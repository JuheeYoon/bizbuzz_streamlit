0,Secretary Antony J. Blinken At a Defense Cooperation Agreement Signing Ceremony With Danish Foreign Minister Lars Rasmussen,https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-defense-cooperation-agreement-signing-ceremony-with-danish-foreign-minister-lars-rasmussen/,"SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good afternoon, everyone. First, let me just say I’m so delighted to welcome Foreign Minister Rasmussen here to the State Department, to the United States, and for this, I think, very important occasion. We’ve had the opportunity, Lars and I, to spend a fair bit of quality time at NATO and other places, but it’s particularly good to have you here in Washington.

For nearly 75 years, the United States and Denmark have been close security partners and NATO Allies. Our forces are working to protect communities from terror in the Sahel. We’re upholding freedom of navigation in the Straits of Hormuz. We’re strengthening deterrence together in the Baltics.

Denmark continues to play a leading role in ensuring Putin’s war on Ukraine remains a strategic failure.

It was one of the first countries to commit to supplying F-16s to Ukraine and to train Ukrainian pilots to fly them. Earlier this month, Denmark pledged to provide $1 billion worth of tanks, drones, ammunition, and to jointly fund the donation of new Swedish armored personnel characters – carriers, excuse me – all of which will help Ukraine defend its territory and its democracy.

Our countries together are committed to enabling Ukraine to stand on its own, to stand on its own strongly – militarily, economically, democratically. That’s why President Biden’s supplemental budget request is so critical, and why we’ll continue to work with Congress to pass it.

The Defense Cooperation Agreement that we’re about to sign will further strengthen security collaboration between our two countries.

When it takes effect, our militaries will be able to coordinate more effectively, even more effectively than they already are. Our troops will train together more seamlessly and more often. We’ll enhance NATO’s interoperability, allowing our Alliance to better safeguard peace and stability for people all across the continent.

Today’s agreement builds on the work that we’ve done to deepen defense cooperation with allies across the Atlantic – from Northern to Southern Europe, from the Baltics to the Black Sea.

In 2021, we signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement with Norway. Earlier this month, we signed a similar accord with Sweden. Earlier this week, we signed one with Finland. Collectively, these agreements underscore the shared commitment by the United States and our European partners to bolster European and transatlantic security.

Denmark remains an essential partner in this effort. Lars and I will have a chance to sit down after we sign this agreement, to go through the many issues and the many areas where the United States and Denmark together are dealing with the challenges of our time. We could not be more grateful to have such a strong, such a valued, such an important partner. It gives me a great source of confidence as we head into the future, knowing that our two countries not only remain strongly allied but, after today, even stronger.

Lars, over to you.

FOREIGN MINISTER RASMUSSEN: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I am indeed honored and happy and glad that we could make this happen, and right before Christmas. I think that will complete my working year. I visited you here in January as one of my first international meetings, and this will probably – at least I hope so – will be the last international travel before Christmas Eve. (Laughter.)

SECRETARY BLINKEN: My wish as well.

FOREIGN MINISTER RASMUSSEN: Yeah. So, Tony, you and I are from the same generation. We are almost the same age. We have seen history unfold at the same time in our lives, and perhaps that is why we both firmly believe in the transatlantic bond and a close alliance between Europe and the United States.

Denmark and the United States are close friends and close allies, and now we are taking our security cooperation to the next level. The Defense Cooperation Agreement is an important agreement that will bolster our bilateral security and defense cooperation. It will also enhance our cooperation in NATO and in the Nordic region.

And as you just mentioned, you have made similar agreements with our Nordic friends, and we are looking very much forward to welcoming our close Nordic neighbor and country Sweden to NATO sooner rather than later. And this defense agreement is a stepping stone towards a more secure Nordic region. It is a part of a parcel we have made during the last couple of years – enhancing our defense budget, welcoming new members to the NATO Alliance, and now these bilateral agreements. It will strengthen European and transatlantic security at a defining moment in history where we need it the most.

Mr. Secretary, we are facing multiple crises. Russia is still waging a brutal war on the European continent; terror in Israel; a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. And we both know that peace and stability cannot be taken for granted. And in time like this, friends must stick together, and that is what we are doing with this agreement.

So again, thank you, Tony. As I just wrote in your guestbook, you can always count on us, and we will always count on you. And I look forward to our conversation. But first, let us sign this agreement.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.

MODERATOR: Good morning. Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Rasmussen are signing a Defense Cooperation Agreement between the United States and Denmark. The agreement sets forth the framework for enhanced defense and security cooperation and partnership between our countries. As an original NATO membership – NATO member, Denmark is a longstanding, essential ally and strategic partnership – partner. We look forward to deepening our already close cooperation.

(The agreement was signed.)

SECRETARY BLINKEN: All right. We’ll hold this one up.

FOREIGN MINISTER RASMUSSEN: Yes. Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you, everybody."
1,On the Occasion of Shab-e Yalda,https://www.state.gov/on-the-occasion-of-shab-e-yalda/,"The Winter Solstice, or Shab-e Yalda as it is known to millions of people in Iran and the wider region, is an important night of celebration with friends and family on the longest night of the year. Tonight, the United States recognizes this rich and festive tradition, which dates back millennia.

Shab-e Yalda should be a joyful time. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime seeks to erase the Iranian people’s vibrant history by renaming Yalda and other ancient traditions. Meanwhile, the people of Iran continue to persevere in the face of human rights abuses and economic hardship brought on by the regime’s failed leadership. Yalda is a time for hope and a commemoration of the triumph of light over darkness. It is a reminder that despite these hardships, brighter days are ahead. The United States continues to stand with the people of Iran as they seek freedom, prosperity, and respect for their human rights."
2,New Listings Under the Section 353 Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors Report,https://www.state.gov/new-listings-under-the-section-353-corrupt-and-undemocratic-actors-report/,"The United States today announced new listings of four Nicaraguan, four Guatemalan, three Honduran, and three Salvadoran individuals under the Section 353 Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors report.

This report, published in the Federal Register, identifies individuals who have knowingly undermined democratic processes or institutions, engaged in significant corruption, or obstructed investigations into such acts of corruption in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Consistent with Section 353 of the United States–Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act, as amended, persons on the list are generally ineligible for visas and admission to the United States.

Promoting strong democratic governance in the region is a priority under the Administration’s Root Causes Strategy. Corruption and other practices that undermine democracy in Central America lead to instability and drive irregular migration. In El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, we work to promote, preserve, and restore democratic norms to build a more resilient, equitable, and prosperous hemisphere. We do this by tapping into a diverse set of accountability tools.

We call on all government leaders, civil society, journalists, the private sector, and the international community to join us in strengthening democratic governance and ending corruption."
3,Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder Holds a Press Briefing,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/statements-remarks/secretary,"MAJOR GENERAL PAT RYDER:  Hey good afternoon, everyone.  Thanks for your patience.  We've got quite a bit to cover at the top today so bear with me here.Secretary Austin returned to the United States last night after a successful trip to the Middle East where he had the chance to meet with leaders from Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and Israel.  During his discussions, the secretary emphasized the strong and enduring partnership between the United States and these key partner nations towards furthering our shared goals of security and stability throughout the Middle East region.Among the topics discussed during the trip was the importance of freedom of navigation in international waterways and the recent threat of Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea.  Upwards of 10 to 15 percent of global shipping transits these straits and these attacks are impacting global trade and commerce, negatively impacting the economies of nations around the world, and costing commercial shipping firms billions of dollars.To help address this challenge, while Secretary Austin was in Bahrain, he announced the stand-up of Operation Prosperity Guardian, an important new multinational security operation under the umbrella of the Combined Maritime Forces and the leadership of its Task Force 153, which focuses on security in the Red Sea.The secretary also convened a virtual ministerial from the NAVCENT headquarters in Bahrain with ministers, chiefs of defense, senior representatives from over 40 countries, as well as the European Union and NATO to discuss the increased threat to maritime security in the Red Sea.Secretary Austin underscored how the attacks from the Houthi rebels in Yemen had already impacted the global economy and will continue to threaten commercial shipping if the international community did not come together to address this issue collectively, emphasizing that this is an international problem that requires an international response.In the days ahead, the United States will continue to consult closely with our allies and partners who share the fundamental principle of freedom of navigation, and we expect to see the coalition continue to grow.Switching gears, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General CQ Brown Jr. spoke today by video teleconference with People's Liberation Army of China Chief of the Joint Staff Department General Liu Zhenli.  This is the first time the two leaders have spoken since General Brown became the Chairman.During the teleconference, General Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain an open and direct line of communication.  For more information about the call, I'd refer you to the Joint Staff and their corresponding readout.Also today, the Department of Defense is releasing the DoD Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response, which establishes the department's enduring policies, responsibilities, and procedures for mitigating and responding to civilian harm.As you may recall, in January of 2022, Secretary Austin directed the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy to develop a Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan.  This plan, which was released in August, outlines steps the department will take and the resources required to implement appropriate recommendations from recently completed studies of civilian harm.The plan also called for the publication of a DoD Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response, which is what we're publishing today.  The release of the DoD Instruction continues the process of improving the department's approach to mitigating and responding to civilian harm.In addition to the instruction, we are also launching a public-facing website which will include our current civilian harm mitigation and response policies, congressional reports, and other related documents.  The website also provides a link to the previously published web page with guidance for reporting civilian casualties.  For more information on the Civilian Mitigation and Response DoD Instruction, you'll find these on the Defense.gov website under Releases.In other news, earlier today, a ramp ceremony was conducted at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for a dignified transfer of remains of three Army Special Operations aviation soldiers who will return home to the U.S.These soldiers and American heroes perished in a helicopter mishap in the Mediterranean on November 10th.  The incident claimed the lives of five American soldiers, two of whom were recovered immediately after the mishap.The team at Dover will work now to confirm the identities of our three recovered soldiers before a dignified transfer to return them to their families, who were present for their repatriation.  The department is proud of the tireless efforts of all involved to bring our service members home, and our thoughts and prayers continue to remain with the families and friends of our fallen teammates.And finally, as you all know, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, defends our North American airspace each and every day.  However, on Christmas Eve, NORAD has one additional special mission -- tracking Santa as he makes his way across the globe.This is NORAD's 68th year conducting this important mission, and children and families worldwide will be able to call to ask NORAD's live operators about Santa's location on the 24th, starting at 6 am Eastern Standard Time.The phone number to call is 1-877-HINORAD, ""Hi Norad,"" or 877-446-6723.  You will also be able to track St. Nick's annual journey on the NORAD Track Santa website, Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube.  And last year alone, NORAD answered over 73,000 calls just on December 24th alone and the program generated more than two million social media followers.Every year, more than 1,000 American and Canadian members of NORAD volunteer, and a variety of corporate contributors are proud to continue the tradition of tracking Santa.And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.  We'll start with AP, who's on the phone.  Lita Baldor?Q:  Thank you, Pat.  Two things.  One, the Secretary met in Israel with his counterpart, Minister Gallant.  Can you say in any context or detail what Israel's reaction was to the Secretary and the Chairman's urgings for a more limited campaign in the war, sort of a scaled back campaign?  Can you just give us any context on what their reaction may have been, what we can expect?And then just secondly on the maritime program that's ongoing, can you say exactly how many countries are actively participating right now?  Should we expect to see the U.S. and other ships there all the time?  Are they going to take turns?  Can you just give us a better grasp of how these countries -- I think you said that -- had said 10 -- there were about 10 initially.  How are they going to sort of take part in this?  How will that work?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, thanks, Lita.  On your first question, again, I'm not going to speak for Minister Gallant.  If you had the chance to catch the press conference in Tel Aviv with the Secretary and the Minister, Secretary Austin made a few things very clear.First of all, he was not there to dictate timelines.  This is Israel's campaign.  But during their meetings, they did have the opportunity to talk about the status of the campaign, they had the opportunity to talk about milestones and the phasing of the campaign, to include transitioning from higher-intensity operations to lower-intensity operations, which, oh by the way, are part of any military campaign and does not necessarily indicate that a campaign has ended.So they were very productive conversations, and again, I think Minister Gallant spoke to where the Israeli military is at this moment.  And so I'd refer you back to those comments.As far as Operation Prosperity Guardian, we've had over 20 nations now sign on to participate.  The nations that have agreed to publicly discuss their participation, we've put those out there.  Since the announcement on Tuesday, Australia and Greece have also highlighted their participation in this operation.  But again, we'll allow other countries and defer to them to talk about their participation.The key point here is that this -- as I mentioned at the top, this is a international problem and it requires an international response.  And so we'll continue to work with this coalition of the willing and all countries will be able to contribute what they feel that they can.  In some cases, that will include vessels.  In other cases, it could include staff or other types of support.And so again, we'll continue to work together to safeguard the shipping lanes through the Red Sea.  Thank you.Let me go to Liz here.Q:  A follow-up on that -- is the U.S. sending more vessels into the Red Sea to accompany these commercial vessels?GEN. RYDER:  So I don't have anything to announce, Liz, in terms of additional vessels.  Clearly, we already have some ships that are in the region.  And again, we'll work with our partners and our allies, in terms of what other ships will come in.I will say that there has been a, as you know, an increase in the number of U.S. ships that are in that region.  You've got the Mason, the -- and the Carney and others that have been there to support vessels -- or to support commercial shipping.  So, nothing to announce right now.  But obviously, something we'll continue to keep you updated on.Q:  Separate topic, to follow-up on General Brown's phone call with his Chinese counterpart this morning, are there any plans to reactivate the military-to-military hotline with China?GEN. RYDER:  So, I don't -- I don't have anything to announce on that front.  You know, as I highlighted, we think it's very important to keep the lines of communication open, so that's something that we'll continue to actively do.The last follow-up.Q:  (Inaudible).  Did China agree to continue to regularly communicate with the U.S. military?GEN. RYDER:  I'm not going to speak for China.  Clearly, you know our position and we're going to continue to do everything we can do to keep those lines of communication open.Let me go over here to Will.Q:  Just regarding the Red Sea coalition, can you talk a little bit more about what specific steps the coalition's going to take to protect shipping?  Are we talking, you know, escorting ships?  Reflagging potentially?  Carrying out strikes on launch sites?  Or just what is this going to entail?GEN. RYDER:  Yes.  Thanks, Will.  So, bear with me here, because I'm -- I kind of want to lean into this a little bit and just provide some additional context here.So, you know, it's very important to understand that the Houthis aren't attacking just one country.  They're really attacking the international community.  They are attacking the economic wellbeing and prosperity of nations around the world.  So, in effect, they've really become bandits along the international highway that is the Red Sea.  And so, the forces assigned to Operation Prosperity Guardian will serve as a highway patrol of sorts.  Patrolling the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden to respond to and assist as necessary, commercial vessels that are transiting this vital international waterway.It's a defensive coalition meant to reassure global shipping in mariners that the international community is there to help with safe passage.  And so, in terms of the specifics, in terms of tactics, I'm not going to get into ROE and what that entails.  But the way to think of this is a highway patrol along the highway that are there to cover the zone.As it's been described to me, the distance we're talking here -- about here from the Suez Canal down to the Gulf of Aden is about the distance from Boston to Washington, D.C.  So, you're talking about a pretty extensive stretch of water that the international community will be covering.Last thing I'd say on this is that the Houthis need to stop these attacks.  They need to stop them now.  You know, that's clear and simple.  And they really need to ask themselves if they've bitten off more than they can chew when it comes to taking on the entire international community and negatively impacting billions and billions of dollars in global trade, economic prosperity and international law.  Thank you.Q:  One additional one.  On the call between the chairman and his Chinese counterpart, let's talk a little bit about the significance of presumption of talks on that level.  I know that this is something that the U.S. has pushed for.  So, how significant is this, that it's happening now, I guess?GEN. RYDER:  Well, I think it's a positive development.  You know, we're clearly working here to implement what was announced by President Biden and Chairman Xi in November.  But we've said all along that, when you have two large militaries it's imperative that we keep lines of communication open in order to prevent miscalculation and the potential that that carries with it as far as risks of operating in certain areas.So again, we're going to continue to press on that.  Thank you.Tom?Q:  Just a follow-up on Will's question.  Since the task force Operation Prosperity Guardian stood up on Tuesday, I believe, have there been any strikes or has there been any kinetic action that you can update us on like the last few days?GEN. RYDER:  By the United States?Q:  Yes.  Or by the coalition as a whole?GEN. RYDER:  I'm not tracking any.  Again, this is a defensive coalition that is there to help reassure global shipping and mariners as they transit the straits.Q:  The fact that you haven't seen anything, would you read into that, that it's having a deterrent effect?GEN. RYDER:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I misunderstood your question.  Attacks by the Houthis against shipping?Q:  Yes, so my first question I was asking -- sorry if it's -- if there has been any kind of any action from the U.S. against the Houthis in retaliation for any strikes (inaudible)?GEN. RYDER:  We have not conducted any strikes against the Houthis.Q:  And the fact that you haven't seen any, you say you haven't seen any, is that -- would you say that the task force is having a deterrent effect?GEN. RYDER:  The fact that the U.S. has not conducted any strikes?  The fact that they haven't conducted any strikes.You know, I hope so.  But, you know, again, what we're going to do is we're going to continue to work with the international community to safeguard those vessels that are transiting those waterways.  And I would hope that the Houthis would understand, you know, the pressure that they are going to bring onto themselves if they don't stop these attacks.  But again, we'll continue to monitor closely.Let me go Chris and then I'll go to the phone here.Q:  Thanks, Pat.  Two questions on Operation Prosperity Guardian.  Is this coalition of the willing under any certain unified command for these nations?  How are you -- how is that being coordinated?GEN. RYDER:  So, this is under combined maritime forces, which is already an existing coalition of the willing of 39 different nations, okay?  So, that is a coalition that has been around for a while that brings nations together to address regional security and stability when comes to maritime operations.  A subset of the coalition maritime forces is Task Force 153, which has been in existence for about 18 months, which provides the leadership, command and control for Red Sea security operations.Now, the question that -- you know -- that we've gotten the question, well if you already had this why do you need Prosperity Guardian.  It's an important question and a good question.  By virtue of the fact that we already have a standing structure, a framework upon which to build, Prosperity Guardian is an operation that is underneath 153.  Task Force 153 can do other things, but it's an operation nested underneath Task Force 153.And by virtue of it being a coalition of the willing, that means that countries can provide what they feel they can contribute based on their national priorities and national domestic decisions.  So, as certain requirements start to present themselves, in this case, addressing the threat that Houthis are, you know, providing or, you know, doing here in the Red Sea, nations have a framework now upon which to pull together and address these together.Q:  And the same question on that.  Are any U.S. air assets part of Operation Prosperity Guardian or is this purely surface vessels that include the MEU or carrier strike groups, for example?  And if you don't have all those details, could you take that back?GEN. RYDER:  Yes, and so I'm not -- I'm not going to go into the specifics in terms of which capabilities or which assets, per se, but yes, air will be a part of this. You know, when -- especially when it comes to maritime domain awareness, air power is always a significant contributor to that.  So, let me go to the phones here.  Let me go to Jeff Schogol, ""Task and Purpose.""Q:  Thank you.  The -- the United States recently launched a -- a drone strike in Somalia, targeting a -- an Al-Shabab leader.  Can you say who is that leader?  And who exactly was killed in the strike?GEN. RYDER:  Thanks -- thanks, Jeff.  So you saw AFRICOM's -- you know, what they've put on -- on this strike.  I don't have any additional details to provide at this time.  If and when we do, we'll certainly put that out.Let me go to Howard Altman, War Zone.Q:  Hey, thanks, Pat.  A couple of -- couple questions.  Does the -- any concerns about the Navy having enough vessels to adequately staff Operation Prosperity Guardian?And today, the Houthis -- the Houthi leader came out and -- and directly threatened the U.S., should there be an attack.  Does that raise the stakes here?  And are you developing any kind of strike packages against the Houthis in Yemen?GEN. RYDER:  Thank -- thanks, Howard.  So on your latter question, you know, as you know, longstanding policy, I'm not going to telegraph, forecast, or speculate on any type of kinetic action.And as far as, you know, the U.S. Navy and its ability to provide the capabilities that we need, I mean, this is one of the significant aspects about the U.S. military, is that we have the ability to surge capabilities to where we need them to address situations around the globe, and the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility is no different.And so as we require capabilities, we have a very longstanding process in place by which to determine requirements, make decisions, and then surge forces into the theater.  And so this will be no different in that sense of the word.Let me come back to the room.  Fadi?Q:  Thank you.  I have two questions on -- on (inaudible).  So -- so you're talking about an international coalition to address the attacks by Houthis in the Red Sea.  Are you able to say whether any country on the Red Sea is -- is part of this coalition?  And why none of the major Arab states announced their participation in -- in the coalition?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, again, we will defer to individual countries within their level of comfort to talk about their participation in this coalition.  So beyond the countries that we've already highlighted, I don't have any new countries to flag for you here today.Q:  And then again on the warning by the (inaudible) leader of the Houthis in Yemen, he warned the U.S. not to take any military actions inside Yemen.  I'm not asking about future operations, but within the framework of the Prosperity Guardian, do nations have any type of authority or mission to attack Houthi targets inside Yemen, in response to attacking commercial vessels, or is it mainly defensive against any projectiles that might be, you know, going in the direction of U.S. Navy or French or whoever is there?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, this is a defensive coalition.  Again, think of it as the Highway Patrol to help safeguard maritime, you know, vessels going through the Strait.  Thank you.Janne?Q:  Thank you, General.  Regarding North Korea's long-range ICBM launches, what is final result of the United States and allies of North Korea's long-range ICBM launches?GEN. RYDER:  Janne, you know we've highlighted the fact that we condemn this launch and any destabilizing actions by North Korea, but I'm not going to get into any intelligence.Q:  In response to North Korea's ICBMs, a joint air exercise between U.S. and South Korea, Japan, is being conducted in South Korea with the B-1B strategic bombers.  Can we say that the -- our allies' ultimate goal towards North Korea is to behead Kim Jong-un?GEN. RYDER:  Look, Janne, we remain committed to a diplomatic approach and continue to call on the DPRK to engage in dialogue.  We harbor no hostile intent to North Korea and we've made that very clear.  What we're focused on is regional security and stability and working closely with our ROK and Japanese allies, as well as other allies and partners in the region, to ensure that everyone in that region can live peacefully and safely, and that's what we'll continue to stay focused on.Let me go -- yes, sir?Q:  Thank you, General.  Two questions if you don't mind.  Has there been any new attacks on your forces in Iraq and Syria?GEN. RYDER:  I don't have anything right in front of me, so I'd refer you to our press desk and we can get you those details.Q:  Do you have any information that Iranian drones used by these groups in Iraq and Syria against your forces?GEN. RYDER:  I'm sorry, say that again?Q:  I mean, do you have any information that Iranian-made drones used by, like, militant groups in Iraq and Syria, even by Houthis, against your forces?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, I mean, we know that Iranian proxies are trained, resourced, equipped by Iranian forces obviously.  That's why they're Iranian proxies.  And so again, you know, all roads lead to Iran when it comes to sponsoring these attacks.  Thank you very much.Let me go over here.  Yes, sir?Q:  Thank you, Pat. You describe the mission of the task force as being defensive and the forces are patrolling the region, but are they going to prevent these kind of attacks only limited with this force tasked or in case of continuation of these threats?  Are there any other possibilities that the Pentagon is considering to avoid the increasing threat that's -- it -- since it's of -- putting a big pressure on the international trade and markets as well?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, so again, I'm not going to speculate or talk about, you know, any potential future operations.  The point I'm trying to make here is that as the Houthis conduct these attacks, they need to realize they're attacking the international community, they are negatively affecting the economic prosperity of millions of people, billions of people worldwide, and that has got to stop.So we will continue to work with our allies and partners.  The purpose of Prosperity Guardian is to help reassure commercial shipping and mariners as they transit the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and we'll continue to stay focused on that.All right ...Q:  ... question about Gaza.  Just will -- the number of the civilian casualties, according to the local authorities, is over 2,000 casualties among civilians only ...Q:  20,000, sorry.  So just at the eve of the Christmas, is Gaza going to enter a new year with the same bombardment and operation causing threat for the civilians?  Is the Secretary -- did the Secretary actually make contact with his Israeli counterparts to avoid this threat within the upcoming days?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, well, first of all, I mean, you know, again, we think it is tragic when any innocent civilian is killed, whether that's Palestinian, Israeli, and you know no one wants to see that. So, we will continue to communicate with our Israeli partners on the importance of taking civilian safety into account in their operations. As for timelines, again, that’s really something I’d refer you to the Israelis to talk about and as I highlighted, the Secretary did have a conversation with his counterpart on phasing of operations – thinking through transitions of operations, but really, I’d have to refer you to the IDF for that. Thank you. Yes sir?Q:  Yes, so with new Ukraine aid package not coming any time soon, and the last of your (inaudible) running out, do you have an assessment of what the impact will be for Ukraine, especially on the battlefield?GEN. RYDER:  Yes, thanks for the question.  As our comptroller recently said in his letter to Congress, we will be obligating the remaining $1 billion in replacement funds by the end of this month.  And once those funds are obligated, we will have exhausted the funding available for us to provide security assistance to Ukraine.So it really does underscore the importance of congressional support for Ukraine.  We would, again, continue to urge the passage of the supplemental that we've submitted.  As you look at the situation that Ukraine finds itself in, we will obviously continue to support them.  But it is imperative that we have the funds needed to ensure that they get the most urgent battlefield capabilities that they require.Q:  You don't know what it will look good on the battlefield, you know, if Congress doesn't pass any time soon?GEN. RYDER:  I'm not going to speculate.  Clearly Ukraine has been able to develop a very capable military.  But, you know, the war continues to be difficult, continues to be a very challenging fight, and to be able to maintain and sustain that force going into the future against an enemy that has said its objective is to eliminate Ukraine, we feel that it's very important to be able to have the resources necessary to enable them to continue engaging in the fight.  Thanks very much.Sir.Q:  Thank you.  Japan government (inaudible) on Friday, meaning tomorrow, (inaudible) for Patriot missile shipment to U.S.  So in terms of this issue, what is the Pentagon's reaction and how does the Pentagon assist Japan -- Japan's decision?GEN. RYDER:  Yes, I've seen the press reporting on that.  You know, look, Japan is one of our strongest allies.  We discuss a wide range of issues in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.  When it comes to things like Patriots, that’s really something I'd refer you to the government of Japan to talk about.  The only other thing I'd say on this is, you know, we continue to see our alliance grow.  And it's stronger than it's ever been.  Thank you.Ma'am.Q:  Thank you.  And I'd like to ask about Ospreys in Japan.  And can you give us an update on the Osprey stand-down and like how long would it last?  And is there any update on the investigation about the crash itself?GEN. RYDER:  Sure.  I don't have any updates to provide in terms of the investigation, the ongoing investigation.  Certainly, at the appropriate time the Air Force will release more information on that.  As we've talked about before, we do continue to stay in close communication with the government of Japan and are committed to being as transparent as we can in terms of that investigation.As far as the status of this individual service stand-downs and the Ospreys, I'd refer to those services to talk about that.Let me go to the phone and then I'll come to Mike here.Heather from USNI.Let me go to Meghann, Military Times.Q:  I was going to ask for an Iraq and Syria update, but I will send an email instead.GEN. RYDER:  Okay, thanks Meghann.  Appreciate it.  Mike.Q:  Yes, I want to change the subject a little bit, 2023 was the worse recruiting year for the military since the end of the All -- or since the start of the All-Volunteer Force, as you -- as you well know.  Is the Pentagon -- as we move into the new year, it's going -- the Pentagon's going to have the smallest military since pre-World War II levels.Does the Defense Department, is it -- is it concerned that these numbers are going to continue trending down in 2024?  Or are you at all optimistic -- are there any signs for optimism that maybe you'll see, you know, the light at the end of the tunnel kind of?GEN. RYDER:  Well, Mike, I'm an eternal optimist.  So, I'm going to say we're optimistic.  But, you know, we know that this continues to be a challenge for a multitude of reasons.  You know, COVID did not help in the sense of our efforts to recruit and, you know, obviously, now that we're past that we're starting to see our recruiters be able to do the face-to-face kind of communication that is absolutely essential to recruiting efforts.You're seeing the services look at many different types of ways to get out and engage with today's youth, as far as highlighting the opportunities that military service and the benefits that it can provide.  And there's a wide range of things, you know, to include the Army's efforts to, you know, help young people get physically fit and at the same time explore the opportunities about the military and the Air Force side aviation camps where young people can get to experience aviation, et cetera, et cetera.So, the services continue to be very active and creative in looking at how we can communicate with the public that we serve.  And so, you know, Secretary Austin has said we didn't get into this problem overnight and it's not going to be solved overnight.  But we are confident that we will continue to see those numbers increase and it's something that we'll, obviously, continue to work very hard at.At the end of the day, you know, the U.S. military provides something that very few employers can, which is the opportunity to have amazing benefits, amazing experience and training, whether you want to stay in the military for a short term or do it for a career.  But it also enables you to be a part of something that's bigger than yourself and contribute to something important.And so, you know, a lot of young people when they talk about the kinds of things they want to do, they want to do something impactful, they want to be a part of something bigger than themselves, the military is a place where you can do that.And so, we'll continue to try to get that message out.  And we'll see where 2024 takes us.(Liz ?)?Q:  (Inaudible) Ukraine funding for U.S. stockpiles at all?GEN. RYDER:  So again, you know, when it comes to the budget and the NDAA, you know, certainly we'll be looking for our ability to replenish our own stockpiles and we'll continue to do that.  The Ukraine supplemental, of course, would help us replenish those -- fund those stockpiles.  But we'll continue to do what we need to do to make sure our own readiness levels stay at where they need to be.  Thank you.Sir?  Time for a few moreQ:  Thank you very much.  General, regarding to these developments in the Red Sea, does the DOD still, in its position which is they are not in a war with the Houthis, and do you have a concern that maybe the conflict there getting escalation -- or more escalated because of what's going on there?  I mean, for the Maritimes on, you know, Prosperity Guardian aren't with the Houthis (inaudible)?  Thank you.GEN. RYDER:  So, just to make sure I understand you question correctly, are we concerned about this escalating into a broader conflict?  Well, that's exactly what we're trying to prevent.  You know, look, we don't want to see these types of reckless, dangerous and illegal activities affecting freedom of navigation through the Red Sea.And so, you know, we would obviously call on the Houthis, as I did earlier, to cease this activity and to safeguard innocent lives.  And the economic prosperity of nations around the world, to include nations in the Middle East region that rely on the trade and economic impact that these straits provide.  Thank you.Last question, we'll go to Jim.Q:  General, just like to jump on Mike's question a little bit.  One of the problems with recruiting is that the veteran's population is also the smallest in memory.  And there are a lot of Americans who don't understand the benefits of joining the military.  Is there going to be any kind of an outreach to the general American public by the department to, perhaps, educate them on what the military does?  And perhaps get these influencers to talk to their children to enlist (inaudible)?GEN. RYDER:  Yes, Jim, well that's happening every day.  I mean, whether it's the Department of Defense proper here out of the Pentagon, as you know, we have a strategic engagement division that does a multitude of community activities that are meant to communicate and inform many different influential groups like veteran's organizations or military service organizations.But importantly, the individual services also do those things, both from a macro and a micro level, from the headquarters level down to the unit level.  You know, in my own experiences working at a base, conducting things like base tours or going out to local schools.  Or when you have airshows or parades or sporting events, I mean, there are many different ways for people to learn about the military.Now, you know, the analysis has shown that at the end of the day it's a conversation with someone versus just a -- you know -- it's important websites and billboards and advertisements are important, but at the end of the day it's the conversation about - tell me more about it.  What does this mean?  What does this look like?  Breaking down some of the stereotypes in terms of what military life actually is versus what the perception is based on, you know, popular programming or TV.And so, by the ability to have those conversations and this is where having recruiters being able to go back to schools and engage with people face-to-face becomes critical.  And so, we don't take anything for granted.  Look, at the end of the day, one of the strengths of the U.S. military is the fact that is an all-volunteer military.And that each of us here takes the oath of office and the oath to protect and defend the Constitution by choice.  No one's making us do this.  And it makes us more resilient.  It makes us a more powerful military because we are defending the people from which we come.So, we're going to continue to stay after that, because at the end of the day we have a very important mission, and the American public expects us to do that.  But what I would tell any prospective recruit is the United States military provides an opportunity unlike any you will ever get to experience.  It's an amazing place to develop and really, again, be a part of something bigger than yourself.And on that note, before we conclude, I just have a couple other things I'd like to say.  I would like to highlight that this will be the last press briefing from the podium before the end of the year.  Our next briefing in here will be on January 4.  And on behalf of Secretary Austin and the Department of Defense, I'd like to recognize all of our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, Guardians, Coast Guardsmen, and DOD civilians who are serving around the world, many of them under austere and dangerous conditions, protecting our nation and safeguarding the freedoms we enjoy.We also want to thank the families of our service members for their service and sacrifice in support of our military and our nation.  As I mentioned to Jim, today's U.S. Armed Forces, they really comprise the most lethal, combat-capable military the world has ever known thanks to our service members and the families who support them, and we're grateful for all that they do every day for our nation.I would also like to thank you, the members of the Pentagon Press Corps, for what you do to keep the American public and the international community informed about our Department of Defense.  Our republic is well-served thanks to your efforts as a free and independent press to report on critical defense issues, promote transparency, and ensure that the American people have a good understanding of what its military is doing every day around the world in support of our nation and our interests.I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and I look forward to seeing you on January 4.  Please don't call me before then.  Thank you.(Laughter.)"

FORT BELVOIR, Va. – Cancer is a silent killer. Often difficult to diagnose and truly insidious, the disease touches many. It leaves in its wake suffering, pain and often death. Cancer was the last thing on U.S. Army Reserve Sergeant Francisco Marti Gonzalez’s mind as he prepared to welcome a daughter with his wife Taisha in 2018.

We often think of cancer as a disease that afflicts those in middle age or the elderly. This was not the case for Marti, as he received a diagnosis as a 24-year-old sergeant. Pain in his lower back and groin area prompted him to get checked. The human resources noncommissioned officer from Utuado, Puerto Rico, was serving his first Active Guard Reserve program tour, in Georgia.

“After I was told I had a mass, I understood that could be testicular cancer. My first worry was if I’d live long enough to see my daughter born and grown up.” Follow up tests confirmed the diagnosis. It was testicular cancer. While Marti had answers, he also faced uncertainty. “I didn’t know what’s next in my life.”

Marti was immediately scheduled for surgery. Doctors removed his right testicle under general anesthesia in November 2018. He would start and complete multiple rounds of chemotherapy.

“Going through cancer treatment was the worst time of my life.”

Less than a year later, Marti was told that the cancer had spread to other parts of his body. “They told me I had testicular cancer that had went to the lymph nodes in my back – and my lungs.”

In May 2019 surgeons removed one nodule from his left lung.

This time – finally – good news. Tumor pathology showed that the cancer had died. It was confirmation that the cancer in his body was gone.

The road to recovery continued though. Marti had to train his lungs and used a machine he would breathe into as part of his resistance training. His lung had far less capacity than before.

“The psychological shock of losing almost 30 pounds and losing a bunch of strength really affected me. I wasn’t even half as strong as I was before starting treatment.” Aside from losing strength, Marti experienced a plethora of other adverse effects. “At some point my skin turned yellow.”

During this time, Marti welcomed his child – a daughter, Isabella. His family provided him with purpose and added to his will to survive. “My plan was to be a survivor and live on. To always do the right things in life. To be able to see my kids grow up. To be a father and a husband.”

And survive he has. Marti is now almost five years into remission. While that chapter of his life is behind him, his drive to excel and push himself physically remains paramount. “I scored a 579 on my last ACFT. I work on it just to prove to myself I can do it.”

Now assigned to the Military Intelligence Readiness Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Staff Sgt. Marti, was recently recognized by the region’s hometown NFL team – the Washington Commanders.

The Washington Commanders organization honored Marti and other cancer survivors with military ties during a home game October 5, 2023, at FedEx Field in North Englewood, Maryland.

More of a baseball fan, Marti had never been to an American Football game before. “When I saw the structure and size of the football stadium, I was impressed. You see it on TV and have an idea of the size, but it’s really something to see it in person.”

The team brought the invited cancer survivors out during half time. The large stadium screen displayed pictures of them during their cancer journeys as they walked down the field. Survivors were divided by types of cancer – lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, pediatric cancers, urological cancers, breast cancer, and others.

The large group of survivors moved in unison wearing colored shirts. Everyone was linked inextricably by their experiences with cancer. The pain, diagnosis, battles, and victories.

Elderly and middle-aged cancer survivors were well represented. What struck Marti the hardest though, were the young.

“There were some children that had survived cancer too. I cried seeing them. When urology told me I had testicular cancer I knew what I was facing – I was an adult. A little kid has to fight this terrible sickness without really knowing what’s going on. It’s really sad that they have this happen to them at such a young age. I saw their innocence.”

While those on the field tasted a sense of victory, the Washington Commanders would lose to the Chicago Bears 20 – 40.

Marti remembers that day fondly. “The game was really fun. There was such energy. The fans were really part of the game. In baseball its more quiet, this football game was a huge deal. It’s definitely the most energetic sports experience I’ve ever been part of.”

When asked what he wishes more knew about cancer, he said this - “Always pay attention to your body. Young males – examine yourself. This can affect you starting as young as 16.”

“If you ever find yourself in the situation where you’re diagnosed with cancer or any other serious disease, stay positive. I always prayed and asked God to allow me to have a second chance.” And a second chance he did receive. Marti continues to be there for Isabella, Taisha and son Daniel – born in 2022."

CHARLESTON, W. Va. - Soldiers with the West Virginia Army National Guard’s 156th Military Police Law and Order Detachment landed at Fort Bliss following a 10-month overseas deployment supporting the U.S. Army Central’s Area Support Group–Jordan.

Brig. Gen. Gene Holt, assistant adjutant general – Army, and Command Sgt. Maj. Chadwick Moneypenny, state command sergeant major, met the Soldiers Dec. 15 as they stepped off the plane in Texas. This is the last stop for the troops before reuniting with Family and friends for the first time since deploying in February.

“These Soldiers performed super well and were highly appreciated,” said Capt. John Ivester, 156th MP commander. “The ASG command was sad to see everybody go because they really hit that level of optimal proficiency.”

“The Soldiers in the 156th brought great credit to themselves and the West Virginia National Guard while deployed,” said Maj. Gen. Bill Crane, adjutant general. ”ASG-J provides the support structure for USARCENT facilities and DoD personnel in and around Jordan, which goes to show how adept our troops are at operating on a global stage. I’m very proud of them and their work and ... especially happy they get to be home in time to celebrate the holidays with their families.”

The 156th MP Detachment, 77th Troop Command Battalion, 111th Engineer Brigade, deployed from their home station of Holden, West Virginia, under the command of Ivester and Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Hatfield. While deployed, they conducted investigations, law enforcement operations, personal security services and force protection at five installations in Jordan and across six countries.

During the mobilization, several 156th MP Soldiers also assisted host nation partners by participating in a Jordanian Armed Forces Language Institute engagement, teaching English.

“They displayed true professionalism and continued to do the job day in and day out with no issues at all,” Ivester said.

After demobilization procedures, the Soldiers depart Fort Bliss to their homes. Often, larger units are flown back to West Virginia and given a formal homecoming ceremony, but thanks to the unit’s smaller size, the desire to get the families reunited as soon as possible means the Soldiers can travel straight home.

The detachment last deployed in 2018, operating at two of Afghanistan's largest bases, Bagram Airfield and Kandahar Airfield, and supported smaller outlying bases.

NUTLEY, N.J. - New Jersey Army National Guard Pvt. Anthony Del Tufo was recognized by the Nutley School Board of Education Dec. 11 for assisting residents of a home threatened by fire.

Del Tufo credited the military principles of civil service he embodied early in his military career.

""I didn't think it was a big deal,"" Del Tufo said. ""I was just doing what was right.""

His recruiter, U.S. Army Sgt. Miguel Valoy, expressed surprise at this response.

""I informed him how significant this is,"" Valoy said. ""He probably saved their lives.""

In what seemed like an unremarkable afternoon in Nutley, Del Tufo noticed a concerning sight — a burning car in a garage. Instead of calling 911, he rushed to the house and rang the doorbell repeatedly until someone answered.

Once the homeowner appeared, Del Tufo ensured they were aware of the danger and prevented the owner from risking their safety by attempting to retrieve sentimental items as the fire intensified.

The Nutley Fire Department arrived promptly and extinguished the fire. Their assessment revealed that had they been called any later, the fire would have spread, likely destroying the house.

After the fire was extinguished, Del Tufo remained overnight to ensure the occupants were safe.

His selfless act earned immense gratitude from those involved.

""He could have left us alone when the firefighters came,"" said the homeowner. ""He chose to stay because he cared for our safety. His selfless nature is rare, and we felt the mayor and township needed to know of his actions.""

Awareness of his actions spread among the citizens of Nutley. Ultimately, members of the New Jersey Army National Guard’s Recruit Sustainment Program learned of his heroic deeds.

Following an intense weekend drill at the National Guard Training Center in Seagirt, Del Tufo was awarded the Army Achievement Medal for his actions.

""He did what many didn't do — he acted,"" said Valoy. ""He helped and made a difference like all good Soldiers should.""

SEOUL – Members of the 403rd Army Field Support Brigade participated in the 2023 Korea-U.S. Security Alliance Forum Vietnam Veterans Recognition Ceremony at the National Assembly Library Auditorium in Seoul, South Korea, Dec. 11.

The ceremony, cosponsored by the 403rd AFSB and Korea Chapter 1507 of the Non Commissioned Officers Association, was held in conjunction with a litany of other events taking place this year throughout South Korea marking the 70th anniversary of the Ironclad Commitment between the United States and the Republic of Korea.

“This season, as we hold dear the values of peace and goodwill, we are reminded of the brave sacrifices that solidified our alliance. It is a fitting moment to reflect on our journey together as we commemorate the 70th year of the ROK-US alliance, an alliance that has stood the test of time and challenges,” said Col. Henry Brown, commander, 403rd AFSB who was the featured speaker at the event.

“Seventy years ago, our nations stood together in a conflict that tested our resolve, courage, and commitment to the ideals of freedom and peace. During the Korean War, thousands of Korean Soldiers and U.S. military personnel fought valiantly for the liberty we cherish,” Brown said. “This war resulted in a significant loss of life and left many wounded – sacrifices we solemnly remember and honor, especially in this season of remembrance and gratitude.”

The event featured traditional and modern music performances and remarks from distinguished individuals including members of the National Assembly.

Col. Brown placed medals provided by the NCOA around the necks of 50 Korean Vietnam War veterans in recognition of their sacrifice and service to the effort in Vietnam. Honorees were also presented with certificates commemorating their service.

Among those honored was Charles Choi, program analyst, S-8 (Resource Management), 403rd AFSB, who is a Vietnam-era veteran of both the Republic of Korea Army and the U.S. Army.

“It was a great moment to be recognized like this, especially since it is the 70th year of the U.S. and Korea alliance,” Choi said. “It was a big surprise to be included so I was honored to receive the medal.”

From Sept. 1964 to March 1973, more than 320,000 South Korean troops served in Vietnam. More than 5,000 South Korean’s died with more than 10,000 injured.

“Our alliance, forged in the fires of the Korean War, continued to demonstrate its strength and resilience in the Vietnam War. The Republic of Korea stood with the United States in a profound act of solidarity and commitment. Around 320,000 South Korean soldiers served in Vietnam, exemplifying dedication, and bravery. Their contributions played a vital role in our joint efforts, highlighting the strength and depth of our alliance,” Brown said. “Today, we recognize and honor 50 brave individuals who represent the thousands of South Korean Soldiers who contributed to this cause. Their sacrifice underscores the strength and endurance of the ROK-US alliance. These Soldiers, embodying the spirit of courage and dedication, reflect the enduring bond and shared sacrifices between our countries.”

Members of Army Field Support Battalion-Korea joined participants from Brigade Headquarters at the event.

“It was our privilege to attend the tribute to Korean Vietnam veterans event and witness the well-deserved honor and recognition bestowed upon them,” said Thomas Gloss, deputy to the commander, AFSBn-Korea. “[It was] a poignant tribute to their valor and sacrifices that left a lasting impression on all those in attendance.”

Joseph Kim, chief, Future Operations, S-3 (Operations), 403rd AFSB, was co-emcee of the event with Park, Jiseul, a well-known television reporter and news anchor.

The ceremony was covered by the Korean Broadcasting System and several other Korean media outlets.

The Korea-U.S. Security Alliance Forum fosters relationships between Korean and American public and private entities to further their goal of strong cooperation between the two countries.

ZAMA, Japan – The U.S. Army Japan Band gave the final performances of their annual holiday concert Dec. 15 and 16 at Zama Harmony Hall here, ending the run of the popular show that began in 2013.

Titled “The Lights of Winter,” this year’s concert was the last for the USARJ Band since the unit will be stood down and deactivated in 2024.

Chief Warrant Officer 3 Matthew David, USARJ Band commander and a first-time participant in the concert, said it was an honor to be part of the final performance and to know it will leave a lasting legacy in the local community after its decade-long run.

“We love performing the music for them,” David said. “Japanese audiences have a deep appreciation for the art of music.”

David called his bandmates excellent human beings, great musicians and great Soldiers, and hoped those qualities came through to the audience during their performance. The commander said the concert was also special to the band because it was a joint event.

“This was a great opportunity for the USARJ Band members to interact and perform with our counterparts in the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Eastern Army Band,” David said. “It brings the concert to the next level by being able to collaborate with such high-caliber musicians.”

One of the main roles of the USARJ Band is to be a prominent public face for the U.S. Army in Japan. Events like the holiday concert and the other public performances the band gives throughout the country allow them to positively represent America and the Army as unofficial ambassadors.

“Although the holiday concert is coming to an end, there are so many other events that still connect the Camp Zama community and Zama City,” David said. “It will be sad that the band won’t be there, but that’s not going to stop Soldiers from trying to continuously build a good relationship with the neighboring cities here.”

Zama City Mayor Mito Sato attended this year’s concert, which she said had a record 5,000-plus people entering a lottery in hopes of securing the limited number of tickets offered for the performance. She described the concert as amazing, saying “the venue was united as one in excitement.”

“The holiday concert became a tradition in Zama City; it was a signature event of the city,” Sato said. “Many of our citizens looked forward to this every year.”

The mayor said she has already heard from people that they are going to miss having the band perform in their city. Though she is sad that this year’s concert was the final one, Sato said there are still many more bilateral engagements between their city and the U.S. Army that will continually help to deepen their relationship.

Kunio Takizawa attended the concert with his wife and said they both looked forward to the event every year because to them, “the holiday season doesn’t officially start until we come to see the USARJ Band.” He thanked the USARJ Band for the invaluable experiences they gave Zama citizens over the years.

“The Army band’s music brought us the joy of the holiday spirit,” Takizawa said. “Nothing can replace this wonderful concert.”"

JOINT MULTINATIONAL READINESS CENTER, Germany – The Hohenfels Veterans of Foreign Wars, Post 10557, collected toys and delivered them Dec. 21, 2023 to a day and residential child care center in Parsberg, Germany.

Days before Christmas, members of the VFW unloaded carloads of toys to das Pädagogisches Zentrum St. Josef Parsberg (the St. Joseph Pedagogical Center in Parsberg), where administrators and children thanked the group for their generosity.

In one of the day rooms, the members dropped off boxes of race car sets, field sport balls, miniature race car tracks, plush animals, dolls, brick-building sets and much more.

“We didn’t expect so much,” said Anna Wagner, an administrative assistant at the center. “Mostly when we get something it’s [just] one of these boxes.”

Michael Simon, the education manager for the center, called the delivery of toys an “enormous Christmas surprise.”

“I am so overwhelmed by this generosity and large-heartedness from you,” he said upon receiving the goods.

“We want to make this a tradition every year to pick up toys,” Edwin Quinones, an officer-trustee with the VFW.

Besides for reaching out to help the children of the center, Quinones had in mind letting the community know what VFW does.

“This is one of the many things we do,” said Quinones. “We also give out grants for people going to college. We also help veterans, but not only veterans, active-duty personnel, with advice.”

To gather toys, the VFW set up a donation spot in the lobby of the Post Exchange. Many community members, upon learning of the toy drive, bought toys to donate.

The Directorate of Emergency Services donated several toys as soon as they learned of the drive.

The Hohenfels Thrift Shop also coordinated with the VFW to mobilize the Hohenfels military community into help out. When community members donated to the shop, the shop matched the contribution, thus gathering even more boxes of toys.

In appreciation of their efforts, the pedagogical center administrators gifted the VFW and the other contributors homemade painted and glazed ceramic hearts."

ANSBACH, Germany (December 21, 2023) – The U.S. Army Garrison (USAG) Ansbach Religious Support Office kicked off the Awana program after more than a five-year pause for the garrison earlier this year on Katterbach Kaserne.

Awana is a worldwide, non-profit program that involves children and accompanying them on their path to faith. This program goes hand-in-hand with teaching children wisdom and spiritual lessons in a playful way.

At the time of publication, approximately 73 garrison children are enrolled in the program and new requests to join are coming in every week. Awana is open to anyone; it is irrelevant which religion you belong to, everybody is welcome to participate.

To ensure that Awana reaches every child in an age-appropriate way, there are different groups and curriculums within the program. The garrison chapel offers the Puggles, Cubbies, Sparks and Truth & Training (T&T) groups for children ages 3 to 11 to experience Awana's mission through gospel and other spiritually activities.

This program mainly relies on volunteers, which is crucial for its success. Currently, the garrison chapel has over 20 volunteers as well as the Awana Commander, Chaplain Hollis Young and Co-Commander April Acevedo, who are passionate about teaching the Awana principles to the children.

“I expressed interest in bringing Awana to USAG Ansbach in the early summer this year. By the grace of God, support from Steve Davids (the Awana missionary for Germany) and CH (Lt. Col.) Ivan Arreguin, USAG Ansbach Chaplain, and approval from the Garrison Commander, Col. Aaron Dixon, Awana came to life on September 27, 2023,” said Young.

When working with children, learning needs to be active and exciting. Therefore, there are different segments within the program to make this possible. The usual process for the children is to initiate the opening ceremony by saying what they are thankful for. This leads right into the Large Group Time with gospels and prayers.

Shortly after, they divide into their individual groups, also known as the Small Group Time, where the volunteers lead the children in age-appropriate activities. Depending on which group you belong to, your evening might start with a fun game, such as one-legged soccer. Other groups, especially those with younger children, begin their program with a puppet show, snacks and crafts. The older kids, which are in the T&T group, will work on their workbooks or the Bible as well as discussing the topic of the day and conclude their evening with fun activities.

Last but not least, there is the closing ceremony, at which the children can recite the Bible verses they have learned by heart and studied diligently that evening in front of their parents and teachers on a small podium, which is also a great highlight for young and old alike.

“The vision and prayer of Awana is that all children and youth throughout the world will come to know, love, and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. That is, therefore, our vision for all children and youth across this garrison. As Awana leaders, our conviction is that the Bible is the Word of God, and we heavily emphasize scripture memorization as part of the Awana program. To see children across this garrison studying and memorizing the word of God, and then coming in excited to share those memorized Bible verses is, for me, the most gratifying part of Awana,” stated Young.

Tracing its roots back, Awana was founded in 1941 as a children’s program at the North Side Gospel Center in Chicago, Illinois, in cooperation with the church’s youth director. This partnership made it possible to create new ways and opportunities to bring children and young people closer to religion. Overall, Awana follows the 3B discipleship philosophy in their program – Belong, Believe and Become.

“During my time at the chapel, I have ministered to the families by teaching children church. Awana is another way to demonstrate to children the Love that God has for them. They learn scriptures through memorization, as they study and meditate on the scriptures, the Love for God grows in them. I thank God for the garrison allowing Awana to be a part of our community,” added Acevedo.

FORT MEADE, Md. – In a significant departure from the last three years’ drive-thru format, the Joint Service Exceptional Family Member Program Holiday Party at McGill Training Center here marked a return to in-person celebrations.

As a first effort to return to in-person events it was important to bring people together in a place with adequate space for those practicing social distancing to attend, as well as the families who still opted to use the drive-up option, said Liesa Jacobs, family support EFMP coordinator.

“Several families commented on the location being ideal for the event,” she said.

Perhaps more important than the location was the welcoming and inclusive nature of the event for all participants – those in close proximity, socially distanced, or participating as part of the drive-up crowd.

“Often, our families express feelings of being judged when out in public . . .,” said Jacobs. “Seeing the staff being so festive and greeting them warmly, families expressed gratitude for the all-inclusive event dedicated to their special needs family.”

“Having a night dedicated to just them means a lot,” she said.

The children at the party were able to decorate wooden Christmas ornaments, construct Christmas tree photo frames and take part in Christmas sticker activity crafts. Facepainting was available for young children and the young at heart while a photobooth – with props – was available to get the perfect selfie regardless of age.

Refreshments of snow cones, cupcakes, cookies, crackers, clementines, as well as, fruit snacks, water and juice boxes were provided by the American Legion, United Services Organization and EFMP staff.

Organizations specifically geared toward exceptional family members, such as the Autism Society of Maryland, were intermingled with booths and activities from the Severn Library, Military OneSource, Corvias Housing, the American Legion and others at the event to expose families to resources available in the area.

Of course, the highlight of the evening was a visit from Santa Claus (Louis “Lou” Randle, Army Housing).

Santa managed to hand out toys donated by United States Marine Corps Reserve’s Toys for Tots campaign. Those toys were wrapped and decorated by EFMP staff, ACS and Military Family Readiness Center volunteers, and each of the EFMP enrolled children who attended received a gift.

The Joint Service EFMP Holiday Party exemplifies the dedication to inclusivity and support for families with exceptional needs that exist across all the military services.

DJIBOUTI CITY, Djibouti - For nearly 50 years, French soldiers stationed in Djibouti have made their way to the Arta Mountains for the grueling, five-day French Desert Commando Course to test their physical, emotional and mental limits. This year, 40 U.S. service members signed up for the challenge, including U.S. Army Sgt. Liliana Munday.

Growing up, Munday, a Soldier with the 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, South Carolina National Guard, gravitated to outdoor physical activities. She was immediately interested in the French Desert Commando Course, but concerned about the physical demands.

“I didn’t think I was ready for it,” she said. “But Staff Sgt. (Samuel) Perez kept pushing me to try out because he saw that I wanted to do it and he had faith in me that I could do it.”

In the pre-assessment phase of the course, service members meet the basic physical requirements and train to earn a spot in the commando phase. In the second phase, they head out to the field for night obstacle, rope and swimming courses and combative and desert survival skills.

Munday’s training regimen began in September and included rucks and runs around the installation before dawn, weightlifting and dynamic, high-intensity exercises nearly every day. At the peak of her training, she fit in three workouts each day while balancing her regular work schedule.

After three months of training, Munday remembers the nerves she felt on the drive out to Arta Mountains where her hard work was put to the test immediately.

“I almost had an aneurysm, I was so scared,” she said. “On the way out there I kept thinking, 'Am I ready? Am I gonna do this? These guys are gonna smoke me, I’m just gonna be out here stranded and be sent home on Day 1.’”

Day 1 consisted of a 5-kilometer ruck run with a full kit, followed by a fitness test and rope climbs.

“I was nervous because rope climbs are very hard for me and in training I could only do one,” she recalled.

Her training partner, Perez, was there to support and encourage her as she steadily made her way to the top.

“I could see she was nervous because we saw the other competitors struggling with this climb,” Perez said. “I was there telling her she could do it; I knew she could. She got up there and when she came back down she had a big smile beaming from her face she was so excited and she ran over and gave me a big hug.”

With the first big hurdle behind her, Munday moved forward in the course with a newfound confidence.

“For some reason, after completing that first day I was good. I started to feel like I could do this thing and I proved to my squad that I was here to work and I deserved to be here,” she said.

Each day and night Munday and her squad faced a new obstacle. She said the mountain obstacle course was the most difficult.

Participants 200 meters above the ground were required to jump across five platforms spaced several meters apart, jump and grab onto a steel pole and slide down to the ground.

“When you’re doing that mountain obstacle course you don’t realize how far each platform is from one another and there are points when you’re not clipped in,” she explained. “I thought, if I missed even a little bit, I’m going down.”

On Day 3, after pushing herself through numerous challenges and rucking nonstop from one training location to another, she thought she had reached her breaking point and seriously considered quitting.

“Your joints just start to scream. It’s painful,” she confessed. “I kept thinking, ’I cannot take this pain anymore. I’m almost done but I cannot do it anymore.’”

Through the dirt, mud, sweat and pain, Munday’s spirit and drive helped her push through. That spirit and drive, she said, comes from two of the strongest people she knows.

“My mom and my grandma — they’re such strong women and they never let me quit when I was younger. They have strong personalities and it’s within me,” she said. “It was very nice to tell them that I did this. They were like, ‘No way, that’s awesome!’”

At graduation, she received the French Desert Commando pin. The black and gold pin features a scorpion resting on the outline of the country of Djibouti. Along the rim are the words ”Aguerrissement Zone Desertique,” which translates to ""Desert Zone Hardening.”

“I’m now able to look back and say, I did that. We did that,” she said with a smile. “Completing something and not giving up even though you may want to … it sticks with you forever. I use this as fuel to my fire when I feel like I can’t do something. I think to myself, ‘You can, because you have already.’”

Beyond the support she received from her family and teammates, Munday’s success is a testament to the adage, ”Preparation is the key to success.” It’s a message she’s shared with her fellow Soldiers since completing the course.

“Someone I work with said he wanted to do the FDCC but he didn’t think he was ready,” she said. “I said, ‘Sir, you’re never going to be ready.’ I didn’t think I was ready. But I got ready. So if you truly think or know that you want to do something no matter the current status that you’re in, if you want to pursue it you’re just gonna have to train and do what it takes to get to that point. There is no other way.”

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – The renaming of the headquarters building, a record turnout of interns, and open-post events that saw tens of thousands of attendees were among the stories that impacted U.S. Army Garrison Japan this past year.

Below is a roundup of some of the most notable stories in the community:

Local employees honored for decades of service

More than 180 local employees with 10, 20, 30 and 40 years of service were celebrated for their dedication to U.S. Forces Japan during a ceremony in late October at nearby Zama Harmony Hall.

Maj. Gen. Dave Womack, commander of U.S. Army Japan, said it was an honor to recognize the employees, many of whom are garrison employees, for their collective service that represented thousands of years of commitment.

“There have been many changes in both of our countries, but the one thing that remains consistent is the people,” he said, “so I want to make sure that I thank every single one of you for your incredible service.”

One of the employees, Naoko Koh, the administrative officer at the Directorate of Public Works, said her 40 years of service, which included various personnel-related positions on Camp Zama, seemed to have flown by.

While Koh sometimes thinks about retiring, she still appreciates the sense of purpose her job provides her and how it continues to motivate her to serve others.

“I feel that many people count on me,” she said. “That’s the reason I stayed here.”

Community ambassadors

Camp Zama personnel proved yet again to be good neighbors while volunteering countless hours to beautify the local community.

The garrison jointly held a four-party event to strengthen community partnerships in late October by helping clean the Sagamihara City Shindo Sports Park.

More than 100 volunteers participated in the cleanup, which was the fourth such event in two years to be organized alongside partners in the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force and Sagamihara and Zama cities.

In early September, U.S. Army in Japan personnel also joined about 1,300 volunteers for the annual Sagami River cleanup. The massive effort gathered 3.5 tons of trash from the area near Camp Zama.

About a month later, volunteers helped sow canola seeds in the fields near the Sagami River, where sunflowers will be planted next year for Zama City’s annual sunflower festival held in late summer.

The rotational canola crops prepare the fields for the sunflowers and will bloom next spring in conjunction with the cherry blossoms, making for a colorful spring.

Internship program sees record year

An unprecedented 34 students from 26 universities throughout Japan joined the garrison’s monthlong summer internship program — the most participation since it began in 2013.

There were so many applicants, in fact, that an interview process had to be held to determine who would be chosen for the program’s limited slots.

Organized by the USAG Japan Public Affairs, the program was developed to give Japanese college students the chance to gain professional experience in a joint work environment while developing their English-language skills.

Using experience gleaned from their time in the program, some former interns have also recently landed positions at DPW, USARJ’s G-4 Transportation Division and U.S. Army Medical Activity–Japan.

Headquarters building renamed after former commander

The USAG Japan headquarters building was officially renamed in early April as a tribute to a former commander.

The building, commonly referred to as Building 102 or the garrison building for the past 70 years, is now named the Col. David B. Hannum Jr. Garrison Headquarters Building.

Hannum, who died in 2010, served as garrison commander from 1975 to 1976 when it was called USAG Honshu, and went on to help others through volunteering following his 31-year Army career.

Members of Hannum’s family watched the ceremony virtually as Col. Christopher L. Tomlinson, then-garrison commander, and Command Sgt. Maj. David A. Rio, the garrison’s senior enlisted leader, unveiled a plaque in memory of Hannum inside the foyer of the headquarters building.

Garrison welcomes new commander

The garrison community welcomed Col. Marcus Hunter as its new commander while bidding farewell to Tomlinson during a change-of-command ceremony in early July.

In the ceremony, Hunter, who previously served as commander of the 1st Battalion, 5th Security Force Assistance Brigade, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, said he was a temporary tenant at Camp Zama last year while on a six-month deployment with his unit.

He said his visit turned into an opportunity for a “site survey” that provided him a closer look at the work and accomplishments of the garrison.

“It gave me an appreciation for this incredible team and the breadth of the missions with which this team is charged,” he said.

Hunter then said he was grateful for the privilege to join the garrison team and to help carry out its missions.

“We share the Japanese values and ideals of a free and open Pacific,” he said, “and I look forward to the many ways in which we will cultivate relationships of trust, respect and true friendship.”

Open-post festivities

USAG Japan held several open-post events to bring tens of thousands of visitors onto its installations.

Throughout the year, these large events had every garrison directorate involved to handle numerous moving pieces, including close coordination with Japanese partners.

In April, the first Hawaiian Festival since the pandemic took place at Sagami General Depot, drawing more than 15,000 attendees who enjoyed live music, dance performances and children’s games.

Camp Zama then hosted an Independence Day celebration for more than 14,000 guests, capping the night off with a fireworks display. A month later, about 20,000 people attended the Bon Odori festival here as many wore traditional “yukatas” and performed folk dances before watching more fireworks.

The Yokohama North Dock Running Festival also returned for the first time in four years in early November as nearly 1,000 runners competed in its 5K, 10K and half-marathon races.

Leaders focus on quality housing

Garrison leadership continued to share housing updates and answer questions from residents during town halls this year.

In the latest meeting in September, leaders revealed the tenant satisfaction rating stood at about 87% in fiscal 2023, similar to the previous year’s rating in which USAG Japan ranked fifth out of 23 garrisons with family housing owned or leased by the Army.

Hunter admitted that while the housing here can be considered old, it is still in very good condition.

He said that during a recent visit from a top Department of Defense housing official, who toured some of the garrison’s oldest and least-renovated homes and barracks, she was still impressed with the state of housing here.

The colonel said that DPW does a great job in maintaining homes but acknowledged that more can be done to enhance the living conditions.

Hunter also spoke on the possibility of having pets inside the two high-rise apartment-style complexes on Camp Zama after receiving feedback from the community.

The Housing Office is now looking to form a committee to gather resident input on a new pet policy, slated to be published in the spring, that may help ease the transition for incoming pet owners.

Sports clinic strengthens partnership

About 150 American and Japanese children participated in a football and cheerleading clinic at Sagamihara Family Housing Area in early November to enhance their cultural understanding.

The clinic marked the first event jointly hosted by USAG Japan and Zama Junior Chamber International.

Children from first through sixth grades at Arnn Elementary School and local Japanese schools were invited to the event, which had professional football players from the Ebina Minerva run drills for the children.

The garrison also bolstered partnerships with other JCI chapters in the surrounding communities by hosting a mission brief and installation tour of Camp Zama in late August.

More than 30 members from eight chapters saw various historical sites and installation facilities, and also met with the garrison commander during their visit.

The purpose of the visit was not only to strengthen existing relationships, but also to establish new ones with other chapters while communicating the role and importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance.

ILLESHEIM, Germany (Dec 20, 2023) - Storck Barracks in Illesheim, Germany, is home to the only helicopter flight simulator operated by the U.S. Army in Europe. The facility, located within the United States Army Garrison (USAG) Ansbach footprint, is well known and appreciated by pilots from NATO partners and allied countries and provides critical training to helicopter pilots of the U.S. Army and other nations.

The simulator complex opened in 1985 and has undergone numerous renovations and retrofits as Army aviation has evolved. Today, it is a state-of-the-art training facility operated by U.S. Army Europe and Africa (USAREUR-AF) and in high demand by helicopter pilots throughout the theater.

The U.S. Army’s 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, located on nearby Katterbach Kaserne, and pilots from regionally aligned forces regularly deployed to Storck Barracks, commonly referring to the complex as the Storck “Flight Sims.” All current helicopter platforms used by the U.S. Army are supported in this facility.

“We have the Apache Longbow crew trainer (LCT), the UH-60L/M Black Hawk aircrew trainer (BAT), the CH-47F Chinook Transportable Flight Proficiency Simulator (TFPS) and the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT),” says Dexter Chun, Facility Manager, Illesheim Flight Simulator Complex (IFSC).

Ignacio Gutierrez de Rubalcava, stationed in Madrid, Spain, with the Spanish Batallon de Helicopteros de Transporte, recently trained at the IFSC and praised the facility highly.

“I am assigned to the only battalion with Chinooks in the Spanish military,” said Rubalcava. “We started transitioning from the Delta model to the F-model of Chinooks and this is the closest training facility to train emergency procedures that you do not want to try on the actual aircraft.”

As a frequent visitor, he raved about the facility: “Early 2022 was the first time we came. Emergency training is the focus. We train with the U.S. Army often and we have been deployed with them to different theaters, so we are used to training with the U.S. Army. We are comfortable with them and the facility is very good. We do have a basic trainer back at our home station, but for more advanced training, we need this.“

Also training at the IFSC during our visit was Slovakian Col. Stefan Okos with the 51st Wing “Presov.” Col. Okos, a UH-60 Blackhawk pilot, has visited Storck several times and greatly appreciates the training opportunity.

“The Slovak Army does not have a simulator for the UH-60 Blackhawk platform. This is the closest training facility for us,” explained Okos. “It is only a 10-to-12-hour drive from home. We are usually here for one week, which gives us 40 hours of training for the team of five pilots and one instructor.”

The IFSC has an excellent reputation within the Slovak Army aviation unit. According to Okos, the alternative to getting the required simulator training would be traveling to a facility in the U.S., where the initial training of the Slovak pilots takes place.

Okos also praised the simulator: “The facility is great. The staff is very helpful. Every time we need something, they are here all day. I cannot say anything negative about the facility or the staff.”

“The pilots are very happy with this type of simulator. When they train for a half hour, they are so immersed in the training, and the simulated situation, they almost forget it’s only a simulator. It is a very good experience for them,” explained Okos.

During their week-long training, the pilots only have a little free time. After the day in the simulator, they conduct briefings every night in preparation for the next day.

“We discuss the following day’s training each night. Going through the check lists, for example. It’s easier for me to teach them on the ground first. I can explain all the procedures in detail before flying. The emergency procedures are discussed in the pre-brief to the simulator training, saving us time while we are in the simulator,” Okos continued.

“The week is a demanding training week. But it is very beneficial. You can watch the progress and the results of the training as the week advances. At the beginning they are struggling with some procedures and at the end of the week they are like professionals. You see the results after five days. The pilots become much more confident as they are training intense emergency procedures in the simulator.”

As an Army Power Projection Platform in Europe, USAG Ansbach is proud to be home to this integral training tool for pilots from our U.S. and NATO partners.

WIESBADEN, Germany - Community members living and working at the Mainz-Kastel Storage Station will soon have a new breakfast and lunch option.

While currently operating a food truck outside the former location of the District Breakfast and Lunch, a new Wiesbaden Family and MWR contractor has been busy renovating Building 4019 in preparation for the opening of Cristobal in late December.

“Our goal was to not leave the Soldiers without any food or drinks during the renovations,” said Cristobal Manager Khaled Ezzedine. “We’re currently providing that service with our food truck while renovating the building. We’re offering different hot and cold sandwiches, sweet things such as doughnuts and muffins, and different hot and cold beverages.”

The Cristobal manager said that once the renovations are completed, the Food Truck will be removed.

“We hope to have the main café room open shortly after Christmas featuring the same offerings and more,” he said, adding, “We’ll use the holidays to finish the whole place.”

With the theme: “Because You Serve, You Deserve,” Ezzedine said he intends to make the dining experience a positive one for patrons. “The Soldier deserves to expect more. I want to show the customers that the moment they set their feet in the doorway – they are appreciated and will be treated well.”

“His pledge to serve the Soldiers is an important point,” said Mark Smith, Wiesbaden Family and MWR Business Operations Division Chief.

“We gave him notice and I was impressed with how quickly he could make it happen,” said Smith, adding that Ezzedine brings years of experience to the project.

The former commercial pilot and restaurant troubleshooter managed several restaurants before opening the Backhaus in Mainz-Kastel. Now he said he is looking forward to the next challenge of serving patrons at the Mainz-Kastel installation.

“We’ll be offering everything from chicken wings and burgers to daily dishes that will change, including seasonal dishes,” said the 53-year-old entrepreneur. A look at the proposed menu includes scrambled eggs, omelettes, various salads, kebab sandwiches, Schnitzels and more.

“What’s important for MWR is to offer patrons a rich variety. Khaled is going to bring that with various hot and cold sandwiches and lunch options,” Smith said. “Our goal is to serve Soldiers locally so that they don’t have to go off base to spend too much money and time away from their duty.”

The Cristobal Food Truck (and eventually the new facility) is open Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. It is closed weekends, Federal and Training Holidays."

WASHINGTON — In the cold and wet autumn woods of southern Finland, Sgt. Nick L. Piazza, a cavalry scout with the 1st Cavalry Division, and his fellow Soldiers slept in tents and built fires every night during Operation Hammer 2022.

In the mornings, he woke up and hopped into his Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a medium-sized armored vehicle that allows Soldiers to perform reconnaissance and engage enemy forces.

Being the gunner on the team, he checked the M242 25-millimeter cannon and the machine gun before making sure the ammunition was properly linked. Then he checked the vehicle’s communication system.

Once everything was good to go, he and his team would head out to engage their Finnish partners in battle operations, learning and growing with them. It was a demanding two-week exercise and another event in Piazza’s life that pushed him to be stronger.

“[Being a cavalry scout] is a very tough job,” he said. “There are tough days and long days but there is so much reward that comes with it.”

Hard work in the outdoors was nothing new to Piazza. He grew up on a large piece of property in Trenton, Tennessee, where he and his brother spent most of their time hunting, fishing and enjoying nature.

When they weren’t playing, their father, a former Navy explosive ordnance disposal technician, had them outside doing yard work. They would cut down trees, chop firewood, dig pits and even help the neighbors with their yard work. These arduous tasks instilled in them a strong work ethic and a standard for them to strive for.

“It set a tone and it set an example of the man that I wanted to be, the kind of example I wanted to emulate through life,” Piazza said recalling the time spent with his father.

Looking to push himself, he joined the Marine Corps after finishing high school.

He spent the next four years as an expeditionary airfield systems technician, designing airfields and maintaining their systems.

Near the end of his enlistment, he contacted an Army recruiter because he wanted more of an opportunity to travel and see the world. He joined in January 2021 as a cavalry scout.

""They are the eyes and ears in the very tip of the spear, painting that picture for the commander and sending up that information, letting them know what’s going on in the battlefield,"" he said.

With his prior military experience, he came in as a specialist and was inserted into a unit entering advanced individual training. He was pushed into leadership positions early on.

He navigated leading his junior Soldiers while trying to learn the different terminology of the Army. This was on top of learning his new job. He started relying on those around him by constantly asking questions while he put in extra time studying.

“It’s not something you master during [initial training],” he said. “That just opens your eyes to what you’ll be learning on the job.”

He soaked up as much knowledge as he could and got more hands-on experience when he got to the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.

Then, last fall, he went on a rotation with the 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team where they trained in the woods of Finland during Operation Hammer 2022.

The two-week exercise allowed more than 4,000 combined Finnish and U.S. service members to train together in the cold and wet environment of Niinisalo, Finland.

“Being a part of that was the most memorable exercise of my military career,” he said. “Getting to fight with [the Finish military], fight against them, and see their tactics … it was definitely eye-opening and a very fun experience.”

The good times also came with hard work, something Piazza has relished since an early age, and his military career has continued to strengthen.

The Army has given me structure, organization and helped me build an even stronger work ethic, he said. It’s also given me leadership skills.

Those skills are being put to the test after Piazza was promoted to sergeant this summer. Now, he gets to guide his Soldiers to be better and eventually take his job.

“It’s very rewarding whenever you see your guys branch out and start to be free thinkers,” he said. “When I see them start to push past their rank and their assignment, it makes me really proud as a leader.”

When he’s not leading his Soldiers, Piazza is in his Bradley Fighting Vehicle being a cavalry scout gunner.

“It’s an extremely rewarding job, and I have no regrets with the path I’ve chosen,” he explained. “I absolutely love being a scout. Any time I get in my Brad and go somewhere, I usually have a smile on my face.”

Piazza will tart college soon while pursuing a degree in psychology. In the future, he wants to become a therapist and help Soldiers with their mental health issues.

CHIEVRES, Belgium – U.S. Army Garrison Benelux held a relinquishment of responsibility ceremony Dec. 19 in Hangar 2 at Chièvres Air Base.

Command Sgt. Major Gary Yurgans, who served more than two years as the senior enlisted advisor for USAG Benelux, bid farewell to the garrison and spoke about his nearly 30 years of Army service and pending retirement.

Col. Lindsay Matthews, USAG Benelux commander, accepted the unit colors from Yurgans to symbolize his relinquishment of the duties and responsibilities of the garrison command sergeant major and commended Yurgans for his leadership and contributions to the Benelux.

“Command Sgt. Major Yurgans, you truly made a positive difference in USAG Benelux and IMCOM-Europe,” said Matthews. “You helped us change the way we see USAG Benelux’s role in this organization, how we support the NATO and USAREUR-AF mission and significantly improved our customer service and Soldier talent management.”

The Non-Commissioned Officer Corps is the backbone of the Army, and their responsibility is to teach, coach and mentor the future of our fighting force, said Matthews. “Yurgans is a man who will bend over backwards to spend time with his team … to get to know them, to help them in their struggles, and celebrate their achievements.”

For Yurgans, who spent most of his career as an Army musician, the chance to serve as a command sergeant major at a garrison in Europe was a unique opportunity that became the crowning jewel of his military career.

“I truly believe our paths were brought together here for a reason,” said Yurgans. “I feel I was placed here to do the best that I can for this organization.”

“With a combined vision and leader emphasis we were able to accomplish some significant achievements. Amongst those were USAG Benelux being selected as the Best Garrison for IMCOM-E, 2021,” Yurgans said.

Yurgans, the first Army musician to serve as command sergeant major, said his time in the Benelux opened his eyes to all of the challenges involved in working at the garrison level, especially for an organization that spans three nations.

“It took me 28 years to get to Europe, but finally I'm here and am so appreciative for this experience and for the friendships I have made,” said Yurgans. “One thing I learned right from the start with this organization, you can’t do it alone, without the professional, dedicated, committed Soldiers, civilians, host nation and mission partners that are the driving force needed to succeed.”

One of the things Yurgans found most endearing about his time living and working in the Benelux was the opportunity to participate in several World War II memorials, such as the commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne, Belgium.

“Visiting Bastogne was truly an eye-opening experience that serves as a powerful reminder of the individual Soldier experience and sacrifices endured to ensure freedom,” said Yurgans. “The love for the American Soldier was never made more apparent than on this day, talking with local folks and seeing the veterans that were present. This made me realize the importance for every Soldier who serves in the military, to serve a tour in Europe and visit places like Bastogne.”

Bolesławiec, Poland - U.S. Army Soldiers from the Georgia-based 3rd Infantry Division attended the ‘Star of Kindness’ event which took place in the Bolesławiec market square December 15-17. In Polish custom, the little star on the night of Christmas Eve is called ‘Gwiazda zyczliwosci’ meaning ‘Star of Kindness.’ During the event, members of the community shared greetings and well wishes as they celebrated the holidays.

“The ‘Star of Kindness’ represents the first star that appears in the sky on December 24th and it’s a Polish tradition,” said U.S. Army Capt. Richard Lee Macleod, the garrison officer in charge of Forward Operating Site Bolesławiec. “They have dinner and then open presents on Christmas Eve, and it starts off the Christmas season in the square.”

The weekend’s scheduled festivities included vendors selling a variety of meals and wares as well as children’s plays and puppet shows. A Christmas fair along with a carousel was included with live musical performances from the 3rd Infantry Division Band. Additionally, 3rd ID Soldiers shared in the holiday spirit while on deployment in Bolesławiec by giving gifts to the Polish children in attendance.

DÜLMEN TOWER BARRACKS, Germany – In my five years at U.S. Army Garrison Benelux, this will be my fourth time visiting Bastogne, Belgium for Battle of the Bulge commemorative events and I can say without a doubt that every visit is better than the last.

To have the opportunity to be a part of the celebration and parade of the anniversary of the Battle of Bulge is by far one of my favorite things to do in Europe. Each year I have had the honor of participating as a member of the color guard marching through the great city of Bastogne.

Having family who fought on both Allied and Axis sides I find myself having a lot of respect for the people who fought and died in Bastogne. To be a part of both cultures who not so long ago were at war with one another is a powerful reminder of the complexity of history and the resilience of human connections.

This year, our weekend visit to Bastogne extended over the course of two days, affording us the opportunity to explore the sites of battle and learn the history of the area.

Our first day started early at the 101st (Easy Company) foxholes; visiting this site provided us with a small glimpse of what it was like so many years ago. Today though, I imagine it is nowhere near as harrowing as how it was 79 years ago. It was an honor as it is every year to come and experience a small glimpse of history in such a sacred place.

Our next stop on the list took us to the Bastogne War Museum. With so much to see there we started it off with learning a bit more about the Soldiers who fought in Bastogne as well as the civilians who lived in and around Bastogne.

Being able to see what life was like for the civilians who lived there really showed me why even people nowadays are so proud of this region. The sense of unity between the local community and service members even today is still as strong as ever.

To end the first day in Bastogne a few Soldiers and I had the amazing opportunity to meet and talk to a few of the classes at Ecole Communale de Mageret, Mageret elementary school in English. It was a privilege to be able to answer the many questions that the children had about life in the U.S. Army and what I do in the military.

On Saturday, Dec. 16, USAG Benelux Soldiers took part in the annual Bastogne Historic Perimeter Walk which spans around the perimeter of Bastogne and where the heaviest parts of the Battle of the Bulge took place. This is a great experience every year to immerse ourselves with the culture and camaraderie of Bastogne and the many different militaries and civilians who join this event.

The official portion of the day was the parade, a significant moment where I had the responsibility of leading the color guard through town. This experience, being my first in such a role, was an honor.

The response from the Bastogne community was particularly striking. Their show of support and appreciation was not only inspiring but also highlighted the strong bond between the visitors and the locals. This interaction was a highlight of the visit, fostering a sense of connection and hope for similar opportunities in the future.

As our visit to Bastogne concluded, I reflected on our appreciation for the sacrifices of Soldiers during the siege and the significance of preserving this history. Those of us from USAG Benelux deeply value our time here, honoring Bastogne's historical legacy.

STUTTGART, Germany — From Oct. 30 to Nov. 17, a group of Army Civilian Professionals (ACPs) and Local National (LNs) employees attended the Civilian Education System (CES) Intermediate Course. This program, a key component of the Army's Lines of Effort to maintain a skilled and ready workforce, illustrates the Army's commitment to nurturing its leaders.

The CES, a progressive and sequential leader development program, stands as a testament to the Army's dedication to multi-skilled, agile leadership.

The Army Management Staff College (AMSC) describes CES as ""The premier leader development experience, igniting the leadership potential of every Army Civilian.”

The U.S. Army Garrison (USAG) Stuttgart command team brought the Intermediate Course to the garrison for the first time thanks to their effort and their dedication to developing ACPs.

The class witnessed a diverse group of ACPs and LNs ranging between GS-10 to GS-12 grades. They engaged in a curriculum designed to foster adaptability, innovation, self-awareness, and effective management.

Robert Gwinner, deputy to the garrison commander at USAG Stuttgart, emphasized the importance of recruitment and retention in his remarks.

""Good people want to work for organizations that are always trying to improve and that offer them opportunities to do the same,"" he said. “Positioning ourselves as an organization that supports its employees’ professional growth helps attract the type of people we’re looking for. USAG Stuttgart has an incredibly important mission and we’re always looking to sustain excellence.”

Instructors Jean Ritter and Nash Carleton tailored the course content to the evolving needs of ACPs. Ritter focused on empowerment through shared experiences and networking, while Carleton emphasized the importance of applying students' experiences to the course's doctrinal knowledge.

Balmina Sehra, a public affairs specialist, reflected on her experience as a student.

“CES helped me realize that the path to leadership does not look the same for everyone. It helped me find the confidence within myself to know that I can pursue a leadership role at some point in the future. I did not feel like that prior to taking the class, which is why these three weeks were so important and eye-opening to me,” she said.

Dr. David Quisenberry, Director of the Department of Organizational Leadership at AMSC, outlined the adaptive nature of CES over the years.

“We offer a synchronous virtual course for those who cannot come to Fort Leavenworth for personal or professional constraints. We conduct Mobile Education Team Courses at Army installations around the world. This year we will conduct courses in 24 locations,” Quisenberry said.

Today’s Army demands trained and ready units with proficient leaders, which highlights the importance of ACPs, and their role in the Army’s workforce.

“Army Civilian Professionals are part of the competitive advantage the Army possesses that neither technology nor advanced weaponry and platforms can replace. Developing leaders is a complex and complicated undertaking because it is primarily a human endeavor—requiring constant involvement,” Quisenberry said.

Tommy Mize, Director of Installation Management Command-Europe, reaffirmed this commitment during a special guest visit to the CES Intermediate course where he delivered remarks and answered students’ questions.

""You should never be told, ‘No – you cannot go to a school in the CES,’"" he asserted. “Everybody in IMCOM-Europe has the opportunity to go to school and attend the CES courses. You need to do that, as it’s an important component of professional development.”

As the CES Intermediate Course concluded, the participants left with more than just enhanced skills; they carried with them a renewed sense of purpose and responsibility.

“The Army, through initiatives like CES, is not just investing in individuals; it is fortifying its future, ensuring that its leaders are equipped to face the challenges of tomorrow with confidence and competence. In the words of these leaders and educators, the message is clear: In the U.S. Army, people matter, and their development is paramount to the Army's success,” said Mize.

IMCOM-Europe will be hosting the CES Intermediate Course at USAG Wiesbaden from Jul. 8-26, 2024, and the CES Advanced Course from Jul. 22-Aug. 16, 2024, at USAG Stuttgart. For a full course calendar on upcoming CES classes visit the AMSC website."

CHIÈVRES AIR BASE, Belgium – The team from Logistics Readiness Center Benelux celebrated the grand opening of their new paint booth with a ribbon cutting ceremony Dec. 18, and the command team from U.S. Army Garrison Benelux was present to help cut the ceremonial ribbon and congratulate the team.

Army Col. Lindsay Matthews and Command Sgt. Maj. Gary Yurgans joined the former LRC Benelux director, DJ Jackson; the interim director, Diana Ioane; the LRC Benelux maintenance chief, Patrick Brown; and the LRC Benelux paint and body shop team to commemorate the completion of the project.

“It was a long process,” said Brown. “We worked with the host nation to make sure we were in compliance with everything and up to code. We also worked with the garrison environmental office, the garrison safety office and the garrison fire department. All these regulations and certifications had to be met before we were finally able to paint. We had a lot of people involved, and we did it.”

In addition to the newly opened paint booth, LRC Benelux also has a newly upgraded paint room. Brown said the paint and body shop team will use the room for preparation and as an area to do small touch-up jobs.

“Once were done prepping, the equipment piece or vehicle will go straight into the new paint booth where we can shoot it, get it done, and get it ready and back to mission,” Brown said.

It’s estimated that having a new paint booth and an upgraded paint room at the LRC Benelux paint and body shop will increase painting production by 100 percent.

In support of Army Field Support Battalion-Benelux, LRC Benelux is now capable of painting four desert tan Humvees olive drab green every week, plus four to six trailers, said Brown. That’s a big increase from what the painters were capable of doing previously, which was two Humvees and two trailers a week.

“We’re looking at increasing our output by 100 percent,” Brown said. “In addition to that, we’ve received a new requirement from AFSBn-Benelux to paint 47 desert tan M107 Tank Rack Modules olive drab green.” A Tank Rack Module is a 2,500-gallon fuel pod.

Plus, LRC Benelux will continue to support USAG Benelux with installation baseline services, and if other 405th AFSB Army Prepositioned Stocks-2 worksites in Europe need LRC Benelux’s paint support “we can assist them, as well,” Brown said.

The new paint booth, which is part of LRC Benelux’s maintenance division, is the only one of its kind in the U.S. Army Europe and Africa area of operations. The cost of the paint booth is about $123,000. In addition, LRC Benelux purchased a new air compressor, a 6-stage air filtration system, and new pneumatic air respirators.

The maintenance division at LRC Benelux provides installation baseline services to the USAG Benelux area of responsibility. This includes maintenance, repairs, services, and paint and body shop support across the garrison’s footprint, to include multiple installations in Belgium and the Netherlands as well as Dülmen, Germany.

LRC Benelux is one of eight LRCs under the command and control of the 405th Army Field Support Brigade. LRCs execute installation logistics support and services to include supply, maintenance, and transportation as well as clothing issue facility operations, hazardous material management, personal property and household goods, passenger travel, non-tactical vehicle and garrison equipment management, and property book operations. When it comes to providing day-to-day installation baseline services, LRC Benelux directs, manages and coordinates a variety of operations and activities in support of USAG Benelux.

LRC Benelux reports to the 405th AFSB, which is assigned to U.S. Army Sustainment Command and under the operational control of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The brigade is headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany, and provides materiel enterprise support to U.S. Forces throughout Europe and Africa – providing theater sustainment logistics; synchronizing acquisition, logistics and technology; and leveraging U.S. Army Materiel Command’s materiel enterprise to support joint forces.

Marc Sasseville, vice chief of the National Guard Bureau, administers the Oath of Enlistment to New York National Guard enlistees at the Fort Hamilton Military Enlistment Processing Station, Brooklyn, New York, Dec. 13, 2023.

BROOKLYN, N.Y. – The National Guard is the nation’s oldest military organization, tracing its roots back to 1636, and Air Force Lt. Gen. Marc Sasseville educated the Guard’s newest enlistees about its storied history on its birthday.

“For 387 years, we've had men and women answering the call to serve the nation,” the vice chief of the National Guard Bureau said. “Job No. 1 is to fight the nation's wars. Job No. 2 is to serve our communities and citizens here at home.

“The Guard is more relevant than ever,” he said. “It's great to be part of this fantastic, historic organization.”

As part of a larger itinerary to visit Guardsmen across the city, Sasseville administered the enlistment oath to New York Guard recruits at the Fort Hamilton Military Enlistment Processing Station.

He also met with recruiters and their leaders to hear their perspectives on what many have called the most challenging recruiting environment since the establishment of the all-volunteer force in 1973.

The New York Army National Guard’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion has been particularly successful in navigating issues that range from a strong job market to a decline in qualified applicants to fill the ranks. Earlier this year, the New York Army Guard was named the top recruiting organization across the Guard for the third straight year.

The New York Army Guard recorded 118% in the number of enlisted Soldiers, new officers and warrant officers who joined from October 2022 to September 2023, and the number of Soldiers who reenlisted as a percentage of each state’s total Army Guard strength.

A score of 100% means the state met its recruiting goals. Scores above 100% indicate a state exceeded those recruiting goals.

This success is based on an organizational strategy to invest in and emphasize recruiting, said Army Command Sgt. Maj. Anthony Abbate, the New York Army Guard’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion senior enlisted advisor. A quarter of the New York Army Guard’s active force is dedicated to recruiting.

“It’s not just one thing,” Abbate said. “It’s the senior NCO leadership across the state. It’s our ability to hire passionate, patriotic Soldiers who volunteer for recruiting duty. They believe in this. They know that we have a lot of responsibility to provide the units here in New York state with a lot of talented men and women.”

Abbate said he has not seen a decline in the number of people who want to serve. The reasons for their desires to serve vary.

“We’re doing well in high schools and college markets, and with legal permanent residents,” he said. “These are people who are not yet Americans, but they want to be. One of the ways they’re doing that is getting their expedited U.S. citizenship through the New York National Guard.”

Abbate said the Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course has been a game changer for recruiting in all Army components, specifically in helping applicants pass the aptitude test required for entry.

This program was established in 2022 and provides education and training to help American youth overcome academic and physical fitness barriers to military service.

“It's amazing what happens when you take a cell phone out of somebody’s hand to put them in a situation where they're getting paid to learn,” he said.

Sasseville said the Guard offers an unparalleled value proposition to the nation, and to the 430,000 or so service members who fill its formations.

“The Guard is set apart because of who we are and what we do,” he said. “Our Guardsmen come in on chunks of time, big and small, to either go downrange and fight our nation's wars, or they come on duty serving their states to get a wide range of missions done.”

The vice chief said the Guard offers its members pride in service to country and community; hands-on high-tech training; education benefits and a retirement pension.

Most Guardsmen serve part time and draw their primary source of income from civilian professions, often in different vocations than their military jobs. This broad scope of skills is what makes Guardsmen so valuable to America, he said.

Abbate said the New York Guard is a juggernaut that offers current and prospective members many opportunities.

“We’ve done a lot since 9/11,” he said. “All the deployments, COVID response, and everything in between.”

Sasseville — accompanied by Army Maj. Gen. Raymond Shields, New York’s adjutant general, and Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau Tony Whitehead — also visited New York Guardsmen on station securing transportation hubs in the city as part of Joint Task Force Empire Shield.

Empire Shield is the state’s standing military organization that plans and prepares for defense support to civil authority missions throughout the New York City area. The unit is commanded by a lieutenant colonel and jointly staffed with Army and Air National Guard personnel along with members of the New York Guard State Volunteer Force and New York Naval Militia.

This unit was established on Sept. 11, 2001, and is state-resourced and sustained from the New York National Guard to support state and city emergency management and law enforcement officials with a rapid response force of National Guard members for homeland security missions.

About 500 Army and Air National Guard members serve on the task force.

Sasseville also stopped at the Jamaica Armory in Jamaica, Queens, to view the progress of a major renovation project of the historic 190,000-square-foot building.

This armory is home to the New York Army Guard’s 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery, and the 442nd Military Police Company. Once renovations are complete, the space will accommodate 600 Soldiers and serve as a modernized hub for New York Guard response to emergencies in New York City.

At the Military Enlistment Processing Station, Sasseville and Whitehead invited the new recruits to join them in the ceremonial cutting of the National Guard’s 387th birthday cake.

“What better way to spend the Guard’s birthday than welcoming our newest Citizen-Soldiers and -Airmen into our great force?” Whitehead said. “Congratulations to each of you, and welcome to the National Guard.”

BOISE, Idaho — Brig. Gen. Ryan Robinson returned to the Idaho State Capitol Dec. 15 to administer the commissioning oath to the Idaho Army National Guard’s newest officer: his son, 2nd Lt. Benjamin Robinson.

Like his father, the lieutenant will begin his career in the Idaho Army National Guard after graduating from Boise State University's ROTC program and commissioning inside the state capitol. While in college, both Soldiers served as the Bronco Battalion's cadet commander.

“It means a lot,” the general said. “It’s great to see the next generation come up into the Guard family. I’m proud of Ben’s accomplishments, dedication and willingness to serve.”

Second Lt. Robinson’s dad wasn’t the only familiar face at his commissioning ceremony. After completing the oath, he accepted his first salute from his grandfather, Air Force veteran Thomas Robinson, who also gave Ryan his first salute in 1996 upon his own graduation and commissioning.

Second Lt. Robinson will serve as a quartermaster officer for G Company, 145th Brigade Support Battalion, 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team. He has drilled with the unit since November as a member of the Simultaneous Membership Program, which allows National Guard members to drill with a unit while completing ROTC.

Robinson said his decision to join the Idaho Army National Guard was based on more than just following in his dad’s footsteps.

“I wanted to serve but also pursue a career in mechanical engineering and stay in Idaho,” he said.

Robinson will put his mechanical engineering degree to good use at a Boise-based drone company.

“I’m honored to accept my commission from the Army and to begin my career, both on the Army side and on the civilian side,” he said.

Since commissioning himself, Brig. Gen. Robinson has successfully managed dual careers. He serves as the Idaho National Guard’s director of the joint staff and as a corporate finance officer in his civilian job. He deployed twice to Iraq in support of combat operations and has held commands at multiple echelons.

Dustin Wilson has made a major contribution as Central Issue Facility manager and accountable officer at Logistics Readiness Center-Daegu since his arrival in June 2022. He has reduced excess/outdated stock by 45 percent, scored “commendable” on all inspections and set up a highly effective ICE feedback system which nets in excess of 10 comments a month (all positive). He brings significant energy, creativity, customer service and efficiency to LRC-Daegu CIF making it one of the best in the Army.

Hometown:

Surprise, AZ

How long have you been working for the U.S. Army?

I started civilian service in 2017 working for the 402nd AFSB LRC-Wainwright Central Issue Facility as a supply technician. With the knowledge I gained there I was able to move to 405th AFSB LRC-Benelux in 2019 as the accountable officer for the CIF Main in Chievres, Belgium, and CIF Annex in Brunssum, Netherlands. I started my current position the CIF accountable officer for the Camp Carroll CIF under 403rd AFSB LRC-Daegu in 2022.

What other positions have you held with the U.S. Military?

Army active duty from 2013-2017 in 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment stationed at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, as MOS 15J, OH-58D Kiowa helicopter armament, electrical, and avionics systems maintenance. Completed one 9-month rotation to Camp Humphreys ending February 2015. As the Kiowa began to be phased out, I was detailed to CIF as a material handler assistant in April 2015, preparing issues and turn-ins of Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE). This was really the start of my career at CIF as I became knowledgeable in OCIE and CIF procedures.

Tell us about your job and what you do:

As a CIF accountable officer, I am responsible for ensuring the accountability of OCIE and Chemical Individual Protective Equipment issued, received, and stored at CIF. CIFs mission is all about readiness, providing protective and load carrying equipment to our assigned service members to ensure they are always fully capable and ready to complete their missions. We support thousands of service members in Area IV with issues and turn-ins of authorized equipment, handling 282,380 pieces of equipment with a value of $28.1m in the past year.

What motivates you?

I love working as part of the CIF team and supporting the service member. CIF is a place I know I can make a positive impact for service members. As the CIF accountable officer, Soldiers often come to me for questions and concerns regarding their equipment and records. While I can’t immediately solve every problem, taking a moment to hear what the individual has to say and understanding their issue makes a difference. I can provide accurate guidance and options for the service member to pursue, ensuring the individual has a way forward and positive experience even in stressful situations.

What other duties are you responsible for?

Alternate Billing Official

What are some of your accomplishments while at LRC-Daegu?

Camp Carroll CIF has achieved a Best-In-Class rating in the ICE Comment system for FY22 and FY23 with a 100 percent satisfaction rating. Our team provides outstanding customer service and ensures every service member is treated with respect and understanding, guaranteeing a positive experience for all.

What is the best thing about working at LRC-Daegu?

Camp Carroll CIF has an amazing team of Korean local national employees, several of whom have worked there over 20 years. I love working with them, sharing CIF knowledge, and learning from their experiences over the years. They made a positive difference in my life and have been very helpful in the transition to living in Korea. I am truly grateful to have them on my team.

What do you like to do in your free time?

My family and I love the simple things like walking along the Sincheon River and visiting the local markets in Daegu, enjoying the amazing cuisine and culture of Korea.

Do you have anything else you would like to share?

After starting my Army career as an enlisted aviation Soldier, I would have never thought my time detailed at CIF would lead me into the career I have today as a CIF accountable officer. I am thankful for the great leaders, colleagues and friends who personally educated and supported me, providing opportunities to grow professionally and further my career."

BASTOGNE, Belgium — Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) helped commemorate the 79th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne, Belgium, Dec. 16, 2023 with a parade through the city center. The 101st Soldiers were joined by WWII veterans, a local Belgian band, members of the Belgian military, Soldiers from Benelux, Belgian school children, and members of the community.

The Battle of the Bulge occurred in the winter of 1944 as elements of the 101st looked to secure and defend the city of Bastogne, surrounded by the German Army. The airborne Soldiers were able to repel the attacks of the Germans and outlast the barrage of German artillery until Lt. Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army was able to break through the German line to aid the 101st Soldiers. Both Lt. Gen. Patton and Brig. Gen. Anthony McAuliffe, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, are seen as heroes that saved the town of Bastogne from destruction.

That legacy of service and sacrifice has not been forgotten by those serving in the 101st today. Col. Trevor Voelkel, commander of the 1st Brigade Combat Team (Bastogne), 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) has not forgotten the importance of what his unit's namesake is.

""It's an absolute privilege and honor to represent the great Soldiers of the Bastogne brigade,"" said Voelkel. ""To see the WWII veterans, to hear their stories and to understand their sacrifice and how that relates to the sacrifice that our Soldiers and families have today is truly a wonderful opportunity and amazing experience.""

""It is a community within a community in Bastogne,"" said Voelkel, ""and what I think you'll find is that they have not forgotten and it's a part of the fabric of society here. They still remember through their relatives and their stories, the liberation of Belgium when the Americans and Allies came to liberate them after years under the Nazis. It's important that we all remember what the world went through, so that it never happens again."""

FORT WALKER, Va. – From December 7-10, five Service Members from the Soldier Recovery Unit at Fort Belvoir, Va., were hosted at Fort Walker for a weekend white-tailed deer hunting excursion put on by Fort Walker staff and tenant volunteers.

For the first time since the COVID pandemic, Fort Walker was able to restart the program and bring SRU participants to stay in The Lodge, the largest and most historic cabin on post. All hunting excursions were led by a guide from the Garrison or Tenant Staffs. The guides, if needed, would assist the hunter to the site, remain present for the duration of the hunt, and retrieve any game upon a successful hunt.

“When I arrived at Fort Walker in 2022, the Wounded Warrior Hunt was the most requested event to bring back after the COVID pandemic, and I can now see why. The employees here love supporting our nation's Wounded Warriors, and I'd like to thank all of our volunteers who supported the event, as well as the participants who have sacrificed so much in support of our country,” said Lt. Col. Jason Duffy, garrison commander. Fort Walker personnel are eager to expand the hunt next year to even more participants."

KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany – One of the joys of the holidays is gift giving, and the team at the Remote Maintenance and Distribution Center-Ukraine in Poland experienced this recently when they received care packages and gift boxes from a group of kind-hearted people on the other side of the world.

“Thank you to everyone who helped lift the holiday spirits within our formation,” said Lt. Col. Michael Liles, the RDC-U commander. “Your act of kindness goes a long way for all of the troops here.”

Army Maj. Janet Williams, who also works at the RDC-U, said she wanted to personally express her gratitude to everyone who continues to keep her and her fellow Soldiers in mind while they’re deployed abroad.

“We could not do what we do without the love and support from people like you. Thank you, and may God continue to bless you,” Williams said.

The team of Soldiers and civilians who work at the RDC-U received multiple holiday care packages and gift boxes in the mail from a group of very giving people back in the states. The boxes included snacks and goodies and things that deployed Soldiers overseas find useful.

“The entire team at our restaurant, along with our fine patrons, are grateful for what you do,” said Nick Mikus, the founder of Nick’s Ristorante in Huntsville, Alabama, and the person who organized the care packages. “We appreciate your sacrifices and your patriotism as you keep all of us here at home protected with the freedoms we enjoy, and we look forward to your safe return home very soon.”

Master Sgt. George Barker, the senior enlisted advisor at the RDC-U and Army Field Support Battalion-Mannheim, responded to Mikus, a retired Soldier himself, with much gratitude in return.

“My sincere gratitude and appreciation to you and your team,” Barker said to Mikus in an email. “Thank you for taking the time to send us these care packages. Your consideration for others during this holiday season is truly what Christmas is all about.”

“It came as a total surprise and was the highlight of my day,” added Sgt. 1st Class Tyson Glover. “I'm grateful for your support and wish you and your families a wonderful Christmas.”

The RDC-U, which was stood up by the 405th Army Field Support Brigade shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, is a model of cooperation and U.S. Army Materiel Command enterprise-level support. Organizations supporting the mission include the 405th AFSB, Security Assistance Group-Ukraine, U.S. Army Europe and Africa, U.S. Army Sustainment Command and multiple AMC Life Cycle Management Commands such as U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command and more.

The 405th AFSB is assigned to ASC and under the operational control of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The brigade is headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany, and provides materiel enterprise support to U.S. Forces throughout Europe and Africa – providing theater sustainment logistics; synchronizing acquisition, logistics and technology; and leveraging AMC’s materiel enterprise to support joint forces.

WASHINGTON – In a strategic move to bolster the nation's defense capabilities and address emerging security challenges, the District of Columbia Army National Guard officially activated Delta Company, 223rd Military Intelligence Battalion (LING), during a ceremony at the D.C. Armory Dec. 9.

Maj. Gen. John Andonie, commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, underscored the day's significance, saying, “Events like this do not happen every day. It is a rare occasion when a state, territory, or district activates a unit.”

This new addition under the 74th Troop Command, which is synonymous with high-visibility missions, including the COVID-19 mission, First Amendment demonstrations and Presidential Inaugurations, will contribute to national security by providing intelligence and linguistic support to all Army echelons. The activation comes amid a rapidly changing threat landscape, marked by technological advancements and requiring a more agile and adaptable intelligence response.

“The mission of the battalion has evolved to address the dynamic environment we now find ourselves in,” said 1st Lt John Ibrahim, D Co, 223rd Military Intelligence Battalion commander. “While our company mission of providing intelligence and linguist support remains the same, we've shifted focus to emphasize integrated technological advancements and large-scale combat operations.”

Delta Company comprises highly trained and skilled personnel, enhancing the D.C. Guard’s multi-domain capabilities by providing intelligence and language proficiencies not found in standard U.S. Army units. The unique skillsets and robust training requirements are critical for supporting Army operations.

“Linguists are very hard to find in some places of our country, but not in D.C.,” said Andonie. “We are in one of the most diverse cities in the U.S., if not the world. It is that diversity that will allow us to find the individuals to serve in this unit and provide the Army with the capability it needs for the wartime mission.”

Recruiting additional Soldiers for the unit will involve traditional and digital channels while leveraging existing networks within the intelligence community in D.C., engaging in local community outreach events, and collaborating with educational institutions. Prospective recruits can pursue a role as human intelligence collectors and linguists. The unit also has career opportunities for Officers and Warrant Officers. The activation provides a unique pathway for individuals interested in contributing to national security through diverse intelligence roles, broadening the appeal and scope of the D.C. National Guard's recruitment efforts.

While this element is new to the D.C. Guard, it brings a wealth of expertise. The unit was previously part of the Massachusetts Army National Guard and earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for efforts in Operation Iraqi Freedom leading to the capture of Saddam Hussein. During their deployment to Kosovo, the unit was responsible for multiple multinational intelligence collection teams.

“What fills me with the most pride is the unwavering dedication demonstrated by my Soldiers towards this organization,” Ibrahim said. “The transition from Massachusetts to D.C. presented unexpected challenges for many, yet their resilience and commitment to the unit have truly showcased the exceptional character of these individuals.”

By integrating these capabilities, the D.C. National Guard can better protect the nation and its residents, ensuring a comprehensive and adaptable approach to safeguarding national security.

BARLING, Arkansas – Thirty-three, two-person teams of military snipers from around the world competed in the 53rd Winston P. Wilson (WPW) Sniper Championship (National Guard) and the 33rd Armed Forces Skill at Arms Meeting (Inter-Service) December 1-8 at Fort Chaffee Joint Maneuver Training Center. These championships allow service members to test sniper skills and weapon systems in a battle-focused environment.

This year’s sniper championships, included international competitors from Colombia, Denmark, and the Netherlands.

The guest of honor at the awards ceremony, marking the triumphant conclusion of the highly competitive event, was Maj. Gen. Jonathan Stubbs, Arkansas’ adjutant general. His presence added honor to the celebration, recognizing outstanding achievements in marksmanship.

“Marksmanship is not just about hitting a target. It’s about discipline, focus, and precision. These are the same qualities that make our National Guard Soldiers the best in the world,” said Maj. Gen. Stubbs.

“The Winston P. Wilson Championship and the National Guard Marksmanship Training Center are integral to the success of our Soldiers in maintaining their marksmanship proficiency,” Stubbs said. “Through these institutions, our Soldiers are equipped with the necessary skills to protect our communities and defend our nation. A strong marksmanship program is essential for the safety and security of our country, and the National Guard is proud to lead the way.”

The WPW sniper competition began in 1971 and has been held annually to determine the best shooters in the United States National Guard. This year’s 53rd WPW Sniper Champion is Utah National Guard. Shooters are awarded the prestigious Chiefs 50 Marksmanship Badge on behalf of the Chief, National Guard Bureau. The Chief’s 50 Marksmanship Badge was established to provide evidence and public recognition of outstanding marksmanship abilities demonstrated at the National Guard Championships.

In addition to earning the Chief’s 50 Badge and the Overall Championship Team Trophy, the Utah National Guard received the Chief David R. Logan Sniper Team Trophy. The 2nd place winner is the Iowa Sniper Team. Iowa shooters are also recipients of the Chief’s 50 Badge.

The Armed Forces Skills at Arms Meeting (AFSAM), established in 1991, is a multi-national competition created to promote marksmanship training and competition between United States military forces and allied nations. This year’s 33rd AFSAM Sniper Championship winner is the 2nd Special Warfare Training Group. The AFSAM championship ran concurrently with the WPW championship and incorporated the same fire courses.

This competition is designed as a training tool for US and Allied armed forces, immersing them into situations they could encounter in the real world. Attendees learn to maneuver and shoot in a carefully orchestrated chaos that mimics a battle-like environment. This allows participating teams to hone their current skills and develop new ones.

FORT WAINRIGHT, Alaska – Two members of Fort Wainwright’s Department of Public Works staff have been selected for top garrison honors for the year. Katrina Hughes, a contract performance evaluator and the mold program manager, has been selected as employee of the year, and Graham Wichman, the Engineering Division chief, as supervisor of the year.

Mold is one of the most significant problems for military barracks, housing, and other facilities across the Department of Defense, and Hughes’s work is critical to the health and comfort of Fort Wainwright’s soldiers, families, and employees.

Hughes’s supervisor, David Zrna, chief of Contract Management Branch, said that Hughes drafted the garrison’s mold response and mitigation standard operating procedures document.

“She coordinates with various directorates and emphasizes the importance of recognizing and remediating mold on Fort Wainwright,” Zrna said. “Katrina has been doing a stellar job along with her regular daily duties. She cares for the health and welfare of the soldiers and civilians on Fort Wainwright, and it reflects with a job well done.”

Mold management is not her only responsibility, however, and Hughes said she “oversees contracts to ensure contractors are meeting their contractual agreements in a timely manner, with adequate materials and in a safe way.”

Hughes has only worked at Fort Wainwright since October 2022, though she has accomplished much in her time here.

When asked what was one of the most notable projects she has been involved in, she replied, “For me, seeing the airfield painting project come to completion was up there for me. The airfield had been waiting years to have this done and being a part of the team to see this through was rewarding. Our team worked through nights, weekends, you name it to ensure the project was successful.”

Like Hughes, Wichman has also only been in his current position at Fort Wainwright for a little over a year but has worked at the installation since 2005 in a variety of positions.

When asked why he nominated Wichman for the award, Tim Sponseller, the Public Works director, said, “I nominated Graham for the supervisor of the year award mainly due to his outstanding efforts in effectively managing an enormous program load—larger than we have seen at USAG Alaska in at least the past 15 years, with over $400M contracted compared to a typical amount of $85M.”

Many of the programs that Wichman is overseeing are construction projects that are being tracked by the highest levels of the Army, Department of Defense, and Congress. They include the new Child Development Center, barracks, Community Activity Center, Aquatics Center, and enhanced main gate infrastructure, among others. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. James McConville, Senior Enlisted Leader to the Chairman Sgt. Maj. Ramon Colon-Lopez, and other dignitaries have visited Fort Wainwright and toured those sites.

Other significant projects Wichman has overseen have included new snow-making equipment for the Birch Hill ski area, renovations and new equipment for the post fitness facilities, and a new motorcycle safety course.

However, “the most significant single program that Graham established and managed was the Greenhouse Gas program,” Sponseller said. “Graham quickly established a vision and execution plan for the program. He and his team coordinated closely with customers, contracting agencies, and Headquarters Installation Management Command to establish project teams and complete detailed scopes of work and estimates on 12 projects that were awarded for over $108M of the $110M available, all prior to the 30 September deadline.”

According to Wichman, the work was truly a team effort.

“I need to emphasize that without the effort of my highly experienced team, we would have had to turn away this opportunity, based on the short timeline,” he said.

Wichman supervises approximately 45 employees in the Engineering Division. He has been dedicated to their professional development and has initiated continuing education opportunities, including their ability to attend relevant professional training in the local area. Local training saves the employees time and keeps them near their families while also saving the Army thousands of dollars in travel expenses for more distant training sessions.

Having worked at Fort Wainwright for 18 years, Wichman has an in-depth understanding of the needs of the installation.

“I fully understand the struggles with our extreme environment and old infrastructure,” Wichman said, “which makes me appreciate every win we get and every improvement we are part of to make this installation a welcome, safe, and comfortable place to work and live for our soldiers, families, and civilians.”"

“It gives the U.S. Soldiers pride in what they do, it broadens their perspective and gives them more insight into Korean culture,” said 1st Lt. Hannah Taylor, a 194th DSSB U.S. volunteer. “Being able to help the local community shows who we are as an organization to the people of the country (Republic of Korea) we are here to protect.”

The Good Neighbor Program is a USFK community relations program initiated in 2003, aimed at actively engaging the local community, government, media, business, education, and military through cultural and educational exchanges to promote mutual understanding of one another's cultures, customs, and lifestyles.

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — For many, the holiday season means putting up the tree and decorating it with care.

Trees for Troops helped to ensure those traditions continue with more than 600 fresh Christmas trees donated to Fort Cavazos and given out to Soldiers and DOD ID card holders Dec. 8 and 9 at the Phantom Warrior Stadium here.

The annual event is sponsored by the Christmas Spirit Foundation, which provides free farm-grown trees to service members in all branches of the U.S. military and their families, and FedEx, which delivered the trees to the Great Place.

Summer Inwood, chief of sports, fitness and aquatics with Fort Cavazos Directorate of Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation, explained why lower enlisted Soldiers had first pick of the trees.

“We just do it because we know they don’t make a lot,” she said. “Their sacrifices are just the same as the officers and the upper enlisted, they just don’t get the same paycheck. And so, we want to make sure that they get the Christmas decorations, and their families get to experience what really the holidays are all about.”

Festive aromas pierced the air and helped usher in the celebratory season as lower enlisted Soldiers and family members were ushered in, 10 at a time, to select the perfect tree.

Though the growers couldn’t greet each recipient personally, they sent their well wishes in personalized messages attached to many of the trees for the new owners to enjoy.

Size and appearance factored heavily into the decision to take trees home, but more importantly, it was about the grandeur of the gesture.

Spc. William Workman, 1st Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, his wife Beth and daughter Emilee have participated in the event twice previously and this year, the family was set on a tall tree with full foliage.

But Workman conveyed the true reason he was grateful for the holiday tradition.

“It means a lot to know that folks go through and take their time to donate all these trees, so all of these other Soldiers have the opportunity to have a tree,” he said.

Spc. Karina Machado, 553 Division Sustainment Support Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade, also had her eye on a tall, green, fluffy and full tree to take home to her husband and two children.

She explained that this time of year can be expensive, and the free tree is appreciated.

“Sometimes during the holidays, someone can’t afford one and it’s a really great gesture for you guys to help E-4 and below,” she said referring to the Trees for Troops program.

Spc. Haku Thomson, 553 Div. Sustainment Support Bn., 1st Cav. Div. Sustainment Bde., shared that this was his first time having a live tree for his wife and daughter, and that the gesture made him feel special.

“It’s amazing because I’m from the islands so we don’t get these trees in the islands, so to get this for the first time, my first Christmas, it’s really nice,” he said. “I think it’s really good for us E-4 and below.”

Soldiers and their families enjoyed some assistance from the Fort Cavazos Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers program. Thirty BOSS volunteers donned in Santa hats helped patrons select and load their trees.

“There’s nothing better than the Soldiers being able to come to Phantom Warrior Stadium and get help getting a Christmas tree from our BOSS representatives,” said BOSS President Cpl. Kandice Pritchard-Harmon. “I’m very proud that we are out here today being able to help our fellow battle buddies and their families.”"

SEMBACH KASERNE, Germany – Testing the capabilities of Soldiers guarding prisoners at Europe’s only correctional facility as well as strengthening military and host-nation cooperation came into play during an exercise here in vicinity of the Sembach Correctional Facility.

The Missing Prisoner Emergency Action Plan Exercise tested U.S. Army Correctional Activity-Europe’s ability to trace, capture and return Soldiers to the facility. This is the first full-size exercise conducted at this facility to test the readiness of the facility’s military and partner organizations.

The exercise involves multiple units from the local area including U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz’s Directorate of Emergency Services, Combined Military Working Dog Detachment-Europe and the Kaiserslautern Polizei.

During the exercise, correctional-facility cadre monitored three Soldiers who were simulating prisoners conducting area beautification outside of the facility’s containment area. During this time a Soldier fled custody of the cadre to attempt escape.

The facility’s operations chief said the ability to react to scenarios like these is key to a ensuring the security of the prisoners and the outside community.

“Our team is ready to react and has plans in place in the very unlikely event a prisoner was to escape our cadres custody,” said Sgt. 1st Class Davon Watkins, correctional facility operations chief. “We immediately lockdown the facility, establish an emergency operations center, deploy a search party and coordinate with local partners for help.”

Once the emergency action plan is activated, the cadre and senior leaders in the facility begin contacting multiple community organizations to assist in catching the missing prisoners. Watkins said the cooperation between all units is essential.

“Events of this scope require that we are able to seamlessly work with multiple military organizations and our host-nation Polizei partners,” said Watkins. “We all must be able to work within the systems each party has in place, and this exercise allows everyone involved to learn how each organization operates so in the event there is an emergency we are familiar with all systems and policies.”

In the end, the combined team of Soldiers, a military working dog, DES officers and Polizei caught the fleeing prisoners and returned them to the facility. While there were adjustments and challenges, Watkins called the exercise a success.

“This exercise was a resounding success and met and exceeded every expectation we had,” he said. “Any challenges we faced we overcame quickly and adjusted well. In the end this was a great learning tool for us that we will take back to our teammates and will do even better next time.”

The missing prisoner exercise allows the correctional facility to coordinate emergency measures with local partners within minutes of an emerging event occurring and is important since all organizations have different law enforcement roles throughout the community.

“It is important to emphasize that the responsibility for security in the West Palatinate is not only the duty of the police alone but is a shared task that we carry together,” said Bernhard Christian Erfort, Kaiserslautern Polizei police spokesman. “The U.S. armed forces and their members have proven themselves not only as defenders of our freedom, but also as committed members of our community.”

U.S. Army Correctional Activity-Europe exercises command and control of all U.S. military service members in Europe and Africa awaiting trial or serving time for crimes committed. The facility falls under the 21st TSC’s area of responsibility under the 18th MP Brigade.

This scope of this exercise created buzz from media throughout Germany with a slew of media outlets interested in the facility’s crucial mission of the U.S. Army’s only correctional facility in Europe.

“The media attending events like this not only shows what our units are doing but allows the local community to see firsthand the scope of work the Army does with our host nation partners,” said Maj. Vonnie Wright, 21st Theater Sustainment Command public affairs officer. “We want to be able to highlight the work of the 18th Military Police Brigade, the correctional facility, our German Allies and the 21st TSC any time we have the opportunity.”

Noting the exercise’s success and praising his team’s readiness, U.S. Army Correctional Activity-Europe senior enlisted leader Sgt. Major Marcus Mitchell said his team should take pride in the results and the partnership they have built with their host-nation colleagues.

""This exercise is a win for the facility, the 18th MP Brigade, the 21st TSC and the Army Corrections Command,” he said. ""Our team here at the United States Army Correctional Activity Europe performs their duties at the facility in Sembach 24 hours a day 7 days a week. It is critical and mandated that we exercise scenarios like this internally and with our local German and American partners who would participate and assist with this type of event. I am extremely proud of their efforts and the teamwork they showed throughout the exercise to get the job done."""

VICENZA, Italy – With Christmas just around the corner, Maija Winesberry shared some advice to avoid getting in debt, with couples from the community during a recent Love and Money Matter workshop.

Christmas is not about giving gifts, or spending money on gifts, Winesberry said. She posed a question, could she even recall a gift given to her from five years ago.

“I like to think about remembering an experience five years ago, some memory of a great time during the holiday season” said Winesberry, who explained how experiences are the best gifts. “Creating memories along the way and increasing your education is completely priceless.”

Sometimes a gift can be writing a nice note or offering something your partner will cherish and keep forever, Winesberry said. Meanwhile, revising your money situation and having a spending plan – for this year and next, she said. Now is the time to start automated savings for next years’ gifts – a way to keep yourself from debt.

Three couples took part in the Nov. 17 training offered by Army Community Service. Nicky Wolf Sumner, ACS’s Family Advocacy Program Prevention Education Coordinator, created the workshop to emphasize how love and money are correlated.

How do these two subjects become one? The Garrison Outlook asked Wolf Sumner, whose job is to educate people about preventing domestic violence and child abuse.

She knows from experience that couples often have problems communicating and she wanted to create something similar to a marriage workshop. She also learned recently how problems with love and money can lead to suicide.

Suicide statistics show that 42 percent of suicides in the military involves relationship issues, Wolf Sumner said. Ten percent are because of financial issues and the rest was because they were not able to find meaning in life, she said. Wolf Sumner partnered with the garrison’s Religious Support Office’s “Spiritual Life Center” to also offer a faith-based approach. While overseas, military families often move to a single income household due to employment issues. Couples need to plan for this to not have financial issues that can also cause relationship problems.

“Oftentimes people struggle with money overseas,” Wolf Sumner said. “I see many families struggling with financial resources and that’s why I decided to combine the different aspects together to make it in a non-invasive way, providing an interactive class, a more fun way to talk about communication, to talk about financial stuff.”

The workshop took different approaches.

Chaplain (Lt. Col.) John Hubbs spoke about the five love languages. Amber Morris taught couples yoga, focusing on healing touches. Winesberry talked about maintaining smart goals, making future purchases and how to maintain finances. Wolf Sumner talked about communication, how to overcome obstacles, how to build a foundation, how to tackle stress when it comes around and how to work together in a marriage or a relationship.

By the conclusion, the couples were able to learn from each other, Wolf Sumner said, because we’re all different and work in different dynamics.

The ACS financial readiness program exists to support readiness, Winesberry said. The next quarterly workshop is in the Spring. ACS has details.

“The workshop was to provide a space for couples to come and chat about their goals, their future as a couple and their finances,” Winesberry said. “I believe that there was an increase of interest after the workshop was finished”."

WIESBADEN, Germany – A local national fire fighter was honored for 38 years of service in an intimate retirement ceremony at the U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden Directorate of Emergency Services fire house on Clay Kaserne, Nov. 22.

In the Army, selfless service can be defined, in part, as doing your duty loyally without thought of recognition or gain. For USAG Wiesbaden firefighter and crew chief Captain Thomas Graef, volunteerism and selfless service began as a boyhood dream that came to fruition over nearly four decades as a professional and 50 years as a volunteer firefighter.

Rauenthal beginnings

Public service is often referred to as a calling, however 38 years of public service is more than just a calling.

“Firefighting comes from the bottom of your heart,” explained Graef’s supervisor, USAG Wiesbaden Fire Department Chief Daniel Corzelius.

For Graef, selfless service and fighting fires was more than a passion – it was tradition.

Graef’s journey to becoming a professional firefighter began in 1972 when he joined the local volunteer fire department managed and led by his grandfather, in his hometown of Rauenthal, Germany.

However, achieving his boyhood dream of working in a German firehouse would be stymied by German regulation. But his drive to be a professional firefighter would find a different path through opportunities with the U.S. Army.

Clear path ahead

Two regulations stood in the way of Graef fulfilling his dream of becoming a professional firefighter – one he could overcome, the other proved more challenging.

Graef knew that according to German regulation, firefighters must have a handyman’s trade. He knew going back to school and learning a trade was his first step, therefore he decided to become an electrician and eventually found work repairing helicopters on the Clay Kaserne Airfield.

The second regulation would pose more of an obstacle.

“In Germany, I could not be a professional fire fighter because I wore glasses,” said Graef.

Though a daunting hurdle to overcome, he would not let it stop his desire to join the professional firefighting corps.

Firefighting was in his blood but serving as a volunteer fighting fire was not enough.

He knew that the German “no-glasses restriction” did not apply to U.S. firefighters, therefore working with the U.S. Army firefighting service could be the solution to his problem.

Graef was officially hired as a member of the USAG Wiesbaden fire department back on June 1, 1985 – leaving the airfield and his electrician duties behind him.

Starting his career handling fire hoses as a rookie firefighter, Graef rose to become a shift leader and ultimately became an assistant chief, responsible for incident response and management.

A proven leader throughout his career, Graef applied his firefighting expertise towards training countless numbers of fighters throughout the years, from rookies to battalion chiefs.

Evolving fire presence

The U.S. Army has had a firefighting presence on Clay Kaserne for 77 years. Graef has been a part of that history for almost four decades.

In that time, he has seen the garrison fire department expand, adding more equipment and personnel over the years.

“(…) As Clay Kaserne grew, so did the responsibilities to respond to the needs of the growing community,” said Graef.

The fire department grew over the years, but the building remained the same size.

“When I started there were only two trucks and now – we have so many they will not fit in the firehouse.”

Building special bonds

Serving as a member of the USAG Wiesbaden Fire Department can be a tough and dangerous profession that offers long hours of shift work – often during the holidays – that can mean a lot of time away from family and loved ones.

“Being a fire fighter is a calling and it takes a lot of time away from the family,” said USAG Wiesbaden DES Director Cody Ferguson.

Spending a lot of time together in close quarters during difficult situations can bring people closer.

The closeness between Chief Graef and his crews is evident. To many of his men, Graef is known as “Opa,” German for grandfather.

“Why Opa? I am the oldest…all my guys are younger than me,” added Graef with a slight smile.

Recognizing their support and sacrifices throughout Capt. Graef’s long and distinguished career, his family present – Gaby Graef and Johannes Graef, were presented with a bouquet of flowers and a gift basket.

“Nobody can be a success for 38 years, without strong family support – thank you for supporting Thomas,” said Corzelius.

Next steps

Though the ceremony marked a major milestone for Chief Graef, he won’t be riding an engine truck into the sunset of retirement, just yet.

In what can be referred to as coming full circle, and though his 38-year career as a professional firefighter has come to an end, Graef will continue to be a fixture in the USAG Wiesbaden fire department as a volunteer.

When he finally decides to hang up his firefighting boots Graef and his wife have plans to do spend more time hiking.

Local national employment

Local nationals have consistently been a part of the workforce, working side-by-side with U.S. armed forces and civilian personnel, on overseas installations for decades.

The garrison workforce in Wiesbaden is comprised of more than 475 personnel of which 370 are local national hires – more than 75%.

Finding qualified applicants who want to apply and fill the void is a constant recruitment effort for Garrison’s Workforce Development team.

“We are short local national hires…especially in the blue collar, engineer, technician and administration career fields,” said USAG Wiesbaden Workforce Development Program Manager Thomas Schulze.

Despite the many employment opportunities that are available, many local nationals do not know that the U.S. military is such a large employer, right here in their back yard.

SEMBACH, Germany – The U.S. Army NATO G4 section used a novel approach for training Soldiers assigned to the unit’s headquarters company about the Army’s Command Supply Discipline Program.

The format for the training was based on the popular game show, Jeopardy!, where contestants respond to clues with answers in the form of a question.

Approximately 20 Soldiers participated in the training Nov. 30 at the U.S. Army NATO headquarters in Sembach, Germany.

The U.S. Army NATO Headquarters and Headquarter Company, led by Capt. Ana Hill and 1st Sgt. Cory Jones, organize weekly training opportunities to “accomplish the brigade commander’s training guidance,” said Jones. “We identify gaps and develop solutions to close the gap. This training was identified to reinforce our core competencies.”

“We receive the Army’s training requirements and the brigade’s training requirements, and we nest them together which requires we do training on a weekly basis,” said Jones. “These weekly training requirements are the bedrock for ensuring our ability to fight and win or Nation’s wars, and more specifically to fulfill our commitment to provide trained and ready Soldiers in support of the NATO mission.”

Sgt. 1st Class Jean Ady and Staff Sgt. Desiree Bruton, both from U.S. Army NATO G4, provided instruction for the training.

“The purpose of our Supply Jeopardy! training was to teach the Soldiers about Command Supply Discipline responsibilities and procedures,” said Ady.

“This was mandatory training,” said Ady, “but we wanted to make it fun. This format was much more interactive and encouraged everyone to greater participation especially because the Soldiers are so competitive.”

“Everyone knew a lot more than I expected,” he said. “For example, they already knew what a FLIPL (Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss) was, but they did not know all the details. In the Jeopardy! format, we were able to provide them those extra details while keeping the training fun.”

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — A dozen American flags, along with one United States Army flag, waved in the crisp breeze Saturday as Chaplain (Maj.) Matt Burden, 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade, welcomed visitors to Bethel Cemetery.

“What an honor to be among you, to get a chance to lead us in this (service) and just to memorialize the heroism of a great man, a great Soldier,” he shared.

Bethel Cemetery, located in the northern training area of Fort Cavazos, was opened to finally lay Staff Sgt. Robert G. Rudd to rest next to his parents after 78 years.

Rudd, who served with 2nd Infantry Division, was killed in action on Jan. 30, 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge.

“I never dreamed that something like this would happen,” Jane Olivier, Rudd’s niece, shared after the service, “but I’m so thankful that the Army was so insistent and diligent in taking care of this and bringing (him) back to us and having this today.”

More than a dozen veterans and supporters were in attendance for the service, along with five surviving family members of Rudd, including Olivier. Other surviving family members were unable to attend, yet they passed along their joy of Rudd finally returning home.

“My grandma is one of the surviving nieces, and she named her youngest son after him,” Stacy Baldwin, a great, great niece of Rudd, said.

This prompted the memory of Olivier.

“Actually, (Stacy’s) grandmother used to write to (Rudd) when he was in the Army,” Olivier shared. “She would write to him until one day, she got the letter back.”

Baldwin became emotional at the thought of representing her grandmother that day, who was unable to attend.

“My grandmother was very, very happy to hear that he had been found,” she stated.

Military service, tragic loss

During World War II, Rudd deferred the draft order he received because he was the primary caregiver of his mother. When she passed however, he voluntarily entered the U.S. Army, joining April 12, 1942, in Dallas. He served with Company C, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Inf. Div., during World War II.

In 1944, American troops were amassed along Germany’s western borders resting and refitting. On Dec. 16, 1944, the German army launched its final counterattack along the western front. The ensuing battle, known now as the Battle of the Bulge, lasted from Dec. 16, 1944, to Jan. 25, 1945, with remnants lasting through February, costing more than 19,000 American lives, according to historical reports from the Army.

During this counterattack, the 2nd Inf. Div. became concentrated with the 99th Infantry Division around Elsenborn, Belgium; they dug in and held a defensive line, repulsing several increasingly desperate assaults by German troops. They finally began to push out of their positions in January 1945 and recapture the wooded areas east of Elsenborn, known as the Elsenbüchel Forest.

Toward the end of January 1945, Rudd’s battalion received orders to attack several new towns.

According to Rudd’s funeral service program, “it was by bright moonlight that troops began the attack, through chest high snowdrifts and mined areas the battalions secured ground around Wirtzfeld within several hours.” Moving on to the towns of Rocherath-Krinkelt, known as the “twin towns,” they found themselves in fierce fighting by late morning even though the regimental artillery had laid a huge barrage on the towns. It was sometime during the fighting Jan. 30, 1945, at Rocherath that Rudd was killed.

Due to intense fighting and fierce artillery shelling, and major restrictions in the area, Rudd’s body was unrecoverable, and the War Department submitted a Report of Death on Feb. 20, 1945, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, also known as DPAA.

It was in 1946 that the American Graves Registration Command was charged with recovering and identifying remains in the European Theatre. Those that could not be immediately identified, which numbered in the thousands, were brought to the nearest American Military Cemetery in the area and named with an X followed by a number.

Throughout the years, several requests were made to compare the remains of an unknown to that of Rudd. However, no matches could be found.

In 1950, a board of officers determined that Rudd’s status was that his remains “were disposed of by the enemy at an unknown location” and further approved his status as “non-recoverable.”

The process

DPAA announced Oct. 23 that Rudd was accounted for on June 20, 2022.

“After reviewing information provided by Belgian and American researchers in 2017, DPAA historians analyzed evidence related to several sets of remains initially recovered by Belgian locals in the Elsenbuchel Forest that had been interred at what is now the Ardennes American Cemetery in 1949, including unknown remains X-3144 Neuville,” according to DPAA.

Researchers suggested to DPAA that “X-3144” might be associated with an unaccounted for member of the 99th Infantry Division, and that the remains should be disinterred, and the list expanded for possible candidates beyond the 99th Infantry Division to include Soldiers, like Rudd, from the 2nd Inf. Div.

This list included 18 individuals whose regiments had operated north of Wirtzfeld. It was this area where the 38th Inf. Regt., 2nd Inf. Div., had operated when Rudd had disappeared, according to DPAA. Historians noted that given his regiment’s location, it was quite possible he perished in or very near the Elsenbüchel Forest.

Following an interdisciplinary analysis by DPAA historical and scientific staff, the X-3144 remains were disinterred from Ardennes American Cemetery on June 23, 2021, and transferred to DPAA Laboratory at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, for comparison.

To identify Rudd’s remains, scientists from DPAA used anthropological analysis and dental records. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA, Y chromosome DNA and autosomal DNA analysis.

It was then determined that Rudd had been located and identified based on location and history of Rudd’s reported loss location and date of death, circumstances of loss and historians’ comprehensive research of the Battle of the Bulge, according to Rudd’s obituary.

Because of the dedicated long-term research and field investigations by Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, along with input from private historians in both the U.S. and Belgium, nearly a dozen formerly unaccounted for Soldiers have been identified from remains located. Rudd was identified by the work these teams accomplished, more specifically, benefiting from 30 years of analysis and the work of two Belgian researchers and an American historian, who are focused on locating the missing members of the 99th Infantry Division from the Battle of Bulge.

Rudd’s name is recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Netherlands American Cemetery, an American Battle Monuments Commission site in Margraten, Netherlands, along with others still missing from WWII. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.

Awards, recognition earned

Rudd’s medals included a Bronze Star with the medal “V” device and one bronze oak leaf cluster, a Purple Heart, Good Conduct medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign medal with four Bronze Service Stars, World War II Victory Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, Combat Infantryman Badge, Honorable Service Lapel Button - World War II and the Belgian Fourragere.

After his death, his family was presented the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for his heroism.

Following the funeral, Rudd’s family members took a moment to reflect on what they had learned about their relative and on the service.

“It was a very moving day for us as we watched everybody participate and just knowing that he’s home, and that it took so long but the diligence and persistence was very moving,” Cindy Williford, a great niece of Rudd, said. “Jane and I were at the airport when they brought him in last night and to watch as Austin-Bergstorm Airport came to a standstill with lights and water, it was the most surreal moment as you watched this plane taxi to the gate. I will never forget that. …

“This is something that I never thought would happen and I’m thankful for everyone who was involved in bringing him home. …,” she shared. “It makes you proud to be an American.”"

WASHINGTON - On the National Guard’s 387th birthday, another milestone anniversary represents the impact the Guard has in more than 2,600 communities across the country.

Twenty years ago, on the Guard’s 367th birthday, a group of Oregon National Guard members answered an urgent call from Oregon Emergency Management — risking their lives to perform an over-water rescue on Oregon’s Sandy River.

The pilot in command that dark, snowy evening was then-Lt. Col. Dan Hokanson, who now serves as the 29th chief of the National Guard Bureau. While he’s proud of his part in the mission, his pride stems from the actions of his crew.

“Like many Guard service members, they represent the spirit, patriotism, and selfless service to our communities and nation … and our pledge to be ‘Always Ready, Always There,’” Hokanson said.

Below is an account of the rescue mission extracted from official correspondence documenting the mission.

On Dec. 13, 2003, the Oregon Emergency Management Agency alerted Lt. Col. Dan Hokanson, project officer for Oregon Army National Guard's Military Air Rescue Team, about a rescue mission on the Sandy River. The call was received at 5:30 p.m. and the mission involved rescuing two kayakers who were holding on to a sandbar that was slowly submerging due to rising storm rains.

A ground rescue team could not reach the kayakers, even after shooting a rope across the river, because the kayakers were so cold from 38-degree river water they could not hold onto the rope. A boat rescue was determined to be the last resort (after a helicopter) due to the rising, swift water at the scene and 20- to 30-foot trees floating downstream. The kayakers had been in the water for over three hours and were bordering on hypothermia.

Hokanson alerted Capt. Brian Houston, UH-60 Black Hawk pilot, Flight Medic Staff Sgt. Travis Davidson, and crew chiefs Staff Sgt. Mark Braeme and Sgt. Rob Armstrong en route to the airfield via cell phone. The crew assembled at the airfield, then prepared the aircraft, briefed and departed on the mission under night vision goggles at 6:30 p.m. aboard Black Hawk 669.

The worst forecast weather for the mission was a 1,500-foot broken cloud layer with 3 miles of visibility due to heavy rain. There was no moon illumination and the outside air temperature was 36 degrees when the crew headed to the rescue site about 45 miles away.

Shortly after takeoff, the crew encountered weather much worse than forecast. Cloud ceilings varied from 500 to 900 feet above ground level and visibility varied from one-half to 3 miles due to storm cells in the area. The crew reduced speed on the aircraft to 100 knots to navigate around as many rain cells as possible.

Twenty-five miles out from the incident site the weather deteriorated to 500-foot ceilings and visibility down to one-half mile. The crew reduced speed and altitude and had to deviate from a direct route due to accumulating ground fog and reduced visibility. Five miles from the scene, the aircraft encountered heavy snow and ceilings came down as low as 300 feet, but visibility remained at one-half mile.

The crew was already using anti-ice equipment, but the aircraft began to accumulate snow and ice on its exterior. The crew contacted the ground rescue teams and was advised of an estimated 200- to 300-foot ceiling with heavy snowfall at the scene. At about a mile out, Houston began to lose sight of the ground. Hokanson took the controls and sighted the rescue vehicles' emergency lights through the fog. The emergency vehicle lights silhouetted the high-tension wires just upstream from the kayakers. Hokanson maneuvered the aircraft into the river valley and climbed into the bottom of the cloud ceilings to cross the powerlines. The crew then maneuvered over the water to a position 120 feet above the kayakers, which they determined to be the safest altitude to stabilize the aircraft without the rotor wash affecting the kayakers. Armstrong and Braeme cleared the aircraft and prepared Powell for hoist extraction of the two kayakers.

Powell was lowered by hoist to the first kayaker and, as he reached for him, his foot hit the river current and he was momentarily submerged in the frigid waters. Powell then reached the first kayaker, secured him to his Jungle Penetrator and was then hoisted back to the aircraft.

After securing the first kayaker in the aircraft, Powell prepared to go down again. Armstrong lost feeling in his thumb (which was used to operate the hoist) due to the freezing temperatures and Braeme came over to assist. Powell was then lowered to the river where he once again entered the water momentarily before grabbing the second kayaker. Armstrong hoisted him up immediately as he and the victim began to drift into the river's current, which required Powell to grab the female kayaker and hold on to her up to the aircraft.

At the aircraft, both Braeme and Powell had to help bring the kayaker into the aircraft as the cold was affecting everyone's coordination and ability to hold anything. As the hoist operations were conducted, the pilots maintained the aircraft at a hover with lateral visibility obstructed by ice and snow accumulation on the aircraft doors. The cloud ceiling and fog also continued to come down to just above the helicopter's rotor system and the pilots' visibility was reduced to the point they could not see beyond the shoreline of the river.

Once Powell and the two kayakers were on board, the crew determined the cloud ceiling was 200 feet above the ground and visibility was less than one-quarter mile. Hokanson hovered the aircraft over to the bank of the river and attempted to follow a road, but he began losing sight of the ground. At this time, both victims were close to hypothermic and Powell began throwing up the river water he had ingested. With deteriorating weather, Hokanson elected to land the aircraft in a maintenance yard where the crew still had sight of the ground.

Ground crews moved equipment by hand to clear a spot for the helicopter, with the rotor blades clearing nearby concrete structures by just 2 to 3 feet. Once the helicopter was on the ground, an ambulance met the aircraft and both kayakers and Powell were treated for exposure and hypothermia. The kayakers fully recovered, no personnel were injured during the rescue and the crew of Black Hawk 669 was credited with two saves.

The National Guard serves as the combat reserve of the Army and the Air Force, and being manned, trained and equipped to fight and win the nation’s wars, helps communities across the country in their greatest times of need, Hokanson said.

While Armstrong and Powell have since retired from military service, Houston and Braeme continue their service in the ranks of colonel and chief warrant officer 5, respectively.

LATHAM, New York--A 60-year old helicopter pilot from Rochester, and a 17-year old from Castleton-on-Hudson who wants to be a mechanic, represented the past and future of the National Guard during the annual Guard Birthday observance on Wednesday, Dec. 13 at New York National Guard headquarters in Latham.

Chief Warrant Officer 5 Michael Zanghi, who has served over 42 years in the Army, joined Pvt. Sean McCauley, a Castleton resident, who enlisted in July to serve as a wheeled vehicle mechanic.

Traditionally the youngest service member present joins the oldest in cutting the birthday cake. The oldest service member represents the history and traditions of the National Guard, while the youngest represents the future of the Guard.

The National Guard claims Dec. 13, 1636, the date the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s legislature established formal militia companies in the colony.

In his remarks, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Mark Shumway, the New York Army Guard’s command chief warrant officer who presided over the ceremony emphasized that the National Guard fights the nation’s wars and serves at home during times of emergency.

Currently there are hundreds of New York National Guard Soldiers and Airmen deployed overseas. Meanwhile more than 2000 members of the Army an Air Guard and Naval Militia are currently serving to help the state cope with the ongoing migrant crisis, Shumway said.

Zanghi, the New York Army National Guard Aviation Office safety officer, has served in the Army Guard since 1981 in a variety of aviation positions.

He started out flying the venerable UH-1 “Huey helicopter and most recently flew the CH-47F heavy lift helicopter in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

He is due to retire in February and hopes to continue working in the aviation safety field as a civilian.

Representing the traditions of the National Guard is “humbling”, but he’s also proud to do so, he said.

“The doors that were available to me, the doors that were open for me, the opportunities have been immense,” he said.

“It’s not been a job. It’s always been something that’s been really fun, and that is why I am still here,” he said.

McCauley, a senior at Maple Hill Sr. High School in Schodack, said he enlisted in the Army National Guard because he wanted to be a mechanic and this would be the best way to do so.

He was originally thinking of joining the Marine Corps, but the Army National Guard would seem to be the better option, McCauley said.

When he completes his training, he will serve in detachment of the 224th Security and Support Aviation Regiment which operates the C-12 fixed wing transport at Albany International Airport in Latham.

Representing the future of the National Guard is a “big responsibility and I’m willing to take it,” he said.

Along with the cake-cutting ceremony, the event included a symbolic oath affirmation ceremony for McCauley and six other new Army and Air Guard recruits administered by Zanghi.

Recognized were:

--Private Ethan Bernard, age 17, from Ballston Spa, who enlisted in September to serve as a combat medic with the 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment in Utica.

--Private 1st Class Glenn Bryant, age 17 from Kingston, who enlisted in June of this year as a military police Soldier in the 206th Military Police Company here in Latham.

--Airman Elaine Emery, age 19, from Greenfield City, who enlisted October 21 to serve as an Aerospace Medical Service Technician with the 109th Airlift Wing in Scotia.

--Airman Jamisen Hotujec, age 20, from Glenmont, who enlisted in mid-November to serve as a Heavy Aircraft Integrated Avionics Technician with the 109th Airlift Wing.

--Airman Nasiru Kotey, age 22, from Albany, who enlisted last Thursday, December 7, to serve in the 109th Airlift Wing as a Heavy Aircraft Integrated Avionics Technician.

-Private Joshuah McGahan, age 18, from Kingston, who enlisted in July to serve as a combat medic with the 466th Area Support Medical Company in Queensbury.

The National Guard, which is composed of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, traces its official birthday to December 13, 1636.

That day the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the colony’s legislature, passed a law establishing formal militia companies in the colony.

These companies were made up of all adult males older than 16 and were expected to meet and train in military skills regularly.

In New York, the first citizen-soldiers were members of the Burgher Guard, organized by the Dutch East Indian Company in 1640 in what is now New York City, to help protect New Amsterdam from their English neighbors in Massachusetts and Virginia or from hostile natives.

After New Amsterdam became the English colony of New York in 1665, a militia modeled on the system used in Massachusetts and other English colonies was put in place.

Citizen Soldiers of the militia and National Guard have fought in all of America's wars from King Philips War against Native Americans in the New England Colonies in 1675 to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Today there are 11,000 members of the New York Army National Guard and 5,800 members of the New York Air National Guard.

Some notes from New York National Guard history include:

--New York gave the country the term National Guard for its militia forces when the 2nd Battalion, 11th Regiment of the New York Militia renamed themselves the National Guard to honor the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolutionary War who had commanded a force called the ""Guard de National"" in the early days of the French Revolution.

--The 1st Battalion, 69th Infantry Regiment was portrayed in the 1940 movie ""The Fighting 69th"" starring Jimmy Cagney and Pat O'Brien. The movie was based on the historic unit's service in World War I.

--The New York Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division was given its nickname ""The Rainbow Division"" during World War I by General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur, then a colonel, was charged with organizing a division of National Guard troops from across the country to deploy to France in 1917. He described the division as reaching across the country ""like a rainbow.""

--The band of the New York National Guard's 369th Infantry Regiment, an African-American unit originally formed as the 15th New York, is credited with introducing jazz music to Europe during World War I. The 369th became known as the Harlem Hell Fighters.

--The oldest Air National Guard unit in the nation is part of the New York Air National Guard. The 102nd Rescue Squadron of the 106th Rescue Wing traces its history back to the 1st Aero Company organized in the New York National Guard in 1908 as a balloon unit.

--The Soldiers of the New York National Guard's 105th Infantry Regiment faced the largest Japanese ""Banzai"" attack of the Second World War on 7 July 1944 on the Island of Saipan. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 105th Infantry had 650 men killed and wounded but killed more than 4,300 Japanese Soldiers. Three regimental Soldiers earned the Medal of Honor posthumously in that battle that day.

-The New York Air National Guard's 138th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, based at Syracuse, was one two Air National Guard units assigned to provide aircraft for the defense of the United States on March 1, 1953. Today the unit operates the MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft.

-The New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing flies the largest ski-equipped aircraft in the world, able to land on snow at the South Pole Station.

-The New York National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division headquarters and support units served in Iraq in 2005 and was the first National Guard division headquarters to deploy to a combat zone since the Korean War in 1953."

FORT STEWART, Ga. – The Savannah-based 1st Battalion, 118th Field Artillery Regiment “cased” their unit colors in Fort Stewart Dec. 12 in a symbolic ceremony before mobilizing overseas.

The 1-118th FAR’s upcoming planned deployment will support operations in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.

“We are incredibly proud of the Soldiers who have volunteered to tackle this challenging mission,” said Lt. Col Russell Dasher, 1-118th FAR battalion commander. “We are honored to serve with them all.”

The unit has prepared and developed leaders for this challenging mission for several years through individual weapon systems qualification and large-scale training exercises domestically and abroad. The learning curve will increase as Soldiers of the unit now work to become proficient with air defense artillery weapon systems.

“Over the coming 12 months, the 1-118th FAR will conduct in-depth training in counter rocket artillery mortar and counter unmanned aircraft systems,” said Sgt. Maj. Christopher Poole, 1-118th FAR battalion command sergeant major.

The Soldiers’ families and employers have supported them throughout the battery of training requirements and preparations.

“We thank our family, friends and employers for the overwhelming support we have received as we go forward to complete our mission,” said Poole.

Members of the 1-118th Field Artillery Regiment have answered the call to service as far as the late 1700s. They have activated in response to World War I, World War II and, in recent decades, multiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan.

FORT WAINWRIGHT, Alaska – Soldiers assigned to the Downed Aircraft Recovery Team within Delta Company, 1-52 General Support Aviation Battalion, recently assisted in the effort to recover a Coast Guard helicopter that crashed in a remote area.

The Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crashed on Read Island in southeastern Alaska during a search and rescue mission Nov. 13. The four crew members aboard were treated at a Seattle hospital and have since been released.

“Following the crash, the Coast Guard made a formal request for recovery assistance,” said Maj. Bryant Knef, operations officer for 1-52 GSAB. “The intent of the request was for the DART to provide a team to help develop a plan for the salvage of CG 6016 and assist with the disassembling and packaging of the aircraft for transport in a safe and efficient manner.”

A three-person Army team conducted a site survey Nov. 24-26 as the first step in the recovery operation. During the site survey, the Army team, in conjunction with the Coast Guard, determined the logistical feasibility and potential risks and hazards and developed a plan for recovering the aircraft.

Potential challenges for the recovery effort included tide level, weather, dense foliage, the aircraft condition, and the distant location of the crash site. The remoteness of the site—an uninhabited island approximately 21 nautical miles north of the port town of Petersburg and 80 miles east of Sitka—necessitated the involvement of numerous organizations. In addition to the Coast Guard and Army, the U.S. Forest Service, National Weather Service, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Petersburg Fire and Rescue, and independent contractors also contributed to the recovery effort.

After surveying the location of the crash, the Army team traveled to Coast Guard Air Station Sitka to analyze a fully mission capable MH-60T Jayhawk to help determine the difference between it and the UH-60L/M Blackhawks the Soldiers primarily work with.

“The site survey determined that the main fuselage of CG 6016 needed to be reoriented upright to load it onto the recovery vessel. It also confirmed the size of the team that was needed to conduct the recovery operation,” Knef said.

The recovery mission took place Dec. 3-9, with the bulk of the party consisting of nine DART personnel, led by 1st Lt. Caleb Kifer, DART officer in charge, and five Coast Guard personnel, led by Lt. Cmdr. Justin Neal, salvage officer.

Daily travel to and from the island consisted of a 1.5-hour boat ride each way via a contracted ferry service. The initial site preparation required the team set up a shelter for tools, equipment, and a dry space for the team to rest in and to clear the remaining brush and logs from the trees felled by the U.S. Forest Service to enable removal of the helicopter.

That dry space was critical for the team, given the prevailing weather conditions in the region.

“It was about 33 F and rained the whole time,” said Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Anderson, DART noncommissioned officer in charge.

After the site was prepared, it was necessary to disconnect the tail of the Jayhawk from the main fuselage. The team then shifted the aircraft upright using ratchet straps, chains, tow straps, and come-alongs.

In one of his daily reports to the 1-52 leadership, Kifer noted, “While rolling the fuselage, it was determined that a second tree had speared through the fuselage and was pinning it to the ground. That tree was cut, allowing the fuselage to be rolled upright.”

A contracted excavator was then brought to the island to lift the main fuselage and tail section onto a recovery vessel. Once the two primary sections were removed, the recovery team collected all remaining debris by hand and loaded it onto the vessel before departing the island mid-morning Dec. 8.

“Partnering with Delta Company, 1-52 GSAB’s Downed Aircraft Recovery Team for the salvage and recovery of our helicopter was a game-changer,” said Neal. “Their specialized skills, professionalism, and expertise turned what seemed like a daunting salvage operation into a well-executed success.”

According to Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Mike Salerno, the helicopter is en route to Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where investigators will further examine the airframe as part of their investigation of the incident."

WIESBADEN, Germany – After nearly a year working together, nine professionals from across Installation Management Command Europe celebrated their graduation from the region’s first Executive Leadership Development Program, also known as ELDP.

Delivering remarks at the ceremony, U.S. Army Garrison Italy’s Amy Cates, who served as the team leader, described when the group came together almost a year ago, “with wild dreams and imagination of what this ELDP program would bring,” adding, “It did not disappoint.

“I can’t recall a time in my life when I felt so supported in my career by people who were genuinely interested in me, and I know my peers feel the same,” Cates said.

The program comprised a wide variety of exercises and activities, including formal training, leadership development, activities, assignments, seminars, leader shadowing, exposure and inclusion in enterprise-wide events, such as briefings about Installation Status Reports and the Facility Investment Plan, said Tommy R. Mize, director, IMCOM-Europe.

“Ultimately, we wanted to make sure we’re developing a cadre of highly skilled employees that are ready for additional positions, and I’m talking at IMCOM – not just IMCOM-Europe but at IMCOM. My assessment is that we have done just that,” he said.

“You have exceeded all of our expectations,” Mize said to the group, while also recognizing and thanking so many of the graduates’ family members for traveling to attend. “When we decided to do this program in 2023 realizing we were at about a 70-75 percent solution, we came to the realization that the cohort will help us figure it out. And, boy have you all, in spades.”

Speaking for the group, Cates recalled professional highlights that included one-on-one sessions with deputy garrison commanders and IMCOM-Europe leadership; briefing Lt. Gen. Omar Jones, IMCOM commanding general; and being welcomed to participate in two Garrison Leader Working Groups.

Mize recognized and thanked three leaders of his staff who led the creation, launch and oversight of the first cohort: Wes Leisinger, chief of staff; Dr. Allen Cannon, workforce development specialist; and Chris Collins, assistant chief of staff, G-4, who named four things the cohort taught the IMCOM-Europe team.

“Look to the most unexpected places for inspiration … don’t be afraid to lean on each other … celebrate that unexpected learning opportunity … and always smile and look like you’re having fun,” Collins said.

The second cohort of the ELDP is scheduled to begin in early 2024, and the effectiveness and success of the first cohort has led to garrison commanders already preparing projects for the group to work on throughout the whole region, according to Mize."

Sgt. 1st Class Terysa King takes one for the team, as she answers questions from a specialist with a video camera. King, who is 21st Theater Sustainment Command’s Public Affairs operations noncommissioned officer, is infinitely more comfortable behind the camera than in front of it. But she agreed to the interview because it was a good training opportunity for her junior soldier, and her most recent mission made international headlines.

Describing how she ended up sharing pea soup and conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was a good plug for the profession she loves—U.S. Army public affairs.

King, who hails from Norfolk, Virginia, has bachelor’s degree in journalism and is currently working on a master’s degree in marketing. She began her Army career 15 years ago to pursue education and gain real-world experience.

“I originally joined the Army to pay for college,” said King. Growing up as a self-described “Navy brat” nurtured a passion for adventure, and she believed a career in the Army would also help her see the world. She has not been disappointed.

In addition to being stationed in various U.S. states, including Georgia, North Carolina and Maryland, King was deployed to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Her overseas assignments include Italy, Korea and Germany, and missions have taken her to Kenya, Botswana, Tanzania and multiple countries in Europe including Romania, Slovenia, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands.

She is currently stationed at 21st TSC headquarters in Kaiserslautern, Germany where she works with public affairs professionals from ally and partner countries, coordinating and supporting media events and coverage of joint exercises and missions. In October 2023, she worked with the German Bundeswehr to support an all-day capabilities demonstration highlighting interoperability between German and U.S. Soldiers for Scholz and German media. When it was time for lunch, the Bundeswehr asked King to “take a picture” with Scholz.

“I was not expecting to be asked to sit next to him,” said King. “Because as public affairs I'm working behind the scenes. I'm used to being behind the camera. So, when they told me, ‘You are going to have lunch with the German chancellor and take pictures,’ I was like, ‘Cool’.

“Then I sit down, and he comes around, and sits right next to me. And then I look up and there's all these cameras in front of me.”

King said the Chancellor sensed her surprise and put her at ease right away.

“In order to break the tension, he said, ’Just pretend they're not there’. That made everybody a little bit more comfortable. I can honestly say that it was one of the coolest things I've experienced so far being here and probably in my entire military career, because how often do you get the chance to sit with someone of that importance? To literally break bread with him and eat a traditional German meal with him. I can't think of many other vocations where you get that opportunity,” said King.

King’s softspoken nature is an asset in her work, putting interview subjects at ease and allowing her to document missions with minimum notice—ensuring Soldiers are focused on their mission and not distracted by her presence.

According to King, her mission, as a public affairs specialist, is to tell the Army story by showcasing her fellow Soldiers.

“It helps the world see the bigger picture of what we do,” said King. “And it's also a morale boost. When I take pictures of other Soldiers, and they're interacting with each other and our allies and our partners, I see them light up and it makes all the hard work that we do worth it. It is great seeing the interoperability between the U.S. Army and our partners.”

King said her decision to join the Army was the best decision she has ever made. She would tell anyone who is interested in joining the Army or pursuing a public affairs career to prepare to be challenged.

“You’ll be pushed out of your comfort zone,” said King. “But it’s definitely worth it.”

Making international headlines and being the subject of a Soldier spotlight was definitely out of King’s comfort zone. But consistent with her humble nature, she did what had to be done to tell this Army story."

WIESBADEN, Germany - They say the best things in life are free – and that was certainly true at the Wiesbaden Entertainment Center on Dec. 12.

Soldiers from units throughout U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden enjoyed a free pizza lunch, cake and bowling as part of the Family and MWR Soldier Appreciation Meal Sponsored by Serving Heroes.

“It’s a really great program,” said Holly Strout, Wiesbaden Family and MWR Commercial Sponsorship and Advertising Manager. “The Gary Sinise Foundation provides complete sponsorship of the Soldier Appreciation Meal.”

“It’s a great morale building event,” Strout said, adding that through the generous support of the Gary Sinise Foundation, they can serve up to 300 Soldiers each meal.

“If the need is ever greater, we can look into that,” she said.

“We learned about it through word of mouth,” said Pfc. Jaxon Gastiaburo, 228th Brigade Support Company, 2nd Multi Domain Task Force. “It’s very expensive out here and when you can get a free meal it’s like ‘Wow.’”

“I think it’s a cool program,” said Spc. Elyssa Edwards, 66th Military Intelligence Brigade, explaining that she became aware of it through email notification from her Command Sergeant Major and other channels.

“I heard about it from my BOSS representative. I came here because I heard there was free food,” said Cpl. Kniel Rivera, 66th MI Bde.

“The bowling is nice too,” said Pvt. 2 Jeniel Leslie, 228th BSC, 2nd MDTF.

Explaining that she would spread the word among her fellow service members, Spc. Celyness DeJesus, 2nd MDTF added, “We’re going to come here together next month. Next time we’ll definitely volunteer to help.”

“Holly brought the idea to us (BOSS) and said ‘I have this awesome idea for an event,’” said Spc. Kevin Alanis, BOSS President.

“I did it at Tyndall Air Force Base and then when I got to Korea,” said Strout, explaining that representatives from the Gary Sinise Foundation did everything possible to make the program a success.

Actor Gary Sinise has been a staunch supporter of Soldiers and their Families through his foundation, the Lt. Dan Band and other projects.

FORT LIBERTY, N.C. – Airborne Soldiers here executed low-velocity airdrop tests of a new remote controlled equipment transport system.

The Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate conducted various testing on the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport, to include a Simulated Airdrop Impact Test to ensure the system could withstand impact forces of hitting the ground after the low-velocity airdrops.

“The S-MET provides small, dismounted units the capability to generate power for organic electronic systems,” said Mr. Jacob Boll, an operations research systems analysist with Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate.

Upon successful completion of the Simulated Airdrop Impact Test, the S-MET underwent rigging procedures to prepare for low-velocity airdrop.

“S-MET reduces physical burdens while operating as a dispersed and decentralized force in austere environments for long periods. Testing targeted the evaluation of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the S-MET for low-velocity airdrop operations,” Boll said.

S-MET supports mobility requirements of Infantry Brigade Combat Teams and supports the Army’s vision to implement Robotic and Autonomous Systems capabilities with urgency to lessen risk to Soldiers during combat.

Multiple successful low-velocity airdrop iterations were completed and after each, an operational exercise consisting of various maneuver drills was conducted.

According to Data Collector Mr. Glen Nino at Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, test data and feedback collected inform Army leaders of the S-MET low-velocity airdrop operations so production decisions can be made.

Before airdrop operations took place, Soldiers were trained on the S-MET, which included overview of the vehicle's instrumentation and controls, as well as instruction on the tactical operation of the S-MET; a vehicle demonstration of its basic instrumentation, controls, and performance of various crew drills.

“The Soldiers were able to witness the S-MET’s capability to negotiate operationally relevant terrain profiles,” said Mr. James Cochran, a military test plans analyst with Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate.

“Any time Soldiers and their leaders get involved in operational testing,” said Shonda Strother, chief editor of Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, ”they have the opportunity to use, work with, and offer up their own suggestions on pieces of equipment that can impact development of systems that future Soldiers will use in combat.”

""Operational testing is the U.S. Army Operational Test Command’s opportunity to contribute to readiness; anything less compromises the Army's ability to provide for the forces that fight and win the Nation's wars,"" said Lt. Col. Derek Johnson, Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate test division chief.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Four former U.S. Army Soldiers recently received the Bronze Star Medal with “V” device, or BSM(V), for their valorous actions in Panama 34 years ago.

Previously awarded the Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM) following Operation Just Cause — a campaign to overthrow Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and restore the democratically elected government of Guillermo Endara in 1989 — the prior service military police officers received upgraded awards at the U.S. Army South holiday ball, Dec. 8, 2023.

“Tonight was just amazing,” exclaimed Kimberly Brodbeck, a former Army captain and one of the four BSM(V) recipients. “Originally, when Mike Russell and Robert Mackey reached out to me, I didn't want to pursue this at all. In my mind, it was done, and it was a long time ago. Then, [Army South] Command Sgt. Maj. [Ronald] Graves called me and told me about the upgrade, and I was in tears. It felt really good [to receive this award] tonight.”

Brodbeck, then 1st Lt. Kimberly Thompson and platoon leader with the 988th Military Police Company, was honored alongside her former company commander, Capt. Linda Bray and retired Lieutenant Colonels Mikel Russell and Robert Mackey, who led the 108th Military Police Company during the invasion.

Collectively, their actions ranged from attacking Panamanian Defense Forces’ (PDF) positions, defending crucial checkpoints, clearing fortified buildings, dodging sniper fire, being pinned down by enemy fire for days, and fighting enemy forces in close combat.

Russell’s display of heroism began when PDF combatants fired on his Soldiers' positions. He acted quickly and with disregard for personal safety to run across the street, alone and only armed with a pistol, to neutralize the threat. When he tried to return to the defended perimeter, an enemy in a multi-story building began firing on his position.

Mikel Russell (right) the Bronze Star Medal with “V” device at the Army South holiday ball in San Antonio, Texas, Dec. 8, 2023. Russell, the former company commander of the 108th Military Police Company, received the upgraded award for his heroic actions during Operation Just Cause in 1989. Russell was tasked with securing key government buildings of the enemy when his company came under intense sniper and light machine gun fire from surrounding residential buildings filled with both combatants and noncombatants. With little regard for personal safety and only armed with a pistol, Russell neutralized an enemy manning a machine gun, shot out a streetlight to incapacitate enemy visibility and returned to the defended perimeter under gunfire.

Since it was nighttime, Russell’s first sergeant yelled at him to shoot out the streetlight above him. He did so, eliminating the enemy’s ability to see him as he ran back across the street under enemy fire.

“I did it because I was mad that they were shooting at my Soldiers,” said Russell. “There was no time to be scared; it was just about protecting my guys.”

Russell said he wrote a letter to a U.S. senator to reconsider the ARCOM he and his fellow Soldiers received. Award recommendations are processed through the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, and the award upgrades were approved in November 2023.

The BSM, instituted on February 4, 1944, is presented to individuals who, while serving in any capacity within or alongside the United States Army after December 7, 1941, have demonstrated exceptional heroism or meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against an armed enemy or an opposing armed force.

The ""V"" device is affixed to decorations as a symbol of valor, representing acts of heroism beyond the ordinary during direct combat with an enemy of the United States. Such actions involve exposure to enemy hostilities and personal risk, showcasing extraordinary courage and dedication.

The BSM(V)s were not the only awards presented that night.

After all awards were distributed, something was missing, according to several of the BSM recipients. While grateful to be recognized, Russell shared that there are other fellow service members who also deserve to be honored.

“There are three Soldiers out there that we need to find so we can get their awards upgraded because they deserve BSMs for their actions,” he said. “My hope is that the Army publicizes this, these three Soldiers read this, and we find them to upgrade their awards. For me, that would be the greatest reward.”"

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Camp Zama’s Army team defeated the Navy team from Naval Air Facility Atsugi 28-13 in their annual flag football game Saturday at Zama Middle High School’s Trojan Field here.

Their victory came on the same day — Eastern Standard Time — that Army defeated Navy for the second straight year in the longstanding college rivalry match-up, held this year in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

The Camp Zama players formed a circle on the field to receive the winner’s trophy from Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan, who congratulated both teams on the good, friendly competition.

Lenworth Lennon, co-captain of the Army team, said the game was fun and that their neighboring Navy rivals made for some formidable opposition.

“It was a hard-fought battle,” said Lennon, assigned to the 311th Military Intelligence Battalion. “Those guys played a tough game.”

The Army team came together just as the installation’s intramural flag football tournament was wrapping up. Assembled from players from many different units, the team did not have the chance to practice as a group before Saturday’s game. Lennon thought this factor might have made cohesion a challenge, but the team was able to come together quickly — a feat he and the other players compared to the fast camaraderie Soldiers forge in basic training.

Christopher Dilidili, also assigned to 311th, attributed the Army win to the fact that they started strong in the first half and kept that momentum going, and because each player was well-suited for his or her position.

“We definitely had good preparation today before the game,” Dilidili said. “We did a god job with talent management.”

Like his teammates, Dilidili said the Navy players’ athleticism made for a challenging game. Beyond the competition it provides, the annual match-up also allows the communities of both services the chance to come together.

“It’s awesome to have a friendly match [like this] every year because it helps the Army engage with the Navy and remind both of us that we have a sister branch close by,” Dilidili said. “And the game also brings family, friends and the community together.”"

Kaiserslautern, Germany - The 6966th Transportation Truck Terminal held an award and farewell ceremony on Dec. 11, 2023, at the Clock Tower Cafe, Kleber Kaserne. During the ceremony, 13 local national employees were presented with Length of Service certificates representing over 420 years of dedicated and professional service to the U.S. Army. Two drivers were also recognized for accident-free driving, one being recognized for 500,000 miles and one for 750,000 miles.

Operational since 1953, the 6966th TTT, part of the Theater Logistics Support Center - Europe and Africa, employs 265 personnel and has been working seamlessly with the U.S. Army to transport and deliver any of the Army’s needs. The unit is responsible for transporting mail, general cargo, HAZMAT, heavy equipment, and handle tow missions. Their missions take them throughout most of Europe and to locations as far as Africa.

According to Helmut Kraemer, 6966th TTT superintendent, it’s important for their workforce to be recognized for their dedicated service to the U.S. Army. “We’re proud to have these guys in my unit,” said Kramer.

As head of the overall operations, Kraemer takes pride in his employees’ success and outstanding safety record. Their civilian support group has the lowest accident rate in the Army, with an accident rate of 0.29 percent per 1 million miles driven.

“It’s very important to recognize their efforts on every mission, whether it is a local run or long distances that take them cross-border, especially during high OPTEMPO, and we have to publicly appreciate them for their effort to the unit and the mission.” said Kraemer.

Of 265 employees, approximately 165 are professional and cross-trained drivers who have a combined average of 3.7 million miles during the past three years. Their mission is to support military exercises, deployment operations, and humanitarian aid support with a tailored vehicle fleet ranging from small cargo vans and 40-ton trucks to heavy equipment transporters.

“The everyday performance of a vehicle operator is not an easy task considering the traffic density in Europe,” said Eckhart Rank, motor transportation supervisor. “Recognizing the work of a vehicle operator is essential for their motivation and the unit's reputation.”

Recognizing the professionalism and skills of the 6966th's members is important for the unit's morale and the younger employees’ plans for the future, knowing that they will also receive recognition for jobs well done.

""Every human being needs some recognition, right,” said Stefan Keller, motor vehicle operator. “I’m glad we started to celebrate the anniversaries again. It allows us to get some recognition from our supervisors and previously it had been lost in the past a bit, so I'm very glad it’s started again.”

As general manager of Theater Logistics Support Center - Europe and Africa, Helmut Haufe is honored to recognize his employees for their hard work and dedication. “It makes me extremely proud to see my employees being recognized for excellence over a span of five up to 45 years of service,” said Haufe. “It says a lot about the organization and the U.S. Army as an employer. It obviously is an indication that it works for both sides, otherwise, it would not have lasted as long as it has.”"

VALENCIA, Spain – Portuguese Army Maj. Gen. Joao Boga Ribeiro received the U.S. Legion of Merit medal from U.S. Army Col. Romeo Macalintal during a ceremony at NATO Rapid Deployable Corps – Spain headquarters here Nov. 17.

Boga Ribeiro received the award from the United States for his service as the deputy commanding general of NRDC-Spain from February 2021 to August 2023.

The award was signed by the U.S. secretary of defense on behalf of the U.S. president and awarded by Macalintal as the United States’ senior national representative at the corps headquarters, one of nine multinational Army corps in the NATO force structure.

“General Boga Ribeiro's superb leadership and visionary military acumen led to the certification of NRDC-Spain as the Standby Warfighting Corps headquarters for NATO in 2022,” said Macalintal. “He ensured the critical interoperability of the NATO allies and had a profoundly positive influence in achieving significant collective objectives.”

“His sage advice to the commander and mentorship of the staff greatly contributed to the training and readiness of NRDC­-Spain to counter threats to regional security, leading to a successful Combat Readiness Evaluation in December 2021,” said Macalintal. “General Boga Ribeiro also led the observations and lessons learned project to identify key tactical, operational, and strategic developments observed during the current war of aggression on NATO’s eastern flank.”

NRDC-Spain is the international part of the Spanish High Readiness Land Military Staff and represents Spain’s primary commitment to the NATO Force Structure.

Currently about 400 military personnel from Czechia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain work at the NRDC-Spain headquarters.

Col. Jerzy Zubr, the former U.S. senior national representative at NRDC-Spain, recommended Boga Ribeiro for the award and was available to attend the ceremony.

After the ceremony, Zubr said “maintaining close relationships with our NATO allies is a cornerstone of our national security strategy and helps deter potential adversaries and assure allies of the United States' commitment to NATO's collective defense.”

PRESIDIO OF MONTEREY, Calif. (Dec. 12, 2023) — The Presidio of Monterey bid farewell to Command Sgt. Maj. Joseph W. Traylor during a retirement ceremony at the Weckerling Center today. In front of Traylor’s family, friends and a garrison workforce that filled the Weckerling Center ballroom, the ceremony marked the culmination of a distinguished 31-year career.

Presiding over the ceremony was U.S. Army, Presidio of Monterey Garrison Commander, Col. Sam Kline. Kline offered his admiration and recounted how Traylor’s three decades of service spanned five states, five countries and included 69 awards and decorations.

“A lifetime of service cannot be simply described by numbers, but better illustrated by the impact on those brothers and sisters with whom he has served. Reflecting on your career, we acknowledge the sacrifices made and the challenges faced,” Kline said.

During the ceremony, Kline awarded Traylor the Legion of Merit, his Certificate of Retirement and other prestigious honors and tokens of appreciation celebrating his dedicated service.

In addition, Kline honored Traylor’s mother, Mrs. Daylinda Pace, with a Certificate of Appreciation and thanked her for her enduring support. All told, Pace’s three sons have served a combined 68 years of military service to include eight combat deployments and seven operational deployments.

“Not only have you played an important role in Joe’s journey, but in supporting the defense of our nation with all three of your Army sons through the last three decades of peace and war. Your strength and sacrifices have undoubtedly shaped the character of the individual we honor today.”

A native of East Alton and Wood River, Illinois, Traylor began his Army career in 1992, joining the Illinois Army National Guard as a Motor Transport Operator before transitioning to the regular Army as a Ground Surveillance Systems Operator in 1994. In 2005, Traylor found his calling in the Army as an Intelligence Analyst, the career field where he spent most of his career. His path through the ranks included a variety of roles from overseeing intelligence operations to the mentoring of Iraqi Army personnel. His assignments took him all over the world to include Korea, Italy, Germany, Afghanistan and Iraq.

In his final speech as an active-duty soldier, Traylor offered his deep gratitude to all those who have supported him.

“As I stand here on the cusp of retirement, I am filled with a myriad of emotions — joy, a sense of pride and accomplishment, nostalgia and a touch of apprehension for the unknowns that lie ahead,” said Traylor, before offering the audience some parting advice.

“The days can be long, but the years are unbelievably short. Every one of us can make a positive and lasting impact in other people’s lives if we care. Help others around you when you can, smile often and be thankful.”

The ceremony concluded with a reading by Chaplain (Capt.) Joseph McCall of the traditional poem “The Watch,” followed by the playing of “The Army Song” and “Old Soldiers Never Die.” A full Weckerling Center ballroom stood in celebration of Traylor and his honorable career.

Traylor will retire to Tampa Bay, Florida where he intends to continue working in the private industry and serving as a volunteer helping veterans in need."

CHICAGO – National Hockey League’s Chicago Blackhawks honored U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Maribel Meraz, assigned to the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, during a home game versus the St. Louis Blues at the United Center, December 9, 2023.

Meraz received the honor before the National Anthem and again during the second period of the game, recognizing her 16 years of service in the U.S. Army Reserve.

Meraz, a Chicago native, who grew up in in the communities of Hermosa and Humboldt Park, was given a standing ovation from thousands of spectators during her recognition at the stadium.

“It was my first Blackhawk game! To hear Blackhawk fans cheer and clap was a tremendous experience!” exclaimed Meraz.

She enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve at the age of 17 in January 2008. She then completed Advanced Individual Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, becoming qualified as a Human Resources Specialist.

In 2011, Meraz served on a 10-month deployment with the 847th Postal Detachment, to Forward Operating Base Kalsu, Iraq, 20 miles south of Baghdad in support of Operation New Dawn. Meraz’ responsibilities included postal operations and managing civilian contractors working with them.

She deployed again in 2013 to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Meraz was assigned to the Joint Military Mail Terminal, where she inspected suspicious packages and searched for contraband. Shortly after, she was reassigned to Qatar, to assist with postal activities at Al-Udeid Air Base and As Sayliyah Army Base.

Following the recognition, Meraz further reflected on her service to the Nation.

“Being a Soldier in the Army Reserve has allowed me to travel to different states and countries. I have had the opportunity to meet all kinds of people. When I was deployed to Iraq, the Ugandan Army was also there. When I would go into the chow hall, they would teach me phrases in Swahili,” said Meraz. “Serving in the Army Reserve has allowed me to grow as a person and develop many skills, most of all patience.”

Meraz’ awards include two Army Commendation Medals, and the Iraq Campaign Medal with campaign star, among other awards throughout her years of service.

ARLINGTON, Va. – Anticipation ran high as Soldiers assigned to the National Guard’s Professional Education Center eagerly awaited the results of the National Guard Bureau’s 2023 Innovation Competition, held at the Army National Guard Readiness Center on Dec. 6, 2023.

“Being able to present our ideas in front of National Guard leaders was the highlight of this experience,” said Sgt. 1st Class Victor Marquez, an instructor and leader at PEC's Sustainment, Installations and Environmental Battalion. “My team and I demonstrated exceptional effort to reach this stage.”

Out of 32 total submissions from across the nation, the team got third place. They see this as an opportunity to refine their product and pitch for a second competition scheduled later this year, said Maj. Jeremy Bouillion, an instructor assigned to the Strategy and Leader Development Institute at PEC.

The journey to the finals involved collaborative efforts from several organizations at PEC. The process commenced with the first round open to all 54 states and territories. Participants submitted an information paper and video showcasing how their proposed innovation could address a specific organizational challenge.

After the first round of submissions, a panel narrowed down the entries to 16 teams, advancing them to the semi-final round. In the semi-finals, teams were required to enhance their information paper and video.

Ultimately, four teams were chosen to progress to the final round, where they had to present their submission with a five-minute pitch. Following the pitch, teams had to face a panel of three judges led by Gen. Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau.

“Reaching the finals presented a significant challenge,” said Bouillion. “Our major task was to identify and engage the right stakeholders who could provide the expertise needed to ensure a robust product presentation.”

PEC, located at Camp Robinson, in North Little Rock, Arkansas, serves as the premier learning institute for the National Guard. Its mission is to enhance the readiness of the National Guard’s full-time staff, with a crucial focus on providing innovative teaching methods. The future of education at PEC lies in virtual reality, according to the team.

“Virtual reality offers students immersive learning experiences, enhancing comprehension and retention of complex concepts,” explained Marquez. “It provides interactive simulations for practical training that is relevant to the operational environment.”

Bouillion led as the project manager and carefully selected subject matter experts for the competition. Colin Trachte, a software developer, took the lead in developing the VR software showcased to the judges, while Ricky Veal, the chief of training development, demonstrated the adaptability of VR across various classes on the PEC campus.

Marquez and Sgt. 1st Class Bryant Laning, an ordnance training developer, spearheaded the vision of the future integration of this technology into one of their existing courses and illustrated its potential through a storyboard for the video submission. With support from the PEC public affairs and visual information offices, the team's ideas came to life in a three-minute video.

The Shark Tank-style pitch left the team nervous, but their confidence in their groundbreaking idea drove them to dedicate countless days to rehearsing for this moment. After the team's pitch, the final decision was in the hands of the judges. The PEC team secured a commendable third place in the finals.

“We consider this a team achievement,” said Bouillion. “We successfully ignited an innovative culture within our organization. Maintaining this momentum is crucial as we strive to accomplish our organizational goals for the future.”"

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Central Arkansas families are smiling a little brighter this holiday season after more than 350 Arkansas National Guardsmen returned Dec. 9 from a nine-month deployment to Southwest Asia.

The Guardsmen, assigned to 2-153 Infantry Battalion, 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, were deployed to support Operation Spartan Shield, an operation that builds partner capacity in the region to promote regional self-reliance and increase security among partner nations.

“We’re excited to have these Guardsmen back home in time for the holidays,” said Maj. Gen. Jonathan Stubbs, Arkansas adjutant general. “They’ve been away from their families and employers doing our nation’s vital business of helping keep the region secure and safe. I’m immensely proud of their service and sacrifice for our state and nation, and I know Arkansans are, too.”

The Guardsmen departed Arkansas Feb. 5 for their mobilization station at Fort Bliss, Texas. From there, they deployed to Southwest Asia, where they served as a security force by providing convoy and base security of U.S. elements and assets friendly to the United States. Including their train-up period, the Guardsmen were away from their families for nearly one year.

On their return trip home, the Guardsmen arrived at their demobilization station at Fort Bliss Nov. 28. They departed El Paso, Texas, and landed in Little Rock, to be reunited with their loved ones.

Families filled half an aircraft hangar at Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport as they waited for their service members to return home. After a short wait, the hangar doors opened and in marched their loved ones as families cheered. As soon as the Soldiers were dismissed from the formation, families and Guardsmen sought out their loved ones.

Joyann Bearden of Searcy said she kept in touch with her husband, Capt. Samuel Bearden, via “phone, texting, video chatting and calling as often as possible.”

To help keep their three children engaged she built a deployment wall in their home.

“We had a deployment wall where we showed a map for the kids to keep up with where their daddy was. We put pictures up and any pictures Sam could send me,” she said.

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – U.S. Army Garrison Japan leaders announced plans for a new workforce action team and answered questions during a town hall at Kizuna Hall here Dec. 6.

The garrison’s new Quality of Life Action Team will include representatives chosen from each directorate who will meet to help drive continuous workplace improvement for the garrison team.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of USAG Japan, said the initiative will benefit the entire organization.

“There are good ideas and good solutions all across the team,” he said of the garrison. “And I want to know and understand and make sure we are using the best ideas from everyone’s different perspectives.”

Hunter, who was joined by Command Sgt. Maj. David A. Rio, the garrison senior enlisted leader, and Jenifer L. Peterson, the deputy garrison commander, said garrison employees work diligently year-round to support the community.

“Thank you for doing that for our community,” he said, “and thank you for what you will do for our own team inside the garrison to help us get stronger and get better in everything that we do.”

Ernestine Robinson, Equal Employment Opportunity manager and adviser for the garrison’s Climate Action Team, briefed recent garrison accomplishments in the past two years, including the creation of leadership training videos for supervisors and employees, several brown bag lunches with the commander, and a reasonable accommodation workshop for supervisors and managers.

A commander’s box was also placed on the second floor of Building 102 to allow anyone to leave comments for leadership.

Hunter said he checks the box just about every time he walks by it.

At least five comments have been left in the box since it was installed in the summer and based on the issue that is brought up, the colonel will directly address the comment.

“I appreciate everyone’s use of that,” he said, “and we would love to receive additional feedback.”

Hunter answered another question on if or when another garrison organizational day will take place. After taking a quick poll from the audience, who were mostly agreeable to it, he asked his staff to look at holding one.

“It’s an opportunity for us to gather as a team,” he said. “We’re all doing so many different things, so here we can get together and celebrate the organization in a unique and slightly different way.”

Hunter also highlighted U.S. Army Installation Management Command’s Service Culture Campaign, saying that dignity and respect are part of the foundation of the garrison’s culture.

“Our workforce is one that is built off of diversity coming from many different perspectives and understanding and experience,” he said, “but is drawn together through the inclusion of our entire team.”

Among the tenets in the culture campaign, Hunter touched on developing every employee to be a leader as a way to strengthen the entire workforce.

“Leader development and talent management is not based off of an individual person as a leader for a position as a leader,” he said. “And the reason I say that is because leaders come from all levels, and you all have a role at some point in time in which [you] may be in a position to lead an activity or an organization.”

He encouraged employees to complete an individual development plan and participate in civilian education programs, developmental assignments, career program training that focuses on technical competencies, and command training that may provide clarity on organizational activities.

“My challenge to all of our supervisors” he said, “is to think about some of those opportunities and then ask yourself within your directorate or your section how you can take advantage of those and how you can develop the talent of each of your individual employees.”

In closing, Hunter expressed gratitude for the valuable input he has already received from the workforce on how to improve the organization.

“What I’m committed to and excited about is, as a team, finding ways in which we think we want to change and develop,” he said. “But that’s something that we’re going to do as a team … [to] constantly strengthen and build ourselves.”

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – More than 160 local community leaders and Camp Zama personnel came together for U.S. Army Garrison Japan’s holiday reception here Friday evening.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of USAG Japan, and the rest of the command team greeted guests as they arrived inside the Camp Zama Community Club ballroom for the annual event.

“There is nothing better than to be able to meet together face-to-face and to share in one another’s friendships,” he later told the crowd. “And truly, that is one of my deepest hopes is that we can all build friendships and have a wonderful partnership.”

Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members as well as local government and academic officials joined Soldiers, Army civilians and family members for the festive occasion.

The reception, which had a dinner, group photos with Santa Claus and music by the U.S. Army Japan band, highlighted the many connections between the installation and its surrounding community.

Throughout the evening, a photo slideshow and several poster boards in the ballroom displayed various community engagement activities in which USAG Japan personnel participated with their Japanese counterparts.

Those events included office calls, cleanups, local festivals, professional military engagements and open-post events, such as the Bon Odori and Independence Day celebrations that drew tens of thousands of people to Camp Zama.

“These partnerships and these friendships mean so very much and are an important representation of our deep Japan-America alliance, which is even more important now than ever,” Hunter said.

The colonel also encouraged the attendees to reflect on the year and to continue to build on past efforts to make the alliance even stronger.

“I look forward to this new year and all the friendships and the good memories that we will make,” he said, “and I wish you all a Happy New Year in 2024.”

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Nearly 50 U.S. and Japanese high school students participated together in an event here meant to foster communication and promote the exchange of ideas among the two communities.

Known as the Student Educational Exchange and Dialogue, or SEED, the event brought together students from Zama Middle High School those from the neighboring cities of Zama and Sagamihara Dec. 2 and 3 at the ZMHS campus.

Sonya Gates, community superintendent for the DoDEA Pacific East District, said SEED is a cultural exchange meant to enhance the development of the U.S. and Japanese students in a variety of ways.

“I hope [this event allows] the students to have a lot of fun, make some friends they can cherish, and gain a better sense of understanding and appreciation for each other’s cultures and beliefs,” Gates said.

The host students at ZMHS provided their Japanese guests with a tour of their campus. Elsewhere during the two-day event, the students formed teams for games and activities such as collaborating to create a mascot character.

Logan Jackson, a junior at ZMHS and a first-time participant in SEED, said the team-building activities with their Japanese guests taught him a lot about the differences and similarities between their two cultures and led to him forming friendships with them. He recommended students who have never participated to join the event next year.

“It was a great way to interact with the Japanese students and get involved a little bit more in their culture,” Jackson said. “I hope we can have [this] event at a Japanese school sometime.”

Asaki Noda, a second-year high school student from Sagamihara City, had so much fun at the event last year that she jumped at the chance to participate again. This year she said she learned the importance of being proactive with her ideas and input when doing a group project.

“By interacting with others my age, I got to know more about the American students’ way of thinking and learn things I didn’t know before,” Noda said. “I felt like I was able to expand my worldview through my participation in this program.”

Feedback like that from Noda and other students reinforced that the SEED event met its intent, said Natasha Anderson, assistant principal at ZMHS. Most of the students expressed their hope to learn more about Japanese culture, and that their guests would likewise gain a better understanding of the academic and social life of American teens.

“[The students] want to basically show that they can work all together regardless of their nationality, which speaks volumes,” Anderson said. “This is an opportunity for students of different cultures to interact socially and understand [those] differences and similarities while building communication and team-building skills.”"

During his remarks, Col. Scott Horrigan, commander of USAG Italy, said that Dyon was invaluable to him over the last several months.

“He has offered forthright advice and valuable insights, helping to provide me with a better understanding of the environment and the challenges we face,” Horrigan said.

PANZER-KASERNE, Germany - The 21st Theater Sustainment Command conducted the Unit Safety Officer Course at Panzer Kaserne for the first time this past November 14-16, 2023, allowing 16 Team 21 USOs to meet all regulatory requirements without having to spend time and expense traveling to receive instruction. In the past, the command has had to send students to the 7th Army Training Command in Vilseck to ensure compliance.

In accordance with AR 385-10, the Unit Safety Officer is a spokesperson who cooperates with leaders and supervisors at all levels within the organization to assist the commander in executing the Army Safety and Occupational Health Program.

“Safety is our top priority, and its essential that we reinforce its significance throughout the formation process,” said Stefanie Diaz, command tactical safety manager, 21st TSC. ""The USOC [Unit Safety Officer Course] training plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. As a part of our commitment to safety, we must acknowledge that each one of us, from the highest levels of leadership down to the newest team members, has a role to play.”

The primary objective of the Unit Safety Officer and the Army Safety Program is to effectively accomplish the mission while avoiding losses that negatively impact readiness. USOs advise the commander and participate in the planning, preparation, execution, and after-action reviews of missions. This ensures that hazards are identified, assessed, and controls are placed and addressed by the commander.

“From a Leader’s perspective, it’s imperative that we lead by example,” said Col. Ernest Lane, chief of staff, 21st TSC. “By completing this training and actively promoting its value, we demonstrate our unwavering dedication to safety and the importance of each one of us as a member of Team 21.”

Lane added that safety is not only a leader’s responsibility, but a shared responsibility for all members.

In fiscal year 2023, the 21st TSC Safety Office invested in certifying a member of its team to be able to instruct the USO course locally or travel to remote locations to complete required training for all 21st TSC and subordinate command members to meet regulatory requirements.

With the addition of a safety officer certified to conduct the USOC training, the 21st TSC and all subordinate units can receive the training without the constraints of having to send students to Vilseck in order to meet mission requirements."

SETUBAL, Portugal - The 21st Theater Sustainment Command supported the first-ever U.S. Army operation at the Port of Setubal, Portugal on December 7, 2023. The port operation was a collaboration between the 21st TSC, 598th Transportation Brigade (Surface Deployment and Distribution Command), U.S. Mission to Portugal, and the Portuguese military and port authority.

“The strategic importance behind getting this port in Portugal is, it is the furthest west that we’ve ever operated coming in or out of Europe,” said Col. Robert Kellam, commander, 598th Transportation Brigade. “We were able to effectively connect the furthest point in eastern Estonia to the furthest west port in Portugal and connect all the transportation nodes from here to there. So strategically, this is a momentous occasion for the 21st TSC and I think for EUCOM [United States European Command] as well.”

The mission was a year-long project and a “proof of concept” that enhances the capabilities of the 21st TSC, United States Army Europe and Africa, and Army Sustainment as a whole, across the European Theater.

“We have a long-standing relationship in many areas, the military-to-military relationship being one of the most important,” said Doug Koneff, deputy chief of mission, U.S. Mission to Portugal. “We want to continue working together, as we have been for a long time, to improve our interoperability and improve our capabilities, and this exercise that’s going on right now is such a great example of that.”

The United States and Portugal have a long-standing partnership rooted in shared history. Both countries were a part of the 12 founding signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and have continued to build upon that partnership.

“We have a very strong defense cooperation relationship that spans decades and decades, so exercises like this go very far to really prove what we already knew,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Jennifer Whetstone, Defense Attaché, U.S. Mission to Portugal. “We already know that we have a strong relationship, but we are continually striving to improve our interoperability and strengthen the alliance as a whole.”

The mission validated the port through the redeployment of equipment belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team “Bastogne”, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). Approximately 500 pieces of equipment were craned onto the vessel Ocean Grand to be shipped back to their home station of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

“We initially moved all of our equipment into Poland with the help of the 21st TSC and then eventually on to Estonia, and now we’re standing in Portugal, having moved our equipment from Estonia to Portugal,” said Maj. Christopher Cummings, executive officer, 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). “So, it's a lot of long, difficult, and complex movements and is a fairly historic opportunity for us to test out a new port, similar to what our brigade has done on its first return to Europe since World War II.”

With the success of the initial mission, the intent is to continue to build and strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and Portugal.

“Honestly, it's like we’ve done this many, many times,” said Kellam. “The coordination and relationships that we’ve established here, I think is going to be lasting and it’s been really amazing and very impressive.”

SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Soldiers from 2nd Cavalry Regiment, with support from other U.S. units and the host nation’s military, achieved rapid deployment to the training area and conducted live-fire scenarios with Stryker armored vehicles Dec. 1-10, 2023, at Krivolak Training Area, North Macedonia.

The Army of the Republic of North Macedonia hosted Brave Partner, while U.S. Army Europe and Africa led the “short notice action planning” exercise to reinforce military readiness and interoperability in a realistic training environment and to ensure U.S. forces are ready to respond quickly to support stability in the Balkans.

“The most important thing is the demonstration of the relationship between the United States and North Macedonia,” said Angela Aggeler, U.S. Ambassador to North Macedonia. “Exercises like this one, bringing in beautiful equipment like this — state of the art — really demonstrates to both of our countries, and frankly to the world and our NATO allies, how strong this relationship is, and we are there to support each other.”

The ambassador visited KTA, meeting with the Minister of Defense of the Republic of North Macedonia, Slavjanka Petrovska, and general officers from both nations’ armies to observe Brave Partner live-fire training on Dec. 7.

However, before live-fire training could take place, 2nd Squadron had to successfully complete expeditionary deployment training. Maj. Luke King, the 2nd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment operations officer, explained how important it was to exercise the processes of getting the soldiers and equipment to the mission, and then to set the conditions for day and night squad live-fire.

“Exercising those systems and validating those processes to make sure that we can deliver combat-ready troops to the training area, or to whatever mission we have, that was the first part,” said King. “They’ve gone through squad blank iterations and then squad live-fire iterations both day and night. And the goodness there is that it gives Soldiers confidence in their weapons systems.”

He explained that the exercise gave company and squad leaders the ability to synchronize fire and maneuver with all their available weapons systems. He then explained the Stryker’s advantages, to include weapons systems that can be mounted to the vehicle.

The Stryker has several configurations, including an infantry carrier vehicle with a mounted remotely controlled weapons station capable of mounting a .50 caliber machine gun or a MK19 grenade launcher. They can fire 120 mm mortars from the back of the vehicle instead of setting up mortars from the ground, which King explained is a unique and awesome capability. Soldiers can fire those weapons and search and traverse from inside the vehicle with a screen that provides imagery.

“Then, the Dragoon has the 30 mm cannon, which we all love, and then a 7.62 coax as well, so you’re not just limited to that one weapons system,” said King. “Also, all fired from inside the vehicle, protecting the gunner.”

In addition to weapons used with the Strykers, each squad had a variety of weapons they fired while dismounted from their vehicles, including the M240 machine gun and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. They used their designated marksman to provide precision fire from a distance with the M110 A1 rifle, and they provided indirect fire with the M320 grenade launchers.

King said that 2CR gained in readiness and lethality due to Brave Partner. They’d conducted expeditionary deployments two previous times within the last several months, so they were confident and quick moving into North Macedonia.

""I can’t emphasize enough how awesome of a training area Krivolak is,” said King. “It was just powerful to feel the full might of every headquarters at echelons above us all the way up to USAREUR-AF align the stars for us to get here so quickly. Whatever we asked for, we got. And we got it in a very rapid fashion, and it’s exactly what we wanted. So, it built a lot of our confidence.”

Sgt. Joshua Briggs, a 2CR infantryman and squad leader, adamantly agreed with King’s praise of KTA and the diverse terrain.

“The terrain out here is very difficult to traverse,” said Briggs. “It’s hilly and rocky. It allows for more intense and realistic training, like where these soldiers might operate in the future.”

Briggs said wet and muddy conditions give Soldiers a chance to train while it’s more difficult to keep steady footing, or to avoid the weapons’ exposure to the elements. The training value is higher because they can still effectively prepare and solve objectives in such conditions, simulating actual combat.

Another 2CR soldier, Pfc. Alexander Dudzenski, said Brave Partner was his first live-fire exercise. He enjoyed training despite the harsh environment and weather, learning something new with every range iteration and seeing the host nation soldiers build a working relationship with U.S. Soldiers.

“I never thought in my life that I’d be able to come and see these countries,” said Dudzenski. “I think it’s cooler to do it somewhere I’ve never been before, and seeing people from different militaries watching us, I find fascinating.”

Briggs agreed, saying it’s always a privilege to work with NATO partners, especially when it’s the first time for him in a country, where his squad can share new ideas to refine and improve their craft.

“Host nation soldiers have been extremely polite and helpful,” Briggs said. “They’ll ask us questions. It allows us to explain our profession as well as our craft and take pride in our work and see how other people see it.”

King agreed that 2CR learned much from working with the host nation.

“The Army of the Republic of North Macedonia has been very accommodating,” said King. “Understanding how they conduct training and telling them how we conduct our own training in preparation for their army to receive their Strykers has been very useful because we also learn from them. Some of the questions they ask force us to be a bit more introspective. We’re not only helping them, but we’re helping ourselves too.”"

GRAFENWOEHR, Germany – U.S. soldiers and NATO partners participated in the European Best Medic Competition (EBMC) here Dec. 4 to 8, 2023.

The European Best Medic Competition tests competencies, skills, and readiness of European theater medics so they can respond more effectively and efficiently, and the highest winners of U.S. forces are selected to represent the European region at the Army Best Medic Competition in Fort Liberty, North Carolina.

EBMC featured multiple exercises such as: Tactical Combat Casualty Care, Polish Marksmanship Badge, night land navigation, 18-mile Norwegian Ruck March and stress shoot. Each exercise simulated a combat environment, both physically and mentally preparing competitors to react and perform in stressful surroundings.

EBMC exercises consisted of not only medical tasks but also basic soldier capabilities, like returning fire, securing casualties and providing tactical field care. A mystery event is practiced annually to keep competitors on their toes. This year the mystery event was a K9 casualty dog event, where competitors had to provide tactical field care to a TacMed Simulation Canine Medical Trainer within a time limit.

“The candidates did an 18-mile ruck march that led into a stress shoot, wearing them down and seeing if they were still able to complete their range qualification,” said U.S. Army Sgt. Jacob Rodriguez, assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade. “They’re cold, they're tired, and they're hungry then immediately come over here and then do a range qualification. It's just more of a mental game at that point, keeping them pushing forward.”

Competitors worked individually and as teams to test their capabilities and readiness to complete tasks.

EBMC allowed the competitors to learn and train on different skill sets that will significantly improve them on individual and team-based tasks, crucial qualities for military medics working in dynamic and high-pressure situations.

“The challenge does not stop here, today or even with the Army Best Medic Competition. As you return to your home station and back to your soldiers and train them to sustain lethality during Large Scale Combat Operation,” said Sgt. Maj. Christinean Johnson with the Army Medical Center of Excellence. “Think about what you endured, the challenges you faced and the mental toughness that it took to execute your tasks in that environment. Build the training and sustainment that produces the best medic for the team.”

U.S. soldiers were participating in the competition alongside NATO partners, promoting interoperability and readiness that is crucial for multinational military operations. Recognizing and learning the differences in medical practices among different nations' combat medics can enhance the overall capabilities of the combined forces.

“With the other NATO forces, they bring a different expertise because we have people that are like combat medics with 10 years of experience and a surgeon, he gave a different insight and input to the medics,” said Spc. George Rivera, assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division. “I think it's really good, and it brings the morale up, communicating with the other soldiers.”

The EBMC prepared army medics and served as a crucible for promoting collaboration, interoperability, and continuous improvement within the military medical community, highlighting the importance of readiness and having highly capable medical personnel to support the world's most potent and lethal army.

“The world's most powerful and lethal army must have the world's best medical instrument of power supporting them and that medical instrument of power is army medicine,” said Brig. Gen. Roger Giraud, assigned to the Medical Readiness Command, Europe."

ARLINGTON, Va. - The 2023 National Guard Bureau Innovation Challenge showcased the inventive prowess of Guard members nationwide Dec. 7 at the Herbert R. Temple Jr. Army National Guard Readiness Center. Among the concepts featured: a virtual reality application by the Arkansas National Guard, a South Carolina Army National Guard initiative for robotic automation of personnel data, and a Michigan National Guard medical system revolutionizing casualty care in austere environments.

“This is an opportunity for you to show us how we can become a better organization,” said Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, who hosted the event. “As I looked through the topics that each of you are presenting today, many of them are unique to the Guard but can also have applicability to the entire Joint Force.”

Ultimately, the Arizona Army National Guard clinched top honors at the competition with its pioneering idea — an exportable live-fire range.

“We’re pleasantly surprised and very honored,” said Army Lt. Col. Loong Lee, the state training officer for the Arizona National Guard’s Joint Force Headquarters.

The team bested the three other finalists — all with solutions that support one of Hokanson’s key priorities: modernization, which the 2022 National Defense Strategy stresses as crucial in building “enduring advantages across the defense ecosystem” and sharpening “the Joint Force’s technological edge.”

The competitors submitted their proposals at the state level, followed by elimination rounds conducted in four regions and then semifinal rounds. The finalists created visual products showcasing their ideas, followed by a presentation to Hokanson and three other senior leader judges.

The competitors were chosen based on their ability to identify a challenge, develop a unique solution and explain the overarching benefit, said Keith E. Buchholz, the NGB’s programs and resources comptroller, who coordinated and organized this year’s challenge.

“By virtue of the fact you are here today as finalists, you have already shown your initiative to seek answers to the questions of how we will do things better, faster, cheaper in the Guard,” Buchholz said.

For Lee, the training officer for the Arizona Guard, this meant identifying challenges in meeting live-fire and training requirements while complying with environmental and safety regulations.

That kind of training at major installations hundreds of miles away from a home station, he said, also “results in loss of time, increased costs, and potential unresolvable conflicts for resources against other units.”

“A solution to these problems is increased utilization of short-range training ammunition as well as a combination of battery-powered simulation devices and training scenarios” that follow Army guidance, said Lee in his team’s presentation.

This provided the means to produce what amounted to a mobile range.

“Through these tools, we can create an exportable maneuver live-fire range that can be safely established in existing training areas that are traditionally too restrictive for standard ammunition,” Lee said.

While minimal transportation can cut costs, the “time savings” could propel units forward, said John Ralph, an Army budget analyst for the Arizona Army Guard’s operations and training directorate.

“In a Guard environment, where you typically get one weekend a month and two weeks to train, every minute is precious,” he said. “And we can give back that time to those commanders to let them get after [the mission].”

Many Guard members who hold relevant civilian jobs helped bring the team's proposal to fruition, said Sgt. 1st Class John McCrory, a transportation management coordinator with an Arizona Guard training center.

“With one of my technicians, if he was just brought up as a Soldier in the active-duty Army, I don’t think he would have the civilian experience with electronics” needed to “adapt to whatever situation we were in,” said McCrory, who also headed the team’s “proof of concept” efforts for the proposal.

Ralph said Soldiers and Airmen should always consider themselves part of the innovation ecosystem and always push ideas — however big or small they may be.

“Don’t be afraid to say something if you see something that needs to be done better because we can always do anything better,” he said.

The National Guard Bureau will further explore each team’s presentation to determine the feasibility of advancing ideas from concept to reality, according to senior leaders. The factors they will consider include funding, scope and impact on the Guard force.

Hokanson closed out the event by emphasizing innovation is imperative and that more competition is on the horizon.

“The four teams that got here did remarkable work, and we were fascinated by the level of innovation going on in our organization,” he said. “And that just inspires us just to continue to do this.”

The NGB plans to conduct innovation competitions biannually through December 2025. Guard members are encouraged to work with their designated innovation lead specialist, typically positioned at a state’s headquarters element, to advance their ideas.

She grabbed her phone and walked across the street from her recruiting center to a movie theater to do some prospecting. After talking to a few interested people, she uploaded their information into the recruiting database in seconds just by using the app.

“It’s so much easier to get [contact information],” she said. “[The app] isn’t something we were asking for, but it’s something that we needed.”

Development for the mobile app and web browser version started in March. A team from the Army Software Factory worked with a team from the Army Analytics Group to create an application that gives recruiters access to information on the go.

The team’s design experienced numerous versions and countless recruiter feedback during the six-month process.

The final product is similar to what recruiters in the private sector use for applicant tracking. The application rolled out to recruiters Nov. 20 and is compatible with iOS and Android phones.

The software lets recruiters call, text, and email candidates without logging into the recruiting system. It also allows recruiters to scan drivers’ licenses, pulling in the associated information.

The height and weight data alerts recruiters to which candidates are within Army standards and which are options for the Future Soldier Preparatory Course.

These features eliminate the need for recruiters to head into the office to upload information from a computer.

“This app has reduced the time it takes to become proficient as a recruiter when it comes to prospecting,” Johnson said.

Reducing commuting time has allowed Johnson to double her face-to-face interactions with candidates. In her first week using the app, she’s had 40 meetings. This is something she said would’ve been impossible before.

Go Recruit mobile also reduces search time for recruiters. They can filter information in the database on targeted demographics depending on what they’re looking for.

It also reduces time when recruiters are making house calls. They can click on a candidate's address and have that come up in a corresponding GPS application.

Johnson said this streamlined process helped her recruiting station increase prospect numbers by around 150%.

“My commander is overwhelmed with the number of contacts we have now,” she said.

In just one week, Johnson said this tool dramatically changed how her station recruits on the go.

“This app is definitely amazing, and every recruiter should have it on their phone,” she said. “It’s a game changer.”

Army recruiters can only download the application on their government phones through the DOD Mobile Apps Gallery.

TOKYO – The day before Thanksgiving, Jim McGee was, fittingly, spending his evening giving his time to help feed children and families in need.

McGee, the chief of U.S. Army Garrison Japan’s Visual Information Division at Camp Zama, Japan, was at the Manbow Children’s Cafeteria in Setagaya with other volunteers to help prepare and serve food to the patrons there.

McGee, a navy veteran, first came to Japan in 1988 when he was stationed at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, and said he immediately fell in love with the country’s people and culture. He has worked at Camp Zama on and off for 15 years since 2005.

In return for the hospitality the Japanese people have shown him in his many years here, McGee said he is always looking for opportunities to give back to them. A few months ago, he learned about Manbow and its mission from a friend who co-founded the organization.

Manbow opened about a year ago to offer help the local community — not just with providing free food to children in need, but with providing support and care to young parents. The cafeteria opens twice a month for dinner.

McGee asked his friend if he could be involved, and his offer was accepted right away. The cafeteria relies heavily on volunteers to help with food preparation, cooking and serving. His first opportunity to help was, coincidentally, Nov. 22 — the day before Thanksgiving.

“I thought, ‘What a great opportunity to help provide food to a bunch of people,’ because Thanksgiving is all about sharing food with friends and strangers, and it’s America’s greatest holiday,” McGee said.

After arriving at the cafeteria, he was immediately put to work stuffing small shells of dough to make Japanese dumplings, known as “gyoza.” He quickly got the hang of it and together with the team of volunteers, they stuffed and pan-friend between 600 and 700 of the dumplings.

Once everything was prepared, it came time for what McGee said was the most rewarding part of the evening: serving the food to the children and their parents.

“I could have done that all day long because the children were so cute and polite,” McGee said. “Everyone was so genuinely grateful and came back to say ‘Thank you’ and ask why I was there and how I got involved.”

Yumiko Yoshimi, president of the Manbow cafeteria, opened the facility because she said she had begun to see a widening disparity in the economic classes in her community. Children from lower class families in particular tend to face a variety of complex issues, Yoshimi said, so she wanted to do something for those members of the community she has been living in for most of her life.

“I think the role of our cafeteria is to fill the stomachs and the hearts of those who come here and to put smiles on their faces,” she said.

Yoshimi named the cafeteria “Manbow,” which is Japanese for “sunfish.” In many cultures, the fish is associated with happiness.

“When people think of a place like this, they probably imagine a dimly lit, quiet place where everyone is looking down,” Yoshimi said. “But our cafeteria is different. Everyone here is excited, and some people are even visibly energized. For them, this place is just like their home.”

Yoshimi said volunteers like McGee are always welcome because their contributions help to raise awareness of what Manbow is doing to help the community in Setagaya.

“This is a great opportunity for both local and foreign volunteers to realize that there are children in Japan who need help,” she said.

McGee said his first opportunity to volunteer at Manbow was serendipitous because Thanksgiving is his favorite holiday. He said the day truly has no agenda other than welcoming family, friends and even strangers to share a meal together.

“This event gave me that experience on a grand scale,” he said. “It will be a Thanksgiving that I’ll remember for the rest of my life.”"

WIESBADEN, Germany – More than 100 students from DoDEA high schools across Europe gathered in Wiesbaden for the annual STEMposium event where they were grouped into teams to develop projects and solutions to real-world scenarios based on climate change and impacts to population centers.

“Students representing our 21 DoDEA Europe high schools are presented with a different real-world scenario in which they are required to formulate actionable solutions in order to be successful,” said DoDEA Europe Student Activities Coordinator Rob Smith about the event. “Our students are getting hands-on, real-world experience dealing with cutting edge tools, technologies, and techniques that can lead to success later in life.”

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District was one of a handful of organizations that supported the STEMposium, participating in career fair and providing mentoring and answered questions of students as they worked on their projects.

In a first for the annual STEMposium, this year’s event incorporated a STEM-focused career fair where representatives from different organizations, including Europe District and several others.

“It was great talking to the students during the career fair,” said Europe District Engineering Branch Chief Nathan Fox. “They were all very engaging and curious about the range of jobs available for engineers and in other STEM fields.”

As part of the event, the students were broken into teams and assigned different areas of expertise including biotechnology, civil engineering, data engineering, environmental engineering, robotics and using CAD programs for 3D printing.

“STEMinar” sessions were scheduled for each of these areas where students worked through their projects with real-world subject matter experts that could answer questions and mentor the students.

“I worked with the students focused on environmental engineering tasks in their groups; they were a bright group of young people who asked a lot of good questions,” said Europe District Environmental Branch Northern Section Chief Patricia Jackson. “They were tasked with providing clean drinking water following a disaster scenario, so we talked about water filtration methods, specifically those that would be climate-neutral. Some solutions we covered were lagoons with plants for filtration, as these filtering plants also absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. We also covered ways to minimize pump power usage, such as through gravity filtration when possible.”

Smith noted that the annual event was again a success and that it is part of DoDEA Europe’s dedication to providing unique and impactful opportunities for the children of DoD personnel stationed overseas.

“This event represents DoDEA's unwavering commitment to providing educational experiences that are not just on par, but often exceed what's available stateside,” Smith said. “It's an immersive journey into the world of STEM, where students engage in hands-on activities, gaining a deeper understanding of science and its real-world applications. More than just an academic exercise, STEMposium is a launchpad for future careers in STEM, nurturing essential skills like critical thinking and teamwork.”"

FRANKFORT, Ky. — There are many leadership schools that service members can attend but few are more challenging than the U.S. Army Ranger School. There, perfection is the standard, and nothing less is accepted.

This criterion was set upon Kentucky Army National Guard 2nd Lt. Dustin McKie-Miller when he decided to go to Ranger School. He aced every challenge on his first attempt and finished the course in 62 days, the shortest time possible for training, crediting both luck and skill.

A Ranger is a part of the Army’s premier infantry force. They specialize in conducting raids and infiltration missions deep inside enemy territory. To become a Ranger is no easy task. One must undergo grueling training to ensure they have the mental toughness, physical fitness, moral character and motivation to endure the challenges they may face in combat.

“At graduation, we’re told that only somewhere between 10 and 20% of Ranger students complete the course straight through,” he said. “The vast majority of those who complete the training have recycled at least one phase at some point.”

McKie-Miller decided to go to the training after several of the friends he had made from across the Army commissioned and began their military careers as infantry officers.

“I got to watch them go through the Infantry Basic Officer Leader Course, then to Ranger School, get their tab, and then see everything that they brought to their organization because of the Ranger program,” said McKie-Miller. “I had the idea in my mind of, ‘OK, well that's what the standard looks like.’”

McKie-Miller's goals fell into place. All he needed was a clear path to seize an opportunity.

“For National Guard Soldiers, there is an additional requirement of completing the two-week long, Ranger Training Assessment Course run by the Warrior Training Center at Fort Moore prior to attending Ranger School,” he said. “I was fortunate that the Guard had a slot available for me to attend RTAC immediately following IBOLC graduation.”

For McKie-Miller, the biggest challenge he faced with Ranger School was the mental hurdle of starting the course.

“I think my greatest challenge was just overcoming the reputation of Ranger School beforehand, of all the horror stories I heard about how I’m not going to eat, I’m not going to sleep, and I truly don’t know when it will end,” said McKie-Miller. “I imagined that it would be a 62-day field training exercise — or, at least hopefully only 62 days — across impossible terrain, and I’d just be broken down to the core throughout it. And, although in the end there is some truth to those stories, the hardest part for me was simply getting out of the car on Day Zero.”

After that, he said, “My mindset shifted to, ’I'm here now, and I'm going to give everything I have for as long as it takes. And so is everyone alongside me.’”

McKie-Miller said Ranger School isn’t looking for perfect genetic specimens, just that you do things correctly.

“What the Ranger instructors expect are 49 perfect pushups, 59 perfect sit-ups, not a second over 40 minutes on the run, and to cap it off, six perfect chin-ups,"" he said. ""They're not looking for someone to go out and do 100 pushups, they just want 49 to standard. When the Ranger instructor counts your 49th, 59th and 6th they tell you to stand up and move to the next station because you've met the standard. But they demand that to perfection.”

McKie-Miller enlisted in the Kentucky Guard in 2018 as a motor transport operator while he was still a student at the University of Kentucky and was assigned to the 2123rd Transportation Company, 75th Troop Command. After a year with the 2123rd, he was encouraged to attend Officer Candidate School in Greenville, earning his commission in 2020. He is now a platoon leader with Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 149th Infantry Regiment out of Middlesboro.

He lives in Clarksville, Tennessee, where he works as a software architect with General Electric Aerospace.

His advice for Soldiers eyeing Ranger School: “It is a difficult course, it does challenge you, and at times it does push you to your limit,"" he said. “But at the end of the day, it's very much achievable.”

Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany - Military and government leaders from the across the globe came together for Silent Warrior 23, Dec. 4 – 7, 2023 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.

The multi-day conference, hosted by Special Operations Command Africa, aimed to facilitate forums for senior military leaders to discuss shared concerns and identify collaborative solutions to the strategic, operational, and tactical issues in Africa. Many leaders in attendance were also from their respective countries’ special operations forces.

The annual conference, now in its 12th year, had 55 nations in attendance – 22 African countries and 33 international partners. This year, the conference placed a heavy emphasis on violent extremist organizations (VEOs) and the unique challenges they pose across the African continent.

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Ron Foy, SOCAFRICA’s commander, stated during opening remarks for the conference that the best way to combat the aforementioned VEOs was through sustained partnerships.

“We recognize the strong potential Africa brings not only to the continent but to the globe as a whole,” said Foy. “A stable and prosperous Africa continues to and always will be in the world’s best interest.”

Also in attendance was the U.S. Africa Command team, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael Langley, AFRICOM commander, and U.S. Marine Corps Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Woods, AFRICOM senior enlisted leader. Langley provided opening remarks for the conference.

“Sessions such as Silent Warrior 23, give me the opportunity to listen,” said Langley. “Listen to your viewpoints. Listen to some of the challenges but moreover, listen to the opportunities across the continent of Africa.”

“Whether it be the enduring fight against al-Shabaab or against violent extremist organizations across the Sahel,” said Langley. “I am listening to you and your ideas collectively.”

Senior officials from SOCAFRICA’s African partner nations were some of the guest speakers for the event. On theme with the conference, Brig. Gen. John Njeru, Kenya Defence Force, organized an in-depth discussion on al-Shabaab, a VEO that has posed a significant security threat in Njeru’s home country of Kenya and other nations throughout east Africa.

Njeru spoke about the increasing capabilities of al-Shabaab, such as the spread of disinformation, large scale recruitment and the increasing use of drones and how those challenges can be addressed through partnerships and collective efforts.

The conference also afforded leadership the opportunity to have small-group discussions on various topics. One breakout session focused on enlisted development within not only U.S. forces, but SOCAFRICA’s international and African partners as well.

Command Sgt. Maj. Garrick Banfield, the senior enlisted leader for SOCAFRICA, stressed the importance of enlisted service members and the benefits they bring to multilateral planning and operations.

“Enlisted leaders provide a unique perspective and a vantage point,” said Banfield. “These vantage points illuminate a situation which can then enable enlisted leaders to provide advice and counsel to their officers.”

Multiple agencies came together to ensure the success of the conference. SOCAFRICA staff took on a heavy load with the logistics and planning efforts of the conference. Airmen from the Language Enabled Airman Program ensured the practices shared were translated to French, Arabic and Portuguese-speaking countries.

“In conferences like Silent Warrior, we facilitate clear and accurate communication across languages and cultures,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Scott Guthrie, LEAP interpreter and 52nd Health Care Operations Squadron physician. “This not only enhances mutual understanding and cooperation but also respects and acknowledges the cultural diversity of the participants – leading to more effective international collaborations.”

Foy thanked those in attendance for battling the elements to participate in the discussions, briefs, and breakout sessions. He also stressed the importance of SOCAFRICA’s enduring partnerships with their African partners.

“Partnerships serve as the backbone for our resolve to defeat violent extremism”, said Foy. “And I can say without reservation no VEO can match our collective strength. None. We’re much stronger together.”"

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White delighted UFC fans during a meet and greet event Nov. 30 at the Fort Cavazos Main Exchange here.

White was in the Central Texas area for the UFC Lightweight bout Dec. 2 at Moody Center in Austin, Texas, and stopped by Fort Cavazos to visit with Soldiers before he made his way south.

The crew from Fort Cavazos’ Great Big Podcast sat down with White to talk about his steadfast dedication to the armed forces and his philosophy on life and success.

White began with a declaration of his support for the military that would echo throughout the remainder of the podcast.

“I’m a huge military and law enforcement guy so anytime that I can ever do anything, no matter what it is, I’m all in,” he expressed. “The level of respect that I have for military personnel, it’s unexplainable. I’ll probably say it 30 times during this podcast, I love the military. I have so much respect for people who defend this country.”

When asked how it felt to be at Fort Cavazos, White replied, “To meet the people who actually are here, doing it and willing to defend our country, there’s no place that I would rather be than here today meeting them and shaking their hands.

“These are the people that are the real heroes and the real superheroes,” he continued. “When you are willing to dedicate a massive portion of your life, and sometimes your entire life, to protecting others and protecting your country, it’s one of the things that I respect the most in a human being.”

White recounted the early days of trying to establish the UFC and the mantra that inspired him then and still pushes him to achieve great things today.

“People thought it was crazy, what I wanted to do. The idea of going head-to-head with boxing. Boxing was massive and was sort of cemented in over a hundred years of history in the United States, and when you say that you want to start what I wanted to start and do what I wanted to do, it seemed impossible and could never be done. Nothing is impossible and everything can be done,” he declared.

“People out there who have an idea and it seems too big and it seems too crazy and other people think you’re nuts, none of that’s true,” he continued. “Anything is possible and anything can be done.”

White talked about his work with the Fisher House and his immense respect for the organization and its efforts to support the military.

“We’re huge supporters and I don’t know if anybody’s done more than the Fisher family for the military,” he said.

Before wrapping up the podcast, White reiterated his support for service members.

“I would literally do anything,” he asserted. “I met a couple of guys here today and I gave them my cell phone number already, I’ve been here 10 minutes … you know if you ever need anything from me or the UFC, whether it’s fundraising, people showing up to bases or any type of support that we could possibly give, I’m your guy, I’m all in.”

Spc. David Briseno, 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment, was one of a group of Soldiers who met White and took photos with him before the meet and greet.

Briseno recounted memories of watching UFC bouts on television with his father and seeing White ringside. He said he never imagined meeting him and described the encounter as, “truly a once in a lifetime experience for me.”

“These big people in Hollywood, they care about guys and girls like us,” he said. “That truly makes us feel special and makes us really want to keep working and doing our best to protect this country.”

Spc. Falecia Long, 1st Bn., 9th Cav. Regt., agreed.

“It makes you feel special,” she expressed. “I think it’s cool that he supports everything that we do. There’s a lot of people that support the military, but it was nice to have someone that’s super big to be like, ‘You guys are doing great stuff.’ It made me feel important.”

Dressed in a black t-shirt with green letters that read “ARMY,” White’s appreciation of the armed forces and his humble and friendly demeanor were on full display as he posed for photos and laughed and talked with Fort Cavazos leadership, Soldiers, Main Exchange staff and VIP guests before greeting throngs of fans awaiting his entrance.

“I was just outside and there’s a line probably a hundred yards long of Soldiers in uniform, out of uniform, waiting patiently to come see him,” said Col. Kevin Brown, command engineer, Army and Air Force Exchange Service.

Brown explained that White’s visit embodied AAFES’ long-standing slogan.

“AAFES, we go where you go, and this is one time he came where we are,” he said. “For Mr. White to come here and meet our Soldiers and family members in our main store, is awesome.”

Brown added that the event was a great way to usher in the holidays for Soldiers and their families.

“This is a really good morale boost for the beginning of the holiday season,” he conveyed. “They have something here to kind of break up the monotony, to give them something to look forward to and have fun.”"

Update: Dec. 14, 2023

WASHINGTON — The Army announced it is crediting service time for Soldiers who commissioned through the active-duty option of the Green to Gold program from 2006 to September 2023.

The decision comes following a review of the Army Military Human Resource Records that revealed those Soldiers did not have a valid contract in place to be enrolled as a Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps member.

""We are pleased to have reached a resolution that takes care of Soldiers and retirees, said Brig. Gen. Hope C. Rampy, Director, Military Personnel Management Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff. ""The Army is profoundly committed to taking care of Soldiers and their families; it's a responsibility we do not take lightly.""

The Army initiated the records review after a U.S. Army Cadet Command Inspector General notice in September stated that some Soldiers may not have known the period they spent as cadets did not count toward their time in service for retirement.

""It's my business to take care of Soldiers, and I don't want to rush to the wrong conclusion,"" Rampy said during an interview earlier this month. ""I want to go through a deliberate process and confirm what's in their file. I want to come up with options that best takes care of the Soldier and their families.""

Federal law, Title 10 section 2106, prohibits the Army from counting a Soldier’s time in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps toward time in service. The records review found that the previously commissioned officers from the G2GADO program did not have a valid contract.

The Army chose the option to credit current active-duty Soldiers commissioned through the program and retired service members during their participation in the G2GADO program in computing length of service for any purpose, including pay and retirement.

WASHINGTON ­­— In 2023, the Army expanded the scale of training both domestically and abroad. The service continued to support humanitarian missions, both within the U.S. and overseas, while maintaining partnerships through agreements like the National Guard State Partnership Program.

The exercises strengthened the Army’s ability to fight alongside allies and partner nations across the globe, as the service looks to increase interoperability among partner nations while building the Army of 2030.

The Best Squad Competition, which finished in October, challenged Soldiers to be all they could be focusing on teamwork and pushing each other to their limits.

Stateside Exercises

BEST SQUAD COMPETITION: This year the service provided more incentives to Soldiers competing for the title of U.S. Army Best Squad. Participants had the opportunity to earn special skills badges for different military occupational specialties. Soldiers could earn the Expert Soldier Badge, the Expert Infantry Badge or the Expert Medical Field Badge.

The 75th Ranger Regiment team from U.S. Army Special Operations Command won first place during the competition followed by a squad from Army Medical Command in second place. Soldiers tested their mettle on 20,000 acres of land at Fort Stewart, Georgia. Soldiers competed in ruck marches and land navigation exercises there, while operating on limited amounts of sleep.

NORTHERN STRIKE: The Army Reserve’s large-scale, deployment exercise added a new element this year: in-theater medical training. Participants simulated a medical evacuation flight during the Midwest-based training exercise from a site in Michigan to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, for additional treatment.

The Michigan National Guard has hosted the exercise since 2012 and expanded Northern Strike into a joint, multinational program based at the National All-Domain Warfighting Center at Camp Grayling, Michigan. More than 7,000 participants from across the U.S. and four nations took part in the annual exercise, where participants simulated joint integrated fires, command and control, and sustainment.

The training, which takes place across Michigan’s lower peninsula, including the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center in Alpena County, the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, and Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport in Iosco County.

Disaster Response

The National Guard deployed 134 troops to support the relief and response efforts following the devastating wind-driven wildfires in Hawaii in August. The Guard provided two CH-47 Chinook helicopters to aid search and recovery efforts, primarily over the island of Maui. National Guard Soldiers supported Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and local law enforcement as liaisons.

In a single day, Guard members dropped about 10,000 gallons of water during a five-hour period. Cartographers and geographers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers used geographic information systems to provide relevant data to help government organizations develop and execute relief plans.

In August and September, about 5,000 members of the Florida National Guard and others activated to assist with disaster response efforts during Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall on Florida’s west coast.

Making a Difference Worldwide

NATIONAL GUARD STATE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM: In 2023, the international program that aligns guard units with foreign partners celebrated three decades of cooperation and providing aid. The Army celebrated the program’s 30th anniversary in July at the National Harbor in Fort Washington, Maryland.

An already established partnership between U.S. forces and Ukraine helped aid the eventual Ukrainian war effort against Russia. Ukraine has held a partnership with the California National Guard since 1993, with Guard members training Ukrainian forces in capabilities such as firing FIM-92 Stingers, a mobile defense platform, and the FGM-148 Javelin, a portable shoulder-launched anti-tank system.

U.S. forces have also influenced Ukrainians on the battlefield, adopting a tactical model inspired by the Army’s non-commissioned officer corps.

U.S. European Command sought to establish a contact team in the Baltic region. The partnership program started with seven former Soviet nations and now includes more than 88 partnerships with more than 100 partner nations across all corners of the world

The program encourages personal ties at the state level among partner nations. Not only does the program support defense security, but also societal relationships that span into other areas of government and economy.

EXERCISE JUSTIFIED ACCORD: The Kenya-based multi-national exercise helped U.S. forces provide humanitarian assistance, engage in peacekeeping missions and crisis response.

Led by U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa , more than 20 countries participated in Justified Accord, the largest exercise in East Africa. Last February, Soldiers learned to perform humanitarian missions and took part in a multinational, live-fire training event. Planners also incorporated cyber-related simulations for the first time.

OPERATION TALISMAN SABRE: During this multinational, large scale exercise, U.S. and Australian forces sought to build a more persistent, secure network among the “Five Eyes” alliance of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

The new network will be synchronized across the partner nations’ systems and save setup times by having network availability already in place. The network will help raise readiness levels and bring the service closer to the Army of 2030.

The development of the new network showcased one of the methods by which the Army and host Australia improved its network capabilities and interoperability among nations during Talisman Sabre. During the annual exercise, Hawaii and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, U.S. forces learned to operate in enemy and austere environments with challenging constraints and longer distances in the Indo Pacific.

The series of experiments, in accordance with the Army’s Data Strategy, allowed the U.S. and its allies to continually test network capabilities in a dozen different exercises.

JOINT EMERGENCY EXERCISE 23: Members of Special Forces and other experts from across the force trained Army physicians and medical personnel in realistic combat casualty care scenarios during Joint Emergency Exercise. During the exercises, Soldiers learned to integrate medical care into combat operations during simulated scenarios.

Hosted by the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, at Fort Cavazos, Texas, the exercise helped increase combat readiness and joint interoperability for more than 2,000 participants from the Army, Air Force, National Guard and Army Reserve. Service members representing 60 combat career specialties took part in the exercises.

U.S. ARMY EUROPE AND AFRICA EXERCISES: U.S. Army Europe and Africa command provides combat-ready, land forces ready to defend the region.

EXERCISE SABER JUNCTION: During this annual exercise in September, the Army, NATO and allied forces gathered in Germany to learn to operate as one.

Exercises centered around the Joint Multinational Readiness Center near Hohenfels, Germany, where 4,000 participants from 16 countries widened the scale of operations and learned to overcome linguistics, logistics and communications challenges. Soldiers also simulated using different weapons and systems and the treatment and evacuation of injured troops.

U.S. Soldiers and their NATO counterparts spent time learning how each other operates on the battlefield and the nuances in their strategies.

USAREUR-AF, comprised of about 41,000 troops on two continents, takes part in 18 major exercises including U.S. Africa Command’s largest multinational exercise, African Lion. This year, African Lion 23 took place across Ghana, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia in May and June 2023. The exercise included combined arms live fires, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear response training and three humanitarian assistance events.

In coordination with U.S. Army Futures Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa hosted Arctic Forge, a series of cold-weather exercises based in Scandinavia.

During Arctic Forge 23 last February, Soldiers from the 11th Airborne Division, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, the 10th Mountain Division in Fort Drum, New York, and the Virginia Army National Guard trained with the Finnish military.

U.S. Soldiers also took part in Defense Exercise North, where they drew from the Finnish troops’ frigid weather experience. The Soldiers operated in three feet of snow under subzero temperatures and learned how to operate in arctic conditions, including techniques used on skis to traverse across challenging terrain.

Allied Spirit began in 2011 and has grown from six nations in 2015 to 21 NATO countries and allies in 2023. Unlike other training center exercises, Allied Spirit features an allied unit comprised of partner nations as the primary training audience instead of a U.S. brigade combat team.

From strengthening ties with allied partners to saving lives during humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, the Army made a difference in forging relationships across the globe, and allowing Soldiers to be all that they can be.

74,YEAR IN REVIEW: Building the Army of 2030,https://www.army.mil/article/272235/year_in_review_building_the_army_of_2030,"This article is part of the ""America's Army: 2023 Year in Review"" content series.

WASHINGTON ­— The Army continued to deliver the most advanced weapons systems and equipment into the hands of Soldiers in 2023.

The service broke new ground in shipping the first Directed Energy, Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense or DE M-SHORAD prototype systems to Soldiers and the Army also received the latest model of the Integrated Visual Augmentation Systems, or IVAS.

After the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System reached full-rate production status in April, the service followed that feat by demonstrating the first successful launch of a Tomahawk missile from its prototype Mid-Range Capability system.

Finally, the Army honored the service of two Soldiers from two major campaigns in naming its newest infantry assault vehicle. The upgrades bring the Army closer to building the Army of 2030 by investing in its top priority, its people and its Soldiers.

DE M-SHORAD system: In September, the successful delivery of the Directed Energy, MSHORAD system to the newly-reactivated Delta Battery of 4th Battalion, 60th Air Defense Artillery Regiment at Fort Sill, made Delta Battery the first tactical, directed-energy capable unit.

The laser weapons system will not only be a deterrent against enemy forces but can counter against relevant threats with air defense protection. The service classified the DE M-SHORAD system as an urgent acquisition program that provides commanders with greater freedom to maneuver.

Members of the battery underwent extensive training in the fall of 2022 to prepare to operate the prototype. Soldiers simulated an attack using a vehicle with the same weight and power of the prototype.

IVAS: The Army reached a new milestone in July when Soldiers received 20 of the latest model of IVAS, the 1.2 variant. The system features an all-weather headset and next-generation, situational awareness tools with a mixed reality display. IVAS provides Soldiers with high resolution simulations, giving Soldiers enhanced capabilities in both in day and night conditions.

The development of the IVAS will result in fielding several years ahead of standard acquisition programs.

Using augmented reality, the headset enhances a Soldier’s ability to navigate in hostile environments. When dismounting, the IVAS’s low-light sensors help the user identify targets and surrounding vehicles.

The IVAS system also has a built-in Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer, which teaches Soldiers to use the headset to solve objective-based dilemmas and battle scenarios.

Tribute to veterans: The Army announced that it named its newest combat vehicle, the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle, after Medal of Honor recipient Robert Booker, a World War II veteran, and Staff Sgt. Stevon Booker, a Distinguished Service Cross recipient from Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The service announced it awarded the $257.6 million production contract to Michigan-based General Dynamics Land Systems in July. Designers built the armored vehicle to be highly maneuverable and mobile, resembling a light tank.

Army leaders commemorated the renaming during a ceremony at the National Museum of the United States Army in June as part of the service’s 248th birthday celebration. In addition, the Army selected Alabama’s Anniston Army Depot as the repair depot for the vehicle.

Mid-Range firepower: The Army fired intermediate range, subsonic Tomahawk missiles from a prototype system at an undisclosed location on June 27.

Soldiers from the 1st Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington carried out the test with assistance from the Navy. The test marks an important step to strengthening the Army’s top modernization priority: long-range precision fires. The MRC system will support the joint, multi-domain mission.

Soldiers contributed to the testing and development of the MRC, according to the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.

Major milestone: The Army announced in April that its Integrated Battle Command System, or IBCS, had reached full rate production.

The Army Acquisition Support Center describes the IBCS as a fire control and operational center, providing accurate targeting and a wider battlespace. Using sensors and effectors in one command and control system, IBCS lets Soldiers see the battlefield more effectively.

IBCS will replace older command and control systems which in turn will improve coordinated engagements and positive control of sensors and weapons.

Network testing with NATO allies: Soldiers in Hohenfels, Germany tested the Army’s Integrated Tactical Network during Exercise Dragoon Ready 23. The ITN provides voice and data communication capabilities to units in the field.

About 2,500 U.S. Soldiers in field artillery, fire control, operations, and signal support systems participated, along with troops from NATO allies Italy and the United Kingdom. The Soldiers simulated operating in austere environments while learning unified land operations with partner nations.

75,YEAR IN REVIEW: Army’s quality of life changes place people first,https://www.army.mil/article/272178/year_in_review_armys_quality_of_life_changes_place_people_first,"Courtesy photos, collage by Christopher Hurd (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL

This article is part of the ""America's Army: 2023 Year in Review"" content series. To view the rest of the big Army news from this year, visit the website at Army.mil/YearInReview.

WASHINGTON — People remain the Army’s number one priority and the service implemented various quality of life changes throughout 2023 to help service members and their families.

These efforts included enhancing career opportunities for spouses, child care access, family housing, and mental health support.

Spouse Employment

The Army worked on several plans to increase employment for the 431,000 spouses across all three components. The service expanded its noncompetitive hiring authority with the DOD Military Spouse Employment Partnership, connecting spouses to 610 employers. So far, more than 258,000 spouses have been hired.

The Army continues to work with the Defense State Liaison Office as they work with states on implementing the recently passed Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act.

This legislation is designed to assist spouses in transferring occupation licenses between states more effortlessly.

The Army has streamlined the process for spousal reimbursement for license and certification cost up to $1,000 during a permanent change of station move.

Family member employment has been difficult in Italy, and on 30 August 2023, the U.S. and Italy came to an agreement that allows U.S. dependents with a mission visa stationed there to telework to jobs with U.S. employers, which was not an option for spouses previously.

“Army spouses play an important role in Soldier and family readiness and Soldier retention,” said Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth. “Leveraging both Army and DOD programs, and partnerships with other federal and non-governmental organizations, we remain committed to improving spouse employment and career opportunities.”

Streamlined Moving Process

This September, the Department of Defense began phase one of transitioning to a single contracting company, Houston-based company HomeSafe Alliance, LLC, for the pickup and delivery of household goods in the continental U.S.

Phase two will include overseas moves and is scheduled to begin September 2024. Army leadership said the change is expected to bring greater efficiencies and accountability for service members and their families.

“This is an opportunity to raise the standard for our families, attract quality capacity to the program, and introduce a level of accountability absent today,” said Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost, commander, U.S. Transportation Command. “Once implemented, this contract will positively impact thousands of service members, civilian employees and their families each year.”

Child Care

The Army tackled child care costs and availability as well. The service built six new child development centers and has at least five more on the way.

The Army also increased staff at the CDCs by raising entry-level salaries and offering staff retention bonuses as well as child care discounts. More than 70% of its total CDC workforce is now staffed.

In August, the Army announced a new child care pilot program that grants Army Reserve Soldiers and their families access to a childcare matching service and in some areas offering free childcare during battle assembly weekends. The program works with local government support and is being piloted in West Liberty, Iowa, and Clay County, Missouri.

“The Army recognizes the impact that child care has on the lives of our Soldiers and their families,” said Lt. Gen. Kevin Vereen, deputy chief of staff for installations (G-9). “Through increased initiatives to identify and secure accessible and affordable child care options, we enable our military parents to fulfill their responsibilities without sacrificing the well-being of their children.”

The DOD announced the creation of the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account, a financial benefit for eligible service members that allows them to place as much as $5,000 pre-taxed dollars from their paycheck into the account for dependent care services.

Active-component Soldiers, along with Active Guard Reserve Soldiers on Title 10 orders, are eligible. The benefit is scheduled to be available Jan. 1, 2024. Those interested can sign up for the account during the annual Federal Benefits Open Season, which runs now through mid-December.

Parental Leave

To support parents and caregivers, the Army refined its parental leave guidance in January. The new guidance increased paid parental leave from 21 days for non-birth parents to 12 weeks of paid paternal leave for birth parents, non-birth parents and Soldiers adopting a child or accepting a child for long-term foster care.

The expanded policy allows for greater flexibility for Soldiers and their families. It authorizes Soldiers to delay parental leave to attend military education, to take regular leave in between parental leave, and to take leave in increments.

Soldiers can request parental leave through the Integrated Personnel and Pay System–Army and the Department of the Army Form 31.

Economic Stability

Soldiers received positive news with Basic Allowance for Housing rates increasing an average of 12.1% this year. Service members in 291 of 300 military housing areas received an increase.

For low-income military families, a new Basic Needs Allowance became available this year. The supplemental allowance is for active-duty service members with dependents whose household income falls below federal poverty guidelines for their duty location. The new program promotes economic security for Soldiers and their families facing financial challenges.

Additionally, the Army increased retention bonuses this year, giving more money to Soldiers in critical military occupational specialties. The service met its retention goal for the fourth year in a row.

Housing

The Army remains committed to improving its infrastructure; and, in 2023, made significant investments in housing.

Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth pledged to invest $1.5 billion in Army-owned housing and another $3.1 billion in privatized housing. Through the Army’s financial investment plan, the service awarded 45 barracks projects in fiscal year 2023 totaling $1.07 billion.

Barracks projects will continue to see an increased emphasis, said Jordan Matthews, Army Material Command facilities division chief. “These investments directly affect the quality of life of Soldiers and families on Army installations and reflect our commitment to people – the Army’s top priority.”

Army leadership is working to provide 100% sustainment funding for barracks and to spend more on renovation and construction.

Health

As part of the Army’s ongoing efforts to eliminate the stigma associated with seeking mental health support, the Army approved its Brandon Act policy in September.

The new directive allows Soldiers to confidentially seek help through their leaders in the rank of staff sergeant and above, and charges leadership to connect Soldiers with resources quickly.

Soldiers are not required to provide a reason or basis to request a referral. The policy applies to Soldiers in the regular Army, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve who are on active duty for over 30 days.

Guidance for Army National Guard and Army Reserve Soldiers not on active duty is under development.

For Soldiers’ physical health, the Army rolled out its new Body Composition Program in June to assess a Soldier’s body fat more accurately. The policy replaces the older two-measurement test with a one-site tape test across the belly button.

And in March the Army released a directive exempting all Soldiers scoring 540 points or more on the Army Combat Fitness Test from the body fat assessment, regardless of their height and weight. Soldiers must score 80 points or more in each event.

WASHINGTON — In 2023 the service pushed forward with several initiatives to help Americans discover their passions, pursue their purpose, and build lifelong communities while serving.

Brand Relaunch

The Army returned to its classic slogan of “Be All You Can Be” with a brand relaunch in March. The campaign is designed to spotlight the countless opportunities the service offers.

""At a time when political, economic and social factors are changing how young Americans view the world, the new Army brand illustrates how service in the Army is grounded in passion and purpose,"" said Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth. ""Serving our nation is a calling and one that is fundamentally hopeful. We want a new generation of Americans to see the Army as a pathway to the lives and careers they want to achieve.""

The brand transformation was a multiyear process designed to reflect today’s Army while addressing the needs of a new generation. The brand’s new look and feel consists of a re-engineered five-point star logo coupled with the return of the popular tagline, which was initially used from 1980-2001.

Future Soldier Preparatory Course Anniversary

The Army celebrated the first anniversary of the Future Preparatory Course in August. The pilot program helped more than 8,800 eligible Americans overcome academic and physical fitness barriers to service.

The FSPC has an academic track and a fitness track, both three weeks long. The academic portion focuses on helping students improve their Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery scores while the fitness track educates students on the five Holistic Health and Fitness readiness domains.

Both tracks of the course had a 95% graduation rate in the first year of the program, with academic students increasing their ASVAB scores by an average of 18.5 points and fitness students losing an average of 1.7% body fat per week.

“The [course] is where desire meets investment, and every day these young men and women show that when provided the right resources and training, they are able to perform and meet or exceed the standards expected of every Soldier,” said Brig. Gen. Jason E. Kelly, the Fort Jackson commanding general.

Graduates of the academic track who increase their score to a higher classification category can re-negotiate their enlistment contracts and may qualify for a different military occupational specialty or additional incentives.

This year, the Army gave out more than $15.5 million to program graduates.

The course initially started at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, but expanded to Fort Moore, Georgia in January.

All-Volunteer Force 50th Anniversary

On July 1, the Army and the nation celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the all-volunteer force. The move was made by President Richard Nixon’s administration in 1973 to fill the U.S. military ranks with Americans who chose to serve rather than with draftees.

Over the next five decades, the Army continued to evolve from its draft days. Enlistments went from two years to varying lengths depending on a Soldier’s career path.

The Army now offers more complex education and training for more than 200 jobs in science, cybersecurity, combat forces, aviation, medicine, law and more.

Innovations to training have been added to set Soldiers up for success, including Holistic Health and Fitness as well as new approaches to mental, sleep, physical and spiritual readiness.

“Our Soldiers, from the newest E-1 to the most experienced generals come from all over the country, from many different backgrounds, from multiple demographics, races and ethnicities,” Wormuth said. “At the end of the day, what unites us is our shared Army values. That and our collective mission to fight and win the nation’s wars.”

75th Integration, Desegregation Anniversaries

It was a year of anniversary celebrations, as the Army marked the 75th anniversary of the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act in June and the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9981 in July.

The integration act allowed women to become permanent, full-time members of the Army. According to retired Maj. Gen Gina Farrisee, the first female commanding general of the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, the Army provides a way for every person to achieve their full potential.

“The Army is an amazing opportunity,” Farrisee said. “For those looking for a challenge and wanting to make a difference, it is certainly the place to do that. There is no doubt in my mind that the military makes you a better person.”

Just a month later in 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981, ending racial segregation in the armed forces.

“Ending racial discrimination in the military made our Army immeasurably stronger and moved our country closer to fulfilling its founding promise,” Wormuth said. “We should be proud of the progress the Army has made in ensuring that every Soldier, regardless of race, can pursue the unlimited opportunities that military service offers.”

Recruiting Reform

Facing a challenging recruiting environment, the Army announced the transformation of its recruiting enterprise in October.

“The competition for talented Americans is fierce, and it is fundamentally different than it was 50 or even 20 years ago,” Wormuth said. “Understanding that reality is key to designing new practices that will make us a more attractive and compelling career choice for young Americans.”

The sweeping changes include expanding the recruiting focus to a larger portion of the available population, creating a specialized talent acquisition workforce, improving the measurement and evaluation of recruiting policy decisions, and aligning the Army recruiting structure.

First, the Army will expand its focus beyond recent high school graduates. Army leadership set a goal of at least a third of the service’s newest recruits to have more than a high school degree by 2028, compared to 20% today.

Second, the service plans to create two new military occupational specialties for an enlisted talent acquisition specialist and a warrant officer to ensure the best recruiting subject matter expertise and leadership. A more specialized officer workforce remains under consideration.

Third, the Army will create an evidence-based learning capability at Army headquarters that will incorporate data collection and program evaluation design into policy planning and implementation.

Finally, Army leadership plans to consolidate marketing and recruiting into a three-star command that reports directly to them with the new commander’s time in position changing from two to four years.

“The fact is that even though it remains a challenge to attract new recruits, we are exceeding our retention goals every year,” Wormuth said. “That means that people who are in the Army by and large love their jobs. And that’s a message we want all young Americans to hear – that the United States Army is truly a place where you can be all that you can be.”

WASHINGTON — Before kickoff at Saturday’s Army-Navy football game, seven cadets and seven midshipmen will walk to midfield to be traded back to their home academies.

The annual ceremony is part of the Service Academy Exchange Program where students from each of the four service academies are exchanged to spend the fall semester at an academy other than their own.

The program has roots dating back to 1945, when the U.S. Military Academy cadets and Naval Academy midshipmen participated in a weeklong exchange program. The program expanded to a semester long in 1975. Second Class cadets from West Point participate in the exchange but go through a competitive selection process.

Cadet Mitch Walker, who was born in Annapolis, Maryland, said being selected and attending the Naval Academy for a semester has been invaluable.

“It’s extremely important to have a better understanding of our fellow services and their mission sets, tools and capabilities,” he said. “It allows us to hit the ground running quicker in the future in joint operations.”

Cadet Beau Briggs echoed this sentiment. “I’ve been told by many mentors in my life that I’ll be serving in joint operations more than you think,” he said. “I wanted to meet people I’ll likely run into at some point in my career, have those connections, make new friends, experience more culture, learn about other services.”

“It’s becoming more and more important to have programs where the joint forces work together,” said Cadet Ida McLaughlin, from Bethesda, Maryland. “As our focus shifts to peer adversaries, joint operations will become critical to the operational capabilities of our forces. Understanding the capabilities each player has and how they complement each other is crucial to any team. Each branch has a specialized mission, and we have a fighting force that is the most lethal on the planet.”

Some of the cadets felt a call to service and are following a family tradition.

Walker, from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, had an uncle who served in the Marines in Desert Storm, a grandfather in the Air Force during Vietnam, a great-grandfather in the Army infantry and a great-grandfather in the Army Air Corps in World War II.

“Service has always been a priority of mine and my family” Walker said. “I was raised to respect those who have sacrificed on my behalf so naturally I wanted to fulfill that obligation and calling as well. I want to be on the ground in the fight up front as an infantry officer.”

Briggs, from Charlotte, North Carolina, had a grandfather who served in the Navy.

“Being here at the Naval Academy, I earned a better understanding of his service,” he said. “I decided to join the military because service has always been a big part of my life in whatever capacity that may come in. Service to our nation is the highest form of service there is. The military was always on my mind. I landed on the Army because I liked the mission more than the other branches.”

Walker highly recommends the service academies to anyone considering attending.

“Going to a service academy is an experience that can’t be bought,” he said. “It’s truly a million-dollar education. You can’t match the experiences, the people you’ll meet or the friendships you’ll build anywhere else in the country. Going through life every day with more than 4,000 other people committed to defending the nation and its freedoms motivates me to be a better version of myself every single day.

“I would encourage anyone looking to join the Army or applying to any of the Service Academies to do your research and put the effort in before you go to be successful,” Walker said. “Be prepared to be out of your comfort zone but the sooner you discover the opportunities available to you, the more you’ll get out of your experience.”

“The Army provides a multitude of opportunities for Soldiers,” McLaughlin said. “Be aware of the programs in place to support you and take advantage of them. Broaden your horizons. Seek out opportunities to experience new things and learn from experts in fields that are different from yours.”

She plays Division-1A Rugby for West Point, studies mechanical engineering and hopes to commission as an aviation officer.

Prior to the start of the Army-Navy game, the cadets will be exchanged at midfield and allowed to cheer on their teams from friendly areas in the West Point seating areas.

“It’s Army-Navy week so tensions are high right now. Everyone’s very skeptical of everyone else,” Briggs said. “I’m looking over my shoulder constantly. I can’t wait to go out to that midfield line, do our exchange and run back to my student section. Go Army, beat Navy.”

“I’m absolutely excited to rejoin my classmates,” McLaughlin said. “The anticipation for this game has been building throughout this semester, and the exchange will be the culminating event for us. With the rivalry, we’re much more similar than different and united in our willingness to place duty, honor and country first.”

“Although the Army-Navy rivalry is strong and apparent in the attitudes of both academies and their sports teams, at the end of the day, we’re all on the same team,” Walker said. “We’re best friends and partners 364 days out of the year until one Saturday afternoon in December as we watch our teams duke it out on the gridiron.

“I’m super excited to see my company and cheer the Army team to victory,” Walker said. “Go Army, beat Navy!”"

JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska — For the 68th year, the Alaska National Guard's Operation Santa Claus is bringing the magic of the season to the remote communities of Fort Yukon, Golovin, Koyuk and Tuluksak.

Teaming up with the Salvation Army, the Guard will deliver gifts and tidings of good cheer to approximately 560 children.

Jenny Ragland, a service extension and disaster services director with the Salvation Army, said the organization collects the gifts and the Guard provides logistical support.

“So, when we show up in a community with Santa, there is a gift with every child's name that we share with them,"" she said. ""... Operation Santa wouldn't happen without the partnership between the Salvation Army and the Alaska National Guard.”

Gifts earmarked for the western Alaska communities were palletized by National Guardsmen at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson before their journey to Bethel or Nome. The Alaska Air National Guard's C-17 Globemaster III and the Alaska Army National Guard's C-12 Huron fixed-wing aircraft facilitated the transport.

Upon reaching the hub locations of Bethel and Nome, Santa, Mrs. Claus and their helper elves continued their journey to Tuluksak on November 14 via Army Guard UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters loaded with all the gifts.

Hanna Alexie, a kindergarten teacher in Tuluksak, said her students looked out the classroom window eagerly awaiting the arrival of Santa and Mrs. Claus.

""The students were very excited for this day, and today they were very anxious waiting,” she said. “They didn't want to take off their coats too, waiting in our classroom. They couldn't wait for you guys.""

Jerry Hawk, a community member, expressed gratitude for the rare gathering. He emphasized the significance of bringing the community together to celebrate the holiday.

""The best part was bringing my grandkids over here with everybody, with the community,” said Hawk. ""The peace of joy, the peace of God is within us.

""I'd like to thank everybody that came over, the [National Guard], Santa Claus, and all the presents, and all the people that came here,” said Hawk. “I'd like to wish everybody a Merry Christmas. Thank you.”

The Inupiat Eskimo village of Golovin welcomed Santa, Mrs. Claus and festive volunteers to the Martin L. Olson School gymnasium in Golovin, Alaska, for Operation Santa Claus, Nov. 30, 2023.

Two weeks later, the jolly bunch continued the heartwarming journey to Golovin on November 30, where local cheerleaders led chants and performed choreographed routines while welcoming the festive visitors.

Donna Katchatag, tribal coordinator, said, the community ""prepared desserts, cookies, lemonade, and all the decorating was the help of the kids also.""

Katchatag was a young student the last time Operation Santa Claus visited.

“I don’t have any memories besides him leaving, and I was wondering, why is Santa leaving in a helicopter?” said Katchatag.

It is an Operation Santa Claus tradition that the festivities kick off with everyone singing “Jingle Bells.” Students were then called one by one to meet and take a photo with Santa and receive personalized gifts and candy canes.

In the interior, gifts destined for Fort Yukon were loaded onto the Black Hawk at Ladd Army Airfield on Fort Wainwright, ensuring a direct and efficient delivery December 1.

The program visits the community of Koyuk over the first two weeks of December, promising more holiday magic for these remote areas.

KINDERHOOK, N.Y. - New York Army National Guard Maj. Gen. Michel Natali commemorated the 241st birthday of former President Martin Van Buren Dec. 5 by laying a wreath from the White House at the eighth president’s grave.

The presentation of the wreath from President Joseph Biden marked the climax of a ceremony that featured wreath presentations from local officials, volunteer groups and the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site.

The New York Army National Guard also provided a color guard and honor cordon for the ceremony, along with a bugler to sound taps and a military chaplain to open and close the ceremony.

New York Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Alison Ogden, a member of Joint Force Headquarters who participated in the honor cordon, said she was proud to participate in the ceremony for the second time.

”It is good for the military to be part of local events like this one,” Ogden said.

Natali, the assistant adjutant, Army, for the New York National Guard, praised Van Buren, who served from 1836-1840, for his efforts to keep the United States from going to war with Great Britain over border disputes in Maine and Americans’ support for a rebellion in Canada. Van Buren also refused to support the annexation of Texas as a state to avoid war with Mexico, Natali noted.

Since 1967, the current occupant of the White House has sent wreaths to be presented at the gravesites of former presidents on their birthdays, Natali said.

The ceremony at the Kinderhook Reformed Cemetery, hosted by Kinderhook Mayor Michael Abrams, included remarks by Megan O’Malley, the superintendent of the Martin Van Buren Historic Site, and a presentation by children from Ichabod Crane Primary School.

Natali said it was important to hold events like this to tie the legacy of the past to the present.

Jane Miller, the president of the Friends of Lindenwald, a volunteer group that supports the National Historic Site, said she appreciated the National Guard participating in the annual tradition in Kinderhook.

“We need to remember that our nation was shaped by people like Martin Van Buren,” Miller said.

He was the son of a Dutch tavern owner who worked and studied hard to become a lawyer and important political leader, she said.

Van Buren was the first president born as an American citizen rather than a subject of the King of England. He was also the only president not to have spoken English as his first language, having grown up speaking Dutch, and the first president from New York.

Before running for president in 1836, Van Buren, a lawyer, served as a New York state senator, attorney general, and governor of New York. He was secretary of state for President Andrew Jackson and vice president during Jackson's second term.

Shortly after taking office in 1837, an economic downturn known as the Panic of 1837 hit. Businesses closed, people lost their jobs, and the agricultural economy took a hit.

Van Buren ran for re-election in 1840 but was defeated by William Henry Harrison. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1844 but lost to James K. Polk.

In 1848, he was the unsuccessful presidential candidate of the Free-Soil Party, a group opposing an extension of slavery. That defeat marked the end of his political career.

Van Buren, known as Old Kinderhook because of his hometown, supposedly gave the English language the term OK. During his run for office, OK clubs were organized to support him. He also initialed papers with the letters OK to indicate he approved.

Van Buren died in 1862 during the Civil War.

The New York Army and Air National Guard headquarters traditionally conduct the wreath presentations at the grave of former President Chester A. Arthur in Menands and Van Buren in Kinderhook. The New York Air National Guard's 107th Airlift Wing in Niagara Falls honors former President Millard Fillmore.

KINDERHOOK, N.Y. -- New York Army National Guard Maj. Gen. Michel Natali commemorated the 241st birthday of President Martin Van Buren on Tuesday, December 5, by laying a wreath from the White House at the eighth president's grave in Kinderhook.

Van Buren also refused to support the annexation of Texas as a state, in order to avoid war with Mexico, Natali noted.

Since 1967, the current occupant of the White House has sent wreaths to be presented at the gravesites of former presidents on their birthdays, Natali said.

The ceremony at the Kinderhook Reformed Cemetery, hosted by Kinderhook Mayor Michael Abrams, included remarks by Megan O’Malley, the superintendent of the Martin Van Buren Historic Site, and a presentation by children from Ichabod Crane Primary School.

Van Buren, O’Malley said, was happy being at home in Kinderhook, where he was born and grew up and lived most of his, she said. He would have appreciated a home grown ceremony like the one she was speaking at, she said.

The elementary school students gave a presentation about Martin Van Buren’s life and sang happy birthday to the president.

“It was excellent to have the kids here,” Natali said.

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – As two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters approached to rescue his battle buddies, then-Sgt. 1st Class Rick Dean was impressed by how closely they circled above before landing together in a tight space.

Dean had only set up the landing zone for one helicopter, not aware that a pair of them would arrive to medically evacuate two of his friends from a dangerous area near Baghdad.

But then they both touched down without hesitation.

“I was unbelievably amazed at the proficiency and skill level of the two crews that landed there,” he recalled, saying he found out later they often respond in pairs. “It was awe-inspiring.”

The incident later convinced Dean to pay it forward. He decided to switch careers from artilleryman to helicopter pilot, a role where he went on to provide similar support for many other military members.

On Friday, U.S. Army Aviation Battalion–Japan honored Dean’s 26-year career as he flew an Army helicopter for the final time. After he landed it at Camp Zama’s Kastner Airfield, his helicopter was sprayed with water and well-wishers doused him in champagne as part of an aviation tradition that dates back to World War II.

Over the course of his service, Dean, now a chief warrant officer 4, had logged 1,900 flight hours in 14 countries, including combat zones. And for the most part, those hours flew right on by.

“Now that you’re at the end, you’re like, ‘Wow, where did the time go?’” he said. “It went pretty fast.”

Medevac pilot

As a child, Dean dreamed of being in the Army and to follow in the footsteps of his grandfathers who had both served in WWII.

In 1997, he signed up for artillery and then completed additional training as a paratrooper. While stationed in Alaska, he remembered the invigorating experience of jumping out of planes in the winter.

After a deployment to Afghanistan a few years later, Dean returned to combat in 2006 and his tour was extended for the Iraq War troop surge.

Dean, who was a squad leader responsible for several young men, said the sight of helicopters would bring him a sense of relief as they kept an eye on them from above.

Once, while his unit conducted a patrol, Dean said an AH-64 Apache helicopter pilot warned them that a stretch along the dirt path ahead of them had been disturbed, possibly hiding a roadside bomb. The pilot then safely guided the Soldiers around it.

“Just to see the helicopters fly overhead,” he said, “it was something that gave you a lot of confidence to know that somebody’s up there watching over everything.”

As fighting intensified during the deployment, Dean said many Soldiers would still require a medical evacuation, including his battle buddies.

Dean and his unit were on a patrol when one of their vehicles hit an anti-tank mine, causing it to flip over. Two of the Soldiers inside the vehicle were badly wounded but would survive after being quickly flown by helicopter to a medical facility.

Despite his fear of heights, Dean said he aspired to be a pilot after that so he could be there for other Soldiers if needed.

Following flight school, Dean was initially assigned to an aviation unit at Fort Riley, Kansas, that mainly transported dignitaries. But he said he fought to get transferred to a “dust-off” medevac unit and served two more combat tours, where he assisted in numerous lifesaving missions.

“Having been on the ground where we needed medevac, I knew how important it was when I was flying it,” he said. “It’s an incredibly important mission.”

Big presence

Standing at 6 feet, 3 inches tall, the burly-sized Dean is easily recognizable wherever he goes.

His contributions have also been significant for the aviation battalion here, which conducts general support operations across the U.S. Army Pacific region.

“He is probably one of the most genuinely honest and outgoing people that I’ve ever met,” said Chief Warrant Officer 4 Jake Schmidt, the battalion aviation standardization pilot and senior warrant officer.

“He just has that presence that more or less attracts people to him, especially here in Japan where he is quite bigger than everybody else,” he said, smiling. “Naturally, people like to gravitate toward him.”

Dean, 46, who is an avid hiker, has climbed Mount Fuji seven times in the past three years, and many of those trips he organized to help friends and co-workers scale Japan’s tallest mountain.

As an aviation mission survivability officer, Dean has also trained tactics to crew members on how to safely fly Black Hawks against different threats.

“He is the subject-matter expert when it comes to that and guides us through all that training,” Schmidt said.

While in the cockpit, Dean had the opportunity to support earthquake disaster relief exercises and assault training with Japan Ground Self-Defense Force units.

Schmidt, who was in the same class of Warrant Officer Candidate School as Dean in 2008, said it was great to see a familiar face when he arrived at the battalion a year ago.

“He is going to be missed for sure around here,” Schmidt said. “He does so much stuff for us.”

And during those stressful times, Dean could always be counted on to help lighten the mood thanks to his contagious laugh, Schmidt said.

“To have that relationship with other people that you work with,” he said, “it just goes a long way to making your job more enjoyable.”

Next chapter

Before he officially retires, Dean plans to participate in the Career Skills Program, which allows Soldiers transitioning out of the Army to learn a new trade and improve their civilian employment options.

Like the job change he previously made in the Army, from combat arms to aviation, his next career move will also veer in a new direction.

Dean said he will return to his home state of New Hampshire to do an apprenticeship to learn how to be a blacksmith, a hobby of his that he started in high school.

While it will be his first foray into trying the profession full time, his motive to pursue it remains the same — to help others.

Once fully certified, he hopes to instruct lessons on blacksmithing at retreats that support former military members dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“I would like teach them another trade or something else they can try out,” he said.

Life after the Army will be bittersweet for Dean. While he jokingly said he looks forward to no more slideshow briefings, he will miss the camaraderie with his teammates.

“I will definitely stay in touch with as many as I can,” he said. “That’s the hardest part about leaving is not having them around.”

But his departure from the Army will also open the door to a new adventure in his lifelong journey.

“I don’t look at it as an ending,” he said, “but more as ‘on to the next chapter.’”

FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. — Screaming Eagle Division Soldiers here just completed training and testing the Army’s 6.8mm family of Next Generation Squad Weapon-Rifle (NGSW-R), NGSW-Automatic Rifle (AR) and the NGSW-Fire Control (FC) systems.

Troops of Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and members of 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, undertook New Equipment Training on the NGSW.

""The New Equipment Training gave the Soldiers a good base before coming out and using the NGSWs,” said Infantryman Sgt. Jack Scott, a team leader in Alpha Company.

Their training covered the similarities and differences between the new weapons and the legacy 5.56mm M4A1 Carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon systems, focusing on enhanced lethality.

“We did a lot of training with both static and maneuver ranges, so the product of Soldier you get now, during the live fire, is high quality due to all of that training,” added Scott.

Once complete with new equipment training, Soldiers tested the NGSW in a Limited User Test, or LUT, in a crawl-walk-run method to ensure all operational data is collected on the weapon, as well as user integration with the new equipment.

Alpha Company and 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment initially conducted static qualification and variable distance ranges with legacy weapon systems and NGSW, to compare performance of both and give Soldiers repetitions and familiarity with the NGSW.

Alpha Company 1st Sgt. Justin Babb appreciated the benefits of participating in an operational test and the opportunity for his junior Soldier’s feedback to contribute and impact Army modernization.

“The candid feedback that the Soldiers and NCOs provided during focus groups and surveys will provide the Army with perspective from the lowest level of user that will actually use the system,” said Babb.

Major differences between the legacy M4, M249 systems and the NGSWs were immediately noticeable by the Soldiers.

Spec. Maximiliano Arguindegui, an automatic rifleman with 1/75th Ranger Regiment, said, ""Overall, I feel faster with the M249, but I prefer the NGSW-AR because it makes me more lethal.""

Scott added, ""Stopping power with the 6.8 round is a big improvement compared to the M4 and M249 and having the ability to use with or without the suppressor is a huge feature for the support by fire element.""

Leaders of Alpha Company also said participating in a test with the Operational Test Command enabled them to get after their internal readiness.

Alpha Company Commander, Capt. Jordan Mares, said, “Being a part of the NGSW test absolutely supported our company readiness. The LUT gave us opportunities to hone our craft, practice lessons learned with feedback from subject-matter experts, and the ability to conduct a lot of repetitions to practice small unit tactics.""

Staff Sgt. Ivan Alvarez, a Squad Leader with Alpha Company, was initially skeptical of the NGSW.

""When we first started the LUT, I was very against the NGSW-R,” he said. “I'm used to the M4 — it's lighter — I'm used to the recoil, the engagements, everything the M4 has to offer. But, as we went through the LUT with the NGSW-R, I can see the capabilities that it brings to an infantryman, especially at a longer distance.""

Alvarez also said testing the new weapons gave his squad added training opportunities.

""We got after a lot of training that we would normally have to wait months to set up and accomplish,” he said. “We were able to get more marksmanship time, more range time, and were able to train under various environmental conditions.""

Another squad leader with the Rangers provided his observations on the training benefit while participating in an operational test.

“We were able to get reps in on a new weapon system as well as our legacy equipment,” said Sgt. Joseph Martin. “We were able to train on many basic things that we want to train on every year, but condensed to get more repetitions, as well as live fire iterations for our younger, inexperienced Soldiers.”

About the U.S. Army Operational Test Command:

As the Army’s only independent operational tester, OTC tests Army, joint, and multi-service warfighting systems in realistic operational environments, using typical Soldiers to determine whether the systems are effective, suitable, and survivable. OTC is required by public law to test major systems before they are fielded to its ultimate customer — the American Soldier.

The Maneuver Test Directorate, based at West Fort Cavazos, Texas, is OTC’s lead directorate for conducting independent operational testing of Infantry, Armor, and robotic systems to inform acquisition and fielding decisions for the Army and select joint Warfighting systems. Poised, ready, and always able, MTD is the “go to” test directorate to provide Army Futures Command and senior Army leadership with truthful test feedback they need to make informed decisions as to what capabilities will be brought to bear against future adversaries in a Multi-Domain Battle environment."

SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — When he returned from a tour in Iraq as the commander of the Oregon National Guard’s 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team in 2009, then-Army Col. Daniel Hokanson saw how the unit’s 3,500 personnel returned to their communities.

“We brought the fabric of America to the war because there are no active-duty bases in Oregon, they came from every corner of the state,” said Hokanson, the Guard Bureau chief. “They were teachers, police officers, firemen … and they deployed. Then they came back to their community, and they showed, look, you can do this. You can serve and you can go back and reintegrate into your communities.”

At the 2023 Reagan National Defense Forum — an annual gathering of national security and defense leaders — Hokanson spoke about recruiting and readiness and listened to remarks from key leaders.

During his keynote address, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III painted the backdrop of the current global environment as “challenging,” citing “the major conflicts facing our fellow democracies, Israel and Ukraine; bullying and coercion from an increasingly assertive China; and a worldwide battle between democracy and autocracy.”

“And let me be blunt about our mission,” Austin said. “The U.S. military is here to win our country’s wars — and to win them decisively. We will always try to deter conflict. But if we have to defend our country, we will fight — and we will win.”

On the recruiting front, the DoD is in competition with corporate America for the same talent pool, especially in high-tech areas like cyber defense and space. This issue was heightened in the wake of the pandemic. Employers have been offering incentives once unique to the military, including education benefits and healthcare packages.

In the 2023 Reagan National Defense Forum survey — a public opinion poll — about half of the respondents would encourage a friend or family member to join the military for reasons of patriotism, service and honor. More than 20% responded that a key point to discourage service is that it’s too dangerous and not worth the risks.

Hokanson joined U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Under Secretary of the Army Gabriel O. Camarillo, and Karl Rove to discuss these issues on the “Celebrating and Encouraging Service: How to Boost Recruitment and Ensure Readiness” panel.

Camarillo acknowledged recruiting as a long-term challenge for the Army. The service announced a major overhaul of its recruiting operations in October.

“This is the biggest transformation since the all-volunteer force was established in 1975,” Camarillo said of Army recruiting, citing increased prospecting and marketing and a revamped recruiting workforce to closer resemble Fortune 500 companies.

Hokanson sees recruiting as a tactical matter with strategic implications.

The Guard is 20% of the joint force funded at 4% of the defense budget. With about 430,000 members, it is the second largest military organization after the Army. There are eight full Army divisions and 90 Air wings within the Guard.

Hokanson emphasized that the National Guard exists to fight and win America’s wars as the Army and Air Force combat reserve. He noted that many Guardsmen either joined or renewed their commitment to serve after 9/11, with an expectation to deploy or mobilize overseas.

He said Guardsmen bring “a treasure trove” of experience and expertise.

The Air National Guard won big in September’s Air Force William Tell fighter competition. The Vermont Guard’s 158th Wing earned the title of top F-35 Wing, along with other individual awards.

Four Army National Guard sniper teams emerged as the best contenders in the 2023 International Sniper Competition, and all finished in the top 10, with the Guard taking first place.

The Guard is also at the forefront of future warfighting domains. The Army Guard has more than 1,095 Soldiers working in cyber units. There are more than 11,500 Airmen assigned to Air Force cyber specialty codes in the Air Guard.

In September, Hokanson presented a joint Guard cyber team with the 2022 SANS NetWars Department of Defense Services Cup, marking the third consecutive year the Guard team has won the cybersecurity competition.

“These Soldiers and Airmen embody the best of the Guard: experts in their civilian jobs who use their skills to serve their states and nation,” he said.

This warfighting posture enables the Guard to perform the most visible of its missions.

“Because we’re manned, trained and equipped to do arguably the most difficult task there is,” Hokanson said, “you can ask us to do almost anything within the local communities, and we will be there immediately to respond.

“We provide Guardsmen the opportunity to respond to their communities in times of need.”

Other panelists echoed the appeal of serving in the Guard.

“Because the [Guard] mission is right in front of you,” Cramer said, “you’re helping your neighbors during a flood or rescuing people in a snowstorm. And I think that does resonate.”

The CNGB spoke of the value and flexibility the Guard offers its members to serve as part-time Citizen-Soldiers or -Airmen.

“Many of our Guardsmen are college students because they can go to school and serve at the same time,” Hokanson said. “Another great advantage is if you’re from Des Moines, Iowa, or Medford, Oregon, and your family’s there and you want to live there, we offer you the opportunity to do all that.”

Still, Hokanson said the Guard is focused on connecting with the groups that have little or no association with the military.

He encourages Guardsmen to tell the story of the Guard, which includes almost 7.5 million personnel days supporting combatant commands at home and around the world. Last year, more than 8,500 people were rescued from disasters, and four countries were added to the 100-nation Department of Defense National Guard State Partnership Program.

A Pentagon data point says that 78% of those who entered military service had an immediate family member, friend or relative in the military.

“The difficult thing is, if you’ve not had contact with somebody in the military, and if you get your perception of the military from what you see on the news or the stuff that grabs headlines, you could have potentially a negative view of it,” Hokanson said.

“But those that actually know servicemembers realize there are great advantages and incredible opportunities,” he said.

The Guard has seen steady improvement in recruiting new members since the disruption of the pandemic, while retention is at historically high levels. Hokanson summarized some of his key initiatives to continue these trends.

“No-cost healthcare for our Guardsmen, the same incentive pay as active-component Soldiers and Airmen and duty status reform,” he said. “And our whole goal is for every Guardsman to have two retirements: their National Guard and civilian retirement.""

We want to show the value of serving our country and the long-term payback for you and your family,” he said.

LATHAM, New York – The New York Army National Guard’s 53rd Troop Command welcomed back a commander during a unit change of command ceremony held Sunday, Dec. 3, 2023, at the National Guard state headquarters.

Brig. Gen. Jack James, who commanded the 53rd Troop Command from 2019 to 2021, took over from Brig. Gen. Joseph Biehler, who replaced James in command in 2021. James had been serving as a deputy division commander for the 42nd Infantry Division.

Biehler has been selected to take command of the 42nd Infantry Division in the coming year.

Biehler, a veteran of deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait, said all credit for his success as a commander of the 53rd belong to the Soldiers of the unit.

“Truth be told, this was an excellent unit when I took command two years ago, and it remains an excellent unit today,” Biehler said. “The leaders and Soldiers made this job incredibly easy for me.”

James is an Army aviator who led the command from 2019-2021 and prior to that, led the 42nd Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade.

According to Maj. Gen. Ray Shields, the adjutant general for New York, who presided over the ceremony, James accepted the assignment without hesitation.

“I’m sure you never expected to be coming back to command the 53rd again,” Shields said to James. “When faced with finding a replacement for Biehler as the commanding general, only one name came to mind – Jack James.”

“I can’t thank you enough for accepting command of the 53rd for a second time so readily, and I know your leadership will ensure success of the 53rd and the New York Army National Guard,” Shields said.

James said that he was anxious to get to work alongside the Soldiers of the 53rd Troop Command again.

“I am grateful for this opportunity to continue to serve our New York National Guard and our fellow Soldiers in this position of responsibility,” James said.

“What an incredible honor – to command American Soldiers. I will not let you down,” James added.

Biehler is expected to take command of the 42nd Infantry Division headquarters in the new year as the unit prepares for mobilization and deployment in 2025 to the Middle East.

“Your experience makes you the ideal person for the role as the next division commander,” Shields said to Biehler. “You are the right leader for this upcoming deployment. It is a big job ahead, but we know that you’re up to it.”

Biehler, a Finance Director for L3 Harris Technologies in Rochester in his civilian career, told the formation of Soldiers that his leadership role with the unit was meaningful to him.

“It has been an honor to lead the 53rd Troop Command,” Biehler said. “There is no comparison in the civilian world than being a commander in an Army unit,” he said."

APPLETON, Wis. - One hundred and five years after the horrific battle that caused his wounds, a Wisconsin National Guard veteran received his Purple Heart medal at a ceremony Nov. 11 at Outagamie County Courthouse.

Pvt. George C. Arts, a member of Company I, 127th Infantry Regiment, was wounded Aug. 4, 1918 during the Second Battle of the Marne. The 32nd Division, composed of Wisconsin National Guard and Michigan National Guard Soldiers, had just arrived from the trenches of Alsace, Germany, to be part of the assault on the heavily fortified town of Fismes.

The 32nd began its advance Aug. 2, 1918, and gained 15 kilometers in two days of fierce fighting. The 127th moved on the town of Fismes on Aug, 4, capturing the town despite suffering horrific losses.

“In those eight days, some of the best German divisions put up a terrific fight to stem the advance,” Lt. Col. Byron Beveridge wrote in his historical sketch of the Wisconsin National Guard.

Capt. Paul Schmidt, commander of Company C of the 127th Infantry, wrote that the Germans spared no effort to make Fismes impregnable.

“Huge stores of ammunition and engines of destruction were located here,” Schmidt said, “and preparations made to withstand the most formidable attack.”

During the bloody fighting that day, Gen. Pairron de Mondesir, commander of the 38th French Corps, observed the American troops in combat against the Germans. When he learned that the 32nd Division had taken all the German strong positions to the north of the Ourcq and had dug in and were holding their ground, he exclaimed, “Oui, Oui, les soldats terrible, tres bien, tres bien!” In English, that translates to “Yes, yes, terrible soldiers, very good, very good!”

The meaning of Mondesir’s use of the word “terrible” is “terrifying” or “formidable,” and his appraisal of the 32nd Division resulted in an official citation giving the division the nom de guerre of Les Terribles. The 32nd Division was the only American division to receive a nickname from an allied nation during the war.

Arts was one of thousands of Division Soldiers wounded in the assault by machine gun fire and gas artillery shells, suffering a fractured left knee and a bullet wound to his right hip. He was hospitalized in Europe for six months. In March 1919, he arrived at Fort Dodge, Iowa, for additional medical treatment. In August 1920, Arts was honorably discharged at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, with a medical rating of poor.

The U.S. military did not issue Purple Hearts at this time for battlefield injuries, but Arts was authorized to wear the American Expeditionary Force wound chevron to indicate he was wounded in combat. After the Purple Heart was reinstated in 1932, wounded veterans of any U.S. military campaign could apply for this award. However, Arts continued to suffer from complications of his wounds and died on Dec. 10, 1928, at the age of 35.

“If George received the wound chevron and sustained such injuries, why did he not receive the Purple Heart?” Kim Craddock of the Fox Valley Veterans Council asked during the Nov. 11 ceremony.

U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher’s office became involved, and after contacting the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, was able to confirm Arts’ eligibility for the Purple Heart medal in less than three weeks.

“Congressman Gallagher and I and the rest of our staff could not be more happy to collaborate and serve in this instance,” said staff member Kerry Niemceke. “The result is a fitting reminder to all in our community of the sacrifice of our veterans and to the sacrifice of the family members who wish to remember them.”

Mike Muthig, Arts’ grandson, said the approval process likely was aided because the family had kept his documents. He said there was always a strong family connection with his grandfather.

“I have always known my middle name was from him, and I've always felt a connection even though I never met him,” Muthig said. “When my mother passed, the name George Cornelius Arts was the last words she spoke on this Earth. And she never knew her father either, because he passed when she was only 17 months old.

“I promised my mother that people would remember the name George Arts,” Muthig continued. “To me the presentation of the award of the Purple Heart to the family was both the fulfilling of a promise and the completion after 105 years of appropriate recognition of extraordinary sacrifice.”

Command Sgt. Maj. Ryan Johnson, the current senior enlisted leader of the 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry Regiment, presented the medal to Muthig at the ceremony. Johnson is also a Purple Heart recipient for wounds suffered during his deployment to Iraq in 2004-05.

“We felt it was fitting, with me being a recipient,” Johnson explained, “as well as being the current command sergeant major for the 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry, which was the battalion Pvt. Arts fought with.”

The Fox Valley Veterans Council also presented the family with a replica of Arts’ wound chevron.

MACAPA, Brazil — Forty-four Soldiers from the New York National Guard, working alongside active-duty Army and Brazilian Army Soldiers, recently concluded three weeks of training in Northern Brazil from Nov. 1 to 16, 2023.

Exercise Southern Vanguard 24 brought Soldiers from the 258th Field Artillery Battalion, 466th Medical Company, Area Support, the 133rd Composite Support Company, the 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment and 138th Public Affairs Detachment to the cities of Belem, Macapa and Oiapoque.

The New York National Guard Soldiers learned how to survive in the Brazilian jungle and participated in and supported tactical operations and training while providing medical support to Soldiers during the exercise.

New York Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Isabel Smith, director of joint staff for the New York National Guard, explained that this training operation helped prepare both countries for rapid deployment and improved readiness in response to crisis or contingency.

“Exercising together allows our armies to increase interoperability and demonstrates a shared commitment,” Smith said.

New York has worked alongside Brazil through the National Guard’s State Partnership Program since 2019, executing bilateral military and civilian engagements in order to increase partner capacity and capability, Smith said.

The New York Guardsmen trained alongside Soldiers from U.S. Army South, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), the 7th Special Forces Group and the 1st Security Forces Assistance Brigade, as well as over 1,000 Brazilian army personnel assigned to Brazil’s 52nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Brigade.

New York Army National Guard Maj. Shelly Respecki, commander of the 466th, said she believed that the opportunity to learn about the jungle from the Brazilian Army was an invaluable experience from a medical perspective.

The unit provided medical support and supply throughout the exercise and treated a variety of injuries such as heat-related illnesses, environmental threats and emergency trauma, Respecki said.

“The course allows our Soldiers to understand what threats and risks are involved with training in the jungle,” said Respecki. “We’ll be better able to treat the participants knowing what they’re going through and how to survive in the jungle if needed to potentially sit on a patient.”

While they learned to operate in a new environment, they found a sense of familiarity in some of their missions as well, the Soldiers said.

Guardsmen from the 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment integrated with the 23rd Jungle Infantry Brigade’s staff section for the duration of the exercise to support operations.

The public affairs Soldiers from the 138th supported media relations in conjunction with Army South counterparts, according to Capt. Stephanie Fernadez, the detachment commander.

The four artillerymen from the 258th Field Artillery, spent a lot of time with Brazilian gunners, according to Capt. Anthony Migliore, the assistant battalion fire support officer for the 258th’s B. Battery.

“I spent most of my time at the gun-line yesterday and it was just like being back at A Battery or B Battery with the 258th,"" Migliore said.

He provided fires planning support for a scenario involving attacks on enemy objectives, during the exercise, Migliore said.

Spc. Myeonghyeon Chang, a water treatment specialist from the 133rd, said she got a lot of experience working in her specialty during the exercise.

“It’s been a really great experience for me, especially since this is my first time being in a Latin American country,” she said.

Chang said she and others from the 133rd provided pure water for both Brazilian and American exercise participants. They also got the change to cross-trained on the 7th Special Forces Group’s water purification equipment.

Ultimately, Southern Vanguard provided Soldiers with more than just training, as they returned to New York having formed new relationships and fresh perspectives, and also got a chance to experience Brazilian culture, the Soldiers said.

“I had a lot of opportunities to learn about their culture, language and how the Brazilian Army works and operates. The food was definitely great too,” Chang said."

JOINT FORCES TRAINING CENTER CAMP SHELBY, Miss. – The 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, conducted annual training between July 23 and Aug. 4, 2023, and participated in Titan Warrior 23.

Titan Warrior 23 is an Army Reserve, multinational, multifunctional, military police exercise with a detention operations focus. The 290th Military Police Brigade, 200th Military Police Command hosted the exercise. Approximately 900 Soldiers participated this year.

The battalion’s training included mobilization and deployment exercises that took the unit from Joint Base San Antonio, Texas, to Camp Shelby, Miss.

Upon arrival at Titan Warrior, Soldiers conducted interrogations and debriefings at a newly established expeditionary Joint Interrogation Debriefing Center. The battalion staff also rehearsed interfaces required to operate alongside military police units conducting detention operations missions.

The 304th and 160th Military Police Battalions, 290th Military Police Brigade, 200th Military Police Command operated Camp Bobcat, a simulated theater detention facility, while other units established detainee holding areas. There military intelligence Soldiers supported screening, questioning and interrogations of role players. Rehearsing shared custody and control of detainees is a critical skill.

Soldiers and officers from the 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion, 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command, participated in simulated interrogation operations and worked alongside the 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation) within the Joint Interrogation Debriefing Center.

U.S. Army Capt. Victoria Martin, assigned to the 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion, said that the training was well-planned and enhanced their comprehension of interrogation operations. “The training reinforced our understanding of JIDC operations and brought our home station training into perspective,” said Martin.

The training provided context to military intelligence task training previously conducted at home-station. Interrogators divided into shifts, which added realism. Contracted role players received intensive and detailed instruction that provided necessary cues during interrogations. Each session ended after Soldiers received feedback from role players and observer controller-trainers.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), through its Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) initiative, contributed an artificial intelligence surveillance system to oversee and manage detainees during Titan Warrior 23. This collaboration offered valuable insight into the integration of artificial intelligence within current detainee operations and intelligence doctrine.

URSA cameras and sensors mounted to robots, patrolled the camp exterior and monitored role player interactions. Military intelligence Soldiers and the military police were then able to glean valuable information regarding interpersonal associations inside of a detention facility. This cutting-edge AI solution supports possible modernization priorities within multiple fields.

Military intelligence Soldiers also received opportunities to train alongside soldiers from Canada and Belgium. The multinational contingent participated in detention facility operations.

U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Tenay Benes, battalion commander of the 338th Military Intelligence Battalion, said, ""The opportunity to test our screening, interrogation, debriefing, and interviewing tactics with our military police partners has proven to be invaluable. As a result of this exercise, we have discovered opportunities for increased collaboration and better coordination.” Benes elaborated, “We've also had a lot of Army fun here - riding helicopters, working with detainees, and playing with robots!""

The 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation) is a deployable interrogation battalion assigned to the Military Intelligence Readiness Command’s Interrogation Group. The unit is headquartered in San Antonio Texas."

MARIETTA, Ga. - More than 80 Soldiers of the Georgia National Guard’s 201st Regional Support Group Forward returned home Dec. 1 after a nearly year-long deployment to Europe. Soldiers and family members were reunited during a welcome home ceremony at the Clay National Guard Center in Marietta.

“You represent the very best of our nation,” said Maj. Gen. Dwayne Wilson, commander of the Georgia Army National Guard. “All of you have performed in an exceptional manner over the last 10 months.”

During their deployment, the Soldiers of the 201st RSG supported base operations for more than 60,000 personnel at multiple stations throughout Europe. Their mobilization was part of a rotation of U.S. military forces that conduct multinational training and operations with allies to build regional security.

“You had a very challenging mission and a very unique mission, providing support to nine forward operating sites across four countries … delivering unparalleled support to U.S. and NATO forces,” said Wilson. “Our forces in Europe are more capable because of you, and our world is safer because of you.”

The 201st RSG comprises a diverse group of units with specialty response missions, supporting overseas combat and domestic emergency response operations.

The 201st RSG has deployed units and personnel multiple times since its 2004 organization. Soldiers of the 201st mobilized to Afghanistan from 2011-2012 and 2013-2014. In 2018, Soldiers of the 201st mobilized to Iraq, serving as base operating support integrator for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve. Subordinate units of the 201st RSG have also supported operations in Korea and Egypt.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, more than 30,000 Citizen-Soldiers and Citizen-Airmen of the Georgia National Guard have deployed to support overseas missions.

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – The first-ever Okinawa Care for Caregivers Symposium was recently held at Torii Station to better inform those who help others of the self-care resources available to them.

The symposium, which the 10th Support Group’s unit ministry team hosted, focused on providing self-care tools to Army, Navy and Air Force religious support teams, while allowing them to collaborate with various enablers on Okinawa and discuss ideas on how to stay resilient.

“This joint and interoperability effort enhances readiness by equipping our UMTs and enablers to connect our Soldiers to the valuable resources in the community,” said Chaplain (Maj.) Neal Muasa, the lead organizer.

About 25 individuals participated in the event, including Col. J.P. Smith, command chaplain for U.S. Army Japan, and Lt. Col. Damon Saxton, chaplain for U.S. Army Garrison Japan.

Smith said a similar event may be held at Camp Zama in the future to ensure its community of enablers can come together.

“We always take care of Soldiers, and we always take care of families, but what do we do to take care of ourselves?” he said. “If we’re not taking care of ourselves, we’re going to be in a position where we’re burned out, we’re tired and we’re not able to give Soldiers our best.”

In the recent event, which took place Oct. 24 through 27, Saxton conducted training and led an interbranch, multidiscipline panel discussion on self-care for helping professionals.

Saxton, who previously served in a special operations unit, said the topic was very close to him, as caregivers can sometimes endure trauma vicariously when they see or hear the effects of it.

“I had heard some really tough things and had a couple of guys that had taken their own lives because of some of the experiences that they had,” he said. “And it was really hard, and I had to seek help from another caregiver to kind of get me back in the fight.”

By sharing his own story, Saxton hoped to convince others to seek assistance when needed.

“I wanted to make sure that everybody there, as they experience these challenging situations that we do in the field of caregiving, that they take care of themselves and each other,” he said.

Saxton said he appreciated how the UMTs on Okinawa brought everyone together for the event, which also had a kayaking physical training session led by the 1st Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group chaplain and a devotional by the 78th Signal Battalion chaplain.

The symposium concluded with remarks by the 10th SG commander, followed by a visit to the historic Hacksaw Ridge during a tour of Battle of Okinawa sites.

“These are all different units, but they all take care of each other,” Saxton said. “I think every time that we get the opportunity to work together, to see each other’s strengths, [being able] to build those relationships is absolutely key.”

Throughout the event, Smith said UMTs shared best practices for self-care and interacted with each other and with military and family life counselors, behavioral health specialists and other enablers in the area.

“We were able to basically learn from one another,” he said. “If you’re operating in isolation, you’re only understanding one perspective. We were able to hear from multiple perspectives, so when we walk away, we walk away with new tools on how to better care for ourselves.”

One of the lessons learned that was discussed was using a journal to take time to intentionally reflect on one’s work being accomplished.

“As long as we know that we are being value-added and we’re making a difference, it kind of keeps you energized,” Smith said. “But you’ve got to reflect on that, because otherwise we’re just on the go. We have to slow it down every now and then and process through the difference that it is actually making.”

Smith also suggested having breaks throughout the workday to reduce stress. He said he may take three to four short breaks, in addition to a lunch break, to walk around, breathe and relax.

“It’s all about staying sharp,” he said. “You’d be surprised at how well you will end up being when you do certain things like that [and] put certain mechanisms in place for yourself to where you stay sharp.”

STUTTGART, Germany - U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Steven Basham, U.S. European Command deputy commander, hosted Arnold Kammel, secretary general of the Austrian Ministry of Defense, and his staff at the command’s headquarters Nov. 30.

The meeting, aimed at identifying areas for future military cooperation, builds on a broadening relationship after Austria and the Vermont National Guard formalized their partnership under the State Partnership Program in 2022.

“Today’s meeting was another important step toward strengthening our relationship with a longstanding partner in Austria,” said Basham. “Our strategic partnership with Austria already includes cooperation for military mobility, information exchanges and military-to-military engagements through the State Partnership Program. We look forward to furthering our mutual commitment to realize a shared vision for European security.”

The two nations’ military-to-military engagement has steadily increased since the SPP partnership, including an air exchange in June in which the Vermont Air National Guard flew F-35s alongside Austrian Eurofighter Typhoons at Hinterstoisser Air Base near Zeltweg, Austria.

“Relations with the USA are of particular importance to Austria. The deepening of the strategic partnership with the USA, anchored in the Austrian government program and the growing State Partnership Program, underline this fact,” said Kammel. “As one of the key players in global security and defense policy, the USA is also relevant for Austria in other areas. Today’s talks mark a further point in the strengthening of joint cooperation.”

Cooperation between the United States and Austria has also included participation in the European Union’s Permanent Structured Cooperation program, enabling the movement of military personnel and assets within EU borders. That intra-European movement is pivotal to the U.S. ability to conduct military exercises and operations.

The State Partnership Program pairs National Guard units with allied and partner militaries to facilitate cooperation across all aspects of international civil-military affairs. The program has been successfully building relations for 30 years and now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe.

WASHINGTON — For the second straight year, first lady Jill Biden welcomed National Guardsmen, spouses and children to the White House to discuss their challenges and how best to support them.

The first lady heard stories of the pride and resilience children show in the face of frequent calls for their Guard parents to serve their nation, state and community.

“Our National Guardsmen and women have to be ready to go on support missions at a moment’s notice,” she told them. “And that means that their kids — all of you — know what it’s like to have your mom or your dad missing at the dinner table every time they’re called to duty.

“And you do it with humility and honor,” she said. “I want you to know that my husband, President Biden, and I are so grateful and so proud of all of you. We know it isn’t easy.”

Since 9/11, more than 1 million Guardsmen have deployed in support of operations around the globe. Because the National Guard is the combat reserve of the Army and Air Force, its members are trained and equipped to help with first-response efforts at home during a crisis.

Today, the Guard stands at more than 430,000 members strong. As the second largest military organization in the Department of Defense, its mission, motto and promise to America is to be Always Ready, Always There.

The National Guard is in about 2,800 communities — almost every ZIP code. Most Guardsmen serve part-time and balance their service with civilian careers and family responsibilities.

Kelly Hokanson, the National Guard senior spouse and mother of three service members, told the group that growing up as a military child is a sacrifice and a gift. Kelly’s husband, Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, is the 29th chief of the National Guard Bureau.

Gen. Hokanson has served in duty stations across the United States and deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.

“It’s a sacrifice of time with your family — a sacrifice every member of our community shares,” Kelly Hokanson said. “But it’s also a gift. A gift of compassion, service and unfathomable strength and resilience.”

Caleb Greico, 14, a New Jersey native, attended the event with his parents and sister, Penelope. He introduced Jill Biden to the group, a responsibility he relished.

“Thank you for inviting me and my family to the White House,” Caleb told her. “We are very honored to be here with you.

“It’s not just my family, but everyone here has a family member that has been contributing to this country.”

Caleb’s mom, Army Spc. Laura Greico, a signal support systems specialist assigned to Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 113th Infantry Regiment, 44th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, New Jersey National Guard, is preparing to deploy with her unit.

Caleb asked other children for advice on how to cope with a parent being gone for an extended time. Staying active and connected in community circles were common themes from those whose parents have deployed or been away for long durations.

“Focus on the stuff you enjoy and work on yourself,” said Aiden Buckner, 14, from New Mexico.

Aiden’s dad, Air Force Capt. Thomas Buckner, is the deputy commander of the New Mexico Guard’s 150th Civil Engineering Squadron.

“Try your best to work and focus on your goals,” Aiden said.

Eight-year-old Marina Munyabuhoro immigrated to America from a refugee camp in East Africa with her parents when she was 11 months old. Her father, Airman 1st Class Theogene Munyabuhoro, joined the New Hampshire National Guard and became an American citizen.

Marina told the first lady she wants to serve in the military “to honor my father’s legacy and to be a symbol of hope … and a good example to other immigrant kids.

And to protect and defend this blessed country.”

The president and first lady are familiar with National Guard service: their son, the late Army Maj. Beau Biden, served in the Delaware Guard, leaving behind his children to deploy on a tour in Iraq. It’s part of why Jill Biden helped establish Joining Forces to support service members, veterans and those they hold most dear.

She encouraged the children in attendance to share with their teachers, coaches and influential people in their lives that their parents serve.

“As a teacher, I ask my class, ‘Is anybody here militarily connected and what are your connections?’” she said. “That helps me to understand that they might be going through a rough patch or might be absent for a day.”

Guard leaders and families — more than 200 representing 36 states and territories — attended the event, which included a holiday presentation and the first lady’s unveiling of the 2023 White House “Magic, Wonder & Joy” holiday theme and decorations.

“We are grateful for everyone’s support of our National Guard families and especially of the children who are central to so many of our members’ lives and service,” Gen. Hokanson said. “We could not do what we do without the support of our families.”

VICENZA, Italy - In an effort to strengthen partnership and promote stability across the African continent, U.S. Army Reserve Civil Affairs Soldiers have embarked on a series of nine-month rotations, deploying in support of U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), to execute vital missions.

Civil Affairs Soldiers, often referred to as the ""bridge builders"" of the U.S. Army, play a crucial role in facilitating communication and cooperation between military forces and local communities. Their missions span a wide range of activities, from humanitarian assistance to civil-military projects. These skilled individuals serve as liaisons between the SETAF-AF and African partners, ultimately fostering goodwill and mutual understanding.

“We are a collection of Soldiers from across America, brought together to do this very important mission,” said Capt. Cody Miller, officer-in-charge of the SETAF-AF forward-deployed Civil-Military Operations Center. “Our companies are broken up into several small, 4-6 Soldier teams deployed throughout the continent of Africa. These teams interface directly with the civilian populations with the goal of strengthening partnerships.”

SETAF-AF provides U.S. Africa Command and U.S. Army Europe & Africa a dedicated headquarters to synchronize Army activities in Africa and scalable crisis response options throughout Africa and Europe. A key component to their success is to employ the experience and versatility of Army Reserve and Army National Guard units to execute missions across the African continent.

During their deployments, the civil affairs Soldiers assigned to SETAF-AF are actively engaged in African communities. They collaborate with local authorities, non-governmental organizations, and international partners to address critical issues. Such projects may include improving healthcare infrastructure, supporting educational initiatives, or aiding in disaster relief efforts. By doing so, they not only provide immediate relief, but also help communities become more self-sufficient and resilient in the long term.

""Africa is a continent of incredible diversity, and every country’s mission set is a unique challenge. I've seen firsthand how our work benefits African partners. It's about mutual respect and understanding, and when we can help a community achieve its goals, it's an incredible feeling,"" said Capt. Dominique Mosbly, SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Team 21 chief.

The majority of the U.S. Army’s civil affairs capability exists within the Army Reserve. These Soldiers serve part-time, typically one weekend a month and two-weeks a year. When not in an Army uniform, they work as police officers, business professionals, medical providers and school teachers, among many other professions. The SETAF-AF civil affairs teams harness these civilian expertise and skill sets to execute the mission.

""We employ a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach in our efforts to increase the region's security and stability. We integrate multiple host nation, US, and international partners into our work, which includes countering violent extremist organizations and helping build host nation institutional capacity,” said Maj. Jacqueline Li, Bravo Company Commander for the SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Battalion.

“As Army Reservists, the SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Soldiers bring a wealth of knowledge and experience from their civilian backgrounds that greatly assists them in their missions. This deployment is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and the Soldiers of Bravo Company are honored to be working with our West African partners,"" added Li.

Lt. Col. James A. Favuzzi, SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Battalion commander, provides guidance and oversight to the many civil affairs teams operating in Africa. For Favuzzi, the importance of these missions cannot be understated.

""Our Soldiers play a pivotal role in the effective execution of SETAF-AF activities. Their interaction with African partners, as well as the information they provide on civilian populations on the continent significantly contributes to our African strategy,” Favuzzi said.

SETAF-AF civil affairs Soldiers conduct multiple missions on the African continent each year, executing numerous civil-military events in support of the SETAF-AF mission to build capacity and strengthen relationships with African partners.

94,Fort Cavazos officials take proactive approach to deter workplace violence,https://www.army.mil/article/272033/fort_cavazos_officials_take_proactive_approach_to_deter_workplace_violence,"FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Fort Cavazos is one of 17 installations set to implement a program that focuses more on a proactive than a reactive approach to avert acts of workplace violence.

Motivated by incidents of violence that have plagued the Department of Defense through the years, the DOD Insider Threat Management and Analysis Center deployed the Prevention, Assistance and Response program to address indicators and elements of workplace violence and violent behavior at its earliest instance to minimize risk, maintain unit readiness and reduce movement along the critical path.

The PAR program utilizes a multidiscipline approach through collaboration with trained professionals, integrated prevention experts and key stakeholders to develop tailored mitigation strategies intended to provide commanders and civilian leaders with an understanding of overall risk within their organizations and options to care for their personnel.

“I am excited about the opportunity to host such a positive initiative,” expressed Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander. “The command is deeply committed to ensuring a strong vibrant command climate where everyone is free to excel and a program focusing on reducing workplace violence at Fort Cavazos is perfectly in line with our philosophy.”

The program is being introduced in three phases. The first focused on deploying PAR cadre to installations, establishing business rules and processes and conducting coalition building. The second phase will educate and train community members and increase awareness. The final phase represents the full implementation.

Drew Hunnicutt, Fort Cavazos PAR program coordinator, explained that the program is currently in its second phase and that PAR program coordinators are here to assist the Army with its mission and provide guidance.

“The PAR mission is to coordinate with the commanders of units,” he shared, “as well as law enforcement, intelligence agencies and counterintelligence agencies to identify if something might be going wrong as soon as possible and to get the person help.”

Each aspect of the program utilizes environmental factors such as personal predispositions, stressors, concerning behavior and hostile actions to identify potentially aggressive behavior. The program incorporates a multi-tiered methodology to recognize early warning signs, escalation and further escalation.

Prevention focuses on the execution of policies, programs, training or practices that aim to prevent workplace violence and prohibited abusive or harmful acts through recognizing personal predispositions.

Assistance emphasizes actions taken at the earliest indication of stress to provide access to necessary services or treatment to mitigate further risk by categorizing a variety of everyday stressors.

Response refers to actions taken to stop the violent threat and mitigate any damages done by the aggressor through identifying concerning behaviors.

Hunnicutt explained that PAR will work similarly to organizations such as the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program, the Employee Assistance Program and the Family Advocacy Program.

He emphasized that PAR is not an independent program or process, but part of the larger integrated prevention effort that works within the same operating procedures as other prevention efforts.

“We’re not here to have a redundancy on top of what Fort Cavazos is already doing,” he said. “We’re here to make sure that there is the coordination and assist with how we can really get these things that we have in place to really work together to get people off the critical pathway to violence.”

Full operations of the PAR program are slated to begin in October 2025, and Fort Cavazos leadership is in full support of the initiative.

“A violence-free workplace is not only a fundamental requirement for our mission but also a reflection of our values and dedication to the men and women who serve under our command,” Stokes said. “This initiative demonstrates the commitment to maintaining a safe and secure environment for personnel, enhancing morale and ensuring mission readiness. My role is to fully support and actively participate in the implementation of the initiative, prioritizing the safety and well-being of our service members and our Department of the Army civilians.”"

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place officially opened its doors for the 2023 holiday season Thursday with a ribbon cutting ceremony.

Dozens gathered in the facility to celebrate all of the hard work that went into filling the workshop’s toy vault as well as the organization’s 25th anniversary.

Brig. Gen. Thomas Felty, III Armored Corps deputy commanding general of maneuver, stopped by the event to express the leadership’s support for Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place. He expressed his gratitude to the many donors and volunteers who helped to fill the vault with so many toys.

“I’ve got goosebumps thinking about it,” he said. “When our Soldiers come in here, with all the elves, and they get to pick out toys, they’re just overwhelmed with joy and happiness at the opportunity to present their kids all of these wonderful gifts. (The emotions are) overwhelming for these young families and so it is a really, really big deal.”

Marizza Stokes, president of Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place, shared that last year, the organization provided toys to more than 1,600 children, with more than 800 families applying. This year, 973 families applied to Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place, meaning the organization hopes to provide toys for around 2,000 children.

Stokes said donations have made their goal a reality and shared that the organization received the largest donation in its history from the Jack D. Levy American Legion Riders Post 573 totaling $56,000.

“This is the largest donation Santa’s Workshop has ever received and we don’t know how to thank you,” Stokes said before presenting representatives of the American Legion Riders with a Santa-shaped diamond donor plaque.

After acknowledging the many other donors and volunteers, guests were invited to the vault where Felty and Santa Claus himself cut the ribbon, officially opening the vault. The vault was filled with a plethora of toys for children in different age ranges. There are also sensory toys for children with special needs.

When asked how she felt seeing all of their hard work coming to fruition and large support from the community, Stokes was at a loss of words.

“We could not do the quality of toys that we do for all of our families without these donations,” she said. “When the families come through the first thing they say is, ‘Oh my goodness, these are … really amazing toys.’”

Once a family is approved, they come into the workshop and an elf is assigned to them, who takes them around the facility so they can choose stocking stuffers, two toys per child, one book per child and a family board game. Stokes shared that the total package per child totals near $125 retail value, which the families receive completely for free.

Stokes has also been able to witness the lasting impact that Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place has had on the families that it has helped.

“This past weekend we had Santa at the Spouse’s (Club) Holiday Bazaar, and it was a little fundraiser for us,” she shared. “There was a young spouse with three little ones and she was messing with her phone. I said, ‘Can I help you?’ She said, ‘I’m trying to donate. I don’t have cash.’ I said, ‘You don’t have to donate.” She said, ‘You don’t understand, you saved our Christmas last year.’ That’s why we do it.”

Stokes shared that the organization is still looking for elves to volunteer to help families pick out the best toys for their children. She expressed that none of this would be possible without volunteers and encourages those who are interested to apply.

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Hundreds of cars lined up Nov. 15 in the Main Post Chapel parking lot here to receive Thanksgiving meal baskets where eager volunteers waited to greet them.

More than 100 Soldiers partnered together to put together the baskets that helped so many families who are in need this holiday season.

Sgt. Jesus Vazquez, 89th Military Police Brigade, said the preparation process for this giveaway began in June and it felt awesome to see all of the hard work culminate into finally being able to hand the food off to families.

“Knowing that after four months of coordination, families are going to be able to have meals on their table — it’s a great feeling,” he said, “especially knowing we brought together 150 Soldiers to make this happen today.”

Vazquez noted that when most people think of what they would receive from a food bank they think of canned food, but the baskets being given away at the event contained fresh produce including corn, potatoes and onions.

“We took it to the next level, knowing that we’re putting food on the table … that people want to eat and want to get,” he said. “Not that the canned food is not good, we just had the opportunity to bring something a little bit better for families.”

As they entered the drive through, families received a basket full of fixings including stuffing, desserts and fresh produce, provided by the Central Texas Food Bank who donated more than 21,000 pounds of food.

Sari Vatske, president and chief executive officer of the Central Texas Food bank, said the organization has provided food for this event for more than a decade. She was excited to see so much joy and said the organization was thankful for the opportunity to partner with Fort Cavazos.

“The camaraderie and the smiles and the happiness that goes into the holidays is just palpable and there’s so much that our military does for us,” she said. “It’s so important to be able to do this year-round but particularly on the holiday. We want to make sure that everyone has a traditional, happy holiday meal.”

Next, the drivers moved on to “Turkeyville,” as it was called by the volunteers there who were handing out the staple part of a Thanksgiving meal.

Chaplain (Capt.) Christopher Smartt, 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, and volunteer in Turkeyville, said it was a privilege to hand out turkeys to families.

“It’s a privilege to hand these out and to watch their faces as they receive these (turkeys),” he said. “You don’t know what they’re going through so just to be able to be here today as a community to be able to bless them … has been fantastic.”

The volunteers in Turkeyville greeted each car with a smile and asked the drivers how they planned on cooking the bird. Smartt said the positive attitude could make all the difference in the world for the recipients.

“(For) families coming to receive a box of food, what we’re worried about is that somebody might feel intimidated by it or maybe apprehensive,” he shared. “So when they come by, we tell them, ‘Hey, thank you for coming by. We’re glad to see you and Happy Thanksgiving,’ just so we can release any of that (tension) and let them know that we’re just glad that they’re here and that we hope (they) have a great Thanksgiving.”

He added that it was heartwarming to see so many people come together for such a great purpose.

“We’ve got different people from all over the post that are here today,” Smartt stated, “from all over Fort Cavazos, throughout different brigades, that are coming together for one purpose and that is to support one another. I love being a part of that. Nobody’s frowning, all smiles because it’s such a great cause. You can see it in everybody’s face. They love being a part of it too, something bigger than ourselves.”

Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, expressed her gratitude for the kindness for those who made a difference for many families at the Great Place, saying the donation of food and time showed great support for the military community.

“It is the contribution of others which truly makes a tremendous impact across our community providing for those in need,” she stated. “I truly believe as you give, you also receive a special feeling within your heart knowing your gift provides for deserving families. To our community partners, who continue to stand steadfast in their support with contributions that make a significant difference in the lives of our Soldiers and their families, we are immensely grateful for your support. Your donations exemplify the unity and support that exists within our community. It is heartening to witness the community continue to come together to support our Soldiers and their well-being.

“It assists in ensuring military families can enjoy a traditional Thanksgiving meal, fostering a sense of normalcy and unity during a time when they may be separated from a loved one due to military service,” she added. “Additionally, it eases the financial burden on the families, allowing them to allocate their resources to other essential needs, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being and morale.”"

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — The HOP initiated its first holiday transportation service here during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, making several stops, to include the Copeland Center, the Casey Memorial Library and Phantom Warrior Lanes.

The service is scheduled for a second run over the winter holidays and will extend to include the motor pool areas.

Fort Cavazos officials partnered with the Hill Country Transit District to provide transportation on the installation during the holidays to get a feel for how the HOP will run on post in the future and help boost morale during the holiday season, which can be especially difficult for Soldiers so far away from home and family.

The holiday service is pilot for the upcoming Cavazos Connector, which will provide mass transit service on post and throughout the local community.

“The post was kind enough to find us a home here, which will be based out of Fort Cavazos for all of our Fort Cavazos transit needs,” said Derek Czapnik, transportation superintendent for the HOP, during the Red, White and You hiring event earlier this month.

“This is going to be a game changer,” he said.

Darrell Burtner, director of urban operations for HCTD, said the organization is looking forward to the collaboration.

“We’re excited, and we really feel that this can make a huge difference to family morale on post and logistics as far as getting people from point A to point B. We’re looking forward to working together.

“I think historically the Army has done a great job as far as transporting Soldiers, but the transportation options for family members and dependents have not been as strong,” he added. “That is really the focus of this, to give them more options of not only getting around on base but also connect into the transit system immediately off post at the gate.”

Burtner explained that the transit system will eventually enable Soldiers to get wherever they need to go on base and connect into the HOP service in town, “so they can go anywhere from Copperas Cove, all the way out to Temple and really anywhere in between.”

To make things even more convenient, the HOP will launch an app for riders to order transportation, much like Uber or Lyft.

In an effort to help get Soldiers to breakfast and other early morning obligations, the upcoming holiday HOP will start slightly earlier from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. There will be no services on Dec. 25 or Jan. 1, 2024.

The holiday HOP is free of charge to anyone with access to the installation.

HCTD is also looking to hire dependents, spouses and veterans to fill part-time driver positions starting in February 2024. Positions start at $18 hourly, offer flexibility and the security of only driving on the installation. Commercial driver’s licenses are not required for the position.

98,TRADOC Hosts LPD on the Importance of Mentorship,https://www.army.mil/article/272019/tradoc_hosts_lpd_on_the_importance_of_mentorship,"TRADOC Hosts LPD on the Importance of Mentorship in the Workplace (Photo Credit: Nina Borgeson) VIEW ORIGINAL

JOINT BASE LANGLEY-EUSTIS, Va. – The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command’s leader professional development webinar series continued this week as Mr. Michael D. Formica, TRADOC deputy to the commanding general, and Mr. Nathan Whitaker, motivational speaker and former NFL executive, discussed the importance of mentorship in the workplace.

With leadership comes the responsibility to mentor those below you, as both Formica and Whitaker can attest to. With the wake of a new mentorship program developed by the TRADOC Civilian Human Resources Directorate, leader mentorship has become a great topic of discussion.

“The Army is a people business, and if a leader doesn’t acknowledge the aspirations of each individual on their team, there’s an essential piece of leadership that’s missing there,” Formica explained. “Mentorship can help inspire and enable their subordinates to reach their highest potential.”

As stated by Formica and Whitaker, the key qualities of a successful mentor are similar to those of an effective leader: character, trust, patience, empathy, and humility.

Whitaker elaborated on this with an anecdote on his experience working with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where their leadership had a character-based selection process during the NFL draft. This showed just how serious a player’s character is considered during such an important process.

Along with having good character values, Formica and Whitaker emphasized the value of empathy and demonstrating a genuine commitment to support the mentee.

“If leaders operate an organization where they demonstrate their desire to help subordinates improve their competence, they will be much more committed to the organization and its success,” Formica explained.

On the quality of humility, Whitaker stated that empathy and the ability to understand that we are all flawed as humans is one of the most important parts of being a positive mentor and develops a deeper sense of trust.

“If I’m willing to own my mistakes, that’s a powerful message [to the mentee],” Whitaker stated.

Formica expanded on this, adding that “humility is a key ingredient in mentorship, because when you recognize that, as a leader, you are fallible and that you will make mistakes and learn from them, you are opening up a learning environment of trust.”

With this comes a new opportunity for both parties to learn from each other, making the mentorship mutually beneficial.

“[Mentorship] must be a two-way street. I am amazed at how much I’m learning from mentees in the process of being a mentor,” expressed Formica as he shared his experience with the TRADOC mentoring program.

Earlier this year, the TRADOC Civilian Human Resources Directorate established the voluntary mentoring program as a personal and professional development opportunity for Army Civilians.

The program, which is available across the TRADOC enterprise, offers different mentoring approaches including cohort mentoring, peer mentoring, and reverse mentoring.

FORT LIBERTY, N.C. – Medical Soldiers with the 7458th Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Army Reserve Medical Commandb ran a weekend clinic as a part of the ongoing Operation Reserve Care Clinic (ORC) on Fort Liberty, North Carolina from November 3-5, 2023.

The goal of ORC is to aid Soldiers in staying medically ready to deploy at a moment's notice. By hosting a Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP) like event on the weekends, the providers of the 7458th MORU are meeting Soldiers around Fort Liberty and beyond to provide critical medical readiness functions. This saves time for the Soldiers, who may not have the ability or time to complete these assessments outside of the Army. Maj. Latasha Brown, the officer in charge of the ORC mission from the 7458th MORU, explained how this mission is critical to maintaining Soldier readiness.

“A lot of Soldiers have had really great Reserve Care experiences and it starts mainly with the staff,” she said. “They like the way the staff are in depth and really positive in their approach to the Soldiers. They actually really care and they are in depth with the Soldiers patient care, not just pushing them through the system. It is one stop, but they really take the time to sit with the Soldier and work with them through whatever challenges they may have while bringing their medical readiness to the green state. Coming to ORC, they were able to get good patient care where our providers care about their status while updating their health information and they were able to leave here with a positive outlook on their future. If they had problems that were just outlined, they were able to work through it and then they left with answers on how to correct those issues they had in the system.”

The ORC mission has been ongoing for seven years. It was initially implemented to relieve the military health contractors and ensure Soldiers were in compliance with Army medical health standards. Since then, it has served Soldiers conducting battle assembly weekend in the area, ensuring that they maintain medical readiness. The operation has had medical Soldiers from other regions look into performing their own versions of Operation Reserve Care clinics, although there have been resource issues in getting these programs off the ground. Sgt. Tarynn Gardner, the mission's non-commissioned officer in charge from the 7458th MORU, recalled all of the moving pieces unique to keep this mission moving.

“It's a lot easier to keep a ball rolling when it's already started,” Gardner said. “So what is hindering a lot of organizations from starting their own programs is getting that ball rolling. There are a lot of pieces. We're fortunate we have a facility and haven't always been in this facility. We've been in various facilities since it started. We eventually found ourselves here, which has been great because everything that we need is pretty close. So facilities, supplies, you need somebody like a point of contact that works like a liaison between the actual hospital and the reserve unit. So we have a person that's kind of coordinating. Then we have our own leadership, which you've been talking to, to lend unit support. In this particular situation, we've definitely had different leaders, but for the most part, the unit has supported us and the willingness of all these individuals who volunteered. There are obviously a lot of different roles that go into the whole process. So all of these individuals, had to go through MHS Genesis training. They all had to get approval for the MEDPROS update to be able to update patient information.”

Soldiers can expect a multitude of medical services, such as preliminary health assessments, vision screening, audio screening, dental services, and more.

The clinic's providers are Reserve Soldiers coming from the 7458th MORU. ORC allows them to be able to practice their medical skills in a realistic setting. While perfecting these skills, they are able to understand different common afflictions Soldiers are experiencing. The Officer in Charge of the Clark Clinic, Capt. Shanelle Warren of the 7458 MORU, explained the advantage of having a clinic run by Soldiers

“We are driven and ran by Soldiers,” Warren said. “ If there is something going on with the Soldiers, like for instance, when they do their PHA, it is definitely very important to answer all the questions correctly. If something's going on, our providers see and notice those things. They give that additional care. Something most people don't know, lot of Soldiers don't have care outside of here. So if there's something going on and we find, for instance, if a soldier has diabetes. We see that in their records, we do get them the referrals to help them get their medications. We don't just see Soldiers as numbers. We see them as our peers because all of us are Soldiers. It's driven through Soldiers to give them care.”"

BALLSTON SPA, N.Y. — Ten Army National Guard Soldiers from New York’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion volunteered to help send 131 Christmas trees from a Saratoga County tree farm to military families at bases in Virginia and Florida.

The Guard recruiters joined 30 other volunteers at Ellms Family Farm in Ballston Spa on Nov. 28 to load trees donated to the Trees for Troops program on board a truck and dispatch them for shipment by FedEx.

New York Army National Guard Sgt. 1st Class Derrick Zwack said he volunteered because he remembered how seeing a Christmas tree while he was deployed had cheered him up.

“When you are overseas, your fellow Soldiers become like a second family, but you still miss your family back home,” Zwack said. “These trees give us a sense of home when we are away for the holidays.”

Ellms Tree Farm, a Christmas season destination for families throughout the Albany region, has been a collection site for trees for 19 years.

Owner Sally Ellms said she is amazed by the generosity of the local growers.

“When I checked a week ago, we had about 30 trees stacked on the trailer,” Ellms said. “So, I made some phone calls to thank and remind our growers and in our final week, we had another hundred donated.”

Trees for Troops is a national program launched in 2005 by the Christmas Spirit Foundation, and with the help of FedEx, has delivered more than 293,500 trees. Fresh-cut trees are gathered at farm and retail lots, picked up by FedEx and routed through distribution centers for delivery to 84 military bases this holiday season.

This year’s trees from the Albany region are going to a Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, and an Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida. In previous years, trees have gone to bases in Afghanistan.

Volunteers helping this year included veterans representing all service branches from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Gulf War, the Cold War and the Vietnam War.

Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Moseman said it’s all about giving back.

“It’s a great day when we gather these Soldiers together and load the trees onto the truck,” Moseman said. “With so many service members sacrificing time with their families for the holidays, it feels awesome to do this for them and remind them of how much we care.”

K-16 AIR BASE, South Korea - The Korean Culture and Information Service (KOCIS) hosted a Korean cultural event for the residents of K-16 Air Base at the Community Activity Center Nov. 24.

The event brought families together to learn about Korean culture and to further strengthen the support for the ROK-US Alliance. KOCIS is an institution under the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism meant to promote Korea’s culture and further expand exchanges between countries.

“We provided some Korean traditional performances, Korean traditional games and some snacks and food so that foreign residents can experience a variety of Korean culture,” said Arirang Event Manager Hojin Chang.

TOKYO, Japan – The U.S. Army Japan Band took the stage at Tokyo’s famed Budokan arena for the last time for their final performance as longtime participants in the Japan Self-Defense Force Marching Festival.

The band’s Nov. 17 and 18 appearances in the concert ended their 42-year run of taking part in the annual joint event, as the unit will be stood down next year.

The USARJ Band have been performers in the festival every year since 1981, except for when it was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Current members of the USARJ Band said they recognize the significance of being part of the final iteration of the band to perform in the historic, 14,000-capacity venue, as it marks the end of a notable era for the unit, which was activated in 1957.

“We are obviously so grateful that [the USARJ Band] had a chance to be here for so many years consecutively and had the chance to work with all these great musicians, great people, and great staff that organizes the event,” said Staff Sgt. Nicholas Miller, a two-time performer at the festival. “It’s bittersweet, but it’s cool to be part of the [USARJ Band’s] last performance.”

Miller said he thinks the JSDF Marching Festival is every member of the band’s favorite event they do every year and said their participation in the event is a unique opportunity for a large, predominantly Japanese audience to listen to music from a diverse group of performers.

“It’s a lot of fun getting to meet all the bands, hearing all the great music that they make, and having the chance to show what we all can do when we come together and work as one,” he said.

Miller said he tried to have fun backstage and keep everyone’s energy up, but admitted he felt a tinge of sadness knowing that every time the band finished a song, they would be getting closer to the last time they would ever play at Budokan.

“I think our performance was very successful, and this will definitely stay in my heart for a long time,” he said.

Chief Warrant Officer 3 Matthew David, the USARJ Band commander and a first-time performer at the festival, said he has known about Budokan and the band’s participation in the festival since the start of his Army career 19 years ago. He said it was a huge honor to be able to be part of the event and represent the United States to the people of Japan.

One of the songs the band performed was from an anime series, and they chose it because they thought it was an appropriate tribute to their host country and one that would help the audience connect with them, David said.

The commander said he could see the crowd visibly enjoying and responding to the music. Making that kind of connection with an audience is “something you can’t put a price on,” he said.

“It’s about [exploring] the human dimension through music,” David said. “Music is one of those powerful ways to connect with people.”

The first JSDF Marching Festival was held in 1963, and Budokan has been the venue nearly every year since 1973. In addition to U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine bands joining the event, bands from Australia, France, Germany, India, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have also performed over the years."

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Community residents donated, cooked and served a feast for the Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers program here on Thanksgiving Day.

The free dinner was available at the Camp Zama BOSS Warrior Zone Nov. 23, and about 60 Soldiers took advantage of the home-cooked food and chance to spend time with their peers.

Randy Benton, BOSS program adviser for U.S. Army Garrison Japan’s Directorate of Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation, thanked the people who worked behind the scenes to host the event.

“This would have not been possible without the outstanding community support from our residents,” Benton said. “Thank you to everyone who helped us out this year.”

In addition to food for the dinner coming from donations from the community, Benton said the Camp Zama Community Club turkey and ham.

Takila Frazier, an Army Community Services site coordinator, was on hand cooking and serving the food, to include her collard greens, mashed potatoes and banana pudding. She said she just wanted to make sure the Soldiers were taken care of on the holiday.

“If it were my son or daughter, I would want someone to take them under their wing and help,” said Frazier, an Air Force veteran.

BOSS president Spc. Michelle Antonio said the event was an important way to connect with those who might be away from home for the first time.

“The holiday season is especially hard for single Soldiers so if giving them something to do, a place to be at, and especially good food to eat helps make their Thanksgiving away from home easier, we will gladly do that,” she said.

Antonio said the community involvement made the event even more special.

“Thank you to all who helped us make the dinner possible,” she said. “All of us truly appreciate the gift you blessed us with this Thanksgiving. Personally, this is only my second ‘traditional’ Thanksgiving, and [it] has been such an honor to try such delicious food! Truly, I want to thank everyone who donated and took time off their day to make this possible!”

Staff Sgt. Lauren Hassler and Spc. Nayellie Maysonet, both Soldiers stationed at Camp Zama, said they were appreciative of the community efforts to provide them an additional option for Thanksgiving dinner with friends. And both said they told family and friends back in the States not to worry because they were receiving a home-cooked meal.

“This kind of event gives the single Soldiers living in the barracks the opportunity to feel like a part of a community on the holidays,” Hassler said. “It really makes a difference.”

Antonio stressed that Soldiers should continue to utilize the Warrior Zone, especially through the rest of the holiday season.

“As we all know, being away from home is hard enough—holidays are even harder,” she said. “Come out and meet new people. There is a roof, drinks, food, and even entertainment being provided … take advantage of it!

“We wish for you all to know you have a safe space here on Camp Zama, even if it is to just get out of your room—it can get stuffy in there,” Antonio said. “Please come to the Warrior Zone … we are looking forward to seeing you all this upcoming year and taking Camp Zama’s BOSS program to new heights!”"

MANGILAO, Guam — Over 100 cybersecurity stakeholders gathered at the University of Guam for the 2024 Central Pacific Cybersecurity Summit, hosted by the Guam National Guard Nov. 6-7.

Representatives from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the National Guard Bureau, U.S. Cyber Command, the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, public utilities, commercial service providers and others joined Guam Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero in the ongoing effort to bolster cybersecurity protection for the island and nation.

“Over the next two days, we are going to lean on one another, exchange ideas, and use our collective expertise to fortify our island and our region’s ability to respond and recover from a cyber attack,” Leon Guerrero said. “To simply say it’s a priority is an understatement. It is mission-critical to our island’s defense and our nation’s defense that we get this done.”

In May 2023, Guam experienced sustained 140-mile-per-hour winds from Typhoon Mawar, wiping out communication systems and other utilities across the 200-square-mile island. On the same day, a multinational advisory and Microsoft announced a malicious computer code was discovered in Guam. The attacks were attributed to Volt Typhoon, a state-sponsored hacking group that conducts espionage and information gathering for the Chinese government.

Guam, home to over 150,000 U.S. citizens, is located in the “typhoon alley” of the Western Pacific. Guam is also closer to Taiwan than Washington is to Fort Bliss, making it the westernmost U.S. soil in the Indo-Pacific.

Additionally, Guam’s Marianas archipelago is the only U.S. soil to have been captured and occupied by an invading force during World War II. This combination of natural and man-made threats to Guam’s fledgling infrastructure, together with Guam’s isolated location, prompted the Guard and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to bring stakeholders together.

Participants at the summit, the second in an ongoing series, addressed capability gaps, resource procurement, organizational structures and more. After two days of presentations and discussions, Guam Homeland Security announced a new, CISA-approved islandwide cybersecurity plan.

Lt. Col. Bumjin Park, chief information officer for the Guam Guard, described the importance of interagency cooperation during the summit.

“When we talk about homeland defense and integrated deterrence, it starts with relationships,” said Park. “Yes, we are generating plans and trying to procure much-needed cyber resources. But really, it’s the human element, like strong partnerships and well-trained communities, even for regular civilian users at home and at work, that provide a strong front against any adversary.”

Leon Guerrero echoed the importance of the whole-of-community approach.

“With so many experts in the room, this integration creates strength that is greater than the sum of its parts,” she said. “This integration showcases our relationships and unity of effort. And when it comes to defending the island and nation we love and call home, this integration deters. Integrated deterrence is a watchword over at INDOPACOM, and this is the work we are doing here today.”

WHEELER ARMY AIRFIELD, Hawai’i — At U.S. Army Garrison Hawai'i, a small but formidable team of ten, led by Jacob Faber and Justin Turnbo, stands vigilant against the relentless threat of wildfires. As the only full-time National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) wildland firefighters in the Army, their dedication extends far beyond the typical scope of duty, encompassing a vital role in maintaining the Army's training readiness.

Jacob Faber, the crew supervisor, outlines their unique position: ""Unlike other installations that rely on external assistance, our team is solely dedicated to wildland firefighting. This isn't just a job for us; it's our life's work.""

Distinct from other military bases that depend on collateral duty or external assistance for fire management, the Garrison Hawai'i team is exclusively devoted to wildland firefighting. ""Our role is unique in the Army. We are the only NWCG wildland firefighters entirely focused on wildland fire, not as a secondary duty but as our primary responsibility,"" shares Faber, underscoring the team's specialized expertise and dedication.

The team's role extends beyond fire suppression; they are a pivotal component in ensuring the seamless conduct of Army training exercises. ""Our presence is non-negotiable for Army training. Fires can ignite at any moment, and we must always be prepared,"" explains Turnbo. This level of readiness is particularly remarkable given the vast area they cover and their limited personnel.

This year alone, this dedicated crew battled over 67 wildfires across the Army installations, a testament to their relentless commitment. With responsibilities spanning across vast landscapes from Tripler to Fort Shafter and beyond, they ensure the safety of both military and surrounding civilian lands.

The team's expertise in wildland fire management is unparalleled. ""Our training spans decades, covering fire management, budgeting, finance, and command duties,"" shares Justin Turnbo, the program manager. This depth of knowledge positions them uniquely in the Army's ecosystem, where they often collaborate with Honolulu Fire Department and the Fish and Wildlife Service, especially during significant incidents like the Mililani Mauka fire where the team coordinated water bucket drop locations from assisting Army aviation assets.

A critical part of their duty is maintaining remote automated weather stations across O'ahu and Hawaii Island. These stations provide real-time fire danger information, crucial for both military and civilian forecasting. ""Our weather stations are a national asset,"" Faber adds. ""They offer essential data not just for us but for the National Weather Service and other agencies.""

Despite their crucial role, the team faces challenges. With a modest budget and a high turnover rate due to the strenuous demands of the job, they often operate under tight constraints. ""We do more with less,"" Turnbo states. ""Our team consistently faces the challenge of maintaining our high standards with limited resources.""

The team's dedication is unwavering, even during personal sacrifices. ""We've missed holidays, family events, all to ensure safety and training continuity,"" Faber reflects. Their commitment ensures that Army training proceeds uninterrupted, a crucial aspect of their mission.

Yet, this exemplary team seeks no glory. Their motto, ""embrace the suck,"" reflects a deep-seated resilience and a focus on duty. This quiet professionalism, however, often leaves their challenges unseen.

As the Army looks to expand wildland firefighting capabilities across other installations, the U.S. Army Garrison Hawai'i Wildland Fire Team serves as a pioneering model. Their experiences, both in triumphs and challenges, will shape the future of wildland firefighting within the Army.

""We're not just fighting fires; we're safeguarding the future of Army training and the communities around us,"" says Turnbo. Their story is one of silent heroism, a beacon of dedication and resilience in the face of ever-present danger.

As the sun sets over the lush landscapes of O'ahu, the U.S. Army Garrison Hawai'i Wildland Fire Team remains on guard, a testament to their unwavering commitment to protect and serve."

HELEMANO MILITARY RESERVATION, Hawai’i — In the heart of Helemano Military Reservation, where urgent calls for help are met with swift responses, the power of collaboration between the Federal Fire Department, local Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, and the Hawaii Fire Department stands testament to the life-saving impact of mutual aid agreements.

On a critical day, the seamless partnership between these agencies was on full display during a cardiac arrest emergency involving Sgt. Dustin Charles Woodmansee of the 13th Military Police Detachment. The harrowing event, which saw Sgt. Woodmansee fighting for his life, underscores the vital role of interagency cooperation in emergency response.

Mateo Mariano, emergency medical technician, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, a key responder, recalls the intensity of the situation: ""My role was to assist my paramedic partner in every way possible, from EKG monitoring to applying defibrillation pads."" His efforts, alongside those of Lead Paramedic Shalei Meneses, paramedic, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, were crucial in stabilizing Sgt. Woodmansee.

Meneses, reflecting on the incident, shares, ""It started as a seizure call and escalated to cardiac arrest. The rapid response from FedFire, who were on the scene performing CPR when we arrived, was crucial.""

This sentiment of collaborative effort is echoed by Captain Alon of the Federal Fire Department. ""It was a day where everyone came together – EMS, FedFire, everyone. The result was we saved a life, not just one but an entire family,"" he states, highlighting the broader impact of their actions.

Brittany Woodmansee, Sgt. Woodmansee's wife, played a pivotal role in the initial response. ""I started CPR until the fire department arrived. Thanks to their quick actions and the care at Tripler ICU, my husband is here today, walking and talking,"" she gratefully shares.

Jonathan Poe, battalion chief of the Federal Fire Department, sheds light on the mechanics behind such coordinated responses. ""When our resources are stretched, the mutual aid agreement with city and county is a lifesaver. HFD and our teams have a strong working relationship, and it shows in emergencies like this,"" he explains.

This mutual aid agreement ensures that when one agency is tied up, others step in seamlessly. ""We have a system where city and county's 911 calls are coordinated with our dispatch. This means quicker response times, more hands on deck, and ultimately, more lives saved,"" Poe adds.

The story of Sgt. Woodmansee’s survival is a compelling example of how mutual aid agreements transcend mere policy, becoming a lifeline for those in dire need. His experience, from the initial seizure to his miraculous recovery, is a testament to the dedication and skill of the first responders and medical staff involved.

""I'm here because of the quick actions of EMS and the excellent care at Tripler. I can't thank everyone enough,"" says Sgt. Woodmansee, expressing his gratitude.

This incident in HMR is more than just a successful emergency response. It's a narrative of unity, skill, and the unwavering commitment of various agencies working together to save lives. It's a reminder of how crucial these agreements are in ensuring that when a call for help rings out, it's answered by a unified front, ready to do whatever it takes to bring a person back from the brink."

Crosthwaite also highlighted the importance of Soldiers feeling a sense of home, even when far from their families, especially on major holidays.

“When we’re overseas we try and make a big deal about [Thanksgiving]; we have a lot of people away from their families,"" Crosthwaite said "" When it’s around the holidays whether it be Thanksgiving or Christmas, we try and make it a more lively experience for the Soldiers.”

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. – In the complex landscape of U.S. Army Sustainment Command’s logistics infrastructure, Logistics Readiness Centers play a pivotal role in managing materiel and support services to U.S. Army units. From ammunition management to equipment maintenance, and hazardous materials operations to bulk fuel, each LRC's unique mission requires careful analysis. Sarah Nadermann, a management analyst and senior technical subject matter expert in ASC’s G8 (Resource Management) Manpower Management Division, is at the forefront of optimizing these essential LRCs.

Nadermann, who joined ASC in 2020, has spent the past two years leading the operation of analyzing all LRCs in the continental U.S. on their size, complexity, and mission to ensure that they are adequately staffed and have the manpower needed for their workloads. This operation is known as optimization, and to date, 35 out of 57 CONUS LRCs have been optimized thanks to Nadermann’s efforts.

With a total of 78 LRCs worldwide, each with a wide range of supporting requirements that impact Soldiers daily, it is important for Nadermann to get the most comprehensive view of each LRC’s individual mission. This allows her to best assess their manpower needs to enable ASC to get Soldiers what they need, when and where they need it.

To ensure the mission success of each LRC, they must have employees with the right skillset in the right place. “We started by categorizing all LRCs based on mission, size, and type-specific principles in order to maximize standardization and replication of force structure models,” Nadermann explained.

“After sites were bucketed and models were standardized, we met with each LRC one-on-one with their Support Operations Directorate functional area to discuss their structures line by line to ensure they understand how model positions meet their needs and document their additional and unique mission requirements,” she added.

Although it is a tedious process, Nadermann said taking the time to meet one-on-one with each LRC has been invaluable. It has led to increased partnership and understanding between the LRCs and HQ.

The RMM team works closely with ASC G1 (Human Resources) to staff the LRC’s after assessing their manpower requirement level. “Manpower and G1 are uniquely intertwined,” Nadermann said. “After RMM documents a position, G1 is responsible for classifying the positions and hiring. We work very closely and there isn’t a day in a manpower analysts’ job that doesn’t involve collaboration with the G1.""

G1 Human Resources Specialist Shelonda Broyles regularly collaborates with Nadermann. “I can honestly say both directorates do a great job building and maintaining relationships, so we are synced and moving towards the same goals,” she said. ""I am honored to work with Sarah and consider her not only a great colleague, but a great friend as well.”

Prior to Nadermann’s employment at ASC, she worked at U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command in finance and accounting and industrial base operations and Joint Munitions Command in budget and manpower.

The prior knowledge and experience Nadermann brought to the table has led her to become a huge asset for ASC.

“I feel one of my strongest strengths in manpower is due to my extensive background in finance and budget, which allows the greater understanding of manpower and how it affects pay and budget,” she said.

Nadermann’s supervisor Erica Slattery, RMM Chief, also sees the value Nadermann brings.

“Sarah is a self-starter, team player, and change agent who possesses a positive, infectious can-do attitude that is recognized across the command,” Slattery said. “Her enthusiasm and professionalism exemplify commitment to the Army enterprise and personal contributions help propel the organization into the future with staying power.”

Working at ASC has proven to be beneficial for Nadermann as well. RMM has allowed her to advance her career by having opportunities to lead special projects and initiatives, such as LRC optimization.

“I love working at ASC,” Nadermann said of her work in RMM. “ASC gives you the unique ability to interact with military, Civilians, and foreign nationals across the CONUS and OCONUS (outside the continental U.S.) enterprise. It allows you to understand the intricate responsibilities of a logistics command.”

LAS VEGAS – The Nevada National Guard executed Operation Silver Circuit, a comprehensive mission dedicated to ensuring safety and security during the inaugural Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix.

About 90 Soldiers and Airmen from the 72nd Military Police Company, the 152nd Medical Group, and the 92nd Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high-yield Explosives Enhanced Response Force Package Command and Control element were activated Nov. 15-19 to support local law enforcement, including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, and first responders in Clark County.

Their concerted efforts supported local agencies at key locations, including the Las Vegas Strip and two hospitals in the city.

The Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix attracted an estimated 315,000 spectators from around the world and $1.2 billion in economic impact, according to numbers from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Brig. Gen. D. Rodger Waters, Nevada National Guard Joint Staff director, said Operation Silver Circuit enhanced security and emergency response capabilities.

“The deployment is a testament to the ongoing partnership between the Nevada National Guard and local emergency response agencies, showcasing their commitment to public safety and effective collaboration in times of need,” Waters said.

The deployment engaged units with specific roles: the 72nd Military Police Company, providing security expertise; the 152nd Medical Group, emergency and triage response operations at local hospitals; and the 92nd CERFP C2 element, contributing to communications, logistics and strategic decision-making.

Tech. Sgt. Zeshan Mahmood, 152nd Medical Group, the noncommissioned officer in charge, emphasized the importance of proactive measures.

“We grasp the gravity of the situation, the potential for calamity, and why we have been here,” Mahmood said. “We understand that these sorts of things can be very dynamic and fluid. We’re all professionals. So, we know how to handle those situations and how not to.”

Capt. Erica Steele, a critical care nurse overseeing the University Medical Center Hospital site, expressed the group’s commitment.

“We are here to help with triage, basic lifesaving, and patient flow in case of an emergency,” Steele said. “In the case of a mass casualty event, it is crucial that we are here to help the hospital care for their trauma victims.”

Frontline responders, such as Soraya Robertson, a civilian ER Nurse at UMC Hospital, emphasized the invaluable support provided by the Airmen.

“It’s nice to have almost a sidekick, you know, somebody who is a partner that’s like, ‘Hey, I got your back,’ ” Robertson said. “It relieves a lot of stress, and we love the support.”

The 92nd Civil Support Team, one of 57 National Guard teams responding to domestic CBRNE threats, provided an extra layer of expertise and support to the mission.

Beyond the Formula 1 event, the Guard regularly supports local agencies and events throughout the year, including on New Year’s Eve and for the upcoming NFL Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium.

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — It didn’t take Jennifer Zaldivar very long to make her mark at Redstone Arsenal. She has only been with Logistics Readiness Center Redstone, located in Huntsville, Ala., as a transportation specialist since the end of January and already has been named Army Materiel Command Employee of the Quarter for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.

LRC Redstone is one of more than 70 LRCs under U.S. Army Sustainment Command, a major subordinate command of U.S. Army Materiel Command. AMC’s mission is to ensure the Army and Joint Forces have the necessary equipment -- including guns, artillery, ammunition -- to fight and win on the battlefield.

As a transportation specialist in the LRC Redstone Transportation Division for Personal Property, Zaldivar processes official, military dependent, and diplomatic passports. She also reviews preapprovals for household goods moves and passenger travel. ASC is the executing arm of AMC, bringing together all of AMC's capabilities to make sure Soldiers have what they need, when they need it, and where they need it, including at home station.

“Our transportation office supports all AMC customers on Redstone Arsenal by providing personal property, passenger travel, and passport and visa support, including transportation motor pool and freight services,” Zaldivar said.

“My work is important, because by processing accurate and timely passport applications, I am able to support our military with important overseas matters,” Zaldivar said. “I also determine whether extra costs are permitted during household good moves which saves the government money. And by being a contracting officer’s representative, I ensure that the government is being taken care of as well as the contractor.”

Zaldivar said she has always been an ardent supporter of America’s military, and her family has strong military connections. Her grandfather was in the Marine Corps for 28 years, and she was born and raised at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

“All four of his sons, including my dad, joined the Navy,” she said, “and my dad served 30 years, retiring as a command master chief petty officer.” Her husband, Salvadore, was a Marine when she met him but has since left the military.

Getting to where she is took her on a somewhat bumpy road. She and her husband had moved to Alabama from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where both had served as Department of Defense Civilians working for the Navy, in late 2019 when she was hired by CWT SATO Travel in Huntsville, Alabama, home of Redstone Arsenal. She was laid off during the COVID pandemic, but because of her experience in working with government travel situations, she was hired as a quality control inspector for household goods for another company. And after two years, she landed at LRC Redstone.

Zaldivar said she feels very honored to be named Employee of the Quarter after such a short time, and attributes it to her strong work ethic. “I am ecstatic and feel very proud to be honored with this award,” she said. “I take pride in my work,” she added, “and it shows.”"

FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. – Fort George G. Meade held a joint wreath-laying ceremony Sunday, November 19, 2023, alongside representatives from Germany and Italy in honor of the two Italian and 33 German World War II prisoners of war buried at the post cemetery.

Maj. Gen. Trevor Bredenkamp, Commander of the Joint Task Force – National Capital Region and the U.S. Army Military District of Washington, and Lt. Col. Chaveso Cook, Fort Meade Headquarters Command Battalion, welcomed Rear Adm. Axel Ristau, German Defense and Naval Attaché; Col. Paolo Scimone, Italian Military Attaché to the U.S., and guests to pay tribute to those who did not return home.

“Today, we continue a tradition that began just 12 short years ago to recognize the strength of the alliance between our countries and service members,” Bredenkamp said. “Our world has changed a great deal since these young service members were laid to rest. I am humbled to join with representatives from both Germany and Italy to remember and honor the sacrifices made by their countrymen.”

Fort Meade was one of 19 camps where German and Italian prisoners were shipped, receiving 1,600 Germans and 58 Italians in September of 1943. Some of those prisoners died during their captivity and were buried at the installation.

“This location is unique however, as it is the only internment site for foreign prisoners of war in the state of Maryland and remains a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by those who served their nation in a time of war,” Bredenkamp said.

A common duty and knowledge of the danger facing them is a universal understanding between Soldiers that transcends country lines, according to Ristau.

“That is why there will always be a universal common remembrance,” Ristau said. “That is why we are assembling here today remembering fallen German Soldiers resting among Soldiers from other nations who we never met or spoken a word together.”

In his remarks, Scimone stated the freedoms the United States and its allies enjoy today come from the sacrifices made by millions of Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen who fought before, during and after World War II.

“We may change how we operate our weapons, structure and procedures, and it is all part of the business, but the ideals that move us and the examples of our heroes remains steady; unaffected by the flow of time,” Scimone said. “Like our ancestors, we stand together, and we fight together. They did it yesterday, now it is our turn and it’s also our responsibility to inspire our successors.”

Ristau noted there is no better place to start the path for peace than at a war cemetery because it raises awareness of what war means.

“It is precisely this place here that reminds us to differentiate between those who are actually responsible and those who are followers and those who are forced to fight a war that you at the end of the day tried to avoid,” Ristau said. “Let us use this day as a day of understanding, a day to learn from the past and a day not to tolerate violence or to be guided by prejudices for a peaceful future.”

In honor of the fallen, Maj. Rick Barnes of the Maryland Defense Band, Matthew Canales of Howard High School and Connor Wright of Bugles Across America played renditions of “TAPS,” “Der gute Kamerad,” and “Il Silenzio d’Ordinanza,” respectively.

At the conclusion of the ceremony, those in attendance were given time to pay their individual respects to the fallen and to mingle before being invited to share lunch at the Freedom Inn Dining Facility here."

LATHAM, New York -- The New York Army National Guard was tops in recruiting and retaining Soldiers for federal fiscal year 2023, outdoing the other 53 state and territorial Army National Guards, according to figures released by the Army National Guard.

The New York Army National Guard achieved a score of 118.12 percent for the 12 months from October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023, according to a year-end analysis of each state’s recruiting and retention success.

The score is based on the number of enlisted Soldiers, the number of new officers and warrant officers who joined, and the number of Soldiers who reenlisted as a percentage of each state’s total Army Guard strength.

A score of 100 percent means the state met its recruiting goals. Scores above 100 percent indicate a state exceeded those recruiting goals.

This was the third time that New York was rated best in recruiting among the states with “large” Army National Guard contingents and the second time the New York Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Battalion has been rated best in the nation, according to Lt. Col. Josh Heimroth, the commander of New York’s recruiting force.

At the beginning of fiscal year 2023, the New York National Guard was authorized a strength of 10,209 Soldiers and had 10,706 personnel assigned.

The New York Army Guard finished the fiscal year with 10,969 Soldiers in the ranks. According to New York National Guard officials, this reflected an increase of 270 soldiers, 760 soldiers above the authorized strength for New York’s Army Guard.

During that fiscal year, the New York Army National Guard recruited 1,594 Soldiers, with 1,521 new enlisted Soldiers and 73 officers who were not previously in the ranks, according to Heimroth.

Another 1,731 Soldiers chose to reenlist in the New York Army National Guard during the year, while 1,235 Soldiers left the force.

All these gains and relatively few losses resulted in New York finishing first in overall recruiting achievement for 2023, Heimroth said.

“We just had the best year for our retention mission that we have ever had,” Heimroth said.

“Our people focused, and Soldier first strategy is showing results. Our leaders at every level and our recruiting and retention teams are performing at an exceptionally high performing level of effort and achievement,” said Major General Ray Shields, the adjutant general of New York.

Success in recruiting and retention also led to the Army Guard ranking New York as the number one state for Army Guard “Strength Health” in 2023, according to Col. Mark Frank, the personnel officer for the New York Army National Guard.

The combination of assigned strength, recruiting efforts, moving Soldiers who missed drills out of the ranks without delay, resulted in this designation for fiscal year 2023, Frank explained.

This recruiting and retention success means that New York currently fields the fourth largest Army National Guard, Frank said. This recruiting success has also allowed New York to add a division artillery headquarters and a finance battalion headquarters to the Army Guard force structure, he said .

Recruiting and retention success is a result of Shield’s emphasis on recruiting and retention, which has been embraced by leaders at all levels, said Command Sgt. Major Anthony Abbate, the New York Army Guard’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion senior enlisted advisor.

“It is the senior NCOs and company leadership teams working with their recruiters and hiring and training their NCOs to enlist people out in their communities and working and forming relationships,” Abbate said.

Retention success is also being driven by New York Army Guard leaders offering Soldiers the opportunity to go to schools to further their military careers and participate in unique training opportunities, like overseas training exercises to Brazil, he said.

“We continue to invest in our Soldiers,” he said.

New York National Guard Soldiers have been busy at home responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and now a migrant crisis, so there is “a sense of fulfillment and the belief that what they are doing matters,” Abbate said.

A real key, Abbate said, is the adjutant general’s commitment to resourcing the recruiters. Out of the over 800 Active Guard and Reserve Soldiers in the New York Army National Guard, 207 are working in recruiting, he said.

The command is committed to keeping the recruiting battalion full – with 124 “production recruiters” interacting with potential Soldiers – and allowing recruiters to be successful by giving them autonomy, Abbate said.

Recruiting, he said, is vital.

“We are the only [occupational specialty] in the military that’s wartime mission and peacetime mission are the same,” Abbate said."

LATHAM, N.Y. – Ten Soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division’s Dismounted Chemical Reconnaissance Team refined their skills alongside 16 Airmen and Soldiers from the New York National Guard’s 2nd Civil Support Team Nov. 14-16.

The event at the Colonie Fire Training Center presented the Active Duty Army Soldiers with the challenges of a chemical, biological, radioactive, or nuclear scenario.

Participants had to find and test a stockpile of materials in a house basement at the training center.

The Dismounted Chemical Reconnaissance Team, based in Fort Drum, uses search, survey, surveillance and sampling techniques to determine the presence and extent of CBRN contamination.

Members of the 2nd Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team (CST) guided and supported the 10th Mountain Soldiers during the exercise.

Lt. Col. John Giroux, 2nd CST commander, said the training is essential.

“Exercises like this are crucial for many reasons. It allows us to identify and fill training shortfalls, expands technical skills and builds cohesion between us at the state level and our contemporaries at the federal level, such as the Soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division,” Giroux said.

The Soldiers used protective suits, oxygen masks and tanks, sensors for detecting hazardous materials, and sample kits. They maintained constant contact over the radio with a nearby command post.

The Soldiers began by circling the house’s exterior, looking for spikes on their detection equipment, and eventually entering the house to pinpoint the origin of the hazardous materials.

The source was a makeshift lab set up by 2nd CST personnel to simulate a situation where someone could be making a weapon of mass destruction in their home.

“This type of situation might be uncommon, but a lack of training when responding to one could have catastrophic consequences,” said Sgt. 1st Class Ryan Wallace, the platoon sergeant for the reconnaissance team. “Therefore, the training must be strenuous, realistic and objectively critiqued.”

1st Lieutenant Rosa Dominguez, the platoon leader for the reconnaissance team, said she and her Soldiers appreciated the help and mentoring of the Guardsmen.

“It was a real pleasure to work alongside the CST members and to absorb some of their expertise,” Dominguez said. “This week, we built a lot of camaraderie with them and working relationships that will benefit both of our units for years to come.”

After completing their mission, the Soldiers decontaminated and removed their protective gear.

The 2nd Civil Support Team comprises Army and Air Guardsmen trained to identify hazardous materials resulting from terrorist attacks, disasters or criminal activity and inform local first responders.

New York has two teams: the 2nd CST at Stratton Air National Guard Base in Scotia and the 24th CST at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn.

Senior Airman Karlie Foster, a hazmat technician with the 2nd CST and cadre member for the event, said she enjoyed working with the active-duty military members.

“It’s great to compare their perspective, which is a unit that will deploy internationally, with ours, which is domestic, and bridge that gap,” said Foster.

WASHINGTON – Throughout November, a display at the Pentagon titled, “Why We Serve” highlights how Native Americans have served in all the nation’s wars since the Revolutionary War.

The Defense Department and the nation celebrate National American Indian and Alaska Heritage Month every November.

“[Native American Heritage Month] is an opportunity to recognize the rich and diverse cultures, traditions, stories, and important contributions of Native American and Alaskan Native people,” said Edward Blauvelt, Society of American Indian Government Employees, or SAIGE, warrior society director.

Throughout America’s history, 22 Native American servicemembers earned the Medal of Honor, 29 were U.S. Soldiers.

About 190,000 American Indians are military veterans. The U.S. is about 1.4% Native.

“Our Army is made up of Soldiers, their family members and civilians who come from all of the cultures in our American society,” said Brig. Gen. Joe Hilbert, director, Army force development. “In essence, we are America. Recognizing and celebrating our Native American cultures and those within our ranks who are serving or who have served and have come from those cultures, it is a way to celebrate us. It’s an opportunity to recognize the great contributions Native Americans have provided us, and what they as a people have contributed to our great nation and our Army.”

Blauvelt said many of the warfare and battle tactics the service branches use today originated from the Native Americans.

“The American Indian, Alaskan Native style of warfare is so ingrained into America that it is now America’s version of warfare, and along with excellent training and equipment, it makes the U.S. military superior on the battlefield,” said Blauvelt.

These tactics include their perseverance, skulking (now known as guerrilla warfare), blitz attacks such as shock and awe, and the use of stealth technology.

Native Americans would skulk game when hunting. They used this for enemy attacks as well.

When the Mohawks skulked, they hid in the terrain to surprise attack the enemy, along with diversions and ambushes. Skulking was an essential mode of warfare for the forest Indians in the northeastern U.S. It enraged the European officers who viewed it as being against the “rules of war,” though they had skulked in wars in Ireland, Scotland, France, and other European countries.

Crazy Horse of the Oglala Lakota tribe performed quick attacks and divided the enemy. The Apache leader Geronimo and the Seminole people used resistance fighting with hit-and-run tactics. Muscogee warriors used night attacks. The overall battle strategy of these Native American leaders focused on preserving the lives of the individual warrior, he said.

Infantrymen Sgt. Taylor Ericco, Spc. Mark Quijada, Pfc. Matthew Pryor and Pfc. Johnathan Stewart of the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, conduct Military Operation in Urban Terrain, using similar guerilla tactics traditionally used by Native American warriors.

This warfighting blueprint evolved into the current multi-domain battle tactic concept aimed at overcoming local threats with small units instead of exposing major assets decentralized command structures. These stealth structures include aircraft, drones, ships, tanks and missiles; camouflage to hide assets; and decoys such as drones and missiles.

Stealth methods include swarming to engage an adversary from all directions simultaneously, nighttime special operations teams and using tactics for surprise and mobility.

The U.S. military evolved using Native American guerilla tactics in Vietnam, Afghanistan and other modern conflicts.

Native American leader Crazy Horse and the plains tribes misled Gen. George Crook and his troops to rest at the bottom of a valley. They hid their numbers by walking and attacking in a single file. They waited until they were upon the enemy before they broke formation and surprised them with their numbers with devastating results against Crook’s command.

They also sowed the battlefield with confusion. A similar tactic in today’s battlefield was used during the U.S. “shock and awe” campaign, part of the 2003 Iraq invasion.

During the Revolutionary War, Native American warriors saw the war as an internal battle and didn’t want to get involved. Still, tribal members fed troops at Valley Forge, served as minutemen, or fought with colonists if their tribes were directly attacked.

After the Revolutionary War, many tribes fought against the U.S. as the nation expanded westward. Still, many Native Americans fought with the Army right up to the American Civil War.

Standouts who fought during the Civil War were Cherokee Gen. Stand Watie and Seneca Gen. Ely Parker, also known as Donehogawa.

Between 1872 and 1890, 16 native scouts were awarded the Medal of Honor. During the Indian Wars, 5,817 American Indians served as scouts during the 81 years.

The War Department authorized Native Americans to be enlisted in the Army and serve in Indian companies. Each existing regiment of cavalry would contain one Indian regiment. A maximum of 55 Indians were authorized for each company or troop.

Some Native Americans supported the programs while others fought against it. American Indians served in the Spanish-American War and earned Theodore Roosevelt’s highest regard, Blauvelt said.

Blauvelt said that even though they couldn’t vote and their numbers were thin, the American Indians were registering for the draft or volunteering for World War I.

“Americans were praising them for their virtues, courage, energy and daring,” he said. “Tribes with elite warrior societies sent their sons willingly.”

American Indians were some of the first to land in France during the last week of June 1918. Their service was recognized when seven Indians from seven tribes accompanied General Pershing in the French parade to honor Americans.

American Indians fought in every major engagement of World War I. Pvt. Joseph Oklahombi, Choctaw, Company D, 141st Infantry Regiment, 36th Division, earned the French Croix de Guerre, a French military medal, for sprinting across the battlefield and capturing 171 prisoners.

The most famous Native American servicemembers from World War I and II were the code talkers from the Choctaw, Cheyenne, Cherokee, Comanche, Ho-Chunk, Osage, and Yankton Sioux tribes.

These Native American service members used their traditional tribal languages to send Allied messages in code during World War I and II. They were present in battles such as D-Day and Iwo Jima. They kept their work secret, and their codes were never deciphered by Japan or Germany. In 2001, they received Congressional Gold Medals for their work.

During World War II, 44,000 Native Americans from 50 tribes of an estimated population of under 400,000 served on active duty, including nearly 800 women. About 150,000 served or supported the war effort. The Army used about 534 code talkers from the Comanche, Meskwaki, Chippewa, Oneida, Hopi, and Dine nations during World War II.

More than 6,300 Alaska Natives from 107 communities volunteered to serve in the Alaska Territorial Guard during World War II.

Native Americans continue to serve today.

“American Indians and Alaskan Natives have made major military contributions to this nation that helped America win battles and wars at crucial moments in history,” Blauvelt said."

WASHINGTON - Pfc. Marques Downing thrives on a good challenge, problem-solving and constant change. He spent most of the past two years working in information technology, studying the latest computer networks and systems courses.

“It can be a lucrative career that offers flexibility, but there’s a lot of certificates and classes,” Downing said. “New technology and software are constantly coming out and you have to learn it.”

Last year, Downing realized he wanted a more hands-on job.

“I’m loving every second of my new job,” he said. “I like getting my hands dirty.”

Downing is one of dozens of wheeled vehicle mechanics who keep tactical vehicles operational at the District of Columbia National Guard’s Combined Support Maintenance Shop at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling.

“We’re like the D.C. National Guard’s own mechanic shop. We’re here to make sure people can get from point A to point B,” Downing said.

On any given morning, there is a line of mission-critical vehicles to test, maintain or repair.

“Our mission is to provide readily, fully mission-capable vehicles to the D.C. National Guard,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Courtney Britton, supervisory surface maintenance specialist, officer in charge for the DCARNG Surface Equipment Maintenance Facilities. “Whatever mission is tasked to the D.C. National Guard, and no matter where it is, we have the vehicle to support it.”

Britton leads the operation of four maintenance shops, while Chief Warrant Officer 2 John Eldridge ensures mechanics are technically sound in maintenance and recovery to fulfill mission requirements.

“Medium Tactical Vehicles, Light Medium Tactical Vehicles, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicles — there’s different types of vehicles for different operations,” Eldridge said. “The vehicles belong to the units ... and we are responsible for the maintenance. So, we’re constantly coordinating with units and honing our skills.”

Eldridge stresses expertise and skill aren’t the only traits that keep the operation thriving; he values people in the organization.

“If I likened it like a vehicle, bad parts create bad output, but good parts create good output,” CW2 Eldridge said. “We’ve got good people working in here.”

Britton says preventative maintenance for the D.C. National Guard motor pool is not reserved for a particular season but lasts throughout the year.

“The maintenance community doesn’t have a slow period,” he said. “While requests for vehicles for annual training peak during the summer months, preventative maintenance checks and services are still done every month by individual units on every vehicle in stock.

One of the mechanics helping to keep vehicles fully mission-capable for the past three months is Downing, one of the newest wheeled vehicle mechanics. He likes the responsibility of knowing he can support mission-ready personnel in training, war or national emergency.

“Every week, there’s something new to learn or get my hands on to figure out,” Downing said.

""The safety and well-being of our residents are paramount. This survey is a crucial initiative by USAG-Hawai'i to assess fire risks and discuss strategic mitigation for the community's safety,"" commented Iris KirkPilger, project director for Island Palm Communities.

The day's activities involved assessing various risks and discussing potential quick-fix solutions. The approach was comprehensive, looking into factors like combustible fences, proximity of vegetation to structures, and the condition of gutters and parking areas. This proactive stance reflects the Garrison's commitment to the safety and well-being of its residents.

Richard Marsh from Installation Management Command Pacific noted, ""This is about more than just surveying; it's about integrating knowledge across departments to achieve the best outcomes for fire prevention and community safety.""

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – The Housing Office here is currently looking to form a committee to gather resident input on a new policy that may allow pets in the housing towers.

“We want everybody to have an active role in [the policy] and try to make it their own,” said Jesus Chavarria, the housing division chief.

The two high-rise apartment-style complexes here only permit cats on the first floor, while residents in single-family homes and townhomes can have up to two pets, including cats and dogs, with some breed restrictions set by the Japanese government.

An updated policy, which housing officials plan to publish this spring using resident feedback and pet-related rules found in other documents, may help ease the transition for incoming pet owners.

While still in its early stages, Chavarria said the policy will likely grant tower residents the option to have at least a small pet.

“We’re trying to aim for the right size,” he said. “For apartment living, I don’t know if we would want a 100-pound dog sitting in there and barking and creating a lot of noise.”

There will be other issues to consider as well, he said, such as space for designated pet relief areas.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan, introduced the possibility of changes to the policy during a housing town hall in September.

While he said the garrison tries to accommodate several different things for residents, he noted that a new pet policy would require community involvement for it to work.

“The option to have pets in the towers is being relooked,” Hunter said at the meeting. “Every family comes with its unique situations, and … pets are [often] a big part of that.”

Chavarria said his office needs to listen to the community on this topic, since a pet is something that family members become attached to and can provide them comfort during stressful times.

“A pet is part of the family,” he said. “[It] helps pull you through grief or it's your friend when you're away from home.”

Chavarria said a committee of at least 10 residents from both towers, with a mix of people who are pet lovers or not, could help guide the draft policy in the right direction.

“I want everyone to have a comfortable home,” he said. “The more the volunteers we have to help out with that would be great.”

(Editor’s Note: Tower residents who are interested in serving on the committee to discuss changes to the pet policy can contact Chavarria at DSN: 263-3441 or 046-407-3441.)

ROŻYŃSK WIELKI, Poland — U.S. Army Soldiers with Task Force Marne visited a local school to learn about Polish culture and to familiarize Polish children with American culture near Bemowo Piskie Training Area, Nov. 15, 2023.

A group of U.S. Army Soldiers with Bravo “Barbarian” Company, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, serving as part of NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group Poland, met with the school staff and students of Primary School Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński as part of an effort to learn about Polish culture and connect with local citizens.

Staff Sgt. Bryce Roatch, a tank commander with Barbarian Company, explained that with the large, nearby presence of the NATO base, it’s important to help the children understand that the Soldiers are friendly and not scary and why they are serving in Poland. Likewise, learning about Polish culture and history helps the American Soldiers understand why their service in Poland is so important.

“This is an opportunity for us not just to show that we’re scary beings with big scary vehicles,” Roatch said. “We’re actually here to learn and understand what’s going on with the local kids here. It’s a huge way to show the next generation of Polish children that this is not only a cool opportunity; it’s very fun.”

“My idea for cooperation with Battle Group Poland when I became the director of our school in 2018 was that children have the opportunity of meeting new cultures without going out of school,” Grzegorz Kacperski, the director of Primary School Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, said. “Because we, geographically, have this honor that you are near here. We wanted to take the benefit [of teaching Polish culture] for American Soldiers not just as Soldiers but mainly as American Citizens.”

The students taught the Soldiers about Poland’s history and one of Poland’s most notable figures in its struggle for independence.

“Józef Piłsudski was the most important person in Polish independence after 1918,” Kacperski said. “American Soldiers are here to help us keep our independence. Leaving Poland, they should know, first of all, why they were here… for Polish people they are [helping to keep] the independence which was started by Piłsudski.”

Roatch, in turn, gave a presentation to the students about the culture of the U.S. Army, the state of Georgia, and the United States. The Soldiers also did some arts and crafts with the students, which allowed them to learn words in each other’s languages, as well as their interests and backgrounds. The Soldiers toured the school and answered the students’ questions in different classrooms.

“The children here are really smart and nice,” Cpl. Daemazejah Corbett, a signal operations support specialist with Barbarian Company, said. “They asked me a lot of questions, so I got to talk to them a lot. I had a good time.”

“For me, it’s very fun, because I get to see my Soldiers interact and grow in not just public speaking but also being able to see the different attributes and ways that cultures talk, and do similar things that we do over in Georgia,” Roatch said. “Getting to watch them sit down and relate is notably critical to their growth in being NCOs and Soldiers, but I think it’s critical in our future here and for them when they end up being staff sergeants and sergeants first class.”

“I got to talk to some of the children, where we learned a little about them,” Corbett said. “I’m realizing that we’re all kind of the same in a way. They like some of the stuff I did… I connected with them a little bit more.”

Roatch believes that it is important for Soldiers to get comfortable interacting with local populations, whether it be in Poland, the Middle East, or wherever they may be serving, so they can build trust and positive relations with local populaces.

“We’re here for now, but we don’t know where the conflict is tomorrow,” Roatch said. “A lot of these Soldiers — they may stay in or they may not — when they become my position, it's important for me and for them to see that they need to be able to trust their community when times are tough.”

PABRADE, Lithuania — Task Force Marne Soldiers and their Lithuanian Allies honed their combat skills during a force-on-force training exercise at Pabrade Training Area, Nov. 16-17.

Known as Strong Griffin 2023, the exercise saw U.S. Soldiers with 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, serve as an opposing fighting force for the Griffin Brigade of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, which provided the NATO Allies an opportunity to share each other’s defensive and offensive tactics, strategies, and standard operating procedures.

“Strong Griffin is an opportunity for us to train together and build towards interoperability procedurally, technically, and the human domain,” U.S. Army Lt. Col. David W.

Task Force Marne Soldiers conducted infantry and armored offensive operations against Lithuanian Armed Forces partners in a series of training exercises across rural and urban environments to test their combat readiness. Lithuanians, in turn, prepared a defense to counter the American attacks. In the training scenario, the American forces worked their way through a forest environment in an effort to seize a town, while the Lithuanians defended the territory.

Both armies were able to adapt and adjust to their situations which allowed them to learn how each other operated as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses in real time.

“The end goal, of course from the tactical perspective… we check the abilities and the gaps we have within the training cycle,” Lithuanian Army Col. Aurelijus Alasauskas, commander of the Griffin Brigade, said. “So if we see that everything goes so well, I don’t think we’re really organizing our exercise the proper way. We happened to see some gaps already, which might be training points for the next year.”

Lithuanian Soldiers trained on their light and anti-tank infantry tactics against an armored force with the help of Task Force Marne tanks.

“We have tanks. We have larger vehicles than they do [in the exercise],” U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Jaden Brown, a tank commander with Alpha “Ares” Company, 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, said. “Bringing in all that heavy machinery against a much lighter force allows them to develop how they would act against a much better equipped, much larger force,”

In turn, Task Force Marne tank crews adapted their tactics to the forested terrain, which meant tankers stayed vigilant by looking out for smaller, light infantry in the tree lines versus much more visible larger vehicles, according to Brown.

Having the opportunity to face each other in a force-on-force exercise during Strong Griffin ultimately made the two NATO allies stronger together. The exercise also allowed the two allies to familiarize themselves with the tactics and techniques they’d employ together as well as similar terrain and environments they might encounter one day on the battlefield together.

“It’s not about fighting [against] each other, it’s about fighting together with a purpose,” Alasauskas said. “So with the U.S. providing offensive capabilities, and Lithuania providing defense capabilities — when you combine those two into one — you have a very mobile, aggressive defense, which is not letting the forces penetrate you or to maneuver in front of you. So you’re leading even in the defense position. This is the main purpose: To lead the battle the way you want to.”

“It’s been an incredibly rewarding experience working with the Lithuanians,” Griffith said. “They’ve been a great partner here in Pabrade. We’ve worked together to define each other's training objectives. We built an exercise that allowed us both to reach them.”

WASHINGTON — The Army’s top leader honored an organization dedicated to funding the education of military children whose parents made the ultimate sacrifice Tuesday morning.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth awarded members of the Children of the Fallen Patriots Foundation the 2023 Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Award, which highlights the efforts of those who profoundly impacted the lives of service members and their families.

Since 2002, CFP has provided $70 million in scholarships and grants to nearly 3,000 children of Gold Star families, or families of veterans who died in combat, including about 1,600 graduates.

“The Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation serves those who have given the most to this nation – our Gold Star families,” Wormuth said during a Pentagon ceremony. “They know the sacrifice of our military families, and they know that the greatest of these sacrifices is to lose a loved one in service to the nation. They also know that one of the greatest challenges faced by parents and students alike is the rising cost of education.”

A 2022 study showed about 25,000 military children today have lost parents in service-related deaths. CFP identified about 12,000 of those children and has pledged to fund any college costs that exceeds Department of Veterans Affairs scholarships for qualified recipients.

The foundation has closed the gap between supplemented expenses and the total cost of a four-year college degree. On average, that funding disparity totals to about $25,000 annually per student.

“The impact that this makes – to lift the financial burden from our Gold Star families, to increase the educational and financial standing of those surviving children, and to realize our fallen service members dreams of setting their children on the road to success – is immeasurable,” Wormuth said.

Steve Smith, a retired Army officer, and CFP development operations supervisor, Kayla Martin, accepted the award in a Pentagon ceremony Tuesday morning.

The roots of the Children of the Fallen Patriots organization began more than 30 years ago, when founder David Kim, then a young Army officer, faced his first bout with tragedy in his military career.

During Operation Just Cause in December 1989, U.S. forces invaded Panama to remove dictator Manuel Noriega from power and restore democracy in the Central American country.

Sgt. William Delaney Gibbs, a member of Kim’s unit, the 7th Infantry Division, died during the operation, leaving behind his wife and unborn daughter. Moved by the tragedy, Fisher, would eventually found Children of the Fallen Patriots in 2002.

More than two decades later, the foundation not only aids those whose parents died in combat, but also those who passed away in training accidents, illnesses and even suicide. CFP does not place limits on its funding for the children’s college expenses, instead it works with each student to assure they graduate without debt.

“Our nation is forever in debt to these children – children who didn’t choose the military life for themselves, but who loved someone who served and wore the cloth of our nation,” Wormuth said. “The Fishers knew this and were dedicated to repaying this debt. And the Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation knows this and has shown us all what it means to make a difference in the lives of these Gold Star families.”

Sixteen of CFP’s 27 full-time staff come from Gold Star families, including four veterans and 13 scholarship recipients.

Philanthropists Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher established the Fisher House Foundation in 1990 to give free housing to family members of hospitalized U.S. troops during treatment. In honor of their efforts, the Army, Air Force and Navy created the award in 1996.

BETHEL, Alaska - The Alaska National Guard’s annual community outreach program, Operation Santa Claus, took an unexpected turn this year as its mission to bring holiday joy to the village of Tuluksak became a vital lifeline for a resident of the nearby village of Napaskiak.

On Nov. 15, the Alaska Army National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter supporting Operation Santa Claus was en route to deliver gifts and holiday cheer to the children of Tuluksak when an urgent call for assistance came into the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

A critically ill patient in Napaskiak required immediate medical evacuation, but adverse weather and icy runway conditions prevented civilian air ambulances from landing there.

Napaskiak is five miles south of Bethel on the other side of the Kuskokwim River. With river ice restricting travel by boat and insufficient snow and ice for travel by snowmachine or ice road, evacuation by helicopter was the only option.

As soon as the AKARNG accepted the mission from the AKRCC, the pilots, Chief Warrant Officers 2 Colton Bell and David Berg, assigned to Golf Company, 2-211th (General Support Aviation Battalion), altered their mission plan to prioritize the medevac.

Having just completed one of two scheduled Operation Santa Claus flights to Tuluksak, the aircrew added two LifeMed paramedics and equipment onto the helicopter with the remaining gifts and volunteers already on board and immediately headed to Napaskiak.

Bell said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Nick Lime, an aviation maintenance technician and crew chief assigned to Delta Company, 2-211th (GSAB), played a crucial role in the team accomplishing both missions within seven hours despite rainy and icy weather conditions.

“He assisted greatly in the configuration of the aircraft and loading and unloading of patients, medics and passengers even with the mission changes and difficult weather conditions,” said Bell. “Our UH-60L is able to transport up to 13 passengers with a full assortment of seats. In this case, we didn’t need all of them, so we took out the extra seats to make room for the presents, medical equipment and paramedics.”

Less than five minutes after departing Bethel, the helicopter touched down in Napaskiak, delivering the paramedics and medical equipment to stabilize the patient for travel to the local clinic, a process expected to take 30-40 minutes.

The aircrew flew 15 minutes to Tuluksak to deliver the remaining volunteers and gifts.

They immediately returned to Napaskiak to pick up the paramedics and patient. They flew them to the Army Aviation Operating Facility in Bethel, where the patient was transferred to a LifeMed ambulance. As of Nov. 16, the patient was in stable condition and awaiting transport via civilian air ambulance to an Anchorage hospital.

“The integration of the LifeMed folks went seamlessly due to previous detailed cold-load trainings and lessons learned in past joint medevac missions,” said Bell. “The coordination with LifeMed was extremely smooth since Chief Warrant Officer 3 Bryan Kruse was in the hangar during the mission and coordinated with LifeMed, RCC, and (a) state Army aviation officer while the crew continued executing the Op Santa mission simultaneously.”

While the Black Hawk and crew completed the medevac mission, Santa, Mrs. Claus and 10 other Alaska National Guard and Salvation Army volunteers delivered an early Christmas to the children of Tuluksak as planned. After celebrating with gifts, ice cream and photos with Santa, the team loaded back onto the Black Hawk for the trip back to the AKARNG aviation facility, where they transferred to an Alaska Air National Guard C-17 Globemaster III for the final leg back to JBER.

“This mission was a great example of how the Alaska National Guard is able to work jointly between Army, Air Force and multiple civilian agencies to support the local population through state missions like Operation Santa and through federal missions such as this RCC request for assistance,” said Bell. “This mission specifically showcases our abilities to adapt to multiple, rapidly changing missions while operating in adverse weather while still completing them efficiently and safely.”

Phillips Jr., from Port Sulphur, Louisiana, is a proud Native American who has more than 21 years of service. (Photo Credit: Courtesy) VIEW ORIGINAL

PINEVILLE, La. – November is Native American and Alaskan Heritage Month, a time to acknowledge the rich and diverse cultures and histories of native Alaskans and Native Americans.

Louisiana Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Bruce A. Phillips Jr. is a proud Native American who has served in the military for over 21 years.

In 2002, Phillips enlisted in the National Guard as an aircraft fueler, reclassing to human resources specialist in 2013. He deployed to Iraq to support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

“From maintaining personnel readiness to ensuring aircraft do not fall from the sky, I enjoy being trained in a variety of skill sets,” said Phillips. “This diversity in skills allows me to better serve the LANG and the people of Jackson Barracks.”

Phillips didn’t plan on a military career.

“My grandfather served in Vietnam,” Phillips explained. “Listening to his stories and watching how he carried himself was a huge influence on me. His guidance has led me in both my military career as well as my personal life.”

His father played a pivotal role in developing an appreciation for his Native American heritage and a positive approach to life.

“I looked up the most to my father,” said Phillips. “He taught me how a man should be, how a man should lead and to be a chief at everything you do. He also taught me to be a good cook and hunter and to provide for my family.”

Phillips continues some of the traditions of his Native American lineage. He attends powwows, has dreamcatchers and uses home remedies.

“I still attend traditional things like powwows, but I especially enjoy fishing and bow hunting. And we Native Americans have such good hair,” he joked.

When not working at Jackson Barracks or responding to natural disasters, Phillips enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.

As a federal technician and reservist with the LANG, Phillips says he understands the benefits of being a Guardsman and serving the community.

“This is an excellent way to earn a college degree while enjoying other benefits the Guard has to offer,” he said. “Living the Guard lifestyle teaches you how to thrive in the civilian world, both mentally and physically. The money and friendships are also an enjoyable part of what the Louisiana National Guard has to offer.”

In 1990, President George H. W. Bush approved a joint resolution designating November 1990 “National American Indian Heritage Month.” Similar proclamations, under variants on the name (including “Native American Heritage Month” and “National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month”), have been issued each year since 1994.

“We are all people under the same roof,” Phillips said. “This month not only benefits Native Americans but people of every heritage that have contributed to what American culture is today. ... We are all in this world together with nowhere else to go, so let’s work together.”

SCHOFIELD BARRACKS – The Army & Air Force Exchange Service’s senior enlisted advisor is ensuring Schofield Barracks Soldiers and their families have what they need to stay ready and resilient.

During his visit to Schofield Barracks on Nov. 16, Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Kevin Osby toured Exchange facilities and met with United States Army Garrison-Hawaii Commander, Col. Steve McGunegle to discuss how the Department of Defense retailer can improve the quality of life for the community.

“The Exchange is all in to make Schofield Barracks a great place to work and live,” said Osby, one of about 30 active-duty service members assigned to the Exchange. “We’re committed to expanding and improving our services and options to best serve the community.”

The Schofield Barracks Exchange recently added name-brand clothing from Old Navy, Gap, American Eagle and Aerie to their lineup giving Soldiers and their families more clothing options.

Earlier this month, the main store started it’s $14.3 million image upgrade project that will give the facility a complete face lift with polish concrete floors throughout, new restrooms and new lighting and paint in the food court. The re-grand opening is scheduled for the middle of next year about the same time their Express completes their remodeling.

Throughout Schofield Barracks, the Exchange has installed nine self-checkout registers at the main store and 22 more at the Expresses and other facilities to help reduce customer wait times. Exchange associates are still available to assist shoppers throughout the store.

Every time service members shop their Exchange—whether in person or at ShopMyExchange.com—they are strengthening their community. 100% of Exchange earnings are reinvested into the military community through funding for critical Quality-of-Life programs, as well as capital improvements. In the last 10 years, the Exchange worldwide has contributed $3.5 billion in earnings to Quality-of-Life programs.

“It matters where you shop,” Osby said. “Small changes can make a big difference in a community. The Exchange is passionate about enhancing the quality of life for our heroes.”"

RAPID CITY, S.D. – Elizabeth “Promise” Crawford was promoted to the rank of sergeant major in the South Dakota Army National Guard during a ceremony on Camp Rapid Nov. 9.

“It gives me great pleasure to be the first to address you as sergeant major. You are an outstanding Soldier, you’ve never disappointed,” said Col. Phillip Stiles. “You are always a hard worker and I have a ton of respect for you. I would send my son or daughter to war underneath you any day, any time.“

Crawford thanked her family for laying the foundation she built her character on — love, passion and courage — and for giving her a life that led her to join the Army.

“I’ve had an amazing career and I’m so glad I get to finish it here at Joint Force Headquarters,” said Sgt. Maj. Crawford.

She joined the Army in 1996 and served five years on active duty, stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, and Vilsek, Germany, before becoming a South Dakota Army National Guard member in 2002.

“She’s very deserving of everything she’s gotten in life and she’s worked very hard to get there, but she didn’t do it alone,“ said Marty Reum, retired U.S. Army combat veteran and mentor to Crawford. “With the support of her family, fellow Soldiers, those past and present, they’ve all influenced her life and helped her get to where she is today.”

Crawford incorporated her culture into her ceremony with a traditional flag song, a prayer and an honor song. She presented three satin star quilts to Stiles, Lt. Col. Brian Hass, and Command Sgt. Maj. Monte Patterson.

“These men have provided me with sound guidance and mentorship that I have often relied upon their expertise and advice for over 20 years,“ she said. “It’s to say thank you for all of the support and encouragement they’ve given me in my career.”

Crawford is from Poplar, Montana, and the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Indian Reservation.

“My advice is to always remember who you are and where you came from, keep yourself grounded to the earth and always carry yourself with pride and respect,” Crawford said.

She served as the supply NCO for the 147th Field Artillery Brigade, senior supply NCO for the 109th Reginal Support Group, 1st sergeant for the 152nd Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, and S4 senior operations sergeant for the 196th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade. Crawford was recently selected to mentor and lead as a member of the Joint Staff, supporting performance excellence programs, the State Partnership Program and domestic operations.

Crawford has deployed on federal missions three times, to Afghanistan in 2013, Kuwait in 2016 and Djibouti in 2020-2021.

“This is incredible,” said U.S. Navy Cmdr. Mary Beth Linnell, an optometrist from the USNS Mercy docked in Majuro, Republic of the Marshall Islands. “This is the whole reason that I decided to stay in the Navy after my initial three-year obligation. This is what I always hoped to do.”

Linnell and her team of Sailors flew to Kwajalein in early November to provide medical assistance and care for the residents of Ebeye recently, providing vision screenings and glasses dispensing to the Kwajalein Elementary School students, along with a dental team providing dental screenings and a cardiologist providing heart exams.

“I was able to deploy back in 2007 and 2009 and I waited until now to do it again,” said Linnell. “This is the best thing I’ve ever done in my 16 years in the Navy – the planning for the mission and the mission itself.”

Linnell explained that her team will go back to Majuro to perform vision screenings and glasses dispensing at the Lara Clinic as well as the Majuro Hospital. She said that the next stop on their Pacific tour will be the Solomon Islands where they will provide medical coverage for the Pacific Games. “I will be going to the outer islands to provide vision screenings again and glasses dispensing. It will be an adventure.""

The largest contingent of Sailors provided dental screenings and dental education to more than 800 students over two days on Ebeye, led by Lt. Cdr. Amie Heim, pediatric dentist with the USNS Mercy.

“For the dental component, we screened and treated about 800 children in the local community. We did exams to find out what kind of dental problems they might have or cavities or infections. We painted fluoride vitamins to make their teeth really strong and then provided dental education to try to teach kids the right way to brush and how to take care of their teeth. Then we used all that information to give to the local dentist at the Ebeye Hospital dental clinic where he will continue to do some of the treatment. We had one of our own dentists over the two days helping with the treatments as well.”

Heim said that this is her first Pacific Partnership mission but she deployed for the Continuing Promise mission last year on the sister hospital ship, the USNS Comfort.

“This is something I really enjoy doing,” said Heim. “In dental school, I always signed up for all the mission trips possible. I always raised my hand. It’s just an honor and a privilege to be able to do it on a much larger scale in the Navy. This time was even more exciting because I go to see it from the ground up in the role of a dental planner.”

Heim was here earlier this summer to meet people in the local community to figure out what the needs are here to come up with a plan together.

What was the response from the community like? “Oh my gosh, it was incredible,” Heim said. “All the kids running in the street after we did some of the education with the big toothbrush. They were so happy and everywhere we went they were welcoming and giving us high fives and saluting us.

“Honestly, I was so very touched by the ceremony at the hospital we attended and all the folks at the hospital and elementary school who came to thank us. From a place that, they will tell you that they don’t have a lot but they have big hearts, you could feel that today. It was just a real honor and a privilege to be able to be a part of that and give back to that community.”

The third aspect of the USNS Mercy visit to Ebeye was having a cardiologist conducting exams on the populace.

U.S. Navy Cdr. Matt Russell, cardiologist with the USNS Mercy, said there was a backlog of about 150 patients who need both pediatric and adult echocardiography.

“The first two days we spent doing mostly adults, looking for patients with heart issues,” Russell said. “In total we did 26 echocardiography studies and saw 26 patients and consultations over the two days. Today we saw 13 pediatric patients of varying conditions from congenital heart disease to rheumatic heart disease, ages 2-17.

Russell explained that this was his first Pacific Partnership. “Clinically, I get exposure to a lot of conditions that I wouldn’t normally see in the United States such as rheumatic heart disease or non-corrected congenital heart disease in kids. Personally these were just wonderful people that I’ve ever met and really terrific doctors. It was a privilege to work with them.”

Russell further explained that “they have a major need for cardiovascular studies and it’s unmet unfortunately. I think we made a dent in the number of echoes that they need and the number of consultations they need but I think they need more.”

Russell’s assistant, HM Ramoune Scarlett, a hospital corpsman from the USNS Mercy said that a lot of the patients aren’t sick right now but could be as adults.

“I think this is crucial to get that information out to help the providers here so they can start treatment now so in the long run they aren’t suffering,” said Scarlett who has done this for six years.

“As a technologist, I am the hands-on guy. I take the images and the doctor does the interpretation.”

Scarlett explained that this was the first time he has deployed in 12 years in the Navy. “I’m happy I came on this trip. You get to see why you are in healthcare. You get to see the why. Being here reminds me so much of being back home (in Jamaica) so it hits home for me being able to help people. Being able to go to poorer countries and identifying what they are going through. It just reinforced my why … as to why I am in healthcare.”"

Steven McGunegle, commander, U.S. Army Garrison Hawai’i and Col. Charles Green, director, Directorate of Emergency Services, met with Representative Trish La Chica on Wednesday November 8, 2023. The discussions, which continued at the Hawai’i Okinawa Center in Waipio Gentry, centered around the pressing issue of homelessness, particularly the encroachment of homeless encampments on federal property in Hawai’i.

The meeting marked a significant effort to engage with Representative La Chica, the elected leader for the Mililani Mauka area, in addressing the challenges posed by homeless encampments. These discussions were crucial for Army Garrison Hawai’i, as the encroachment of civilian homeless populations onto Army managed lands presents unique challenges.

“We’ve been seeing increasing homeless trespassing at several Army locations on Oahu,” said McGunegle. “This meeting was important step forward to discuss the joint effort with city and state officials required to reach collaborative solutions.”

Representative La Chica, who had firsthand experience observing the operations of homeless sweeps, brought valuable insights to the table. The talks delved into the complexities of the homeless situation in Hawai’i, including the logistical hurdles and the coordination required with various agencies.

A significant part of the discussion revolved around the removal of debris and hazardous waste from these sites. The group acknowledged the financial and logistical challenges associated with homeless encampments as key concerns.

In addition to discussing the current situation and challenges, the meeting also opened up conversations about potential long-term solutions and strategies to address the broader issue of homelessness in Hawai’i. This included exploring various models from other areas of the country that could be adapted to the Hawai’ian context.

Overall, the meeting was a constructive step towards fostering collaboration and finding effective solutions to the challenges of homelessness in Hawai’i. The discussions highlighted a shared commitment to addressing this complex issue and the importance of working together across different levels of government."

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Kevin McGovern first met his future wife, Armie, in Yokohama after a mutual friend introduced them, sparking what would turn into 20 years of marriage.

From their encounter, Armie recalled that she knew Kevin was interested in her, yet she initially wanted to take her time before pursuing a serious relationship.

But Kevin’s cheerful demeanor, and the sacrifices he made for her along the way, made her realize he was the real deal.

“He was the best thing to ever happen in my life,” she said. “He was a great father; he was a great husband. I will never forget him. He’s always in my heart.”

Armie and her family joined several community members for a memorial service Wednesday at the Camp Zama Chapel to celebrate Kevin’s life following his death from natural causes on Sunday. He was 66.

The dedication Kevin showed to Armie and his five children also extended to his work life.

After graduating high school in 1975, Kevin enlisted in the Navy to serve in aviation ordnance. He retired after 21 years of service and moved to Florida where he received a certification in culinary arts.

Kevin used his new skills at several resorts and country clubs before returning to Japan, where he was previously stationed, to be the chef at the Atsugi Enlisted Club. He later worked for the Defense Commissary Agency and then became a cook for Child and Youth Services, or CYS, at Camp Zama.

He also was active with the Veterans of Foreign Wars post here, where he continued to make an impact with other veterans in the area, said Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan.

“I am struck by the exemplary commitment and performance of Kevin,” the colonel said. “He had such a positive attitude and was infused with joy in everything he did and … made everything fun for all who knew him.”

Hunter said Kevin’s legacy will endure through the lives he touched from both his family and many others in the community.

“I will say Kevin will be missed,” he said, “but his spirit lingers in our hearts and, as such, is a true testament to a life well lived.”

Loretta Murray, the CYS coordinator, said Kevin brought so much happiness to the children as he nourished their lives with the meals he served.

When Kevin interviewed for the job four years ago, Murray remembered that he showed his true self to the hiring panel.

“He said, ‘If you hire me, I’m going to be the cook that’s singing, dancing, hanging with the kids and having a party,’” she said. “And that’s what he did. Mr. Kevin was the life of the party.”

Murray said he also displayed that liveliness outside of work as she often saw him and his wife mingling at the VFW or singing karaoke at the Firelight Lounge.

“I will miss his positive energy and attitude, but I am wishing the family the [best] through these trying times,” she said. “We are here to support you all, because while Kevin was part of our CYS family, his family is part of our family as well.”

Kevin’s eldest daughter, Shannon Nease, said she was thankful for the Camp Zama community coming together to honor her father.

“To know my pops was to love him,” she said. “Our very own ‘Mr. Popular’ that was not bothered by others’ opinions or thoughts. He was an amazing father and loved all of us so, so much.”

Nease then spoke of having the opportunity to see her father one last time. She had just arrived at Tokyo Narita Airport from Florida when she got a call from her family to rush to the hospital.

It was the longest bus ride in her life, she said, as she hurried to the hospital to say goodbye to her father.

“My dad waited for me,” she said. “He gave me 10 minutes and for that I am eternally grateful.”

Nease was able to let her father know that everyone was there with him and that they all loved him.

“I will never forget that moment,” she said. “Dad, we love you and we will never forget you.”

April is the month National Arbor Day is celebrated, but November is the month Texas celebrates its own Texas Arbor Day because autumn is the best season to plant trees in the state. The ceremony was also a celebration of Fort Cavazos receiving the Tree City USA award for the 18th consecutive year by the Arbor Day Foundation.

“It’s truly an honor to be awarded for the 18th year,” Stokes said. “The Fort Cavazos Arbor Day proclamation signing is a reminder of how simple acts can create healthy communities, while searching for hope for a better tomorrow.”

The Tree City USA program is sponsored by the Arbor Day Foundation in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters.

“This team is so inspired and motivated, doing such good work being persistent about planting trees, and continuing the effort that it takes to be a Tree City USA community,” Wiseman said. “Celebrating 18 years as trailblazers is a great example to share for other organizations and installations to follow suit.”

Fort Cavazos achieved Tree City USA recognition by meeting the program’s four requirements: a tree board or department, a tree-care ordinance, an annual community forestry budget of at least $2 per capita and an Arbor Day observance and proclamation.

“Our biologists, environmental professionals and community partners serve as a bridging element and bring together communities to create lasting change,” Stokes said. “Thank you for continuing to highlight Fort Cavazos’ commitment to environmental stewardship, and also to creating beautification in green spaces.”

Highlights of Fort Cavazos’ accomplishments included planting 360 trees; pruning and watering more than 3,627 trees; and overseeing design and landscaping plans for construction projects.

“As we look forward, I encourage not only Team Cavazos here but other military installations and our surrounding communities to celebrate and support our efforts on planting and protecting trees,” Stokes said.

Wiseman recognized Fort Cavazos’ successes in maintaining a green space and the symbolism of planting the ceremonial bur oak tree.

“There’s not just environmental sustainability in mind but also the sustainability of this installation that continues to grow,” she said. “The planting of a tree is symbolic and important that you’re not just keeping what exists already. You are improving upon what you have — it’s a great joy to see all the motivation.”

KILLEEN, Texas — Citizens, Soldiers, veterans and families of the Central Texas community lined the streets Nov. 11 in downtown Killeen for the Veterans Day Parade hosted by the City of Killeen and the Central Texas Area Veteran Advisory Committee here.

This year’s parade entries participated with a variety of Soldiers, floats, marching bands from the Killeen Independent School District, and the U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, Col. Lakicia Stokes, as the parade’s grand marshal. The parade serves as a way for the local community to show their appreciation to the veteran and active-duty community alike.

“There’s everything from Soldiers from Fort Cavazos, there’s cars, antique cars, motorcycles, a lot of nice floats. It’s just a great day to come out and see everybody’s kind of creativity come to life and supporting the Soldiers and veterans in our community,” said Pat Christ, co-chair for Central Texas AVAC.

Children waited eagerly on the sidewalk to collect the candy that was being thrown to them from people in the parade.

Shortly before the festivities began, Lori Spencer, AVAC member and spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Day National Committee, presented City of Killeen Mayor Debbie Nash-King a document declaring Killeen, Harker Heights and Copperas Cove as regionally recognized sites for Veterans Day celebrations as citizens, local organizations and friends and families gathered in front of Killeen City Hall looked on.

“Mayor Nash-King’s late husband began this back in 2014. And he did a lot of work to ensure that we were recognized as regional site from the Department of Veterans Affairs,” Spencer said. “I’ve been so honored to be able to take that on and so for the 10th year in a row, the cities of Killeen, Harker Heights and Copperas Cove area has been designated a Veterans Day regional site. It is my honor to present this declaration to Mayor Nash-King on behalf of the Area Veterans Advisory Committee and the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Day National Committee.”

Mayor Nash-King offered opening remarks and kicked off the parade with some encouraging words.

“I’d like to thank you all for attending and thank you for recognizing our area as a regional site for Veterans Day celebration,” Nash-King said. “We stand behind our Soldiers, veterans and their families and it is an honor for me to be able to say thank you for all you do, all you’ve done and the sacrifices that were made for this great nation. Thank you.”

Each year the Central Texas AVAC sponsors the event, according to city officials. AVAC is comprised of all the veteran organizations from Nolanville, Harker Heights and Killeen."

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Several days of rain provided much needed water to Belton Lake, but also created dense, muddy terrain that was a challenge to maneuver in, let alone conduct the largest combat exercise here in three years.

Remagen Ready 24-1 was a blended live and constructive, joint, multi-echelon, division-sized combined arms exercise that included a contested gap crossing.

Soldiers participated in a hands-on tactical exercise Oct. 30 – Nov. 9, which tested the brigade’s proficiency in navigating a wet gap crossing; moving troops, light and heavy vehicles and supplies from one side of Belton Lake to the other; and reinforced the vital training required to be “ready to deploy, fight, sustain and win in multi-domain operations anywhere in the world,” according to III Armored Corps.

“It doesn’t matter that you have the world’s greatest tank ready, if you can’t get it to where it needs to be,” said Maj. Brian Harris, chief of community relations, III Armored Corps. “The ability to move and not to get bogged down and to advance is so crucial, and so in III Armored Corps, you know, that can’t be more important to us.

“So, this is one step in the evolution of figuring out how we can use the sort of unique aspects of Fort Cavazos, which includes the fact that we have Belton Lake here and that we own both sides of it,” he continued. “And so, we can do something like this which oftentimes at installations you’re not able to do.”

An exercise of this magnitude could not function independently of the many Garrison tenants that provide constructive services and resources support.

Nearly 60 civilian team members from across the Directorate of Plans, Training, Mobilization and Security collaborated to provide range operations support, devices and secure and schedule training areas.

“It’s very important to provide them with training neighbors to assist training units on the installation to be successful,” said Chris Hoffman, chief of training for DPTMS.

The Fort Cavazos Fire Department arranged emergency medical, water rescue and hazmat response support and was prepared to render first aid and water rescue measures at a moment’s notice.

Additionally, more than a dozen volunteer personnel from Morgan’s Point Dive Team provided additional water rescue support.

“The safety of the Soldiers is important,” said Andrew Lima, chief of the Fort Cavazos Fire Department. “If we don’t have the assets for personnel, then we don’t have an exercise. To keep those guys safe at all times, that’s why it’s very important that we were there.”

Maj. Edwin Martinez, deputy corps engineer for Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, III Armored Corps, described the partnership as symbiotic.

“We could not do an exercise of this scale without working hand in hand with the Garrison entities,” he said. “The digital environment, the systems, the hardware, everything enables us to do this.

“We are interconnected. Fort Cavazos installation and the Fort Cavazos units, we have to work hand in hand,” Martinez continued. “When we all work together for the common goal to train our Soldiers and our armed forces, we train our young men and women to be ready and that’s our purpose. We’re working together to achieve that goal.”

Trudging in boot-deep mud, Soldiers from the 74th Multi-Road Bridge Company, 62nd Engineer Battalion, 36th Engineer Brigade, worked to assemble an Improved Ribbon Bridge consisting of ramps and interior bays to create a floating roadway that allows Soldiers, their vehicles and equipment to cross the waterway safely.

M30 Bridge Erection Boats attached to the sides of the IRB guided sections into place and kept the fully assembled structure from floating off site due to the current.

Soldiers drove Bradley Fighting Vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and fuel trucks, onto the IRB to float the machinery approximately 1,700 meters, or a little more than a mile, to the opposite side of the lake.

“It may look like a relatively small gap that they’re crossing,” Harris said. “(Yet) it’s a significant effort to do it right, to do it safely.”

Soldiers were also tasked with completing the crossing while negotiating obscured vision due to thick smoke emitting from non-toxic fog oil canisters.

“It’s a representation of the current operating environments, the current battlefield that we foresee, and we have to move, we have to learn to operate in these conditions,” Martinez explained.

The water crossing began the morning of Nov. 3 and was expected to take a couple of days to complete according to Lt. Col. Tania Donovan, deputy public affairs officer for III Armored Corps.

She explained that the wet gap crossing is just one aspect of the exercise.

“While this is what we are seeing right now, really the entire Remagen Ready exercise is focused on large scale combat operations,” Donovan explained. “It is 24/7 where they test out everything from communication capabilities talking to units all across the battlefield, talking to each other, coordinating, synchronizing.

“In order to have and put together an exercise for the Soldiers, we need planners, we need facilities, we need the support to really identify the objective, set it on the map for the Soldiers and also, play the other side,” she continued. “In this exercise, we have Garrison capabilities doing that, we have a lot of our civilians focused on the systems that are required to facilitate the training for the Soldiers.”

More than 100 civilians collaborated with roughly 6,000 Soldiers from 1st Cavalry Division, III Armored Corps Headquarters, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command, 11th Signal Brigade, 36th Engineer Brigade, 75th Field Artillery Brigade, 504th Military Intelligence Brigade and 3rd Air Support Operations Group, in the exercise and more than 700 wheeled vehicles and nearly 160 tracked vehicles crossed the wet gap during the nearly two-week training.

Harris said the long-term goal is to see if Fort Cavazos can eventually become the gap crossing training headquarters for other installations.

“For now, it’s training tenant units at Fort Cavazos, but there’s a belief that there’s other units around the Army that potentially could use this kind of training,” he explained. “And so, this is the next step in testing out our ability to do it here; can we get it to the point where we could potentially be able to offer it as an option to units that are deploying. Maybe it becomes a training center that’s not just for Fort Cavazos.”"

Fort George G. Meade, Md. – Sailors assigned to U.S. Fleet Cyber Command/U.S. TENTH Fleet focused on self-care and holistic nutrition during a cooking class at Fort Meade’s Kuhn Hall, the Education and Resiliency Center, Nov. 1.

Offered upon request, ""Meal in a Mug,"" aims to assist service members residing in the barracks with healthy meal options and meals prepared using only a mug, a microwave, and a few utensils. During the demonstration and meal preparation, the Sailors prepared two, 2-minute healthy meals, each costing less than $2.00. The course is open to all service members, military family members, and Department of Defense (DoD) ID cardholders, and provides recipes and hands-on experience.

“This class is about laying the foundation for a good whole foods diet,” said Dr. Shari Youngblood, a professor at the University of Maryland, who is also board certified in personalized nutrition. As a self-professed “Army brat,” she volunteers to teach the course at Fort Meade to help service members.

The Demonstration Kitchen at Kuhn Hall was designed by the Fort Meade Alliance, an advocacy group to promote lifelong culinary and nutritional skills.

“There is a lot of confusion around nutrition. We all have cultural and powerful emotional associations with food,” Youngblood said. “Food is the most powerful way of fixing [or avoiding] a health condition.”

“Food facilitates mental, spiritual, emotional and physical wellness,” she said.

One has to be well to perform well, and food habits can be taught, there’s a natural connection between wellness and readiness, she said.

As Cyber professionals, the Sailors duties may require flexible hours and long days. Protecting the DoD’s networks is work that requires dedication 24/7/365 days a year. The force is agile, resilient and responsive to facilitate intelligence, logistics and combat support functions to the Fleet and Combatant Commanders. Fleet Cyber Command is a tenant command at Fort George G. Meade, which employs more than 64,000 personnel, many with specialties in intelligence, information and cyber operations.

One of the Sailors who participated said, learning to cook healthy foods on the run is important and he appreciated the opportunity to participate.

“Growing up, I really didn’t learn to cook,” he said. “I want to be able to cook my own food, three meals a day.”

The Sailors learned to make a Coffee Mug Quiche, Protein-packed quick oats and received other recipes to share with the unit.

Likewise, the other Sailor who participated said buying fast food is expensive and not ideal for personnel living in the barracks. She recalled the resourcefulness of the junior enlisted personnel when it comes to food preparation but said the demonstration kitchen and the course offers new insight.

“We want our service members and community members on the installation to know the demonstration kitchen is available for use,” said Chad Jones, public affairs officer. “The education, resiliency center promotes well-being and can serve as another outlet for continuing education, personal growth and development.”

“We hope the Sailors spread the word,” said Jones. “The class, and the Demonstration Kitchen are open to the community. Our hope is that it’s a safe space for all personnel, units and families.”

Any community members interested in the nutrition program can contact Noelle Austin-Jones, director of Fort Meade Armed Forces Wellness Center at 301-677-2006."

WASHINGTON — The Army’s artillery production doubled in the last year with the service currently producing 28,000 155-millimeter howitzer rounds a month.

The dramatic uptick comes as the Army expanded its capacity at current facilities while looking to bring new ones into the mix next year.

""We will have taken, over a couple years, what was a very fragile, admittedly, industrial base and dramatically improved its strength,” said Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology.

The need for the increased artillery comes in response to supporting the war in Ukraine, the recent conflict in Israel and replenishing U.S. stockpiles. The service has sent more than two million rounds to Ukraine thus far.

Currently, the Army ships steel from Ohio to two facilities in Pennsylvania, the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, and a sister facility in Wilkes-Barre. These two plants turn 2,000-pound steel rods into two-foot-tall artillery shells.

The shells are then transported to the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, where they are filled with explosives and sealed. The propellent and charges for the rounds are mostly produced at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant in Virginia and the Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Tennessee.

Throughout this year, the Army expanded production at these facilities by constructing new buildings, installing new equipment and improving automation. These upgrades helped double the Army’s artillery production rate, Bush said.

With the expanded capacity at current facilities, the Army is shifting its focus in fiscal year 2024 toward bringing brand-new production facilities into the manufacturing process. This will give the service multiple sources for each production step.

“Which is what you want in the ammunition production world,” Bush said. “You don’t want one building being the single point of failure.”

The service is building a new factory in Mesquite, Texas, and it awarded a contract last year to a Canadian company to build the artillery shells. It is also funding two new facilities to load the shells with explosives. One will be in Arkansas, and the other will be in Kansas.

The improved production process is part of the Army’s modernization plan to bring the industrial base into the 21st century. Current and future Army readiness requires modernization on a sustainable path that develops, implements, and deploys new technologies to deter current and emerging threats.

Bush said the Army aims to increase 155-millimeter production to 60,000 by next summer and to 100,000 by the end of 2025. The 100,000-round goal is largely contingent on the approval of President Joe Biden’s request to Congress for fiscal year 2024 emergency supplemental funding, which has $3.1 billion for 155-millimeter artillery production and facility modernization.

""This important legislation is needed to make sure the Army is ready to meet the growing challenges we face today, and in the future,” Bush said. “It will strengthen our industrial base to ensure we can supply our defense needs while we serve as the arsenal of democracy for our allies.”

FORT RILEY, Kansas – Inside the brain of a division-level combat operation exists a complex neural network consisting of dozens of shops and hundreds of people working towards a common objective.

Over a ten-day period, Danger Ready 2, an exercise designed to train elements of the 1st Infantry Division on the scope and scale of large-scale combat operations implemented multiple movements to test the unit's ability to break down and rebuild functioning sites.

Logistics elements play a key role in all warfighting capacities. The ability to sustain a fighting force often is the difference between victory and defeat. These commodities are the lifeblood of any combat element. In a strenuous environment, knowing what a unit needs is equally as important as knowing how to supply it.

“I believe we are replicating what happens overseas,” said Sgt. 1st Class Tyler Robinson, senior movements noncommissioned officer assigned to the 1st Sustainment, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Division Materials Center, 1st Inf. Div. “It’s great training. It’s kind of rough at times but that’s what refines you and makes you better.”

The second stage of the Danger Ready exercise implemented more advanced warfighting techniques, which focused on perfecting the art of synchronizing time and space in a hostile environment where large forces are engaged with one another. Soldiers reviewed satellite imagery, studied by geospatial analysts, conducted two-minute briefing drills that highlighted key decision points in the simulated battle space and coordinated rapid relocation of key combat assets.

Elements belonging to the 1st Inf. Div.’s Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, Sustainment Brigade, Signal Company and Division Artillery, trained in tandem with Soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Division and the U.S. Army’s V Corps, who are currently operating in Poland, in preparation for Warfighter, a capstone exercise synchronizing the U.S. Army and Allied forces across the globe on more sophisticated operational standards.

“Character development is very important when it comes to day-to-day operations,” said Spc. Bilend Amin a geospatial intelligence imagery analyst assigned to Signal Company, Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 1st Inf. Div. “Part of being an enlisted Soldier there are going to be times where you're going to do grunt work, where you're going to have to help set everything up.

“You’re not just going to walk in and just do your job. Sometimes it requires you to get your hands dirty and set up some C-wire or help run cable or clean up equipment or facilities to maintain the area that you work in.”

Like logistics, accurate reconnaissance of an enemy’s composition and disposition informs senior leaders and provides them with an accurate representation of the battle space as it evolves over time.

“We are responsible for full motion imagery,” said Amin. “This information feeds the other sections of the division staff providing location of the enemy forces in time and space.”

Communication amongst headquarters elements leads to appropriate decisions which, in turn, fine tunes the ability for the division and allied elements to function in synchronization with one another.

“It’s going to start going faster and faster,” said U.S. Army Col. Terry R. Tillis, the 1st Infantry Division deputy commanding officer for maneuver, during one of many two-minute drills. “Your reports are important.”

Providing efficient and accurate communication at every level allows for effective moves to be made on a battlefield. In active combat environments, relaying accurate and timely information to senior officers can make the difference between success and failure. In this simulated environment, officers and noncommissioned officers are offered the opportunity to improve the level of detail and the speed at which accurate information is transferred.

“We should be building upon this every time,” said Tillis. “We are doing this to try and be better.”

For each Soldier the end state of training exercises is in understanding the capabilities of a division involved in a large-scale combat operation and their role in maintaining those capabilities.

The series of Danger Ready training events will continue to build upon one another, improving lethal functions of the 1st Inf. Div. and its ability to operate in any combat environment as it prepares for Warfighter 2024."

FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. – Fort Meade broke ground on the construction of two new buildings, the Freedom Center IV barracks, in ceremonies Nov. 9. The barracks will house 380 enlisted service members from all military branches when complete.

Special guest speaker, Gen. Paul Nakasone, Commander U.S. Cyber Command, Chief Central Security Service (CSS) and the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), identified those service members in his remarks. “It’s going to be members of the Central Security Service, 40 percent of NSA’s workforce, the Marines, the Soldiers, the Sailors, the Airmen, the Guardians, the Coast Guardsmen that make up the analysts and linguists and reporters that ensure that the National Security Agency can do its principal missions of signals intelligence and cyber security.

This is a world-class facility for a world-class workforce,” said Nakasone.

Gen. Nakasone also talked about the cooperation it took to get to this stage. “It’s been a partnership, the partnership of U.S. Army Garrison Fort (George G.) Meade led by Col. Michael Sapp, Directorate of Public Works (DPW), obviously working very hard to make sure that we have everything that we need, and my incredible team, Installations and Logistics led by Mr. Randy Westfall at the National Security Agency. I also pass along my thanks to our representatives and certainly our congressional leaders that have been so key for us to be able to ensure that we have the funding and resources to be able to build such world-class facilities,” he said.

Col. Michael Sapp, Commander, U.S. Army Garrison Fort George G. Meade also emphasized the importance of partnership. “As you know, the combined effort between the NSA and the U.S. Army Garrison (Fort George G. Meade) to fund this facility could only happen because of the partnership and cooperation. When we combine our efforts, we can do so many great things.”

“These buildings and the joint service members that will reside in them are another reminder of the incredible talent and skills that we need to attract and retain service members with skills that the nation needs so dearly. It should not be underestimated and cannot be overstated the quality housing and the impact it will have on morale and the quality of work,” Sapp added.

The Freedom Center IV project represents the first phase of the long-term barracks solution at Fort Meade. “A solution that’s vital for this installation’s growing mission, as it provides tenants with the proper, necessary housing that they deserve,” said Lt. Col. David Myers, Deputy District Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Baltimore District).

Garrison Housing Chief, Aimee Stafford, who also served as the ceremony’s emcee said, “This project has been a long time coming, over 10 years. With included kitchenettes, it will be quite an upgrade from the barracks that will be demolished by the time this project is complete.”

Officials of the Freedom Center IV project have set a target completion date in the Fall of 2025."

BARRINGTON, Ill. - Overcast skies and blustery, cold wind could not stop the patriotic spirit from burning brightly during the Village of Barrington’s Veterans’ Day ceremony, November 10, 2023.

Veterans and civilians gathered to listen to remarks from Karen Darch, Barrington Village President and Captain Michael Ariola, Public Affairs Officer, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, based in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

“Today we say thank you to our veterans and those serving in the military,” said Darch. “Thank you to all for being with us today.”

Darch’s family shares in a rich family lineage of service in the armed forces.

“My dad served in the Army Air Corp during World War II. It was wonderful growing up with a dad who was a veteran. My husband served in the U.S. Navy. He was in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps during college and served on two different destroyers.” said Darch.

“It’s important to remember the sacrifice of those who have served our country and it’s important to be grateful for it,” said Darch. “We are very thankful for our veterans in the community.”

In the audience, Paul Corwin, Navy veteran from Barrington, listened to the Village President’s words and recounted his own military service.

“I attended Lane Technical High School in Chicago and graduated in 1962. I went into the Navy in 1965 and trained to be a nuclear plant operator. My job was to take samples and do surveys of radioactive areas,” he said. “I lost my best friend who was a radio operator with the U.S. Marines. He was killed in Vietnam.”

Corwin served on two ships during his Navy service. The U.S.S. Bainbridge and U.S.S. Cavalier, a Bayfield class attack transport, which operated in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Ariola spoke about the history of Veteran’s Day.

“As many of you know, we celebrate Veterans Day on the anniversary of the Armistice that ended the First World War. On November 11th, 1918, the armistice agreement was signed in a railroad car in Compiegne, France,” said Ariola.

In 1954, Congress changed the name from Armistice Day to Veterans Day to honor all veterans who served the nation.

“On Veterans’ Day, we honor the brave men and women from all walks of life who have stepped forward to defend our nation throughout our history,” said Ariola.

Barrington resident Rich Bowman served in the U.S. Air Force from 1962 to 1967. He is an ROTC graduate from Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois.

“I was in logistics and transportation,” said Bowman. “In Vietnam, I ran a small air terminal. My men loaded and unloaded cargo from cargo planes because it was too dangerous to use the roads.""

Bowman completed his military service at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii.

“They needed people who had served in Vietnam. It was a good experience. People always thank me for my service. It was the highlight of my life,” Bowman said.

Ariola paid tribute to what is the greatest asset in the U.S. military. The people who serve day and night in defense of the nation.

“Our all-volunteer force is a credit to Americans of all races, genders and creeds; and our common commitment to defense of, and love for, our country binds and unites us together. That goes to the heart of what it means to be an American,” Ariola said."

FORT BARFOOT, Va. – Virginia National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crews completed aerial firefighting support and Soldiers and Airmen began ground firefighting training Nov. 11.

After Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Nov. 6, aviation crews assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 224th Aviation Regiment, 29th Infantry Division, used two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters equipped with 660-gallon water buckets to drop almost 22,800 gallons of water on fires in Madison County through Nov. 9. Two helicopters flew missions in Patrick County Nov. 11, dropping nearly 13,900 gallons of water.

“Our helicopter crews mobilized and deployed in record time to provide additional resources to help the Virginia Department of Forestry in the fight against multiple large wildfires,” said Brig. Gen. Todd H. Hubbard, the VNG director of the Joint Staff. “Our partner agencies depend on the VNG to rapidly respond with requested capabilities when needed, and we are really proud of how quickly and safely our Soldiers responded.”

Approximately 30 VNG Soldiers and Airmen conducted the field day exercise portion of wildland firefighter training with the Virginia Department of Forestry Nov. 12 at Fort Barfoot after a day of online training. Guard members received personal protective equipment

and focused on basic tools, familiarization with bulldozers and engines, fireline construction and proper fire shelter use.

Once their training is complete, the troops will deploy where needed by DOF for ground support.

“The Soldiers and Airmen coming together to train for a possible ground support mission are from Virginia Army and Air National Guard units across Virginia, to include our 12M Army firefighters assigned to the Fort Barfoot Fire Department,” Hubbard said. “I am sure they are going to be a welcome sight to the crews who have been fighting wildfires for weeks, and we expect them to provide additional capabilities to allow some people to rest or help speed up the effort to finish getting the fires under control. It really is an honor to work with such dedicated professionals towards a common goal.”

Additional Soldiers and Airmen, members of the Virginia Defense Force and Virginia Department of Military Affairs employees are providing operations center, administrative, logistical and public information support in Richmond and Fort Barfoot.

“We owe a special thanks to the loved ones of all our personnel who are on duty as well their employers,” Hubbard said. “Without their support, we would not be able to accomplish our mission.”

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — The month of November started off productive with the annual Red, White and You Career Fair Nov. 1 at the Lone Star Conference Center at Fort Cavazos.

The Texas Workforce Commission, Workforce Solutions of Central Texas and the Texas Medical Center collaborated with the Fort Cavazos Transition Assistance Program to organize the event.

The event is one of three major career fairs held annually at Fort Cavazos to connect transitioning service members, military spouses, veterans and family members with hundreds of employers waiting to put service members’ unique skill sets to work for their respective companies.

Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, welcomed employers and anxious job seekers.

“This joint hiring event with team Cavazos and Workforce Solutions of Central Texas is one way that we improve the quality of life for our transitioning Soldiers, veterans and families,” she began. “This event plays a crucial role in helping Soldiers, veterans and families transition to civilian life successfully by connecting them with employment opportunities, resources and support, while also recognizing their contributions to the community and the nation. This is all about taking care of people.”

Almost two-hundred employers in a variety of career fields set up tables throughout the venue and spoke to a steady stream of interested parties about what their organizations offered and the types of positions available.

Jerry Hernandez, marketing manager for the Fort Cavazos TAP, explained that events like this are vital to help transitioning service members prepare for civilian life.

“What Soldiers need to understand when they get out of the military … right now they get their basic pay, they get their BAQ (Basic Allowance for Quarters), they get the medical and housing all paid for,” he explained. “When they get out to civilian life, that’s no longer covered. So, now they have to pay their medical, their housing, all that good stuff.”

Hernandez added that connecting Soldiers with hundreds of employers under one roof makes it a lot more convenient to find their next careers.

“It’s much easier,” he said. “Soldiers working on Fort Cavazos don’t have to go outside the installation or get transportation. So, that’s why we do it.”

Spc. Shakera King, 115th Brigade Support Battalion, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, said she appreciated being able to connect with numerous employers in one venue.

“Events like this help us. It’s during the workday, our jobs know that this is where we have to go, and we can meet all these people at one time. You can meet everybody at once, so that is really, really great.”

Representatives from “The HOP” were on hand to talk to potential hires about positions as bus drivers on Fort Cavazos. The organization will start micro transit services on post and is hiring Soldiers, veterans and military family members to fill approximately 50 part-time driving positions at $18 hourly, starting in February 2024.

“The base was kind enough to find us a home here, which will be based out of Fort Cavazos for all of our Fort Cavazos transit needs,” said Derek Czapnik, transportation superintendent for the HOP.

“This is going to be a game changer,” he said. “This is going to give the quality of life to a lot of one car families or single Soldiers or anybody that doesn’t want to drive. It’s going to be just a wonderful addition to the community.”

Two brothers from St. Paul, Minnesota joined the U.S. Army in 1917 as the United States was drawn into the First World War. One sacrificed his life serving in the Great War. The other survived a gas attack, returned to Minnesota, and started a family. Several generations hence, his great-grandson, inspired by his family’s legacy of service, is back in Europe with the U.S. Army’s 3rd Infantry Division protecting freedom once again.

It all started when U.S. Army Pfc. Frank Dingle from St. Paul Minnesota, joined in 1917. His brother U.S. Marine Pvt. Richard Wallace Dingle joined the Marine Corps April 20, 1917, just 14 days after the U.S. declared war.

Both brothers fought in World War 1. Frank was attached to the U.S. Army Ambulance Corps from 1917 to 1919, while Richard was an infantryman attached to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. Richard fought in the famed Battle of Belleau Wood where he was killed in action June 6, 1918, at the age of 20 years old.

His brother Frank survived World War I despite a gas attack and received the French Croix De Guerre Medal March 17, 1919 followed by an award citation from a field marshal from the French-East Army.

“Since entering service in the division, he has shown the most robust qualities of courage and dedication,” the award citation read. “During the night of October 1, 1918, despite great fatigue and great disturbances coming from a wave of gas, refused to be replaced and continued his service until all the wounded were evacuated.”

After returning from the war, Frank went to Pine River, Minnesota to become a dentist. In 1921, he founded American Legion Post 98 in St. Paul Park, Minnesota with the help of fellow local World War I veterans and named the Legion hall after his brother, Richard.

A generation later, following in the service of his grandfather, John Dingle joined the U.S. Army in May 1982.

“I wanted to be an Airborne Ranger,” he said.

Determined, he started his military career in basic training, then completed advanced individual training (AIT), as well as the airborne, and air assault schools.

“It’s about taking the challenge in front of you,” John said. “It’s what defines you.”

He was initially assigned to the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade combat team, 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. He was later transferred to the 2nd Ranger Battalion at Fort Lewis, Washington. During this time, he completed Ranger School.

He served with the Ranger Battalion until 1986 and decided to attend college at Saint Martins University in Washington State, where he joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.

“My proudest moment is getting through it all, basic training, AIT, airborne, air assault, Ranger School, and getting to where I wanted to be,” John said. “The second proudest would be commissioning as an officer.”

John served as an officer until 1991 at the age of 32.

“My life would have been drastically different if it wasn’t for the military,” John said.

Starting a family a few years later, John has four children. Three of the four sons, including his son Jordan, decided to follow in the footsteps of their family’s Veterans and joined the military.

“Service has always been on my mind since I was a little kid,” Jordan said. “I was always surrounded by it growing up and my dad would always talk about his time in the service.”

He attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and was commissioned as an armor officer May 21, 2022.

Jordan graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in military history and landed in the top 30 percent of his class.

Like his father, Jordan began completing tough training and military courses, like the U.S. Army’s Armor Basic Officer Leader Course, the Bradley Commander’s Course, and the Scout Leader Course.

“The most challenging of the courses was the Armor Basic Officer Leader Course,” Jordan said. “I had to learn to fight mounted on an (M1A2) Abrams which is similar to fighting dismounted, but maneuvering tanks provides a greater tactical challenge. It was definitely a learning curve.”

He eventually was assigned to the “Rock of the Marne,” the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division, which earned its nickname for its heroics on the same French battlefields of the First World War where his great grandfather and great-great uncle served. In fact, the 3rd Infantry Division fought alongside U.S. Marine Corps units during the Battle of Belleau Wood near the Marne River in 1918, where Jordan’s great-great uncle was killed in action.

“It’s probably my proudest moment in my military career to join the 3rd Infantry Division,” said Jordan. “The history of this unit is very inspiring: from the Thunder Runs in Baghdad, Vietnam, most campaigns in the European theater of war during the Second World War, and then back to my lineage, World War I.”

Like many service members, Jordan, who is currently deployed in Eastern Europe, looks to his fellow Veterans and his family’s legacy of service as a source of inspiration in his own service.

Members of the Dingle family have served in World War II, Vietnam, and Afghanistan to the present day in addition to Jordan’s service with the 3rd Infantry Division in Europe.

“I think it’s humbling to be able to serve in Europe just like previous Dingles,” Jordan said. “I am proud of my family for serving, especially my great-grandfather, and great-great-uncle, for their sacrifices. They represented the family well for the service they gave and I want to thank them for their impact on my life even though I’ve never met them.”

Veterans Day takes on a special meaning for Jordan. It’s important to him to not only reflect on family members who have served or those who continue to serve, like his brothers, but it’s important to remember all those who have served for the United States, he said.

“Ultimately it’s about selfless service and sacrifice,” Jordan said. “Most people see military sacrifice through the lens of combat, but it also encompasses the day-to-day sacrifice. It harkens back to being told what you do, even if it’s not something you want to do, you do it. Service members choose to join the military, to be something bigger than themselves, to give back to the country, and to challenge themselves every day. That’s why we honor service members on Veterans’ Day.”

Jordan’s service may very well inspire another generation of his family or other Americans to follow in his footsteps of service one day, just as previous generations of Dingles inspired him. He wants to continue being the best he can be for his unit and country. He hopes to attend law school someday and continue his service in the Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps. At the same time, his brothers are currently serving elsewhere in the U.S. Army. Capt. Jack Dingle is the commander of Alpha “Able” Company, 3rd Battalion, 509 Infantry (Airborne) in Anchorage, Alaska, and 2nd Lt. Jared Dingle is attending the Infantry Basic Officer Leadership Course at Fort Moore, Georgia.

As for John, he has plans to retire and move to Florida within the year.

“I am very proud of all four of my boys,” John said. “What comes to mind when I think of Jordan, he’s very intellectual. He enjoys learning and sharing his knowledge. I’m proud of what he has accomplished so far in his career, and I can’t wait to see what he does in the future.”"

WASHINGTON – As the air raid sirens and mortar blasts went off, medical evacuation crews dropped the wounded off at a hospital near the demilitarized zone. Young nurses worked around-the-clock to treat the injured despite attacks from the Viet Cong in South Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam War.

Some of the nurses never made it back and are honored on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Many of the other women gather each year at the Vietnam Women’s Memorial for camaraderie and to share stories of the past. This Saturday several of those women will celebrate the memorial’s 30th anniversary in Washington.

Call to Service

Many female combat veterans were following in their family members’ footsteps when they joined the Army.

Two former first lieutenants described their family connections. Patti Ehline’s father served in World War II and Vietnam. Her future husband was also joining the Army and would serve in Vietnam with her. Mary “Edie” McCoy Meeks commissioned into the military because her brother joined the Marines.

Capt. Diane Carlson Evans became an Army nurse because her brother served in the 101st Airborne Division, and then her other brother was drafted. Mary Breed, also a first lieutenant, joined after losing family members and a friend. Her brother was injured in Vietnam in 1968; a friend from her church was killed; and her girlfriend’s brother died.

“I was closely affected by the war,” she said.

Eileen King, then a second lieutenant, didn’t have any family members who served but felt a call to service. “There was a lot of criticism about America, what it stood for, especially about our military,” she said. “I wanted to serve my country. I felt very protective of my nation and the military. I wanted to do my bit.”

Nurse Recruiting

Jobs for women were limited in the 1960s. Many of the female nurse candidates were in nursing school when Army recruiters contacted them about joining the Army Nurse Corps.

“They were desperate for nurses over in Vietnam. They were desperate for stateside nurses to take care of the wounded because the Army hospitals needed staff,” Breed said.

As a student nurse, Breed received permission from her parents to enlist and sought out an Army recruiter. “I said, ‘I’m going to graduate next year as a registered nurse. How do I go to Vietnam?’” Carlson Evans said. “The Army offered the Army Student Nurse Program because there was a shortage of military nurses. They paid my tuition, my books and my uniforms my senior year in college. It was nice.”

They all said they passed their state boards, enlisted as private first classes for basic training, and then commissioned into the Army Nurse Corps.

In the trenches

The Viet Cong dug tunnels under the hospitals and stole equipment while the nurses worked in shifts that lasted 12 hours or longer. Soldiers would go into the tunnels to retrieve equipment but some would die from fatal cobra attacks.

The nurses learned techniques such as starting intravenous lines in the dark, performing amputations and working with burn patients.

“We had to measure up. When a Soldier came in and his life depended on us, we learned quickly,” Evans said. “We were the youngest nurses ever sent into battle. We had energy and stamina. We wanted to do our job. We were given a mission. We wanted to get each other home alive.

The men sandbagged the hooches and hospitals as they were rocketed and mortared. They were in the guard towers, some standing guard, getting killed, protecting us. We were in the hospitals saving lives.”

She said they heard artillery rounds 24 hours a day.

“We got used to the sounds of war, but we pulled together as a team. The men valued our service, and we valued theirs,” Carlson Evans said.

Breed worked at the 18th Surgical Hospital, which sat close to the demilitarized zone, and the 95th Evacuation Hospital.

“Sometimes you would have at least four doctors [working] on the same patient at the same time,” she said. “In the U.S., doctors take turns. Everybody had to work at once as quickly as possible to save the patient’s life and then move on to the next patient.”

“There was a tremendous team effort in caring for our patients,” Capt. Elaine Niggemann added. “We worked long hours but everyone pitched in. Some days were very hard but the camaraderie among us was great. It was enlightening to go from a college atmosphere to a war zone caring for patients.”

Memorable Patients

While nurses remember quite a few of their patients, each of the nurses have memorable patients from Vietnam.

King worked with a pilot who had lost both of his legs and one of his arms.

“It was obvious he was going to die. I don’t remember his name; I feel so guilty about it,” she said.

She said she went to the bathroom and when she came back, she saw that someone had left a letter for him.

It was from his wife and had a photo of his wife and child in it. “She told him she loved him,” she said.

Although King was tired from working a double shift, she said she didn’t want to leave. King finally had to rest for a few hours before her next shift. The pilot died 20 minutes later.

“For years, I wondered if I had just stayed, would he have lived longer? But I did my best,” she said.

Edie Meeks said an encounter with a young Soldier from Kansas still haunts her.

“I read a letter to him from his mom. She talked about his dad just coming in from pheasant hunting with his dog. At the end, she said, ‘We’re so proud of you, son.’ Three days later, he died,” she said.

Breed said she was in civilian clothes shopping at a shoe store on Fort Dix, New Jersey, when a former Soldier approached her.

“He said, ‘You were my nurse in Vietnam,’” she said. “He told me I took off his leg. I took off so many legs. I couldn’t remember each patient at that time and didn’t want to tell him that. I was still grieving the loss of my father at the time. I didn’t even hug him.

“Now I would give him the biggest hug in the world,” she said. “I asked him how he recognized me, and he said, ‘When you’re dying, you remember the last person you heard. You said to me, ‘I’ll take good care of you.’”

Ehline grew attached to a 10-year-old Vietnamese boy named Mai Van Bo. “It was the only day I cried in Vietnam,” she said. “It was the day I had to send him back to his village. I had become very close to him in the months he was at our hospital. He was paralyzed from the waist down, and I feared he wouldn’t survive in the village. His mom and I both cried.”

Niggemann worked three consecutive 12-hour shifts while caring for a young South Vietnamese man in the burn unit. On day four, he had a cardiac arrest and passed away.

“It was very sad and one of the few times I cried at work,” she said. “I will always remember him and the delightful conversations we had before he died. He told me about his family and children.”

Five years ago, she found his sister while searching the internet and spoke to her on the phone. “It was an emotional conversation,” she said. “I was able to answer some of the questions she and her family had regarding their loved one [and] tell her how much the nurses cared for and liked her brother; and that he did not die alone. It was an incredibly healing phone call for both of us.”

Life After Vietnam

Because of their hands-on experience, many of the Vietnam nurses went on to become physicians, dentists, civilian nurses and other high-ranking positions which were uncommon to women in the 1960s and 1970s.

Evans served as head nurse in a surgical intensive care unit and recovery room at Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas, and then founded the Vietnam Women’s Memorial in Washington.

Ehline serves on boards for the Vietnam Veterans of America to fight for the rights of veterans with PTSD.

Niggemann went to medical school and became a doctor.

Breed worked as an ICU nurse for the Department of Veterans Affairs for 15 years, as a missionary nurse for two years and then in the operating room.

King went on to practice law for 10 years, then she sat on the Superior Court of California. Now, she serves on the California Court of Appeal.

Advice for the Next Generation

Nurses faced mortar attacks and worked long shifts from Vietnam to Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. For these Vietnam nurses, they said they’d do it again in a heartbeat and recommend service to the next generation of nurses.

“It was an honor to serve in the Army Nurse Corps. I would do it all over again,” Niggemann said.

“Those two years changed my life, and I’d do it all again in a minute. Don’t just sit on the sidelines of life. Step up and participate,” Meeks said. “For the nurses after me, talk to each other, get help if you need it. We don’t have to carry everything alone.”

“I encourage young people to think about the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, some area of service,” Evans said. “I’m biased. I liked the Army. I liked boots on the ground. I wanted to be close to where the fighting was. Serving our country makes us more united; taking that oath to protect the Constitution and our democracy.”

WASHINGTON — Before James Earl Jones was making Americans remember their love of baseball or striking fear into their hearts as the voice of Darth Vader, he was an Army officer.

He commissioned in the summer of 1953 as a second lieutenant following graduation from the Reserve Officer Training Corps at the University of Michigan. After his initial training, he completed his first and only assignment by establishing a cold weather training command at the former Camp Hale near Leadville, Colorado.

Jones is just one of many Army veterans who not only served their country but also had illustrious civilian careers.

Below are a few others:

The late Tony Bennett was the son of Italian immigrants and grew up during the Great Depression in New York. Born Anthony Dominick Benedetto, he was drafted into the Army in 1944 during World War II.

As a young Soldier, he deployed to Europe with the 63rd Infantry Division, which replaced large casualties suffered during the Battle of the Bulge. His division fought its way across Germany throughout 1945 and liberated the concentration camp at Dachau.

At the end of the war, Cpl. Benedetto was sent to Mannheim, Germany as part of an Allied occupation force. There, he started singing with the 314th Army Special Services Band under the stage name Joe Bari.

Bennett used his GI Bill to study bel canto singing at the American Theatre Wing in New York City after leaving the Army in 1946. He was discovered shortly after by Bob Hope while he was on tour with Pearl Bailey. Hope told him he needed to change his name and said they would start calling him Tony Bennett.

Bennett went on to win 20 Grammy Awards and two Emmys during his prestigious career before passing away this summer.

Robert Duvall

Actor and filmmaker Robert Duvall grew up in a military household. He was the son of Navy Rear Adm. William Howard Duvall. Instead of following in his father’s Navy footsteps, Duvall enlisted in the Army in 1953 at the end of the Korean War.

He served two years at Camp Gordon, Georgia, now Fort Eisenhower, before being honorably discharged as a private first class.

He too used his GI Bill to take acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. He was classmates with Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Gene Hackman. His big acting break came in 1962 playing Boo Radley in “To Kill a Mockingbird.”

That springboarded a career that saw Duvall appear in many military theme films including “M*A*S*H,” “The Great Santini,” “Gods and Generals,” and “Apocalypse Now.”

Duvall, now 92, spends some of his spare time visiting Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals to thank injured veterans for their service.

Another celebrity that was drafted in the 1950s was Clint Eastwood, known to many as “Dirty Harry.” He became a swimming instructor at Fort Ord, California, after basic training.

In his spare time, he was a bouncer at bars and clubs off base, gaining recognition from some in Hollywood. After his honorable discharge in 1953, he used his GI Bill education benefit to take acting classes.

That was the start of a 70-year career in the entertainment industry as an actor, director and producer of movies and television.

Elvis Presley

The “King of Rock and Roll” went from superstar to Army private after getting drafted in 1957. Following an initial service deferment to finish filming a movie, Presley went through basic training in 1958 before being assigned to the 2nd Armored Division and then the 3rd Armored Division.

He spent two years on active duty, which included an 18-month stint in Germany where he was a truck driver. He finished his Army career as a sergeant and received an honorable discharge in 1960.

""I was in a funny position,” he said during an Armed Forces Radio and Television interview before his discharge. “Actually, that's the only way it could be. People were expecting me to mess up, to goof up in one way or another. They thought I couldn't take it and so forth, and I was determined to go to any limits to prove otherwise, not only to the people who were wondering, but to myself.

Jackie Robinson

The future Hall of Famer and man who broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson was drafted into the Army in 1942 during World War II. This was following a distinguished college career at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he became the first athlete to letter in four sports: baseball, basketball, football and track.

He was initially assigned to a segregated cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas, before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1943. He joined the 761st “Black Panthers” Tank Battalion.

In 1944, Robinson boarded an Army bus and was ordered to sit in the back but refused. He was taken into custody by military police and court-martialed. He was later acquitted and sent to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky.

There, he served as an Army athletics coach until receiving an honorable discharge in 1944. The next year, Robinson began playing baseball for the Missouri’s Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro leagues. He was spotted by Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Rickey signed Robinson and placed him with Brooklyn’s minor-league club, the Montreal Royals. Robinson was called up to make his major league debut with the Dodgers in 1947 as the first African-American player in MLB history.

He went on to be a six-time All-Star, Rookie of the Year and 1955 World Series champion. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 and passed away in 1972. His number was retired by MLB in 1997.

Schulz Museum; Roger Higgins/Library of Congress) VIEW ORIGINAL

The man we all must thank for “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” Schulz is the author and illustrator of the popular “Peanuts” newspaper comic strip, which stars Charlie Brown, Snoopy and friends.

Before he created the iconic series, Schulz, who grew up near Saint Paul, Minnesota, was drafted into the Army in 1943 during World War II. He served as a staff sergeant in the 20th Armored Division.

He came back to the U.S. in 1947 and started his career as an illustrator with the publication “Li’l Folks” in the St. Paul Pioneer Press. He pitched a four-panel strip to the United Feature Syndicate, and it was accepted.

The first release of “Peanuts” was Oct. 2, 1950, and it ran until Feb. 13, 2000. He passed away in his sleep at 77 after completing the final comic strip.

Ice-T

Tracy Marrow, now known by his stage name Ice-T, grew up in Newark, New Jersey until his parents both passed away while he was young. He lived with various relatives in Los Angeles, California, during high school and got involved with gangs.

Struggling to support his girlfriend and daughter after graduation, he enlisted in the Army as an infantryman. He served four years in the 25th Infantry Division. During a deployment to Hawaii, he served as a squad leader at Schofield Barracks.

After completing his enlistment, he returned home to California where he launched a successful music career winning multiple Grammy Awards. He then turned that success into a lengthy career in television and movies, playing detective Odafin Tutuola on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and starring in his own reality show “Ice Loves CoCo.”

Cooper, an Army veteran and Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army who holds more than 20 U.S. patents was awarded the medal for developing innovations in wheelchair technology and helping to strengthen the nation’s well-being. Cooper has dedicated his career to helping veterans to lead full and rewarding lives through engineering and advancing assistive technology.

WASHINGTON — While bike riding along a busy German road, Rory Cooper suffered an injury that changed the trajectory of his life.

An avid runner, the Army sergeant pedaled to work while recovering from knee pain on a summer day in 1980. Suddenly, a bus sideswiped with his bike. The impact pushed Cooper into the oncoming traffic, where a semi-truck hit Cooper and his bike.

Cooper awoke in a German hospital with tubes inserted into his body. The impact broke his clavicle, several ribs and ruptured his spine. Doctors told him that he would never walk again.

The sergeant didn’t know then, but the devastating injury would steer him towards a career where his work would touch the lives of thousands of Soldiers and civilians.

Years of treatment and therapy would follow for the sergeant before his medical discharge from the Army in 1982. As Cooper recovered and began planning his next steps, he never forgot the lessons he learned during his years in the Army as a unit armorer and civil affairs Soldier.

“If you take care of your people, they will take care of you,” he said. “I also learned about the importance of selfless service and not leaving anyone behind.”

The native of San Luis Obispo, California applied those lessons to the rest of his life.

He devoted his career to improving the lives of people with disabilities, from his research at the University of Pittsburgh to his more than three decades of work as a senior scientist and director of the Department of Veterans Affairs Human Engineering Research Laboratories. Cooper and his research teams developed new models of wheelchairs and services designed to make activities and facilities more accessible to patients throughout the nation.

Those achievements culminated in a White House ceremony Oct. 24 when Cooper accepted the National Medal of Technology and Innovation Medal from President Biden, the highest honor for technological achievement.

The medal reflected the impact of his wheelchair and service innovations, and the example he set for future rehabilitation engineers as a professor and mentor. Two days later, the distinguished professor was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

Since 2014, Cooper has served as a Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army, or CASA, for Western Pennsylvania. In addition to acting as advisors to Army Secretary Christine E. Wormuth, CASAs use their positions of influence to connect the Army with the larger civilian population.

“I think the CASA program is awesome. The CASAs that I’ve had the opportunity to work with are truly remarkable Americans and patriots,” Cooper said from his office in Pittsburgh. “[The CASA program] allowed me to connect with the Army in a deeper, broader way. I intend to stay connected and serve the Army in any way I can add value.”

As a CASA, he has coordinated Army-related events at the Pittsburgh Marathon and worked with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers on visits by Army leaders. During the marathon, he organized the planning of Army recruiter stations at the race and a military relay. Cooper said he coordinates internships for veterans and helps former service members with job placement.

“Being a CASA has been good for me because at the time I was injured, there was no warrior transition support,” Cooper said. “You just kind of went from being in the Army to being a patient. It’s been great to reconnect with the Army and serve again.”

Following that July 1980 injury, Cooper faced a crossroads in his life. He had originally considered returning to the Army as a commissioned officer prior to the accident, but after his spinal injury, he admittedly didn’t know his next move.

Cooper’s commanding general in Germany, then-Maj. Gen. Clarence McKnight visited Cooper at the hospital and encouraged him to pursue a career in engineering science.

“[He] told me I should continue to pursue my dreams,” Cooper said.

Before the bicycle accident, Cooper represented the Army as a track and cross country athlete at the World Military Games. While studying electrical engineering at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo County, Cooper again found his competitive edge, and began training to compete in wheelchair racing and wheelchair basketball.

He later participated in the National Veterans Wheelchair Games and eventually became a Paralympian, winning bronze at the 1988 Paralympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. He currently chairs the Paralympic Games Science Task Force, which studies athlete classification and ethical standards.

After receiving his master’s degree in electrical engineering at California Polytechnic State University Cal Poly, Cooper earned his doctorate in electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Cooper considers himself a “Soldier for Life,” concurrently contributing to the Army while working on his research in academia.

One of his projects at the University of Pittsburgh included the development of a lightweight, battery less wheelchair called a “PneuChair,” which allowed people with disabilities to participate in waterparks. Through the use of a joystick, patients could control their movements in the park while eliminating the danger of electrocution.

Cooper also invented a device known as the SmartWheel, which tracks and categorizes user movement and a variable-compliance joystick that makes wheelchair controls customizable.

“My proudest achievement, besides convincing my wife to marry me, is creating the Human Engineering Research Laboratories and all that we have been able to do, the people I’ve been able to train, and the impact that we’ve been able to have on the lives of people in our veteran population,” Cooper said.

For more nearly 30 years, Cooper worked with the Wounded Warriors program to help accommodate the needs of veterans with spinal injuries, traumatic brain injuries and multiple amputations. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Cooper made regular visits to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.

Cooper provided the veterans with devices that included ultra-light wheelchairs, and manual wheelchairs.

“To see our service members come back despite the challenges they were facing was very rewarding,” Cooper said. “We really give them good, quality wheelchairs and teach them about hand cycles, [cycles powered by hands]. To me it was very rewarding to see that the technology that we had contributed to was allowing them to get back into society.”

Cooper served as an Army World Class Athlete Program coach for the Army’s Paralympic athletes in wheelchair racing in 2011, even training future Paralympian swimmer Elizabeth Marks. Cooper also helped former Army Col. Greg Gadson, who lost both of his legs during a bomb attack, with his mobility. Cooper trained Gadson on hand cycling and helped get his wheelchair fitted.

“It is a privilege to serve. I’m very grateful to have served as a Soldier and then again as an athlete, and as a coach,” Cooper said. “It’s pretty meaningful.”

WASHINGTON — Around the corner from the Vietnam Wall stands a bronze statue of a nurse with a wounded soldier lying across her lap and sandbags at her feet. A second nurse searches for a medivac while the kneeling female Soldier stares at an empty helmet. The scenes are enshrined on the Vietnam Women’s Memorial, a monument that honors the services of women during the Vietnam War.

Female Vietnam veterans visited the memorial for its 30th anniversary celebration this past Saturday. Among them was the woman who spent 10 years fighting for its construction.

“I founded the Vietnam Women’s Memorial because I was very proud of the women I served with, and I felt they hadn’t received recognition and honor and had been left out of our memorials, books and movies,” said Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a captain and nurse in the Army.

The Vietnam Women’s Memorial, unveiled on Nov. 11, 1993, is the first monument to honor the efforts of military women at the National Mall. Evans, a Vietnam War veteran, said her time in the Army inspired her to find and tell more stories of women who served.

“No one really talked about the women who served in the military,” she said. “We were just invisible veterans. Even while we were serving, there wasn’t a lot written about what we were doing around the world during the Vietnam era. My service in Vietnam galvanized me to help tell their stories.”

Veterans returning from Vietnam weren’t welcomed by the public, Evans said. “It was very painful but I was very proud of my service, what I had done and accomplished, but we weren’t allowed to show that pride as women or men because we were being disparaged and diminished and scorned for serving our country. It was extremely painful,” she said.

After attending the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1982, she said she started to heal but recognized that many women who had served remained unknown.

“When I started this effort in 1983, I had to defend my proposal as to why women deserve this and why there should be an addition,” Evans said “There’s lots of criteria and gatekeeping, all kinds of opposition. It took 10 years of fighting and winning various approvals and working with Congress. It was like a second war for me. I wanted to honor my sister veterans.”

Her Time in Vietnam

Evans was raised around farmers while growing up in Buffalo, Minnesota. In 1964, many of those farmers were getting drafted. Two of her brothers enlisted in the Army, and one served with the 101st Airborne Division. While attending nursing school, Evans decided to talk to an Army recruiter. She learned the Army had a shortage of nurses and decided to join the service.

The military paid for her tuition, books and uniforms for her senior year in college. After her college graduation, Evans was assigned to Kenner Army Hospital at Fort Lee, Virginia for training. Finally, she deployed to Vietnam from August 1968 to August 1969.

“We were the youngest nurses ever sent into battle,” Evans said. “Most of us were under 25 years old. I was 21. The casualties in Vietnam in ’68 and ’69 were huge.

It was the height of the war, and I learned quickly. It didn’t take long to learn how to start IVs in the dark. We had to measure up when some Soldier came in and his life depended on us. We learned quickly. We were young and had a lot of energy.”

She said the hospital would get rocketed and mortared regularly. Soldiers put sandbags around the hospital and manned the guard towers.

“We were in the hospital saving lives as we heard incoming and outgoing artillery. We got used to knowing what the sounds meant; the air raid sirens,” Evans said. “We pulled together as a team — men and women. Our job was to take care of each other and get our jobs done and get home safely. We were there to protect our patients.”

Because of her hands-on experience in Vietnam, when she returned to the U.S., she was immediately promoted to captain at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. She later became head nurse in a surgical intensive care unit and recovery room.

Nurses on the Wall

Evans said she and her fellow nurses helped save the lives of 300,000 men who were wounded in Vietnam. “We were with so many of the men [whose names are on the Vietnam Wall] when they took their last breath,” she said.

Many of the nurses who made it back from the war continued their careers as physicians, dentists, teachers and colonels, Evans said. Some even went on to be the first female generals, including Brig. Gen. Anna Mae Hays, the chief of the Army Nurse Corps who became the U.S. military's first female general officer.

Importance of Memorial

Vietnam veteran Eileen Moore, now a justice with California Courts of Appeal, said having the memorial is important for her and the other female veterans.

“Being there and being among the other nurses who had gone to Vietnam was really healing for me,” the former second lieutenant said. “I had never tried dealing with the memories. Being around that statue and the other nurses helped me begin healing. The community really helps you.”

Moore, travelled from California to attend the anniversary, said she will never forget a pilot she treated who lost both of his legs and one of his arms. Like Moore, the pilot was Irish, so Moore spent more than 12 hours singing him Irish songs that they both had grown up with.

“I could see tears going down his face because I suspected his parents sang him the same songs,” she said. “I took a break and when I had come back, there was a letter for him. One of the guys in his unit must have brought it in. I opened it up and read it to him. It was from his wife. It had a picture of his wife and a little boy. She told him she loved him.”

She said her time in Vietnam gave her the courage to go to law school, sit on the Superior Court of California and then the California Court of Appeal.

Mary “Edie” McCoy Meeks served as a first lieutenant from February 1968 to February 1970 in Vietnam. She said she joined the Army Nurse Corps so that she could be there for her brother, a U.S. Marine, if he suffered an injury.

She said the memorial saved her life.

“I now know where to find women who speak my language; no explanations necessary, no judgements, just understanding,” she said.

If she could, McCoy said she would join the Army Nurse Corp again in a heartbeat. “Don’t sit on the sidelines of life. Step up, participate,” she encouraged.

For the nurses of the next generation, she said, “Talk to each other, it makes all the difference. Get help if you need it. We don’t have to carry everything alone.”

Mary Breed was a first lieutenant from 1969 to 1971 in Vietnam. Because of her on-the-job experience, she became an ICU nurse for the Department of Veterans Affairs for about 15 years and worked as a missionary nurse in developing countries.

“Vietnam taught me a lot,” she said. “I learned you are not self-sufficient. You have to work as a team and respect what everybody does. Their job is just as important as yours.”

She said she’s honored to have the memorial.

“I can’t thank Diane enough for all of the work she put in to make that possible,” she said. “As women, we’re taught to just accept life experiences. A lot of people kept it inside. We all identified with at least one of the people on that statue. I identified with the one holding the patient and the one looking up to the choppers.”

She said 17 crew members from the 237th Dustoff medical evacuation helicopters died the year she was in Vietnam so she was thankful she made it back safely.

“The statue is very moving, and I’m so thankful,” she said. “I hope it leads to more recognition of women in conflict and war.”

Call to Serve

As a pioneer who led the way for nurses to serve in the years that followed Vietnam, Evans encourages young women of the next generation to join the military.

“It’s the responsibility of each one of us to serve our country in some way. It makes us a better country to know that we took an oath to protect the Constitution, to protect our democracy,” she said. “We should all be taking that oath and stepping up to do whatever we can in service through military service or some kind of service to our country. It makes us a stronger, more united country.""

“We recognize that your service did not end with retirement,” she said. “Many of you continue to give back to our communities, mentor the next generation of leaders and support our Soldiers and their families in various ways. Your continued engagement is a testament to your enduring dedication.”

During the ceremony, a presentation with Soldiers wearing historical and current uniforms showed the long history of the U.S. military. Honorary retiree retired Sgt. Maj. Guadalupe Lopez was also recognized for his years of service in and out of uniform.

Guest speaker Robert Farias, assistant director of the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, spoke to the retirees on the health care available to them in the area and thanked them for their service.

“Thank you for your service,” he said. “Thank you for your bravery. Thank you to your spouses and family members for supporting you … and most importantly, thank you for all of your great sacrifices to our great country.”

There were many resources available to the retirees at the hospital including the CRDAMC Health Fair, which provided immunizations as well as health screenings. There were resources also available around Fort Cavazos, including legal assistance and ID card services.

Stokes encouraged them to take advantage of the resources available at the facility, connect with other veterans and allow the installation to help them receive the benefits and support that they earned through their service.

“As we look to the future, know that your legacy lives on in the military service members who stand here today and those who will follow in your footsteps,” she said.

“Your wisdom, experiences and leadership continue to guide us as we face the challenges of an ever-changing world,” Stokes added. “The bond that connects us as military service members, past and present, is unbreakable and we stand united in our commitment to defending freedom and protecting our great nation.”"

KILLEEN, Texas — Hundreds came out to enjoy the United Service Organizations at Fort Cavazos Trunk or Treat with H-E-B Operation Appreciation event Oct. 27 at the Killeen Special Events Center here.

Originally slated to be held on Fort Cavazos, the event was moved to the indoor venue because of inclement weather.

But a few intermittent showers didn’t stop hundreds of attendees who waited outside in long lines, while hundreds more enjoyed the festivities inside.

Benjamin Griffin explained that the USO at Fort Cavazos partnered with H-E-B for their Operation Appreciation 10-year anniversary, making the annual Halloween event one of the biggest ever.

“Events like this is something that’s super exclusive to our active-duty service members and their families. That’s what it’s about,” he said. “We see all these kids out here dressed up and we have provided a safe environment for them to come enjoy some candy, enjoy a bouncy house, some ice cream, some music and it’s once a year that we’re able to do something like this.”

With the smell of barbecue in the air and the upbeat sounds of the 1st Cavalry Division Band entertaining onlookers, the wide-open space bustled with interactive activities, circus performers, face painting stations, games, six large bouncy houses and a huge inflatable slide.

Because no Trunk or Treat event would be complete without an array of sweet treats, the USO at Fort Cavazos staff and volunteers, along with volunteers from the Directorate of Public Works, 1st Medical Brigade and Cavalry Family Housing, handed out candy.

The H-E-B mobile kitchen provided barbecue sandwiches, drinks, popcorn and cotton candy. Guests also delighted in using the 360-activation station.

Military spouse Sandy Kerfoot and her five children made quite a creative and tasty impression dressed as a variety of iconic characters representing their favorite cereals.

“It’s the highlight of our Halloween season, picking out costumes,” she said.

Kerfoot shared that dressing up is a 12-year tradition for her children and the event was a great opportunity to bond with other military families.

“It’s just great to see the whole community out together, making those connections, seeing those same people over and over again.”

But it wasn’t just the youngsters that showed off their creativity when it came to their Halloween get-ups.

Dressed as superheroes, the Go Team Therapy/Crisis Dogs Central Texas joined in the fun and delighted guests with their inventive outfits and friendly dispositions.

Spc. Brittney Caraway and Spc. Sahria Blanks, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command, said the event was a great way for Soldiers to get out and have a good time.

“It’s important for the unit as a whole to boost morale and get to know each other,” Caraway said.

“You have people that come, dress up, without it being so serious. We can actually have fun together,” Blanks added.

Griffin estimated that more than 4,500 Soldiers, military families and Halloween enthusiasts attended the event, adding that it’s about serving the military community.

“At the USO, it’s all about hospitality,” Griffin said. “Touching those folks in ways where they can relax, have a good time and just enjoy themselves. We’re talking just an exceptional amount of things that were put into this, and again, with the weather changing, we could not be happier with the turnout.

“This was a once in a lifetime thing to partner with H-E-B to be able to put on this amazing gift for the 10-year anniversary of Operation Appreciation,” he added. “All the stars aligned, and we are just so happy and thrilled to be able to do that to support our community in the best way possible.”"

FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. - When discussing national security is not uncommon to examine India in comparison to China as a rising power in the Indo-Pacific. In the second Cultural and Area Studies panel of the 2023 academic year and 11th of 2022-2023, the impact of India as a rising power, the history of the U.S. and China’s counter strategic stances and basic blockades to a U.S.-China relationship were examined by a panel of experts in each area during the event held Nov. 2.

The panel included Mr. Michael Kugelman, Director of the South Asia Institute, The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; Dr. Megan Greene, Professor of modern Chinese history, Department of History, the University of Kansas; and Mr. Terry Mobley, Diplomacy Chair, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, a career foreign service officer, U.S. Department of State.

Trifold of advantages of India to national security

Kugelman discussed India’s role in the China-U.S. relations from three perspectives; history, geography, and strategy.

In the late 1950’s the U.S. was quite interested in having India as a partner to counter China, but this idea was altered with the changing of administration in the 1970s.

This change was followed by an ebb of pursuit of U.S.-India partnership for nearly 20 years. With the emergence of China competition, the views of India for national security have shifted.

“In the last decade, especially in the last several years, India is being seen as partner in efforts to counter China,” Kugelman explained.

China continues to push westward to expand its presence in south Asia.

China’s recent aggressive territorial claims to areas equally important to the U.S. and India such as the south China Sea and Taiwan Straight have encouraged the U.S. and India to again amplify their partnership, Kugelman explained.

“For many years India has been concerned with what it describes as a ‘String of Pearls’ and ‘Encirclement’ strategy on behalf of China to deepen influence in India’s backyard,” Kugelman said. “India has grown increasingly concerned in more recent years as China has been doing that even more intensely. BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] being one of the main vehicles in which it has done that.”

Kugelman introduced the question if space should be a frontier of concern in the future when it comes to the U.S.-India-China triangle, with a recent lunar landing by India.

Strategically, India has been seen as the best bet to countering China in south Asia due to its size and location, among other areas such as military and population size, he explained.

“U.S.-India relations have been growing exponentially since the early 1990s and trade cooperation has been one of the reasons for that,” Kugelman said. “U.S.-India trade cooperation proceeds along a track that is completely separate from China that doesn’t relate to China competition that much.”

There are challenges for the U.S. India policies due to certain factors such as bureaucracy slowing down or stopping initiatives between the two countries; India’s continued connection to Russia for various goods; and India’s stance on the U.S. alliance system.

“India has vowed to never join the U.S. alliance system because of its policy of strategic autonomy,” Kugelman said.

China-U.S.-Taiwan Relationship: then and now

As early as 1945, the Chinese absorption and then rapidly afterward control over Taiwan began, Greene explained.

Due to the continued control of the Republic of China over Taiwan, in the 1900s and 2000s, Taiwan began to call for separation from China as a whole.

The late 1970s saw the creation of the Taiwan Relations Act by the U.S., vowing the need to ‘maintain capacity’ to defend Taiwan, after the nation was de-recognized within the United Nations.

Prior to this the U.S. invested heavily in Taiwan’s economic growth particularly in the areas of fiscal, advising, and technological support, Greene explained.

“These efforts on the part of both the U.S. and Taiwan have led to the emergence of Taiwan as a high-tech hub in certain areas, with a good example of that is semiconductors,” she said. “In 2023, Taiwan produces more than 60% of all semiconductors and over 90% of the most advanced semiconductors produced worldwide, which is a strategic concern.”

“Although Taiwan was governed for 40 years under martial law, in 1987 martial Law was lifted. It was lifted partly as a strategy to gain support outside of Taiwan,” Greene said.

Since then, Taiwan continues to hold elections that have garnered rotating representation of the parties within elected leaders.

“The democratization was at some level a strategy to solicit continued U.S. support,” Greene said. “It also satisfied the demands on the part of Taiwan’s people to determining their own futures. And it certainly succeeded in doing the later.”

Five Key Issues in China-U.S. Relationship

Taiwan continues to be a central priority to the China-U.S. relationship.

An upcoming election could see a leader in power who is motivated for independence, which would be contrary to China’s thoughts on the nation, Mobley explained.

South China Sea is another area of focus, Mobley said, pointing out the Chinese Nine Dash Line.

A significant trade route for more than 10% of U.S. trades plus competing interests of territories and area create choppy geopolitical waters for this region.

“Maritime domain awareness is something the U.S. has been pushing with south Asian countries for some time now,” Mobley said.

The Senkaku or DiaoYu Islands, are used as a way to push nationalism by China, he explained, making incidents around the area volatile, much like events of similar nature around Taiwan, with the U.S. taking a neutral stance on the area’s sovereignty.

Rare earth elements are critical to several different applications to include defense.

“As of the end of 2022, China accounted for 63% of the world’s rare earth mining, 85% of rare earth processing, and 92% of rare earth magnet production,” Mobley said. “Not just the U.S. but the entire world is heavily, heavily dependent on China for rare earth elements.”

Furthermore, nearly 20% of pharmaceutical ingredients are imported from China, with 40% of global antibiotic production also falling to China.

The discussion continued with questions regarding the effect the Belt and Road Initiative has on the U.S. and China relationship, conversations about what India-U.S. cooperation may look like in space and the potential use of Myanmar by China to bypass the South China Sea trade route tension.

This panel is part of a seminar series discussing issues of operational and strategic importance to the U.S., which CASO in coordination with CGSC, universities, think tanks, interagency and other partners conduct every two to three months, which is also live streamed on CGSC's Facebook page.

147,COMMENTARY: Flanders Fields still remain in the hearts of America’s veterans,https://www.army.mil/article/271557/commentary_flanders_fields_still_remain_in_the_hearts_of_americas_veterans,"Flora four and six open up, blood petals of young poppies,

and dance and weave ‘neath violent winds of change.

War rages betwixt blackened air and chopped seas,

entrenched in rage -- no way across No Man’s range:

Central Powers four and Allies six, hatred’s blood overspills.

Warriors, rooted, stand their ground where vainglories die—

No hope of home light’s warmth beyond Flanders Fields,

just poppies freely waving where heroes, resting, lie. ~ E. Pilgrim

Some veterans have served in combat, some have served in peacetime, some have served a few days or years, some have served until retirement and beyond. But each has taken the oath to support and defend the Constitution and the United States against all enemies, even if that means losing their life. All are worthy of honor on this and every Veterans Day. (Photo Credit: Eric Pilgrim, Fort Knox News) VIEW ORIGINAL

Like Memorial Day, Veterans Day sprang from war.

Unlike Memorial Day when we remember and honor our fallen heroes, Veterans Day is an opportunity to honor all who have answered the call to serve the nation. Service in war, service in peacetime, 10 days, 10,000 days, it matters not.

It doesn’t matter because those who have served or are serving have done so with the full understanding that they might one day have to sacrifice their lives for that service. It starts with the contractual oath:

“I solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic …”

It’s implied in the Warrior Ethos:

“I will ALWAYS (emphasis mine) place the mission first. I will NEVER accept defeat. I will NEVER quit. I will NEVER leave a fallen comrade.”

It’s clearly spelled out in the Soldier’s Creed: “I am an American Soldier. I am a warrior and a member of a team. I serve the people of the United States, and live the Army Values … I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy, the enemies of the United States of America in close combat.”

Soldiers regularly sing about it in the Army Song at every ceremony: “Count the brave, count the true, who have fought to victory” and “Fighting till the battle’s won.”

They breathe it every day of their service to the nation, spelled out in the Army Values: Loyalty. Duty. Respect. Selfless Service. Honor. Integrity. Personal Courage. Those aren’t empty platitudes that are spoken to deflect the unsuspecting away from our failures or substandard efforts. The words matter. Every word matters.

Most successful organizations have mission statements, mottos, cultural beliefs and standards. Otherwise, they likely wouldn’t be successful. Few employees, though, are willing to die for them. That’s what sets the warrior apart.

It’s what ushered the Central Powers – Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria -- to agree to an armistice with the Allied Forces of France, United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Japan and the United States on Nov. 11, 1918. It was a way for the Central Powers to admit defeat without further bloodshed.

Most historians agree that it was the entrance of America’s warriors into World War I that eventually led to the armistice and then to the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, which officially ended the war. On Nov. 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson officially called for the nation to celebrate “Armistice Day.” He told the public to honor the day with parades and public gatherings as well as a moment of silence at 11 a.m.

Exactly two years later, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was established at Arlington National Cemetery when officials interred and commemorated a warrior who had died in World War I. The Soldier’s casket was chosen by Sgt. Edward Younger out of four identical caskets. Younger had been wounded in the war and had earned the Distinguished Service Medal.

The unrelenting, determined sacrifices of America’s warriors is a fixture in the American psyche. It is stitched into America’s banner: a banner carried in war, a standard raised high in battle by men and women who have answered the call and have stood in the gap to defend the nation’s freedom and its Constitution against all enemies.

Our veterans devoted their lives to safeguarding our freedom. Devote some time on this special day to thank them. Remember the red poppies of Flanders' fields, and honor them all."

MADISON COUNTY, Va. - Virginia National Guard Soldiers assigned to the Sandston-based 2nd Battalion 224th Aviation Regiment, 29th Infantry Division, are helping fight wildfires in Madison County.

In the first 24 hours, VNG aviation crews dropped nearly 10,000 gallons of water on the fires.

After Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Nov. 6, the VNG deployed two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters equipped with 660-gallon water buckets at the request of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management to support the Virginia Department of Forestry.

The Guard planned to continue to assist in the firefighting efforts Nov. 8.

“We are extremely proud of how quickly and safely our aviation crews responded to start assisting with aerial fire suppression in Madison County after Governor Youngkin’s emergency declaration,” said Brig. Gen. Todd H. Hubbard, the Virginia National Guard director of the joint staff.

“The role of the National Guard in domestic operations is to provide additional capabilities to partner agencies to help our fellow citizens in times of need, and this is a perfect example of how that works,“ Hubbard said. “The Department of Forestry and firefighting crews from across the region have been battling the fire in Madison County for nearly two weeks, and now our capabilities give them extra resources in the fight. It is an honor to work with such dedicated professionals towards a common goal.”

VNG aviation crews conducted water bucket training in October at Fort Barfoot. Aviation assets can support firefighting efforts using water buckets, which require periodic training for flight crews to ensure proficiency with the equipment.

The training provided currency and qualifications for three flight crews, capitalizing on lessons learned fighting fires during the unit’s deployment to Kosovo in 2022.

During domestic operations, the VNG receives missions from VDEM and responds as part of a multi-agency team with other state and local agencies.

149,Sowing seeds of service starts with vets,https://www.army.mil/article/271532/sowing_seeds_of_service_starts_with_vets,"REDSTONE ARSENAL, Alabama —The excitement was almost electric when I dropped my kids off at school this morning. You could feel the energy pulsing in the halls and the current of conversation was all about the day’s big event: the Veterans Day program.

As I sat and sipped my coffee waiting for my husband to arrive, I reflected on the morning’s progress so far. My usual challenge of rousing my girls was effortless – they were up and fully dressed before I was – and all because their Soldier dad was coming to school for Veterans Day. It was, apparently, a VERY big deal.

As I observed and listened to the hallway chatter, I heard snippets of conversation. “My mom is a veteran – she’s coming!” “My grandpa is a veteran – he’s coming!” These were endearing to hear, but not surprising. It’s totally natural for immediate relatives to come and support their kids’ and grandkids’ school events.

What did surprise me, however, were those with no familial relation showing up as a guest of a student, or as a supporter of the school. As the program commenced, students and their veterans were announced and then walked under the sabers of an honor guard, getting the full VIP treatment for all in attendance to recognize.

Some who came with the students were announced as friends of the family, others as neighbors. Some of the older veterans who were invited by the school to participate were solo and announced as friends of the school.

Every single one of them was treated like a rock star and cheered by a gym full of pre-kindergarteners to eighth graders. Every. Single. One.

It struck me, as I looked around at little hands waving clutched American flags that, as military families, we often take for granted that everyone has a veteran in their lives. That everyone has someone to set the example of selfless service for them. That everyone has someone who took an oath to protect and defend our nation.

We forget that many of those little flag-waving hands, cheering at the events, want to have a veteran, too. They want to have a special person on Veterans Day to stand proudly next to and declare to the world, “This is MY veteran!”

When you look at the statistics of people who have served in uniform, it’s an astonishingly small number when compared to the rest of the population. And it’s getting smaller by the minute.

Whether through the passing on of those who served in prior wars, or simply the lack of those currently enlisting or commissioning, our supply of veterans is dwindling. And friends, that simply is “unsat” (to employ a phrase often used by veterans when the situation isn’t satisfactory).

So, for those veterans still hearing a call to duty, here is a challenge to you: find a young person who may not have a veteran in their life and be THEIR veteran.

It might be a neighbor, it might be the child of a co-worker, it might be someone you already mentor. Talk to them about your service. Let them know you care about them, and their Veterans Day activities at school.

Be the one to teach them about the importance of selfless service, duty and honor. Be the one who inspires their own service to their community.

Be the one to teach them to be all they can be.

It’s an investment worth your time. Your military leadership and mentorship experience could be the key to their success. Being THEIR veteran could have far-reaching impacts for our nation that you can’t even begin to imagine.

Just take the first step, sow the seeds of service, sit back and watch them grow.

Who knows?

You might just grow a Soldier."

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Senior army leaders from 21 Western Hemisphere nations gathered in the coastal city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for the 2023 Conference of American Armies Commanders Conference beginning on Nov. 6, 2023. Brazil served as the host of this year’s conference as they concluded their role as the permanent executive secretariat of the 35th cycle.

Each CAA cycle lasts two years and rotates on a voluntary basis between the 23 member armies. The theme of the 35th cycle is, “The CAA’s contribution in the process of transformation and preparation of the ‘Army of the Future’ for the expansion of cooperation and integration on confronting the challenges and threats that may affect the security and stability of the American Continent.”

“Just the fact that you are all here means you are committed to strengthening these relationships,” said Brazilian Army Commander, Gen. Miguel Mine Ribeiro Paiva Tomas, during the opening ceremony. “The CAA reinforces the military diplomacy and is a forum where we can have conversations on topics of similar interest. The CAA is indispensable to the politics of the region.”

As a founding member, the U.S. Army stands alongside the partners in an effort to achieve each cycle’s goals. The U.S. Army also recognizes the significance that international organizations such as the CAA play in stabilizing various regions of the world.

“The CAA is an opportunity for us to foster relationships and provides a platform to increase the stability and security across the Americas,” explained Gen. Andrew P. Poppas, U.S. Army Forces Command commanding general and senior U.S. Army representative at the CAA. “I am honored to have taken part in this event.”

Throughout each year, the U.S. Army participates in several training exercises to further the CAA objectives of strengthening integration and cooperation among the American Armies, protect against threats to peace in the region, and advance democracy and freedom.

U.S. Army South, commanded by Maj. Gen. William L. Thigpen, serves as the primary representative for U.S. Army activities throughout the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility.

“Throughout the year, we conduct a large number of events demonstrating our commitment to the CAA objectives, including training exercises, subject matter expert exchanges, and senior leader dialogue,” said Thigpen. “In the past week, Soldiers arrived in Brazil to take part in Exercise Southern Vanguard 24 and we hosted the Chilean Army commander in chief at our headquarters to discuss future combined training opportunities.”

This year’s commanders conference started with an opening ceremony followed by a plenary session, during which the Brazilian Army provided an overview of the 35th cycle’s activities. Participants also reviewed the results of the electronic vote that took place earlier this year which made changes to CAA bylaws, included Portugal as a special observer to the CAA, and identified Paraguay as the host army for the 37th cycle of the CAA.

At the conclusion of the plenary session, attending armies conducted bilateral meetings to discuss shared challenges and security cooperation opportunities.

“This conference was a great experience,” remarked Poppas. “I enjoyed being able to sit down and discuss training opportunities and develop a better understanding of the unique challenges throughout the region.”

This year’s conference concluded with the official handover ceremony marking the end of the Brazilian Army’s role as the permanent executive secretariat as they passed the responsibility over to the Mexican Army, who will fill the position for the two-year duration of the 36th Cycle."

ARLINGTON, Va. – In a hallowed corner of Patton Hall at Northern Virginia’s Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, a journey through the annals of American military history awaits. An officer’s saber from the late 19th century, a World War I-era combat helmet, and a flag that bore witness to the attack on Pearl Harbor stand as sentinels to a remarkable legacy.

Welcome to The 1636 Room, a treasure trove of nearly 200 unique artifacts curated by the National Guard’s 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia. It’s a living tribute to the nation’s oldest military organization.

For Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, the room honors the Guard’s heritage and its legacy of “courage, duty, honor and service.”

“The 1636 Room is a tribute to that tradition, a commemoration of a force unlike any other — one that continues to have an impact as 20% of the Joint Force and continues to shape the course of history,” Hokanson said during the ceremony unveiling the exhibit Nov. 1.

The idea for The 1636 Room originated late last year when Hokanson asked the National Guard Bureau History Office to develop a plan for a heritage space where Guard members could gather for events and social occasions and for others to learn more about the force.

By spring, he signed off on the history office’s recommendation that Patton Hall would be the ideal spot, said Richard Clark, NGB chief historian.

“It is centrally located, and it has a rich history of its own,” he added, noting the 3rd U.S. Regiment, as “the oldest regiment in the Army, has a room at Patton Hall, and it seemed appropriate for the oldest U.S. military organization to have a place there as well.”

Honoring the roots of today’s National Guard, the exhibit space is named in tribute to the 1636 Massachusetts Bay Colony militia and boasts an extensive array of strategically positioned artifacts that include framed flags, panel displays, photographs, visual artworks, and replicas. Clark explained each item encapsulates the essence of unique events, remarkable achievements, unit emblems, and historic missions undertaken by different Guard elements.

Army Maj. Gen. James W. Ring, adjutant general of Virginia, said the series of framed pictures showcasing Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division from its beginnings in World War I to Operation Iraqi Freedom was a fitting contribution to the room.

“For us on the Virginia side, we carry heavy within the 29th,” said Ring, who attended the ceremony along with nearly 150 senior Guard leaders.

While the photographs are significant for Virginia Guard members, Ring said the room’s spirit can resonate with all Soldiers and Airmen.

“This is a chance for all of us to have the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of the Citizen-Soldier and Airman tradition of those that came before us,” he said. “It’s a tremendous honor to be here today.”

NGB history officials emphasized the room’s purpose extends beyond showcasing history.

There is a canteen, cup and mess kit engraved by Soldiers from New Mexico National Guard’s 200th Coast Artillery during World War II. These very Soldiers later endured the harrowing Bataan Death March, followed by internment in POW camps.

The artifacts represent valor and immense suffering. Of the roughly 1,800 Soldiers from New Mexico who fought in the Pacific Theater, only about half returned at the war’s end.

The history office will continue updating the room as it receives more items representing different aspects of Guard heritage.

“As the National Guard evolves, the room will evolve with it,” said Clark, adding the room “is not a static display. It’s a dynamic space that evolves as states swap out artifacts, and as additional states and territories and District of Columbia identify their contributions.”

In his closing remarks, Hokanson said the room — with the intent and purpose of honoring Guard heritage with unique items from the past — is only the beginning.

“These items are not only part of our history — they are part of our ongoing story,” he said.

OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. - The 55th Operations Support Squadron’s survival, evasion, resistance and escape specialists, better known as SERE, joined with the Nebraska Army National Guard to conduct hoist training Nov. 4.

Company G, 2nd General Support Aviation Battalion, 104th Regiment, flew a UH-60 Black Hawk from Lincoln to Offutt, which enabled personnel from both units to carry out some mandatory training.

“In order to maintain our mission-capable status, SERE specialists are required to accomplish hoist proficiency training every 36 months,” said Master Sgt. Clifton Cleveland, 55th OSS SERE program superintendent.

All of the 55th OSS SERE specialists had accomplished their training before arriving at Offutt, so Cleveland came up with a plan to keep them proficient.

“We reached out to the Nebraska National Guard in September and the discussion evolved into this joint training opportunity,” he said.

For the Nebraska Army National Guard Soldiers, this training also allowed them to remain current, which is required every 90 days.

“It is important for us to continuously train hoist to remain proficient for any potential missions we may get,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Russell Kuhlman, G Company, 2-104th GSAB training officer. “For example, during the 2019 floods, we conducted many hoist missions to rescue people from the cold water.”

SERE specialists are experts at surviving in the most remote and hostile environments. Hoist training is invaluable for exfiltrating people when aircraft cannot land.

“Hoist training is designed to prepare SERE specialists and aircrew members how to properly execute recovery tactics, techniques and procedures safely in a wide variety of austere environments,” Cleveland said.

“If an aircraft could not land for whatever reason, like steep terrain, foliage or urban environments, a hoist could be used,” Kuhlman said. “This involves hoisting a medic down to patients to treat, package, triage and evacuate them from the battlefield. Once the medic has done what is needed on the ground, we can hoist patients and the medic out using different types of extraction devices.”

Maintaining proficiency is essential not only to the SERE specialists but also to all of Team Offutt. By maintaining their mission-capable status, they can offer SERE refresher training, a 36-month requirement for all aircrew members.

“The SERE program exists to better train, prepare and equip over 2,700 warfighters here at Offutt as well as at three operating locations and two geographically separated units,” Cleveland said.

With the positive outcome for both units involved, they are already looking ahead for other chances to collaborate.

“This initial integration with the Nebraska Army National Guard has already opened numerous opportunities for our SERE specialists to integrate into future personnel recovery exercises and events together,” Cleveland said.

“There are a lot of valuable training opportunities our teams could mutually benefit from,” Kuhlman said. “We are looking at the possibility of doing a SERE training event for some of our crew chiefs and medics who do not get the same SERE training our pilots do.”

FORT MITCHELL, Ky. – Honor Guard Soldiers from the Kentucky National Guard on Nov. 4 helped honor a Medal of Honor recipient whose grave had gone unmarked and almost forgotten for 148 years.

U.S. Army Sgt. John F. Rowalt of Bellville, Ohio, served during the American Indian War before contracting smallpox and dying at the age of 28 in Cincinnati. He was buried at the nearby Highland Cemetery in Kentucky.

“It’s definitely something special for us,” said Army Sgt. Scott Zelensky, northern Kentucky area coordinator for the Honor Guard. “It’s not something we get to do every day, especially for a Medal of Honor recipient, but at the end of the day, we do the same job as normal. We provide the same honors to that veteran.”

Representing Rowalt’s family was his great-niece, Fran Dankovic of Lexington, Ohio.

“This is awesome,” she said. “I’m so grateful to everyone who helped put this together and to the ones that showed up. I was nervous yesterday thinking about it, but being here today has been great.”

During the ceremony, Capt. Mitchell Hagen with the KYNG Honor Guard presented Dankovic with a folded flag in honor of her late great-uncle.

“I’m at a loss for words,” she said after the ceremony. “This was a lot more than I expected. I’m just so honored by all this.”

Former Kentucky Air National Guardsman Rob Schultz and journalist Carl Hunner with the Richland Source led this “labor of love.”

Their research and hard work paid off, as they were able to provide a headstone for Rowalt.

According to Hunnell, Rowalt was 19 years old when he earned the Medal of Honor. As a private serving in Company L with the 8th United States Cavalry Regiment, his unit got into a fight at Lynx Creek in the Arizona Territory during the Apache Wars Oct. 14, 1869. It was during that battle that Rowalt distinguished himself, earning the Medal of Honor for “gallantry and action with Indians,” according to the citation.

Rowalt was discharged from the Army May 11, 1873, in Fort Union, New Mexico, as a sergeant. He returned to Cincinnati to live with his brother but contracted smallpox, for which there was no cure. He died and was buried at Highland Cemetery. The grave was unmarked for the past 148 years.

“It will never again be unmarked,” said Hunnell, as he spoke to those in attendance. “A hero has his recognition.”

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash.— —A movement on the horizon catches the eye of a sniper team. Through his scope, the spotter tracks the gentle movement of the grass, gauging the direction of the wind and distance to the target. His partner takes aim, gently squeezes the trigger... and bang.

For a snipers and spotters with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion, 161st Infantry Regiment, 81st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, success depends on perfect calculation in an imperfect environment. That is why they conducted an alternate position and urban stress shoot training event at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Nov. 4, 2023.

This training is all in preparation for Guard snipers to compete at the Winston P. Wilson Sniper Championship, an annual National Guard competition held at Camp Robinson in northern Arkansas.

“The preparation for this competition is pretty hard,” said U.S. Army Sgt. Remi Milslagle, a sniper team leader with HHC, 3-161 Inf. “They keep the majority of the details from all of the competitors, so you really have to work well with your teammate to prepare for whatever the competition throws at us.”

Getting to know how to best work with a teammate is essential for a sniper. Training together and participating in these competitions help build unit cohesion as well as allow the unit to know how well they can perform alongside their peers. Sniper/spotter teams must work quickly to make precise adjustments in a high-stress environment. The attention to detail before taking a shot at a target is a key factor for every move a sniper and his teammate will make.

“You’re taking out all of the factors such as wind, distance, position and so on before the first shot even goes off,” said Milslagle. “It's definitely a two-person job. If you don’t hit the target, you need your partner to spot the shot and make adjustments quick.”

In addition to showcasing a unit's excellent marksmanship skills, the competition's objective is to evaluate the performance of competing teams and how it pertains to unit training. Teams have the opportunity to network and display how well they perform when given newer and more efficient equipment.

“We just recently received the MK22 rifle which will replace the M2010 that we currently use,” explained fellow sniper Sgt. Matt Meckley. “So doing these training sessions as much as we can will help us get familiarized because these new weapons are what will be used in the competition.”

Training with better equipment allows for the snipers to do their job to the best of their ability. When units take part in training and competitions, it enables snipers to shoot at long distances, learn how to maneuver, conduct reconnaissance operations and overall prepare and train for missions.

“The competitions are a great way for us to measure our skill relative to our peers,” said Meckley. “We don't get a chance to do that with other units very often because we're such a small organization. It allows us to work as a team and to see how other teams perform as well.”

Snipers are an asset whose primary focus is to be able to shoot at long distances. It takes time and effort for a sniper unit to prepare and train. Their mission begins long before a shot is even fired.

“We conduct reconnaissance for days at a time, we hike through the woods, and we try to get vantage points to best see the battlefield before the battle even starts,” said Milslagle. “The sense of responsibility that is given to us as a small team and being able to accomplish the mission feels very rewarding.”"

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash.-- U.S. Soldiers with the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion (Linguist), 56th Theater Information Operations Group, Washington National Guard, put their language skills to the test during the annual Valor Language Games on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., Nov. 4, 2023 .

""It has been a very successful iteration of these games,"" said Maj. David Grun, operations officer for the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion. ""Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves and they feel challenged by the events.""

The Valor Language Games, named after the battalion’s call sign and motto,“Vigilance and Valor”, consists of three events, each testing intelligence soldiers on their expertise in tactical questioning, voice intercept/analysis, and briefing a senior office on the commander's priority intelligence requirements (PIR) they found during their questioning. Linguists are tested as individuals and as a team on their abilities to read, speak, and listen to the languages including Russian, Korean, Chinese, Spanish and French.

""The Valor Games are used to test the linguists' proficiency in their language and as a precursor to a much larger game, called the Polyglot games, hosted by our higher headquarters, the 300th Military Intelligence Brigade (Linguist),"" said Grun.

The first test of the games is a tactical questioning lane where linguists must question an informant to obtain potentially critical information about a scenario using their foreign language skills. The second lane is voice intercept/analysis, a computer-based challenge where competitors must use their skills as a linguist in both reading and listening in their perspective languages while gathering details of the scenario for their brief during the culminating event. During the last lane, linguist must come together as a team and compile all of their intel from their previous lanes and create a brief to present to a senior officer. They are graded on the interpretation of the information they gathered and on the presentation.

""We're just happy we can support the battalion and looking forward to doing this again next year on an annual basis,"" said Capt. Jeff Bridges, commander, Bravo Company, 341st Military Intelligence Battalion.

The Valor Games are a precursor to the Polyglot Games, an annual language game hosted by the Utah National Guard's 300th Military Intelligence Brigade (Linguist). More than 140 participants from 25 different organizations came together earlier this year for the 5th annual Polyglot Games, the 2024 games are expected to be the largest language games ever conducted.

“The Valor games tested the language proficiency of the Soldier's before being sent to the Polyglot Games,” said Grun. “We want to make sure our folks are set-up for success.”

The 341st has been successful in the past at the Polyglot Games: Staff Sergeant Sergei Corduneanu was named language professional of the year at the games in 2019. In 2020, Sgt. Robert O’Donnell took top honors, followed by Spc. Louis Delorme in 2021. Each year the 341st was also named the Best Command Language Program in the 300th.

“Time and time again our Soldiers have proven that they are professionals in their assigned languages,” said Lt. Col. Nolan Rinehart, commander of the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion. “The work we do is critical in developing intelligence products for combatant commanders when deployed and postured to help to assist civil authorities and our communities during disasters, so ensuring our linguists are at their best is one of our training priorities.”"

FORT INDIANTOWN GAP, Pa. – A routine flight on Nov. 2 was much more than that for two Pennsylvania National Guard pilots, as it encapsulated a family’s unwavering commitment to service and a shared love for aviation.

That morning, 2nd Lt. Zack Adams, a recent flight school graduate, got to fly a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter alongside his father, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Rich Adams, a veteran of Army aviation.

According to Zack, a platoon leader with Alpha Company, 2-104th General Support Aviation Battalion, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, his father was his hero growing up and he wanted to become a helicopter pilot like him.

“My father has always been a huge role model for me both in life and now inside the cockpit. It doesn’t happen very often for someone to begin their career field where one of the most senior and skilled individuals also happens to be their father,” Zack said. “I have this privilege of learning from the best.”

Upon graduating from the U.S. Army Initial Entry Rotary Wing school at Fort Novosel, Alabama, an aviator returns to their assigned unit to learn to tactically employ their aircraft on military missions. They train and grow as aviators in a process broken up into three readiness levels.

The Adams’ flew together for Zack’s first flight of his readiness level progression, with Rich as his instructor pilot.

With crisp air and fall foliage as a backdrop, their flight originated at Muir Army Heliport and took them around the Harrisburg and Fort Indiantown Gap areas.

Inside the cockpit, their interaction was professional — instructor pilot to pilot-in-training. But their connection as father and son was apparent with occasional comments like “been waiting a long time to say that” from Rich when he handed over control of the helicopter to Zack. Or “not a bad life” from Zack as they took in the moment and the views from the sky.

Rich is the command chief warrant officer for the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, a full-time standardization instructor pilot and aviation mission survivability officer. He has served on multiple combat tours over his 34-year career, including 1,500 hours of missions in an AH-64 Apache helicopter during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006, where he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. He has flown nine types of helicopters.

Even after such a long career, Rich says this experience with his son will stay with him forever.

“The opportunity to fly a military helicopter with Zack has always been in the back of my mind. However, if anyone knows how challenging the path can be, I never assumed it would happen,” Rich said. “Here we are, a few years into his service and me near the end of mine, and the culmination of planning is met with opportunity.”

Among their family and friends, there is a running joke that Zack had been conditioned from birth to want to fly. Rich acknowledges he may have planted a seed there, as many fathers who love their profession also do with their children. But the path to becoming a pilot requires years of hard work, preparation and discipline, and Zack followed the blueprint himself.

“I always get people saying I have been brainwashed since birth with all the helicopter toys, being taken to airshows and listening to all the stories from my father,” Zack said. “Although those things certainly contributed to my desire to fly, I find that for myself, what made me want to start this career is wanting to experience the joy of flying while supporting my desire to serve our great nation.”

Many may expect Zack to emulate his father’s experience and skills. Zack holds himself to high standards, but for now, he is soaking everything in, taking advantage of the lessons he can learn from his father and making his own path.

“The biggest piece of advice I can give anyone is to make their career their own journey. If there is someone that you emulate and aspire to become just like, know that your paths will never be exactly the same,“ he said. “Find a path that best suits you and strive to get to where you want to be and never give up on that.“

DJIBOUTI CITY, Djibouti -- Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) engineers and civil affairs service members delivered refurbished desks and chairs to schools throughout Djibouti as part of their Desk Rejuvenation Project (DRP).

The DRP is a small, yet self-sustaining mission that’s been carried out by the civil affairs and engineering battalions of CJTF-HOA during the past year. The project focuses on creating a comfortable learning experience for students across Djibouti.

U.S. Army SFC Josh Barnett, 294th Engineer Support Company (ESC) member, was the project lead for the ESC’s portion of the desk program. Barnett led ESC service members on rebuilding broken chairs and refurbishing and sanding desk pieces to help make the desks they gather look good as new.

“It’s easy, it doesn't cost too much and it really helps the city out,” said Barnett. “The kids love the work we do and so do the teachers”.

The 294th ESC and former Alpha Company Civil Affairs Battalion refurbished and delivered approximately 400 desks to four schools across the country.

Earlier this month, they passed their mission and the DRP to the 1782nd ESC, who began making desk deliveries to both the Hali English Institute and the Annex 3 School. Their most recent delivery took place in October during which they delivered 15 refurbished desks for children at the Annex 3 School in the Balbala district of Djibouti City.

“We’ve delivered a lot of desks already,” said Barnett. “At Annex 3, we were even able to help build new swings for their playground to really help these kids have a more enjoyable learning environment. The headmasters’ are always super thankful when we come by, which makes it all the more worthwhile.”

Kamil Mohumed, Hali English Language Center CEO and Headmaster, shared this sentiment. Kamil works with Civil Affairs as a translator and hosts English Discussion groups for all ages out of his school. He’s been outspoken within the Djibouti community about the positive work that comes from the presence of U.S. military personnel in the country.

“I started my center off very small and provided some of my own chairs and desks for the students,” said Kamil. “ Now, thanks to Civil Affairs, I’m able to see my school grow. The work they do is really good for my community.”

U.S. Army Civil Affairs personnel work as the primary liaison between the Army and non-U.S. populations. In Djibouti, the Civil Affairs East Africa Team spends their weeks planning and organizing ways to engage and coordinate cross-national events and cultural exchanges between CJTF-HOA’s partners and the Djiboutian community.

U.S. Army Sgt. Allan Jefferies, CJTF-HOA Civil Affairs East Africa Team member, explained that while dropping off new desks might seem like a small win, these projects have helped improve conditions at local schools considerably and helped foster a bond between U.S. personnel and the local community.

“When we see there’s a need at these schools, it’s always great to be able to help fill that need,” said Jefferies. “As civil affairs personnel we try to really get involved in these communities and especially try to do things for the youth since they are the future.”

When their deployment is up, the 1782nd ESC and the current Civil Affairs East Africa Team will be replaced by new companies and personnel just as they replaced the 294th ESC and previous Civil Affairs team. However, just as each new team has made their own mark on Camp Lemonnier and the region, the DRP will remain an enduring legacy of Camp Lemonnier’s ongoing humanitarian efforts in the Horn of Africa.

The 2023 West Africa Logistics Conference, co-hosted by the Chief of Defense of the Armed Forces of Côte d’Ivoire and United States Africa Command, convened in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, Sept. 19-20, to address West African security challenges through logistics cooperation.

Rear Admiral George Bresnihan, Director of Logistics at U.S. Africa Command, welcomed logistics leaders representing 12 African nations, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union.

“We’re here to share our collective insights and discuss challenges and potential solutions to the herculean task of sustaining and maintaining a military through peacetime and crisis,” said Bresnihan. “I’m very excited to hear from our African partners and learn how we can strengthen our partnerships through logistics.”

The specter of terrorism, transnational crime, humanitarian crises and the effects of climate change were at the forefront of vigorous discussions on regional security challenges.

U.S. Ambassador to Côte d’Ivoire Jessica Davis Ba, speaking in the country’s official language of French, stressed, “It is through our shared experiences that we can emphasize the importance of continued dialogue, cooperation and mutual understanding as we move forward in our joint efforts to maintain the security and stability of our countries and our world.”

The Ambassador identified military logistics as a pillar of strategic power and reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to our African partners in their pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity. She also highlighted the United States’ 10-year partnership plan aimed at addressing the root causes of violent extremism.

The initiative, she stated, “emphasizes the importance of a proactive approach in building trust between communities and security forces. It is essential, more than ever, to improve interoperability and coordination [in order to] to strengthen our armed forces and work together to address the myriad security challenges we face.”

In the keynote speech, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for African Affairs Ms. Chidi Blyden echoed the Ambassador. “In Africa, synchronized operations, coordination and interoperability are key to readiness when addressing a multitude of threats in the region such as humanitarian and climate disasters, threats from violent extremist organizations and even cyber criminality.”

Blyden further highlighted that Department of Defense events like the West Africa Logistics Conference, annual exercises, noncommissioned officer training and rotational engagements with state partnership programs advance military strategic logistics in Africa.

Dr. Joel Amegboh, from the African Center for Security Studies, provided a regional overview and scene-setter outlining emerging threats confronting West African militaries. Attendees critically analyzed real-time threats of violent extremist organizations engaging in terrorist activity, drug trafficking, organized crime and poor governance in the region within the frame of three reoccurring themes: interoperability and equipment compatibility; logistics strategy, support concept development, and doctrine; and resourcing readiness.

Interoperability and Equipment Compatibility

Conference participants viewed interoperability between regional forces as a critical component to countering emerging threats. In the current operating environment, equipment, parts, supplies and diversity of language pose challenges to logistics support among militaries in the region. Partners shared real examples of how those challenges presented obstacles to interoperability and collaboratively agreed that joint exercises were an effective way to verify and validate capabilities and gaps.

Examples shared brought to light how varying equipment from international donors arriving with inadequate levels of resupply and repair parts can greatly affect interoperability. Additionally, the variety of official languages spoken in the region invariably poses challenges to information sharing and communicating in the battle-space. Attendees agreed that a common operating language and compatible equipment have the potential to significantly enhance interoperability and shared logistics practices in the region.

Logistics Strategy, Support Concept Development, and Doctrine

Multinational operations demand ready forces from contributing nations. Participants agreed that readiness is a national priority within their respective countries, but preparedness for peacekeeping operations can sometimes be misaligned with the readiness demands of counter-terrorism or disaster response efforts. This perceived gap drove discussions on the need to harmonize efforts starting with aligned doctrines, strategies and concepts of support.

Partners acknowledged the benefits of U.S. support, highlighting logistics institutional capacity building, lauded national and regional centers of excellence, and encouraged potential for increased instruction on logistics concept development at professional military education establishments across the region.

Resourcing Readiness

West African partners described the need for a culture of accountability in defense procurement and in a limited resource environment, sharing mechanisms, mutual logistics agreements and common-sense resource strategies as critical to sustaining operational readiness. At the core of addressing readiness, is the needed investment in human capital recruitment and retention. Members also discussed the efficacy of local manufacturers as organic sources of supply, acknowledging that the reliance on donor equipment implies a lack of absorptive capacity to sustain a variety of donor equipment using local sources. Dependence on donors also requires supplying more than just major end items, but the spare parts to sustain them. This problem set intersects with barriers to interoperability.

For example, partners outlined how although U.S. security cooperation programs are affordable options to defense equipment and a force enabler, there is a need for faster delivery of equipment and parts. More efficient access to partner or regional markets by U.S. industries is vital to resourcing and readiness.

The reality of donor nation processes and slow delivery windows generated ideas among participants centered on regional training support centers and repair depot concepts that enable forces to conduct counter-terrorism training while sustaining forces and equipment employed in multinational operations. There was interest among African partners in utilizing a logistics hub for crisis response in the Gulf of Guinea.

There was also a consensus that in crisis response, forces need to be prepared to collaborate with commercial and non-governmental organizations and integrate quickly with other teams on the ground. The expectation of militaries to be highly organized, responsive and easily mobilized in the event of natural and man-made disasters requires forces to be prepared as first responders.

At the beginning of the conference, the Director of Cabinet for the Ministry of Defense of Côte d’Ivoire, Mr. Jean Paul Malan, enthusiastically shared his hopes that from the West Africa Logistics Conference would emerge “viable logistical solutions that effectively contribute to meeting the challenge of peace and security in our sub-region.” By the conclusion of the conference, participants achieved a shared understanding of regional military logistics challenges, best practices and opportunities for increased collaboration.

To continue momentum, Bresnihan stated, “During this event, we heard insights from our African partners and gained a greater understanding of methods to strengthen regional collaboration. In the upcoming months, we look forward to continuing to fortify logistics efforts in the region.”"

CASERMA DEL DIN, VICENZA, Italy — Class of 2024 Cadets from U.S. Military Academy West Point’s Civil Engineer Capstone Design Program are designing a canopy structure to cover the west-side basketball court for the U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) on Caserma Del Din, Vicenza, Italy during their stay on October 23 to 25, 2023.

The Capstone Design program requires students to navigate a complex engineering problem, work collaboratively in teams, and persistently tackle the challenge over the course of an academic year.

“For their senior year, instead of having a typical taught class, one of their classes is a capstone project. For the entire year, they are working in teams of 3 to 6 on some project, typical for a client, with the idea that they are working on something that doesn't have a solution already,” says Capt. Robert Hume, a civil engineering instructor from U.S. Military Academy West Point. “This trip is a small part of that year-long project. We figured it would be helpful to meet the clients we are working for, see the site, and see if we can get a feel for the region as well.”

The Deputy Chief of Staff, Engineer (DCSENG) of SETAF-AF has been mentoring and providing open-ended engineering design projects to the program for four consecutive years, guiding students in meaningful engineering design projects that align with their academic commitments.

This year, the Cadet team must provide a structural analysis and design for a canopy structure that fully covers the three basketball courts while minimizing interior columns.

If constructed, this canopy promises to open up exciting possibilities for the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) department, allowing them to expand the fitness area to include an outdoor workout space, mirroring the offerings at Caserma Ederle.

“The strongest benefit is the partnership opportunity, both for West Point, the department of civil mechanical engineering, and for SETAF-AF,” said Capt. Matthew Glavin, a civil engineering instructor from U.S. Military Academy West Point. “We both benefit by providing the Cadets a world class opportunity to put their engineering education into practice to solve a real world problem.”

Student teams undergo an iterative design process: defining the problem and its requirements, analyzing alternatives within the constraints of applicable codes and standards, and ultimately selecting the most viable solution that culminates into the presentation of written deliverables and presentations to a faculty advisor team, external customers, and stakeholders.

SETAF-AF's continued involvement in West Point's Capstone Design Program exemplifies its dedication to fostering engineering talent, preparing Cadets to confront real-world engineering challenges, and ensuring they are equipped to contribute to innovative solutions in the future, reflecting SETAF-AF's commitment to building the engineers of tomorrow.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Nine Army National Guard Soldiers from across New York State spent more than 48 hours in competition to become the “Best Warrior” of the Syracuse-based 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.

Spc. Peter Fillion, 23, of Rochester and Sgt. 1st Class Travis Wood, 32, of Basom were named the brigade’s best warriors in the Soldier and Noncommissioned Officer categories.

Fillion and Wood, both infantrymen, are assigned to Charlie Troop of the brigade’s 2nd Squadron, 101st Cavalry Regiment. They will compete in the New York Army National Guard Best Warrior Competition in spring 2024, with hopes of extending a five-year streak of 27th IBCT Soldiers placing first and representing New York in the Army National Guard’s northeast regional and national competitions.

“The best warrior competition tests a Soldier’s mind, body, and spirit,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Kevin Roeser, senior enlisted leader of the 27th IBCT.

Over two and a half days from Nov. 3 through 5, Soldiers were tested in six events:

- Formal interview board in dress uniform

- 12-mile ruck march carrying a 35-pound pack

- Three-gun shoot, combining rifle, pistol, and shotgun qualification with 10 burpees, a high crawl, and 25 air squats

- Warrior tasks and battle drills

- Land navigation

- Army Combat Fitness Test

Soldiers also had to submit a paper on their Army experience, with junior enlisted competitors focusing on how to improve peer relationships and best prepare for military schools, and NCOs focusing on how to improve leadership, operations, and management.

During the warrior tasks and battle drills, Soldiers were challenged to bound with a buddy while under fire – taking cover behind barriers, crawling under obstacles, and firing back at an enemy. Once they cleared the challenge, they had to immediately provide care to a simulated wounded Soldier under stressful conditions.

“Adding a lot of pressure like screaming, battle sounds, and even putting pressure like hinting at the time – that can allow them to perform under pressure in real scenarios,” said Staff Sgt. Danielle Dillard, a combat medic evaluating Soldiers on their medical skills.

“You have all these factors to increase the heart rate, increase the blood pressure, make them sweat, and get nervous. Their hands are shaking, and that’s what we want. We want them to be under that pressure so that they can train and perform,” she said.

Competitors were chosen as the best-of-the-best from thousands of 27th IBCT Soldiers across the state, after completing competitions at their home units. Fillion and Wood spent extra time preparing for the challenges at the brigade-level.

“It’s a lot of studying, maintaining physical performance, and your sponsor preparing you to go out there and succeed,” said Wood.

Fillion works part-time as an architect for Kideney Architects, while pursuing his graduate degree in architecture from the State University of New York at Buffalo. Wood is an area manager for Amazon.

Whether operating weapons, enduring the ruck march, or presenting knowledge in a professional manner during the formal appearance board, both say the skills and traits they used in competition translate to their civilian careers.

“A lot of my job is attention to detail. Reminding myself, you need to think about the little, tiny things. They all affect something later down the line,” said Fillion. “And just [having] a never-quit attitude.”

Fillion has served in the New York National Guard for more than two and a half years. Wood has served for 14 years, and returned this summer from a deployment to Germany, where he helped train members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Runners up in the competition were Spc. Damien Pagano, an infantryman from Buffalo, assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment, and Sgt. Nicholas Dorrman, a military intelligence systems maintainer and integrator from Saranac, assigned to Delta Company, 152nd Brigade Engineer Battalion.

Competitors in this year’s competition also included:

- Spc. Andrew Buck, an unmanned aircraft systems operator from Victor, assigned to Delta Company, 152nd Brigade Engineer Battalion

- Staff Sgt. Kurtis Schneider, a wheeled vehicle mechanic from Mechanicville, assigned to Golf Company, 427th Brigade Support Battalion

- Spc. Bradley Brundige, a wheeled vehicle mechanic from Baldwinsville, assigned to Bravo Company, 427th Brigade Support Battalion

- Sgt. Nedp Edouard, a cannon crewmember from New York, assigned to Alpha Battery, 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery Regiment

- Pvt. Keara Conn, a fire control specialist from Patterson, assigned to Charlie Battery, 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery Regiment"

BELEM, BRAZIL – Four New York Army National Guard combat medics assigned to the 466th Medical Company, Area Support (MCAS), completed a Brazilian jungle familiarization and academics course with U.S. Army South, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), 7th Special Forces Group and 1st Security Forces Assistance Brigade Soldiers Nov. 1-4.

The medics are among 18 medical personnel and their Brazilian partners providing medical care to service members in Belem, Macapa and Oiapoque during the Southern Vanguard training exercise Nov. 6-16.

New York Army National Guard Maj. Shelly Respecki, the commander of the 466 MCAS, believes the opportunity to learn about the jungle from the Brazilian Army is an invaluable experience.

“The course allows our Soldiers to understand what threats and risks are involved with training in the jungle,” said Respecki. “We’ll be better able to treat the participants knowing what they’re going through and how to survive in the jungle.”

Participants in the jungle course learned about fruits and vegetables in the jungle, hunting and survival techniques, day and night land navigation, and conducting jungle movements and recovery.

Sgt. Gina Alexandro enjoyed the experience.

“I’m excited to not only function as a medic but actually be incorporated in the training with them,” said Alexandro. “I’ve been able to practice on my machete, build my own jungle hooch, and eat exotic fruits.”

Sgt. Brion Pasquale, a combat medic and civilian emergency medical technician, returned for his second visit to Brazil after attending Operation Parana III in the southern region of Brazil.

“I really love coming back to Brazil,“ he said. “It was such a great experience the first time, but to get this type of training in the Amazon is special.”

The 466 MCAS had medical field tents in various locations where service members could be treated for heat-related illnesses, environmental threats, emergency trauma and any other potential illnesses or diseases.

“We have a strong team here on the ground with lots of experience,” said Respecki. “The Brazilian medical team here have been open and receptive, and it’s been great working together.”

The New York National Guard and Brazil have been partners under the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program since 2018.

The 30-year-old SPP program now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe.

RICHMOND, Va. – The Virginia National Guard’s 34th Civil Support Team was evaluated by U.S. Army North as trained and mission capable Oct. 17 and 19.

The 34th CST supports civil authorities in a domestic chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive incident.

During the training proficiency evaluation, usually conducted about every 18 months, the CST was evaluated during two full-scale training exercises, responding to scenarios involving a mock chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive threat.

One of the exercises was conducted at the Petersburg National Battlefield’s Five Forks Unit visitor center, and the other at the Dinwiddie Airport. During the exercises, the CST conducted reconnaissance and sample-collection missions, analyzing substances to determine the severity of the hazard and appropriate next steps, all under the scrutiny of ARNORTH evaluators.

“We are very proud of the men and women of the 34th CST,” said Brig. Gen. Todd Hubbard, VNG director of the joint staff. “Their performance during this TPE reflects their ability to perform a very complex, technical mission with a high level of proficiency. The team demonstrated an ability to deploy at short notice in support of local, state or federal requirements within the commonwealth or anywhere in the nation.”

Lt. Col. Thomas D. Mecadon, commander of the 34th CST, said the unit trained for several months to prepare for the evaluation.

“I could not be prouder of them,” said Mecadon. “The truth is that based on our rigorous training schedule over the past six months and the dedication of the team to training, the TPE just felt like another day of training.”

Their ARNORTH-certified success was even more impressive given the relative lack of experience by many of the CST’s members.

“Over the past year, the team has gone through an immense amount of changeover, approximately 50%,” said Mecadon. “The amount of work, time and preparation they all dedicated to developing as a team is not measurable. It is a testament to their dedication to our mission.”

Mecadon singled out Virginia Air National Guard Capt. Samantha Vittorioso, the CST’s science officer, for developing realistic scenarios to prepare the team.

“The scenarios and agents may have been different and unknown, but nothing presented was new,” he said. “The team approached the evaluation days with flexibility and the knowledge required to overcome the challenges.”

Each team member completes 500 to 900 hours of specialized training during their first year of assignment and continues advanced training throughout their tenure with multiple agencies, including the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, the National Fire Academy, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency.

The team’s primary response area includes a 300-mile radius from Fort Barfoot south to South Carolina and north to Pennsylvania. They maintain personnel on standby at all times and can deploy an advance team within 90 minutes and the main body within three hours.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - The Tennessee National Guard celebrated the life and legacy of former President James K. Polk in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tennessee State Capitol Nov. 2 in honor of Polk’s 228th birthday.

Each year, a representative of the current president is responsible for placing a wreath on the tomb of past presidents to honor them and their service on their birthday. Col. John Kinton, commander of Jackson’s 194th Engineer Brigade, represented President Joe Biden at the ceremony.

“It was a privilege and honor to represent the president today,” said Kinton. “As a Tennessean, I’m flattered to be able to commemorate President Polk for all he has done for our state and country.”

During the ceremony, Kinton and Jaryn Abdallah, the education and outreach coordinator for the President James K. Polk Home and Museum, laid a wreath on Polk’s tomb. Kinton spoke about Polk’s legacy and contribution to the state and nation.

“Polk devoted his life to making Tennessee and the country a better place,” said Kinton. “As president, Polk directed the country’s efforts in the Mexican-American War and shaped the nation into what it is today. There are many parallels with what he endured during his time as president and what we are going through in modern times. We can learn much by studying his life and presidency.”

Also participating in the ceremony was Col. Mark Phillips, the Tennessee National Guard’s state chaplain, who gave the invocation; Sgt. 1st Class James Tate with the 129th Army Band, who played Taps following the wreath laying, and Soldiers from the Tennessee National Guard’s Joint Forces Headquarters, who served as honor guards.

Polk was the 11th president of the United States from 1845 to 1849. He also served in the Tennessee Legislature, as governor of the state and as a member of Congress. He was a captain in the Tennessee Militia and a colonel on Tennessee Gov. William Carroll’s staff.

WASHINGTON — The Army wants to add 800 new students over the next two months to its Army Recruiting and Retention College at Fort Knox, Kentucky, a service leader said today.

In addition, Soldiers who volunteer to serve as recruiters will receive incentives, and the Army pledges to care for those troops and their families, said Lt. Gen. Doug Stitt, deputy chief of staff for personnel.

The bonuses include immediate promotion to staff sergeant upon reporting to their first recruiting assignment and graduates of the school who enroll in the Army Recruiter Course by February 2024 will receive a one-time lump sum of $5,000. The promotions to staff sergeant will be conditional, and Soldiers will still need to meet professional military education requirements.

Staff sergeants who volunteer will be eligible for promotion to sergeant first class if they field 24 signed enlistment contracts and all 24 recruits attend Basic Combat Training over a maximum 12-month period. Current recruiters who extend their three-year assignment will be awarded $1,500 per month for up to 12 months.

The service will also consider reassigning Soldiers slated to attend the Army’s Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina to the Recruiting and Retention College.

Sgt. Maj. Christopher Stevens, senior enlisted advisor for Army Personnel, G-1, said that the selections will not impede the service’s abilities to train new recruits.

Stitt said that last week the service identified a drop in the number of students scheduled to attend the college on Monday, as the service looks to bolster its recruiter corps of more than 10,000 Soldiers.

“The losses exceeded the gains and in order to maintain that momentum that we were seeing within the recruiting force, we [started] to set the conditions for transformation,” Stitt said while speaking to reporters Wednesday. “We made the decision this week to bump up the numbers [of recruiting college students].”

Over the past two weeks, the Army screened and selected Soldiers throughout the force to report to the college by Monday.

Staff Sgt. Dustin Biven, assigned as a non-commissioned officer-in charge of multimedia production at the Defense Media Activity, Fort Meade, Maryland said he received his notification to report to Fort Knox on Friday. Biven’s wife recently gave birth to a baby boy, and he was scheduled to complete his paternity leave. The father of four also had mission commitments and a full-time college schedule that could be compromised by the new assignment.

Biven said that reassigned Soldiers have been asked to shift their life and careers in a short window of time.

“I am very fortunate to have the support system and a wife who could care for our children,” said Biven, 30. “But there are some single Soldiers out there and some single mothers out there — people who probably are not medically fit or are able to go because of pre-existing conditions or surgeries — that are being tapped with this [assignment] and they are frightened.”

Stitt expressed regret for the late notice and said the service will contact the selected Soldiers and work with their unique circumstances.

“I’d like to open up and first of all apologize to the Soldiers and the families that received this last-minute notification,” Stitt said. “That mistake is mine.”

He said the service is working on multiple avenues to minimize the impact to Soldiers and families.

“It’s not lost on me, particularly at this point in time, the impact this last-minute notification and now being on the cusp of the holidays has on our Soldiers and our great NCOs as they navigate a process to support the recruiting enterprise,” Stitt added.

When questioned whether the service will open selection to candidates who do not meet requirements, such as fitness and physical training scores and body fat requirements, Stitt reiterated that standards will be met.

He said that the branch will prioritize identifying the candidates that meet the qualifications to attend the college. Soldiers must be in the grade of E-5 to E-7 and have a minimum four years in service to qualify.

“This is not about a number,” he added. “This is about identifying the right Soldiers to go in there and support this effort.”

“Our standard for suitability screening has not changed,” Stevens said. “We're talking about positions of trust.”

Army human resources will work with the Soldiers’ chain of command and career counselors on a case-by-case basis to assure that recruiter candidates have a smooth transition, Stitt said.

“We will communicate with the family and the chain of command and work this by the individual, to ensure if that Soldier has a life situation, family situation or professional situation,” Stitt said. “We’re going to talk to that Soldier, to that family, to work through this to ensure that we have the right NCOs at the right time to perform this vital mission in service of our recruiting enterprise.”

To build recruiting momentum, Stitt said Army leaders are working closely with U.S. Army Recruiting Command to outline required knowledge, skills and behaviors for the Army’s new military occupational specialty, 42T talent acquisition specialists.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth announced on Oct. 3, 2023, the Army will transform its recruiting force from temporary positions to permanent military occupational specialties for both Soldiers and warrant officers. A pilot program will soon be in development.

For now, the Army hopes to attract enough volunteers to recruit the next generation of Soldiers and asked commanders and leaders throughout the force to encourage Soldiers to volunteer to become recruiters.

“We are communicating through the chain-of-command,” Stitt said. “Talk to your Soldiers. If they are ready to volunteer, here are the incentives. And if you've been identified for reassignment and have some family, personal, professional concerns, let's sit down and let's talk about it.”

THE ARMY UNIVERSITY, FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. - The Army University’s Command and General Staff College inducted two new military members to the International Hall of Fame; Commodore Errington R. Shurland, Chief of Staff, Barbados Defence Force and General Javier Iturriaga Del Campo, Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, Oct. 31, 2023, at the Lewis and Clark building on Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

Since its establishment in 1973, the CGSC IHOF has inducted nearly 300 military officers representing 80 nations.

Nominees are selected based on their distinguished service that has helped them achieve the highest level of leadership within their respective militaries.

“The inductions of Commodore Shurland and Gen. Inturriaga’s today represents the fulfillment of the potential that resides in each student in the military education institution as a direct return on the investment made jointly by our respective militaries and the professional military education of our officers,” Lt. Gen. Milford H. Beagle, Jr., commandant, CGSC said. “Today we celebrate alliance capability and credibility and commitment. Something as necessary as now, as any other time in our history.”

Shurland, a graduate of the Class of 2002 and classmate of Beagle’s, is the first inductee from the nation of Barbados.

He has served since 1984 with his career culminating in his appointment to Chief of Staff to the Barbados Defense Force in September 2021, the first naval officer to serve in this position.

Throughout his career, Shurland has represented Barbados at every level of military service and his leadership is and will remain important as the U.S. and Barbados relationship moves forward, Beagle explained.

Shurland joked that while most claim CGSC is the best year of a young officer’s life, his time can’t be labeled as such wholeheartedly due to a missed first wedding anniversary, tragic events of 9/11, and a historic ice storm.

He continued that the lessons learned while at CGSC 21 years ago have made lasting impressions personally and professionally.

“It was impactful and a significant professional development program that I’ve ever undertaken on my military career,” Shurland said.

He mentioned lifelong lessons in diplomacy and experience in joint, interagency collaboration.

The two lessons he’s taken with him for the entirety of his career include not to seek perfection, and dispute remediation and diplomacy.

“Perfect is the enemy of good enough, is a phrase he [then Commandant Gen. James Sitright] used during an introductory speech to us back in 2002,” Shurland said. “That phrase provided me and I’m sure some of my classmates with some critical guidance.”

Shurland explained seeking perfection often ties up progress to completing tasks.

The second lesson was the impact of the events of 9/11 on the class which included 91 international students representing more than 70 students.

“The current deputy was responsible for managing that situation. He did so with a calm reassurance,” Shurland explained of how the tragic events were explained during the 2002 CGSC. “He managed to resolve concerns and disagreement and conflict in a very constructive way. He encouraged ‘creative tension’ and for a difference of opinions to be share.”

The creation of a space to share conflicting ideas and opinions in a professional, constructive environment was recognized by the international student population who would later address the leadership’s actions in a letter of reflection and condemnation of the actions against the U.S.

Beginning his military career four years before Shurland, Inturriaga’s would take him to positions at every level of the Chilean Army to include his current as Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army.

In 2017, he gained notoriety as he commanded military forces during a national state of emergency during devasting wildfires of Santa Auga.

Since returning to Fort Leavenworth after 18 years, Inturriaga has also reflected on his time at CGSC and its impact on his career.

“My time as an international student of the class of 2006 afforded me the opportunity to complement and enhance my character and knowledge as a field grade officer and throughout my career,” he said.

The CGSC experience was a “key factor” to help him achieve one of the highest levels of his career.

The experience includes the professionalism of the teachers and professors who were part of his CGSC time.

“They acknowledged the experience of our differences that would improve the quality of their lessons and was demonstrated for their respect to our opinions and customs,” Inturriaga said.

He closed his remarks thanking his sponsors and with a parting thought for those in attendance.

“Success is never the objective. Sometimes it is the result of hard work, loyalty and friendship between partners, to include within the Army.”

Inductees into the International Hall of Fame are presented gifts from the Greater Kansas City Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars and the CGSC Foundation.

FORT MEADE, Md – Hundreds of retirees from all branches of service gathered at McGill Training Center here Oct. 27 for Fort George G. Meade’s 48th Annual Retiree Appreciation Day.

The installation hosts this annual event to honor our retiree community and showcases diverse services and support that is offered to retirees around Fort Meade and state of Maryland.

“Every year, Retiree Appreciation Day is Fort Meade’s chance to show our appreciation and celebrate you all for your committed service to our nation,” said Fort Meade Garrison Commander Col. Michael Sapp during his opening remarks. “It’s our connections with the community that make us strong. You all are a significant part of that community.”

Sapp’s intent for this event is to provide a first-class Retiree Appreciation Day event for our deserving retirees, their families within the safety and comfort of Fort Meade.

This year’s event featured a health fair, vaccine clinic, vendor exhibit, DEERS/ID card renewals, casualty and legal assistance, raffle and door prizes as well as an opportunity to hear from keynote speaker, Maryland Secretary of Veteran Affairs, Honorable Anthony Woods.

“We have a military that is going to be called upon to do challenging things at some point in the future. Your experience, seeing everyone stand up here today, makes that very clear. As much as we love to preserve peace, every once in a while, we find ourselves in very tough times,” said Woods. “I am thankful for your service, but I also call upon you to see what you can do to encourage the next generation of people to serve.”

Woods went on to describe different initiatives that the Maryland Department of Veteran Affairs is currently working on to improve quality of life for veterans including the MDVA Service and Benefits Program, PACT Act, Cemetery and Memorial Program, Maryland Veterans Trust Fund, 988 infrastructure and the Joining Forces Project.

The office is also focusing on improving employment options for military spouses, combating food and housing insecurity, encouraging health and wellness initiatives and seeking opportunities to serve alongside the civilian community. Woods took the time after his remarks to speak with many of the attendees one on one to address their specific concerns and point them in the right direction.

Retirees also heard from Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center Commander, Col. Chris Maker, Fort Meade Human Resources Director, Wes Smith, and Fort Meade Military Personnel Division Chief, Marcus Ufeanyui. Maker spoke on KACC’s dedication to taking care of veterans and service members while Smith offered attendees a hearty welcome and Ufeanyui highlighted services available to retirees and their spouses through the Fort Meade Retirement Services Office.

This event ensures retired service members and their families are kept up to date on changes affecting their retirement rights, benefits, and privileges, while fostering goodwill between the retired and active-duty communities.

WASHINGTON — Each day Spc. Joelle Pamplona, a physical therapy specialist, heads into the Madigan Army Medical Center on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington to help veterans, Soldiers and their families heal.

Being able to make a difference in their recovery is what drives him.

""It's the reason I picked this job,” he said. “It makes my day every time knowing that I helped someone and that now they are living their best life again.""

Growing up in Southern California, Pamplona was an active kid. He was into athletics and martial arts.

While watching the popular animated series “Naruto,” he became drawn to one of the characters, Rock Lee, who lacked the talent of others but was able to keep up by training extremely hard.

“This inspired me as a kid to get strong and always improve,” he said.

He started doing pushups, sit-ups and running to increase his strength and endurance. As he got older, he turned to weightlifting and then powerlifting to push himself harder.

While in college in 2018, he broke the state squatting record for his weight class during a powerlifting competition.

The constant training and repetitive heavy lifting took a toll on his body as the injuries mounted. He dealt with foot, ankle, knee and back pain.

“I’ve had it all,” he said. “When you’re younger you have a little bit of an ego, and you just need to outlift everybody. It doesn’t always work out well, and sometimes you have to learn from your mistakes.”

He did just that. He researched how to improve his form, how to prevent injury and how to heal himself. He also started changing his workouts to increase flexibility and mobility.

With his ability to transform his own body, others in school started to take notice and began coming to him for advice. He enjoyed coaching them and helping them bounce back from injury.

This love of movement, physical activity and helping others fueled him as he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology from California State University, Fullerton in 2020.

The timing was not on his side as the coronavirus pandemic hit, limiting his ability to get the hours and experience he needed for a physical therapy specialist position.

He turned his attention to the military and contacted an Army recruiter. The Army offers more than 200 ways to serve as a Solider, including careers in science, cybersecurity, combat forces, aviation, law and medicine.

The recruiter told Pamplona that nothing was available in his desired field at the time, and he would keep him in mind if anything popped up.

Sure enough, a few months later the recruiter called and asked if he was still interested.

“I was like, ‘Heck yea,’” he said emphatically. “I always wanted to join the military. I always looked up to people who served the country. Being able to put on the uniform gives me a lot of pride.”

He enlisted in 2021 as a physical therapy specialist and went to basic training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma before heading to Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston for job training.

The course was challenging as he juggled studying, staying fit and being a Soldier. Time management became a key to making sure he didn’t burn himself out.

Finding enough hours in the day to complete his work might have been a struggle but comradery with his classmates was not.

“We became like brothers and sisters,” he said. “I still talk to them almost every day.”

Following his completion of phase two of physical therapy training at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, he was assigned to his first duty station at Madigan Army Medical Center last year.

There, he’s been able to help veterans, Soldiers and their families recover from injury. He’s even helped several of them rehab following surgery to repair Achilles tendon tears.

This time has allowed him to grow close to many of his patients.

“You build a lot of great relationships in this field,” he said. “You spend so much time with them, and they are in such a vulnerable state. They put a lot of trust in you and in the process to get them better.”

The rehab can be slow at times, but Pamplona says patients get energized as they start to make progress. This is an important step for them physically and mentally.

“Getting back your life is critical,” he said. “It’s critical to your mental health and it’s critical to your well-being.”

In just a few short years, Pamplona has used his drive to improve and help others to become the Soldier everyone on post knows for helping them recover.

“[Joining the Army has] been better than I thought it’d be,” he said. “Just the opportunities it’s given me and the friends it’s given me. I think I got placed in a great situation.”

Pamplona is scheduled to be promoted to sergeant next month.

October is National Physical Therapy Month. It is a dedicated time to celebrate the ways physical therapists, physical therapy assistants and physical therapy students help improve the lives of patients across the country.

WASHINGTON — From war heroes’ stories on the front lines to discussions on leadership, Soldiers have a wide palette of podcasts available to them.

Organizations across the Army have adopted podcasts to share local services and events while podcasts from service-wide publications such as the NCO Journal focuses on broader Soldier topics like transitioning to civilian life. Soldiers can conveniently stream episodes on or off duty, while working out or traveling.

The Army News Service looks into nine growing podcasts from across the Army.

NCO Journal and the Sergeant’s Time podcasts: What began as supplemental content for NCO Journal articles and stories has expanded to regular episodes with topics that vary from career advice, tips on building Soldier camaraderie, and talks on future combat operations.

The NCO Journal podcast provides relevant advice for Army NCOs as well as leadership lessons. The publication fields submissions from the Army’s senior NCO academy staff, NCOs and civilians. For instance, the program hosted a discussion on transition assistance for Soldiers retiring from active duty. The NCO Journal hosts have also held talks on ending NCO misconduct.

“We're trying to diversify and make it more all-encompassing, more approachable for all NCOs,” managing editor Chago Zapata said. “Everything that we do in the NCO Journal we look at it through the eyes of the NCO. Does this article have any bearing? Or does it provide any sort of for depth professional development opportunities for our audience? We have a chance to dive deeper into it in our podcasts.”

Zapata, a retired Marine Corps gunnery sergeant, expanded the programming to a second podcast, titled “Sergeant’s Time” to feature guests of different ranks and backgrounds who do not submit articles. Guests will include the Recruiter of the Year and Drill Sergeant of the Year winners with retired Sgt. Maj. of the Army Daniel Dailey slated to be featured in the first episode.

The Spear, Modern War Institute, West Point: Already renowned for its harrowing accounts of Soldiers in combat, “The Spear” ranks as one of the Army’s top podcasts in listenership. Timothy Heck, deputy editorial director, wanted to diversify the program further.

Heck featured Soldiers of all ranks, genders, and career fields, including logisticians and public affairs officers, and even included troops outside of the Army. Heck, now a former assistant West Point professor, noticed episodes focused heavily on Operation Enduring Freedom and the war on terror.

He then began featuring stories from the Vietnam War and World War II.

“There’s more to the Army, and there’s more to combat than the 11 Bravo [infantry] experience,” Heck said. “So, let’s look there. I wanted to make [the podcast] more than just the Global War on Terror.”

In the Spear’s episode “Across the Fence” on Sept. 27, Heck interviewed former Army Green Beret John Meyer, who went on secret missions in North Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Meyer volunteered for Special Forces training in Vietnam, where eventually Green Berets would join indigenous Soldiers in an eight-year secret war.

Heck spent time as a Marine Corps artillery officer and did one tour in Iraq before becoming a military historian. His featured guests included Medal of Honor recipient Earl Plumlee, Navy Seal Rick Witt, and Army Rangers.

Heck added that the podcast’s audience grew in part to episodes that focused on the Russian-Ukraine conflict and the U.S. contributions to the war. Last spring, Heck interviewed the chief of the Ukrainian Army’s chaplain corps.

The Marne Report, Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia – Fort Stewart’s local weekly podcast has slowly grown after initially having a small following. Hosted by Molly Cooke, the Marne Report updates Soldiers and post residents on local events including holiday celebrations and fitness competitions.

The episodes offer tips on deployment preparation for Soldiers, as well as back to school advice for families, and interviews with installations commanders and leaders.

Topics range from discussing respite care for the family members of deployed Soldiers to anti-terrorism awareness tips.

“A really cool thing about this podcast is that we've got interests across the board from active-duty service members to their family members,” Cooke said. “So, it’s a broad range of topics.”

FORSCOM Frontline, Army Forces Command, Fort Liberty, North Carolina – FORSCOM’s podcast focuses on the command’s mission of bolstering Soldier readiness and tells stories of troops on the frontline. The program features topics unique to the command, including FORSCOM’s recent Best Squad Competition but also delves into subjects that impact the whole force, including improving quality of life and suicide prevention.

Frontline publishes two episodes a month and most recently featured the Golden Knights, the Army’s demonstration and competition parachute team. The podcast has posted interviews with Olympic Gold Medalist Amber English, a member of the Army’s World Class Athlete Program as well as an explosive ordnance Soldier who was featured on the Food Network.

Some episodes offer advice including one that discussed how to identify scams and fake social media profiles of prominent military members, while another offered testimony from a holistic health and fitness officer.

Leader Up, Army Management Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas – The “Leader Up” podcast, hosted by the Army Management Staff College, focuses on Army civilian professionalism and leader development.

Episodes feature commentary by Army senior leaders including James Helis, director of the Army Resilience Directorate. Helis discussed how Soldiers and civilians can build resilience by learning coping skills to plan, set goals, and maintain positive attitudes to prevent harmful behaviors.

“If you’ve got the coping skills to deal with the challenge, you’re less likely to turn to unhealthy alternatives; to substance abuse, to [suicide], to acting out in the workplace,” Helis said.

The podcast also tackles broader Army topics including the service’s digital transition to streamline its data processes.

Kyra Pearl, 11th Corps Signal Bde., interview guests on Fort Hood’s Great Big Podcast, while host Samantha Harms, Fort Hood Public Affairs, controls the levels during a podcast recording Monday at III Corps Headquarters.

The Great Big Podcast, Fort Cavazos, Texas- Derived from the installation’s “The Great Place” nickname, “The Great Big Podcast” explores the mission and achievements of Fort Cavazos’ local units including the 1st Cavalry Division. However the podcast features a diverse array of topics that not only caters to Soldiers but the larger military community.

The weekly program, which launched on Dec. 16, 2019, also delves into topics such as the prevention of domestic violence, domestic abuse and suicide. The episodes feature a variety of subjects, from the role of a first sergeant to how Soldiers can contribute to the Army’s antiterrorism program and environmental sustainability.

“The Great Big Podcast is unique truly because of the focus that we take when it comes to telling the Army story,"" said Samantha Harms, command information chief. ""So often you only hear about the typical topics of being a Soldier — trainings, weapons, deployments — which are covered in our podcast.

""But it is important to remember that a Soldier is human first ... We tell the story of services on the installation, the reminders of how the Army operates for that young Soldier or to inform the public, share intimate stories on domestic violence to remind people that they are never alone, and so much more.""

Episodes have discussed the impact of Army civilians in service modernization as well as leadership development. One episode featured the impact of the Army on the Texas-based rock band Bowling for Soup.

""The community we have here in Central Texas is something that is quite special,"" Harms said. ""It is filled with service members, retirees, veterans, Department of the Army civilians, contractors and people who truly work hard to constantly better the place they live in. Our podcast reminds them that we are here for them too.""

Breaking Doctrine, Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, - The Army’s flagship center for doctrine located outside Kansas City, Kansas focuses its “Breaking Doctrine” podcast on current and trending topics related to doctrine; the fundamental principles that guide the military’s actions toward national objectives.

For example, a recent episode examined recruiting challenges as the Army looks to rebound from recruitment shortfalls. Gen. Johnny Davis, who leads Army Recruiting Command, answered questions on how Army recruiters could better appeal to potential candidates for military service.

Another episode performed a case study on a dangerous combat operation maneuver called passage of lines. During the operation, a stationary force creates a pathway for another force to pass its position.

Episodes ranged from exploring how the Army shifted from active defense to the most recent operational philosophy, “AirLand Battle,” which stresses air and ground theater operations to intricacies of the Army Field Manual 3-0. The manual establishes the doctrine for multi-domain operations, the service’s operational concept.

The Army Soldier for Life Podcast, Soldier for Life – “Army Soldier for Life,” which connects Soldiers and families to assistance programs, offers advice on permanent, change-of-station moves and the transition to civilian life.

The podcast, hosted by Lt. Col. Ismael Ortiz Rivera, Soldier for Life employment director, also discusses financial tips for Soldiers, career development for military spouses and career skills programs.

Additionally, episodes highlight eligible healthcare for Soldiers once they retire. The program featured episodes that explored various career opportunities including the Secret Service.

The Army Soldier for Life program works closely with communities to encourage opportunities for veterans to keep ties with the Army.

The High Ground, Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama – USASMDC’s podcast offers news of the command, which provides space and missile capabilities to joint services and partner nations while supporting multi-domain operations.

One episode discussed how members of the 100th Missile Defense Brigade Operations Team in Colorado Springs, Colorado, perform a critical national security mission. Under the guidance of a presidential order, the 100th Missile Defense Brigade defends the U.S. from the threat of intercontinental ballistic missile attacks.

FORT BUCHANAN, Puerto Rico—Various service members and federal civilian employees supported the Red Ribbon Week campaign, led by the 1st Mission Support Command and U.S. Army Garrison Command Fort Buchanan Army Substance Abuse Program, by wearing a red shirt for work to raise awareness about the dangers of substance abuse and encourage healthy, drug-free lifestyles, October 25.

Red Ribbon Week is a national campaign in the United States. Dr. Carlos Montañez Cintrón, the ASAP coordinator for the USAGC Fort Buchanan, explained that the campaign was established in 1985 to honor Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, an American Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was killed in the line of duty while working undercover to investigate drug trafficking.

""The red ribbon has become a symbol of his sacrifice and a commitment to drug prevention efforts,"" said Dr. Montañez. ""With the slogan 'Be kind to your mind, live drug-free,' our aim is to raise awareness in the community.""

An information booth was set up at The Exchange here, where informative pamphlets and campaign materials were distributed. Visitors were also educated on the proper use and handling of controlled substances.

The goal is to guide veterans and the community towards a healthier, drug-free lifestyle, said Sgt. 1st Class Yadira Valle Lopez, a soldier of the 1st MSC working at the ASAP information booth.

""We are actively raising awareness in the community about substance abuse and promoting Drug Collection Week,"" said Yesenia Pagan Rosario, the Drug Testing Coordinator of the 1st MSC. ""On October 28, the Fort Buchanan community will have the opportunity to drop off their expired, unused, or unwanted medications at the Fort Buchanan's PX from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm.""

Pagan Rosario explained that the event is organized by the DEA and promotes proper disposal of medicines.

Visitors at the Exchange expressed their appreciation for the initiative, as they believe that the information provided promotes the well-being of the community.

""I found the presentation very informative because there are times when people are unaware of the consequences of mishandling medications,"" said Jose Miguel Rodriguez Melendez, a retired veteran.

""The last time I attended an event like this, I received a campaign ribbon, which I still have hanging in my vehicle to raise awareness,"" said Nilda Lopez, the wife of a retired veteran.

The 1st Mission Support Command offers services and programs that enhance readiness and resiliency, like the Sexual Harassment and Assault Program (SHARP), Suicide and Prevention, Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP), and Private Public Partnership Office."

WASHINGTON — It is four in the morning and already they are lined up at Chicago’s Midway airport, ready to go. It’s like a military formation, 107 men and three women, all veterans who served either in World War II, Korea or Vietnam.

Their destination: Washington D.C, on a chartered Southwest Airlines 737 thanks to Honor Flight Chicago, a group of dedicated volunteers who make it their mission to provide a well-deserved thank you to veterans for their military service.

“Three World War II veterans, 10 Korean War veterans and 97 Vietnam veterans are on this flight,” said Honor Flight Chicago Co-director Doug Meffley, “We have now flown over 10,600 Veterans which is the most of any Honor Flight hub in the nation.”

Southwest Airlines First Officer Brian Dunn, who serves as an Army Reserve public affairs officer at the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, was the co-pilot on this flight. He met with the veterans, shook their hands, and asked about their service prior to the flight.

“I think it’s such a special thing. There’s an organization that will mobilize all these volunteers to have such an impactful day for the World War II, Korea and Vietnam Veterans,” said Dunn, who worked his first honor flight eight years ago. “To have the honor of working as a crew member on this flight is pretty special.”

Flying and military service are part of Dunn’s Family heritage too. He always wanted to pursue flying since he was a young man.

U.S. military veterans who served in World War II, Korean and Vietnam Wars pause for a photo during an Honor Flight Chicago trip to Washington D.C., October 18, 2023. During the one-day trip, they visited the U.S. Marine Corps War memorial, the World War II memorial, Korean War Veterans memorial, Vietnam Veterans memorial and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. They also enjoyed a performance by the U.S. Marine Corp Silent Drill team.

“I think flying was always a part of me. I’ve known since I was eight years old that I wanted to be an airline pilot. I put all my energy and focus into achieving that dream. It’s a big reason why and how I (joined) the military,” said Dunn.

Dunn, who currently serves at the rank of lieutenant colonel, further touched on his service in the Army Reserve.

“Along the way I’ve made a wonderful career in the Army Reserve in a non-flying capacity. I’ve had the opportunity to be the head of human resources on a general staff and I’ve taught military history at the University of Illinois Chicago. I’ve been a commander and now I get to work in Army public affairs,” said Dunn. “It’s been a diverse, wonderful 26-year career so far and I’m not done yet. I’m grateful for it.”

Dunn’s grandfather was the captain of a B-17 crew that flew 38 missions over Europe at the end of World War II.

“He was at Pearl Harbor when it was bombed. My father and husband both served in nuclear submarines in the Navy,” Dunn said.

After they arrived in Washington, D.C., a police escort led the chartered buses to the Iwo Jima memorial for the first stop. Then it was on to the World War II memorial where they were greeted by an actor portraying General George Patton.

There, John Clauson, a St. Charles, Illinois resident, recalled his service in the Army Air Corps during World War II.

“I was in the air corps cadet program for pilots for about 18 months. They sent us to college for four months in Galesburg, Illinois. Then I went to cadet training in San Antonio, Texas. In 1945, we finally got to Chickasha, Oklahoma where we started to fly the PT-17 Stearman,” said Clauson. “I was reclassified to go to B-29 gunnery school. We used the B-24 to learn the gunnery system. We finished gunnery school in August and we were ready to go when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.”

Clauson was honorably discharged at Fort Sheridan, Illinois.

After leaving the World War II memorial, the veterans traveled to the Korean War and Vietnam Veteran’s memorials.

At the Vietnam Veteran’s memorial, a veteran quietly etched the name of a Soldier on a piece of tracing paper.

Vietnam Veteran James Doffin, of Dyer, Indiana, who served as a demolition expert and combat engineer, was moved by the outpouring of gratitude from citizens which, Doffin stated, did not happen when he returned home.

“When we came home (from Vietnam) nobody paid much attention to us. Today was awesome. I think I shook more hands than I did in my lifetime,” Doffin said. “Words can’t express how nice it was.”

The last stop for the veterans was the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport. It is home to the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Space Shuttle Discovery and a SR-71 Blackbird spy plane.

When they returned to Midway Airport that evening, the veterans were greeted by hundreds of well-wishers who waved American flags and held welcome home signs thanking them for their service.

“This is the most fulfilling thing I will do in my life. To see the veterans come home to this love and respect that is 50 years in the coming,” said Meffley. “I have yet to get through a flight day without tears."

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. – The 39th Annual Army 10-Miler, held October 8, 2023 in Washington D.C., annually attracts more than 35 thousand runners and 900 teams from around the world.

U.S. Army Reserve Master Sgt. Laroy Warren, G-1 Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge, IPPS-A Liaison, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, was in the pack competing in his first Army 10-Miler.

“At the starting line, they had runners broken down into waves. It was a lot of people. The atmosphere was inspiring. There were all levels of fitness, whether it was walk run or run,” Warren said. “Each wave may have had five thousand runners.”

Each wave was released roughly eight minutes apart, followed by another wave. During the race, Warren maintained a nine minute per mile pace and finished in one hour and 35 minutes while encountering trouble at mile four.

“I sprained my ankle near the water stop. I stepped into a pothole. For six miles I was in pain, but I knew if I stopped, the swelling would have intensified,” said Warren. “I stopped thinking about the pain and continued the same pace. I wasn’t looking for an excuse to stop. I just kept pushing through.”

Despite the pain, the veteran Soldier, with 24 years of Army Reserve service, said he found plenty of enjoyable moments along the route.

“My favorite parts of the course were running past the Washington Monument, running through a viaduct where the light changed from sunny to dark, and during the turnaround where you get to interact with other runners by giving each other a high five or yelling words of encouragement,” said Warren.

Leading up to the Army 10-Miler, Warren ran numerous 5 Kilometer (3.1 mile) races for months.

“I was training to run 5Ks in 2022. I ran a total of 30 5K and 10K (6.2 mile) races from March to November. In 2023, I decided to step it up and run 10K races. I have run 35 races so far this year. I run every weekend. When the Army 10-Miler came around, I decided to get involved and go for it. I’m currently looking to participate in a half marathon,” said Warren.

However, it is an ironic situation for a Soldier who pursued running because he does not like to do it.

“The reason I run is because I don’t like running. If I make it fun, I kind of enjoy it,” said Warren. “The way you get better at something is you pick something you do not like to do and work on it and get better at it.”

He referenced a quote, from boxer Mike Tyson, that he keeps on his phone.

“Discipline is doing what you hate to do but, nonetheless, doing it like you like it,” said Warren.

Fitness and sports have always been a passion of Warren’s since he was a child.

“I played little league baseball. I swam in high school and played a lot of basketball. I’ve been an athlete all my life. I think I found my passion to be fitness,” said Warren. “If you love doing something, whether you get paid or not, I consider that a passion.”

He also conducts a free early morning fitness session for Soldiers and Army Civilians working to improve their fitness.

“I’ve been doing my morning fitness group for five years,” said Warren. “There are other Soldiers that need help with fitness, and it also helps me out. Just like I’m pushing them, sometimes they push me.”

Warren stated that he has advice for those thinking about running the Army 10-Miler in future years.

“Start training now. It depends on your goals. Get some miles under your feet. Start running some 5K races. That makes it fun. Keep doing them and do some running on your own. Increase the mileage and you will be ready for 10 miles in no time.”"

WASHINGTON — The Army will build a new blue book and blue book app to reinforce standards and discipline across the service, the Army’s top enlisted leader said.

The Army Software Factory in Austin, Texas leads the initiative, scheduled to release by October 2024.

The app will contain the non-commissioned officer and Soldier creeds and feature a set of standards that will remain uniform across the Army including leadership responsibilities. A digital library in the app will link to other service publications and units can add their own unique history.

The new blue book mobile app will eventually be able to provide instant updates and alerts when the Army passes a new regulation. Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer said that adopting clear, service-wide reference, like the new blue book, will be critical in future conflicts.

“You can’t build standards and discipline in a time of crisis,” Weimer said during his initiatives briefing at the Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington Wednesday. “If we’re really going to be truly ready for large-scale combat operations, we have to have those standards and discipline before we get called upon for that.”

Army Training and Doctrine Command Sgt. Maj. Raymond Harris will form an operational planning team to seek Soldier feedback to help create the app across the three service components, Active Duty, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard.

The Army created the blue book as a guide for all Soldiers for standards, discipline and culture. Soldiers will receive the document upon entering Basic Combat Training. The book establishes Army ethics early in a Soldier’s career to introduce new troops to the Army’s culture and form their moral core.

Weimer said the responsibility of enforcing the Army’s standards remains with its NCO corps.

“The foundational document will be the same for all of us, period,” Weimer said. “You still have to lead and still have to have the personal courage to live the standard and enforce the standard.”

Concerns over the erosion of discipline and adherence to service regulations grew during the coronavirus pandemic when many Soldiers teleworked from home for the first time.

“I think COVID really highlighted an issue with standards and discipline,” Weimer said.

Weimer said that Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy A. George’s transition team held more than 500 conversations with division commanders and division sergeants major, and the most frequent topic was standards and discipline.

Harris said Soldiers have had some questions about the clarity of current Army standards and their interpretation. He said that the new blue book will provide needed specificity.

“We’re going to remove some of that ambiguity, so you leaders and Soldiers feel empowered or are empowered to make that change and correction,” Harris said. “And you’re not afraid to do it.”

WASHINGTON — Between his full-time duties as a special operations non-commissioned officer, deployments and parental obligations, Sgt. Maj. Benjamin Buzek spent more than nine years earning his bachelor’s degree.

He then wanted to pursue a Master of Business Administration without pulling dual responsibilities as a Soldier. So Buzek devised a way for NCOs to attend The College of William and Mary Raymond A. Mason School of Business in Williamsburg, Virginia full time while still receiving active-duty pay.

The college offers a full-time MBA program for active-duty officers and veterans, but previously, there was no program for active-duty NCOs, Buzek said.

Two other NCOs have earned their MBA through the Buzek’s initiative since Buzek graduated from William and Mary in August 2022. Although the program has limited eligibility, Buzek now hopes to expand it to afford other Soldiers the same opportunity.

Buzek’s efforts earned him the 2023 Sgt. Maj. Larry L. Strickland Educational Leadership Award. Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer presented Buzek the award in a ceremony at the Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington Oct. 9.

Strickland, senior enlisted advisor to the Army deputy chief of staff for personnel, died in the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. The 29-year Army veteran strongly believed in Soldier education and professional development.

Buzek believes the changing nature of war requires Soldiers of all ranks to be better educated to make smarter decisions in combat.

“I think the times when officers were the only educated people that make decisions, that’s changed,” said Buzek, 40. “[On] today’s battlefield, the command team of officers and NCOs have to move at the speed of light because the enemy is moving that quickly.

“As the wars have ended, the best thing that you could have is experience,” he added. “The second best thing you could have is education. So, I think it’s incredibly important that our force is educated and that our NCOs get the time to go to school.”

Buzek said that he had to secure permission from his chain of command for successful enrollment in the program and to receive his full-time salary.

“I think great leaders don’t do things for themselves,” Buzek said. “They do things for people that they’re leading. This program that I’ve developed wasn’t just for me, it was for the next person.”

As a teen growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, he described himself as a “troublemaker.” After enlisting in the Army at 17 in 2000, he went on to have a successful 23-year career in special operations.

Master Sgt. Jacob Connor, NCO-in-charge of the 101st Airborne Division Public Affairs Office at Fort Campbell, Kentucky won the Sgt. Maj. Dawn Kilpatrick Memorial AUSA Scholarship Award for excellence in Public Affairs.

The award is given in honor of the late Kilpatrick served in Army public affairs from 1979 to 1999. She took roles as the editor of three Army publications and also acted as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Army. She died of cervical cancer eight days after her retirement from the Army in 1999.

Connor, a 16-year veteran who started his career as a cavalry scout, credited his fellow staff members for winning the award.

“My shop stands out because of the teamwork; the team that we built, the camaraderie that we have,” Connor said.

Story by: Carlos Cuebas, Fort Buchanan Public Affairs Officer

FORT BUCHANAN, PUERTO RICO- The U.S. Army story would not be complete if it did not include the contributions made by Hispanic Americans. This ethnic group has an honorable military service record dating back to the Revolutionary War. That is why Hispanic Heritage Month allows us to recognize and appreciate the contributions of our Hispanic American Soldiers, Army Civilians, and family members, who live by the core Army values every day.

One of the most memorable contributions of Hispanics can be seen through the eyes of the Borinqueneers. The unit was active from 1899 to 1956 and, in 1959, reconstituted as part of the Puerto Rico Army National Guard.

The Borinqueneers were the only Hispanic unit from the Korean War to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. Many recognize this as the last battalion-sized bayonet assault in Army history. Today, the youngest of the surviving members are in their eighties and nineties.

Many hear these stories and can only imagine. At Fort Buchanan, we are blessed because we have the privilege to see members of the Borinqueneers around post almost daily.

One of the members of the Borinqueneers that frequently can be seen around the post is Victor Labarca, a Korean War veteran.

""I am very proud to see these young Soldiers who serve with a great sense of dedication,"" said Labarca, who served in Korea in 1950, wearing the Sentry Box uniform patch, also known as Garita, currently used by the U.S. Army Reserve 1st Mission Support Command.

""That patch is very special. To us in Korea, it meant that we had a piece of Puerto Rico with us on the battlefield,"" added an emotional Labarca during an interview a few years ago.

But at Fort Buchanan, we can honor the sacrifice of past generations, such as the Borinqueneers, and first-hand witness the significant contributions the new generations of Hispanic Soldiers make every day.

With ten years of service in the Army Reserve, Staff Sgt. Liza Baez is a member of that new generation of U.S. Army Soldiers from Puerto Rico. She has excelled in and out of uniform.

""I have played professional basketball successfully for a long-time representing Puerto Rico. When I joined the U.S. Army Reserve, I quickly realized that the same skills that you need to be a successful professional athlete are the same ones you need to be a Soldier: discipline, dedication to duty, and the ability to focus on your mission,"" said a proud Baez who is a Puerto Rico native.

Baez also reflected on her Hispanic ethnicity.

""I am proud to be Hispanic and to be a U.S. Soldier. Everywhere I go, I honor past generations of Hispanic Soldiers by being professional and by doing my very best in everything I do while trying to inspire others to do the same, regardless of their ethnicity. We all are Soldiers,"" said Baez, a Culinary Specialist in the Army Reserve.

According to the U.S. Army Equity and Inclusion Agency, today, more than seventeen percent of America's Soldiers and seven percent of Army Civilians are of Hispanic or Latino descent. A large proportion of Fort Buchannan's workforce is of Hispanic origins.

Fort Buchanan serves a diverse military community of approximately 15,000 active duty, Reserve and National Guard military, Marine Corps Reserve, and Navy Operational Support Center.

The military installation also offers critical services to the Department of Defense civilian population, veterans, retirees, and their families, as well as more than 30 federal agencies in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands."

WASHINGTON — The Army becoming a data-centric, technology-driven service is one of the Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth’s top objectives.

During her keynote speech to kick off the 2023 Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C., she spoke about the importance this plays in fielding the Army of 2030.

“We must continue to embrace innovation and transformation or risk failing to address future threats,” she said. “In close partnership with industry, the Army has pressed ahead and stayed on track to implement our most ambitious modernization effort in 40 years. With the introduction of each new system, we continue to increase our force’s capability to respond to various threats and serve as a credible deterrent to our adversaries.”

To expedite changing the Army and its business and operating model to leverage data strategically, the service created the Digital Transformation Strategy in 2021.

This outlines three key areas the Army must improve to leverage innovative and transformative technologies: modernization and readiness, optimized digital investments, and a technically savvy, operationally effective digital workforce.

In the last two years, the Army has been laying the foundation of the strategy by implementing the right policy, guidance and resourcing so it can quickly integrate technologies in the future.

“I think that is a big piece of where we are moving right now, and as you look at the next couple years, it really is about maturing that foundation,” Army Chief of Information Leonel Garciga said during an AUSA panel this week. “I don’t care how good an algorithm is. If you don’t trust the platform, or you don’t trust the network, do you trust the output of that algorithm? I think the answer is no.”

One of the key foundational pieces is making sure that the data being collected is properly labeled across the entire Department of Defense. This will allow the systems to communicate and scale quickly.

“We’ve got to ensure across all the functional communities in the Army, we have a common way of tagging, governing and ensuring that the data is accurate,” said Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo, who serves as the Army’s chief operating and management officer. “Once we do that, then I think we’ll be able to really start humming.”

The Army is taking an enterprise approach to change and transform faster. It is working on a more unified and coherent network. It’s changing how it trains Soldiers to use and interact with emerging technologies. It’s also adopting industry best practices for software development and updating its acquisition policy.

“In order for us to succeed, the challenges aren’t really technical because industry has most of this stuff already figured out,” Camarillo said. “The real question is how quickly can we adopt and change our processes to make the most advantageous use of capabilities that are already in the market.”

All this work is being done to give commanders and Soldiers on the battlefield the timely information they need to make informed decisions.

“So much of what we do involves software, involves data, it’s going to impact the entire range and spectrum of military operations in the future,” Camarillo said. “For us to maintain [our technological] advantage, we absolutely, as an imperative, have to get this right.”

WASHINGTON — Hundreds of Soldiers and Family members participated in a Family forum on quality-of-life concerns with Army senior leaders during the last day of the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C.

The participants voiced their concerns on a wide range of topics including health care, spouse employment, education, and barracks and housing issues.

“I know that we have a lot of work to do,” said Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth. “We are an enormous organization with an enormous inventory of housing and barracks. We know there is always continuing work to do, but I think we’ve done a lot in the last few years to make sure we are supporting our Soldiers and Families.”

Child Development Centers

The Army is putting an emphasis on expanding its number of child development centers, Wormuth said. The service built six new centers and has at least five more on the way.

The Army is also looking to increase staff at CDCs by increasing wages and providing incentives. The Department of Defense recently adjusted how much service members pay for child care at CDCs for the current school year.

“I know child care is a huge issue,” she said. “For me, as a mom, that was one of the hardest things when my kids were young.”

New Installation App

When Soldiers and Families move to new installations, one of the biggest challenges they face is finding the right resources for the information they need, said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George.

To alleviate the problem, the Army Software Factory is working on a mobile application that will bring information into one place. The team is currently reaching out to Soldiers and Families for ways to tailor the “My Army Post” application for use across the service.

“We are going to make this happen, and we want your feedback on what else you need,” George said. “I think this is important. We have a lot of resources in the Army, and we want to provide them.”

Spouse Employment

The Army is working on a number of initiatives to increase spouse employment. One example is that military spouses and dependents stationed in Italy can now telework for American companies. This is a big win, Wormuth said.

The Army is looking at increasing direct hiring opportunities for spouses. They are also working to ensure states follow the recently passed Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act that recognizes service member and spouses’ valid professional licenses when they move to another state.

Barracks and Housing

The Army is the service with the largest number of barracks. It spends more than $1 billion annually and has a maintenance backlog of $6.5 billion to bring the quality of barracks up to standard.

“That’s going to take some time, but we are making progress,” Wormuth said. “The chief of staff of the Army and the sergeant major of the Army and I are working to increase the amount we are spending on military construction for barracks.”

Army leadership is working to provide 100% sustainment funding for barracks and to spend more on renovation and construction, Wormuth added.

There is a barracks summit scheduled for the end of October to discuss improvements.

“We are doing a lot in that area to really try to make sure that our Soldiers are living in the kind of accommodations that they deserve to live in,” she added. “Be patient with us.”

As the forum ended, leadership reiterated the importance of these quality-of-life issues for Soldiers and their Families.

“We just want you to leave here today knowing that none of these concerns surprised us,” said Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Weimer. “We absolutely know they’re important. We absolutely know these are priorities, and we are taking a look at each and every one of them.”

Todd Wasmund, commander of U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa, and Ghana’s military leadership share a lighthearted moment following the culminating exercise at African Lion 2023 near Daboya, Ghana, June 13, 2023.

ARLINGTON, Va. — Africa is a continent of potential and service members at the Southern European Task Force, Africa, work every day to help African partners turn that potential into reality, said Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, commander of the unit based in Vicenza, Italy.

“We are responsible for all of the Army’s operations, activities and investments in support of U.S. Africa Command,” Wasmund said Oct. 11.

Africa is the second largest continent, with more than 50 nations and hundreds of languages. Tens of millions of people live in poverty even as the resources exist to lift up populations.

The African continent contains more ungoverned, under-governed or misgoverned areas, which attract extremist groups like Boko Haram, al-Shabaab, al-Qaida and the like, according to Defense Department officials.

It’s also a continent with little infrastructure and many natural disasters.

SETAF-AF — as the task force is abbreviated — provides a scalable crisis response option to the commander of U.S. Africa Command.

“It is scalable from a platoon all the way to a two-star joint task force headquarters,” Wasmund said.

The command had to do that recently following the coup in Niger. The task force quickly stood up and managed the U.S. forces in Niger. There are about 1,000 U.S. service members in the country, with a small footprint in the capital of Niamey and the most at an airfield in Agadez. The command provides the facilities for the Air Force and Special Operations Command — Africa, which had the counterterrorism mission.

The State Department said the July 26 deposition of the elected president was a coup, which limits the aid the command may provide to Niger. Restrictions under section 7008 of the State Department’s annual appropriations dictate what the United States can provide to Niger in foreign assistance, military training and equipment.

”With the announcement yesterday of the 7008 status for Niger, there will be some things that are suspended,” Waslund said. “They do require a little bit more scrutiny of how we might provide some of that partner support. That’s not something we can continue without further policy decisions.”

The general said the command will continue to maintain communications as the State Department establishes with the Nigerien junta a path to reestablish constitutional government.

Overall, the command’s operational activities include security cooperation, exercises, key leader engagements, medical readiness exercises, and other engagements.

The command also provides crisis response, including a noncombatant evacuation operation from Sudan earlier this year.

While West Africa is a focus for the command — it is the most populated portion area — it engages across the continent. The biggest exercise each year is African Lion, hosted by Morocco and SETAF-AF. It brings together nations from the continent and Europe to train together. The command also sponsors a yearly African Land Forces Symposium, giving military leaders the chance to meet and exchange ideas.

SETAF-AF and U.S. Africa Command help partner militaries as many of them mount counterterrorism efforts. U.S. service members help train partner militaries. The Africans train with U.S. Army security force assistance brigades and civil affairs teams. U.S. military personnel participate in medical readiness exercises and more.

“We have a lot to offer, but we are careful about their capacity so that we don’t overwhelm them,” the general said.

The command works closely with the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program. Wasmund called the program “brilliant” and a true force multiplier. The program, which pairs state National Guard units with nations, began in 1993 and started in Africa 20 years ago. The first two partnerships in Africa were Morocco-Utah and South Africa-New York.

“These Soldiers grew up together,” the general said. “That gives us this depth of relationship, [and] continuity. What we’re doing is ensuring everything ... we do with the African partner is synchronized and complementary.”

VICENZA, Italy – U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, commanding general of U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), said goodbye to a close friend and colleague, Italian Army Col. Michele Biasiutti, Caserma Del Din base commander and SETAF-AF deputy chief of staff - Italy, Sept. 8, 2023.

At an awards ceremony, Biasiutti received a plaque from Wasmund, thanking him for his service and dedication to SETAF-AF.

Biasiutti served in the position since Jan. 2020, and relinquishes his post to incoming Italian Army Col. Michele Amendolagine, who currently serves as the Italian base commander for Caserma Ederle in Vicenza.

“I served with a total of three [U.S. Army] generals during my time at SETAF-AF,” said Biasiutti. “Of course, everyone has their own personality, but there’s a common professionalism within each of these leaders.”

He shared how the source of this leadership must be traced back to the professional development and education the American military provides to its soldiers.

As the Italian deputy chief of staff for SETAF-AF, Biasiutti supported all training and operations for U.S. deployments and redeployments on Italian soil. His team ensured that all Italian rules were followed while Americans lived and operated on Italian bases and training areas.

His work also helped forge lasting partnerships between U.S. and Italian forces.

He regularly facilitated engagements between SETAF-AF leadership and the Italian Army, as well as local civilian and regional authorities.

""Working with my close friend Col. Michele Biasiutti over the last three years was a pleasure,” said U.S. Army Col. Keith McKinley, who recently retired as SETAF-AF’s chief of staff. “Michele contributed directly in enhancing the great military-to-military relationship between the command and our Italian hosts.""

Biasiutti’s position at SETAF-AF was not his first exposure to working alongside American service members.

Previously, Biasiutti deployed to several countries including Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Balkans, Kosovo, as well as Afghanistan where he served as the executive officer to the deputy chief of staff for operation Resolute Support headquarters. In this last assignment, Biasiutti worked under U.S. Army Gen. Scott Miller, commander of U.S. and NATO forces, during operation Resolute Support.

“Gen. Miller personified how a great leader can maximize and magnify the strengths of those around him, leading different services and diverse professionals to unified objectives,” said Biasiutti.

Biasiutti looks forward to his next assignment as he takes command of an Italian Alpini unit in Bolzano, Italy. Donning his distinctive peaked Alpini cap, adorned with a white feather, the new assignment marks a return to his mountain combat roots, he said.

“I am going back to my origins,” said Biasiutti. “I expect there will be challenges, but I will be equipped with the skill set developed over my career, enhanced by my experience working with SETAF-AF.”

WASHINGTON — Simplifying the way the Army trains and builds teams while continuously transforming the force are among the focus areas of the Army’s new Chief of Staff Gen. Randy A. George.

George said the Army must reduce the use of complicated, cumbersome technology while leveraging technology that cuts costs, including video game simulations that can lower spending on training formations. Using artificial intelligence, the Army can replicate realistic battlefield scenarios with less assistance from additional units.

The Army’s top uniformed leader said the nation’s largest military branch must find ways to continually transform, including developing methods to better access and process data while enabling machine learning and autonomy.

“We have to ruthlessly prioritize how we use time and resources,” George said during an Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition’s Eisenhower luncheon today. “Our days, dollars and decisions must be spent on building lethality and cohesive teams.”

George said the service’s top priority in transforming the force will be effective command and control as a foundation. In June, the Army discussed plans to transition to divisions as its unit of action to allow smaller units to maneuver and provide greater command and control capabilities.

The general recently visited the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Vilseck, Germany and praised the unit for its innovative command and control. The 2nd Cavalry’s regiment commander uses five Stryker armored vehicles digitally connected across the battlefield to exercise command and control.

“[The regimental commander] understands the challenges of large-scale combat operations and is adapting in real time to be more mobile, low signature and lethal,” George said.

George also said the Army can use simple, accessible technology such as a tablet to replace large operations centers.

“The world and warfare are changing rapidly,” George said. “We will stay ahead of our adversaries. And so, continuous transformation means iteratively adapting and evolving how we fight, how we organize, how we train, and how we equip.”

George said that he will place trust in Army leaders and commanders to decide how to invest in resources and find the means to build lethality.

The Army must remain ready when called to support operations worldwide. George cited the conflict in Ukraine as an example. Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Army deployed an armored brigade in Poland and paratroopers in the Baltic region to bolster the war effort.

George also announced plans to reduce excess and little-used equipment to help deliver combat-ready formations.

“Our leaders spend too much time laying out equipment and checking serial numbers,” George said. “I talked to a company commander in Europe who had a 118-page property book. That makes no sense.”

Gen. Andrew Poppas, Army Forces Command commander, and Army Materiel Command leader Gen. Charles Hamilton will lead a two-year effort to reduce the supply of excess equipment at two divisions by the end of 2023. In turn, the initiative will save Soldiers hours from managing excess materials, George added.

George said the Army will reduce time spent on vehicle maintenance across the force with “modest changes” to maintenance intervals in the service’s fleet of vehicles. The saved hours will give Soldiers more time to train and spend with families.

The war in Ukraine also revealed the need for greater reserve munition stocks. George said the establishment of a Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team earlier this year will help the Army create a more predictive maintenance model and leverage advanced manufacturing.

“We’ve learned so much from Ukraine’s experience and our experience supporting them,” George said. “We are going to adapt and change.”

During the next iteration of Project Convergence in spring 2024, the service will focus on establishing “kill webs” across the joint and combined teams with partner nations. Kill webs provide decision aides for commanders to quickly outline and identify tasking and re-tasking options on the battlefield.

George said the service’s efforts to modernize and innovate paints a positive portrayal of Soldiers to the American people. He said Americans see Army leaders who demand excellence and hold Soldiers accountable.

“This is critically important because the character of war is changing,” George said. “It is changing rapidly because disruptive technology is fundamentally altering how humans interact.”

WASHINGTON — Gen. Randy A. George, Army chief of staff, detailed five areas that Army Recruiting Command will revamp during the Be All You Can Be Symposium at the Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington D.C. Oct. 9.

The Army will shift how it prospects for recruits, transform its recruiting workforce, realign the recruiting command structure, create an experimentation capability within the recruiting command, and use evidence-based recruiting. It already revamped its slogan, “Be All You Can Be” in March.

George said recruiting has changed drastically since he joined the Army 42 years ago, when “Be All You Can Be” was also the Army slogan. He was trying to figure out how to get money to go to college. He talked to a Korean War veteran who told him he should join the Army.

“It was the best thing I ever did,” George said. “He was very successful in my very small, local community and had a big impact on me.

“When I first came in, I went over to the National Guard armory; got into a van; drove down to Des Moines, Iowa; took the ASVAB test; [and] got to stay in a hotel,” George said. “The next day, I did the medical piece, and by noon I was calling my mom to let her know I was signing up. It was that quick. It’s different now.”

He said he went out and talked to troops around the world to learn from the boots on the ground.

“We’re retaining great Soldiers; they love being in the Army. They love the people and the mission. They’re making lifelong friends and being fulfilled by what they do by being in the military,” he said. “Now we just need to look at how we need to recruit a little differently in today’s day and age.”

Changing how the Army prospects

Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, commanding general of the Army Recruiting Command, trains and leads more than 8,000 recruiters worldwide.

Recruiters are prospecting in a competitive environment with shifting generational and workforce preferences.

George said the Army may need to target recruits from the labor force who are going to work during the day and college in the evenings.

“They still think of the Army as only infantry, armor and combat arms when we have a gamut of critical career fields, George said. “I don’t know if many in the labor force and those in school understand what we truly do for this nation.”

“The high school markets make up a large portion of our enlisted force but with that number shrinking, we need to expand into the labor market,” Davis said.

He said he talks to non-military people like his delivery drivers as much as possible.

“I ask them to educate me. I’ve been in the uniform for so many years. I just want to understand from their perspective,” he said. “They’re very supportive. They trust the military. But they don’t relate to the Army.”

Transforming the Army’s recruiting workforce

The Army developed its recruiting workforce reforms after conducting a 90-day quantitative and qualitative analysis of two million contracts, 1.5 million accessions and 70,000 recruiters since 1998.

“We’re picking the right people, training them and keeping them, and not rotating them all the time so they can interact in their communities,” George said. “They will have language skills, know the area, know the people, continue to progress, know the environment and can be more effective.”

The change will result in a new military occupational specialty, 42T, talent acquisition specialist.

“This whole rollout, it has been on all of our minds every single hour as we look at transforming. This is potentially the biggest change ever to occur in the United States Army Recruiting Command’s history,” Davis said.

Davis grew up hearing war stories from his grandfather, who served in World War II.

“He spent a lot of time sharing his Army story with me,” Davis said. “He was very inspiring to the whole family.”

He hopes to carry on that inspiration to his team of recruiters as they create this new career field.

Davis touts the Soldier referral and recruiter performance incentive programs as successes because they were recommended by recruiters on the ground.

“When [they see] that investment in them, then there’s this surge of energy to get out there and do more in terms of our prospecting, processing and future Soldier management,” Davis said. “Listening to these recruiters and acting on their recommendations, that’s what I’m doing; it’s driving this positive resurgence across the recruiting force.”

Realigning the recruiting command structure

George said that marketing and recruiting will be consolidated and realigned into a three-star command directly reporting to him and the secretary of the Army.

“The tenure will be for four years. I’m going to be personally involved to help drive and make sure we’re getting after the change that we need,” he said.

“This synergy with the brand rollout has been able to help us align our marketing with the needs of our recruiters,” Davis said. “We’re starting to see all of our efforts from marketing, our retraining, what we’ve done to invest in our recruiters and then educating them on this brand.

Creating an experimentation capability within recruiting command

The Army will have an experimentation team, comprised of recruiters supported by experts in information management, data management, survey design, labor market analysis, marketing, operations and procurement.

Recruiters will be able to use technology to analyze the job market, what is and what isn’t working, and use technology in recruiting efforts.

“Most of the great ideas come from the people who are actually doing the mission,” George said. “We need to empower the people who are out there innovating for the Army.”

“Everything we’ve done in this command is from the feedback provided by these recruiters. It’s allowed us to really move resources and invest in their needs. We’re all interdependent,” George said.

Using evidence-based recruiting

George said the Army needs to improve the formal measurement and evaluation of recruiting policy decisions to better determine return on investment and more effectively allocate resources.

“We need to do a better job in the Army of understanding what’s working and what isn’t,” he said. We need to know what’s working in our marketing, how effective is it if you give someone a bonus, [and] what is the sensitivity analysis.”

Some people join the Army to be assigned to specific locations or for specific career fields, George said.

“We need to study that and make sure we have the analytics behind it as we move forward. There’s no more important topic in our Army right now.”

“Our responsibility to the Army is to be experts in warfighting and to be prepared to defend our nation,” George added. “We need the right people inside the Army. People have always been the strength of our Army.”

Rebranding the Army

In March, the Army rolled out the “Be All You Can Be” brand to address a younger generation.

Brian Griepentrog, executive vice president, Fors Marsh Group, leads a team of more than 60 scientists who conduct research for the Army with a focus on recruiting, market and advertising research, vocational choice, personnel selection, training and youth demographics.

His team conducted years of research with young adults and veterans about the perceptions of the Army and Army service. They used the concepts of possibilities, purpose, passion, communities and connection to find out what slogan participants liked best for the Army.

“Across all of these stakeholders, in a number of criteria, when asked if it would be a strong representative of purpose, passion, communities and connection, that was the winning candidate, so that’s why we’re now represented with Be All You Can Be,” Griepentrop said.

Lt. Gen. Douglas Stitt, deputy chief of staff G-1, joined the Army 33 years ago when the slogan was “Be All You Can Be.”

“My father encouraged me to be a part of something bigger than myself. I started out thinking about the mission but fell in love with the people I served with,” he said. “I’d do this job for free. I’d sign up the day after I retire.”

Whether it’s revamping the slogan, prospecting the workforce, transforming the recruiting command structure and workforce, creating experimentation capabilities, or using evidence-based recruiting, the Army is seeking Soldiers for the 21st century.

WASHINGTON — With the Georgia heat bearing down on them, Sgt. Jake Phillips and members of 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, struggled to finish the final leg of the 2023 Army Best Squad Competition’s first phase in September.

Still, the Soldiers had confidence in one another as they carried 35-pound rucks for 15 miles in the woods of Fort Stewart, Georgia. The Soldiers operated on only two hours of sleep and endured food deprivation. Fortunately, the squad boasted some of the most physically-fit Soldiers in the Army including Spc. Chancellor McGuire, who had the highest physical training test scores among all 60 competitors.

They had also competed and trained together for at least three years and some members even deployed together. Knowing his team’s robust fitness levels, Phillips wanted to push his squad to its limits.

The fire team leader learned that slowing their speed during the march actually helped his squad find the endurance needed to secure victory.

“I was always wanting to push the pace past what I think we’re capable of as a squad,” said Phillips, 25. “I was wanting to put more gas when it should have been more brakes. That was personally more challenging.”

Phillips’ guidance helped his 75th Ranger Regiment, U.S. Army Special Operations Command squad win the 2023 U.S. Army Best Squad of the Year award. Phillips, a native of West Chester, Pennsylvania, took Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year honors. McGuire, who hails from Austin, Texas, won Soldier of the Year.

“I think the key for us to win was we’ve all been working together for years,” Philips said. “We all know each other pretty well.”

Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer presented the awards in a ceremony at the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C. today. Soldiers from Army Medical Command finished in second place while the Army Pacific Command squad took third.

McGuire said keeping the goal in sight helped his squad weather through the endurance march.

“It was the last day of the competition. You can do anything for however long you tell yourself you can,” he said.

The 24-year-old McGuire credited his squad leaders and company commanders with helping mold him into a more capable special operations Soldier.

“It means I’m doing something right,” McGuire said of winning Soldier of the Year. “I took a lot from my team leaders coming up, my squad leaders. I took in everything that they have taught me … I’ve kind of become a sponge, so really I’m an image of them.”

The Army revamped its former Best Warrior contest two years ago into the Best Squad Competition to encourage a greater focus on team building and unit cohesion.

This year’s contest, executed by 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, featured another incentive. While competing, the participants could simultaneously earn their special skills certifications: the Expert Infantry Badge, awarded to Soldiers in infantry and Special Forces units; the Expert Soldier Badge, given to Soldiers who are not in infantry, Special Forces and medical branches; or the Expert Field Medical Badges, earned by outstanding medical technicians.

Twelve, five-person squads competed in the first phase of the competition during 10 grueling days at Fort Stewart.

The Soldiers went on ruck marches, completed exercises and did battle drills across more than 200,000 acres of land. The Soldiers engaged in land navigation, operated in urban areas and rucked from each destination. They learned to operate while sleep-deprived, while also taking part in night exercises.

During the competition’s final phase, the competitors travelled to Washington D.C. to be interviewed and evaluated by senior leaders.

McGuire said that his squad, which also includes Staff Sgt. Andrew Ewing, Spc. George Mascharka, and Spc. Shane Moon, finished first because of the bonds that the Soldiers share during and outside of duty. The Soldiers know each other’s families. They work out together and spend time studying in coffee shops.

The USASOC Soldiers faced stiff competition, particularly from the MEDCOM squad of Sgt. Jaime Padilla, Spc. Axxel Pasos, Sgt. 1st Class Kaleb Richardson, Spc. Robert Rupers and Christopher Trejo.

“My squad is the best squad,” said McGuire, a fire team leader. “We achieved something that we set our hearts and minds to, but at the end of the day we came out on top.”

WASHINGTON — Army leaders gathered at the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C. to discuss the service’s strategy as it starts the new fiscal year.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth spoke about the Army’s need to innovate and transform its modernization effort, force structure and recruiting.

“This is a crucial moment for the Army to summon our ingenuity,” she said. “To innovate and invest in emerging technologies; to test and develop in uncharted areas like artificial intelligence and contested domains like space and cyber; to reshape and transform the force to be more adaptable and flexible.”

In the past year, the Army has moved several systems into stages of advanced prototyping, production or fielding.

The Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office demonstrated the successful launch of a Tomahawk Land Attack Missile from the prototype Mid-Range Capability Weapon System in June. This followed the successful launch of a Standard Missile 6, or SM-6, from the system earlier in the year, confirming its full operational capability.

This system gives the Army the ability to strike enemy ships from land, a capability Wormuth said is well-suited for the Indo-Pacific.

One of the top modernization efforts for the Army is the development of long-range hypersonic capabilities. In February, the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force deployed the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon during Operation Thunderbolt Strike.

The Army is also working on emerging technologies including short-range air defense capabilities to defeat unmanned aircraft.

“As small unmanned systems increase in number and decrease in cost, we must have this capability to defend our formations against what will soon be the most common threats on the battlefield,” Wormuth explained.

Robotics is another area where the Army continues to research and develop new capabilities.

This year, the Army started fielding the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport to lighten the logistical load for infantry Soldiers. This paved the way for an even larger system the Army is prototyping, the Robotic Combat Vehicle designed to carry weapons, sensors and other robots.

The secretary also announced the Army is beginning a Human-Machine Integrated Formations Initiative to figure out how Soldiers and robots will work together on the battlefield. She said these integrated formations will bring robotic systems into units alongside Soldiers with the goal to have robots make first contact with the enemy.

“I see us embracing change, looking to the future, and becoming the more modern, more lethal, and more adaptive force we need to be,” she said. “As we pursue the most significant modernization effort in generations, we are building an Army that can dominate in large-scale multi-domain operations.”

Building this Army will require transforming the force structure to ensure the service has the capabilities it needs to meet current and future strategic requirements, she added.

As the force structure changes, so will Army recruiting. Last week, Army leadership detailed the change in who they recruit, how they recruit, and who will be recruiting.

The service is shifting its focus from high school seniors to the larger available workforce. It will also switch to permanent specialized recruiters by creating two new military occupational specialties.

“We have to innovate and transform in recruiting, but also in warfighting concepts and modernization, or risk irrelevance,” Wormuth said. “And the United States Army cannot and will not be irrelevant.”

VICENZA, Italy – The U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) will co-host a Warriors Corner presentation titled ‘State Partnership Program: Twenty Years of Making a Difference in Africa’ during the Association of the United States Army’s Annual Meeting and Exposition Oct. 9-11 in Washington, D.C.

The National Guard’s State Partnership Program has been successfully building relations for 30 years and now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe. There are currently 16 State Partnerships in Africa from 13 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

Gen. Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard, will introduce the National Guard’s SPP Program. Maj. Gen. Todd Wasmund, SETAF-AF Commanding General, will discuss the Army’s support U. S. Africa Command's campaign in Africa and where it interfaces with SPPs in Africa, before turning over to Maj. Gen. Alan Dohrmann, The Adjutant General for the North Dakota National Guard, state partner to Ghana, Benin and Togo to discuss his state’s individual partnership.

Lastly, Maj. Gen. Thomas Oppong-Peprah, Chief of Staff for the Ghana Army, will discuss partnering with both North Dakota and SETAF-AF.

The SPP evolved from a 1991 U.S. European Command decision to set up the Joint Contact Team Program in the Baltic Region with Reserve component Soldiers and Airmen. A subsequent National Guard Bureau proposal paired U.S. states with three nations emerging from the former Soviet Bloc and the SPP was born, becoming a key U.S. security cooperation tool, facilitating cooperation across all aspects of international civil-military affairs and encouraging people-to-people ties at the state level.

This cost-effective program is administered by the National Guard Bureau, guided by State Department foreign policy goals, and executed by the state adjutants general in support of combatant commander and U.S. Chief of Mission security cooperation objectives and Department of Defense policy goals.

Through SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-society relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic and social spheres.

The panel will be held Monday, Oct. 9 from 1430-1510 in the Army Exhibit in Exhibit Hall E at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The discussion will also be livestreamed on the SETAF-AF Facebook page and on DVIDS.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III paid a special visit to service members deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, during his first trip to Africa Sept. 24-25, 2023.

The Secretary addressed a small formation composed of Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines from various units reflecting the joint mission operating out of Camp Lemonnier.

“This command and this installation is the epitome of jointness. The work you do here with our Djiboutian partners and our other allies here is important,” Austin said. “I also know that because you’re here you’re away from home missing family, missing birthdays and anniversaries. So when you talk to your family tell them Lloyd Austin said ‘thank you’ not just for your service as the military members, but for their service as well.”

Before departing, Austin personally recognized several enlisted members for their superior performance while deployed. Among them was U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Craishod Norris, a Foreign Liaison Officer assigned to CJTF-HOA.

“It was an honor to meet Secretary Austin and the feeling of having someone at such an esteemed position in our chain of command take the time to congratulate service members like myself is indescribable.” said Norris. “I’m thankful to be recognized during such a special occasion, but our mission here at Camp Lemonnier is a team effort.”

Secretary Austin’s stop in Djibouti exemplifies the strategic importance of the U.S.-Djibouti partnership and is home to Camp Lemonnier, a critical military installation that serves as a linchpin in counterterrorism efforts and regional stability.

During his visit, Austin met with the President of Djibouti Ismail Omar Guelleh and the Minister of Defense Hassan Omar Mohamed Bourhan to discuss the security partnership between the two nations and shared priorities in the region. He also met with Somali President Hassan Mohamud and discussed the shared effort to counter al-Shabaab in the region.

From here Austin will continue his travels through the African continent later this week by traveling to Kenya and Angola to showcase the department’s appreciation for our African partners."
188,Army raises number of ACASP reserve careers,https://www.army.mil/article/270386/army_raises_number_of_acasp_reserve_careers,"An Army Reserve Soldier speaks to potential recruits about military career opportunities in Puerto Rico.

WASHINGTON — The Army will now provide incentives for more skilled, experienced civilians who join the Army Reserve.

The service recently expanded the number of certifiable, reserve career fields in the Army Civilian Acquired Skills Program from seven to 44.

Nearly 200 new Soldiers in Fiscal Year 2023 have enlisted or commissioned through the program, which has mutual benefits for both recruits and the Army.

Civilians with experience in jobs that range from musicians to human intelligence collectors, and orthopedic specialists to vehicle mechanics can take advantage of the program. Enlisted Soldiers who meet qualifications will be awarded the rank of specialist, or E-4, and bring needed skills into the force.

The Army in turn will spend less time training new Soldiers, who have already certified their skills through trade schools, professional certifications, academic degrees and time on the job.

“[ACASP] allows us to open a greater talent pipeline to the Army, giving more people an opportunity to join with those skills,” said Col. Fred Hockett, deputy commander for support, Army Recruiting Command. “[ACASP] makes it a little more attractive when people say I can use the skills I've already gotten in the civilian workforce in the Army.”

Hockett said the Army does not currently have plans to expand the number of active-duty career fields but may add more ACASP jobs as the service’s needs change.

Angie Holbrook, Army chief of military personnel, Accessions Division, said that the majority of the new ACASP recruits joined as in the military occupational specialties of42R/S musicians, 68W combat medic specialists and 88M truck drivers. About 80 Army band members enlisted through ACASP.

Holbrook said the program has given Army recruiters another tool to entice potential recruits as they compete for talent in a highly-contested job market.

“The expansion of seven MOS to 44 gives us a much broader range to bring in [Soldiers] who have those skills,” Hockett said.

Holbrook said the service expanded the program due to the success of the original seven reserve MOS and changing demographics. He added that the Army has recently seen more interest towards in intelligence, technology and vehicle maintenance. Coincidentally, Army leaders have targeted recruiting Soldiers in those fields.

“[ACASP] allows us to get people that are using recent, relevant technologies into the force,” Holbrook said. “I think it’s going to give us more depth because it takes a long time for the Army to field the new equipment or field new systems … These people are coming in straight away and being able to put those things into practice with the most recent technologies.”

Holbrook said that qualified applicants may also have the option of shorter service contracts because the Army saves time and funding on ACASP recruits’ training. ACASP not only gives Soldiers a head start on their careers, but it provides a cost-savings tool to bring skilled troops into the force.

“The Army realizes there’s some definite, emerging skills, talents and technologies that we want to be able to put into the force quicker,” Holbrook said. “[ACASP] is giving more opportunities to more people, but also it gives us those knowledge, skills and abilities faster.”

A Soldier who enlists as a track vehicle repairer with two years of training and experience in the repair and overhaul of engines, power trains and chassis components will only require three weeks of advanced individual training compared with 14 weeks for a normal recruit.

Other careers including firefighters, construction engineers, electricians and carpenters require two years of professional experience to receive an ACASP certification.

In some career fields such as combat medic, Soldiers already certified can also hasten the training process. Combat medics must re-certify their skills every two years, and ACASP recruits will already be familiar with the certification process.

Medics must attend a 16-week training program where they will not only learn emergency care but basic life support and in-patient and out-patient care. Through ACASP, a recruit can reduce that training time to 9 weeks.

New Army Spc. Adam Michael of Walterboro, South Carolina joined the Army through ACASP as an 88M Motor Transport operator because of his prior civilian experience working for J.B. Hunt, a motor transport services company.

The program specifically benefits recruits considering joining the National Guard or Army Reserve. Hockett said that qualified recruits can begin applying their skills immediately in their home states.

“There's a lot of overlap between those civilian skills that they've already gone to school and potentially paid for and the MOS-producing courses that we have in the Army Reserve,” Hockett said.

More than 80 leaders from 14 European countries met to discuss strengthening reciprocal fuel support during Defense Logistics Agency Energy Europe & Africa Fuels Exchange Agreements Forum in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Sept. 19-21.

For the 18th year, international partners met to learn more about the DLA Energy International Fuel Agreements program and explore increased partnership opportunities.

“The relationships we have built consistently show the world that we can stand united while supporting one another. This is especially true during the turbulent times being experienced in the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and on the African continent,” DLA Energy Commander Navy Capt. Brian Anderson said during his opening remarks. “Together, we continue to improve and grow this forum through the interchange of open discussion. We all have a lot to learn from each other.”

What started in 2005 with 34 representatives from eight countries talking about fuel support has grown to 80 representatives from 14 countries spending almost a week together networking, discussing capabilities and exploring enhanced interoperability. Representatives were from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Albania, Georgia, and NATO Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

For first-time attendees like Albania and Georgia, the forum provided an opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge of the U.S. fuel exchange agreements program. These agreements, which provide cross-servicing capabilities between partner nations and coalition forces worldwide, help manage fuel costs and optimize the supply chain.

“When a host nation partner with a DLA Energy international fuel agreement receives DLA Energy-owned fuel, the host nation partner pays the standard price DLA Energy charges U.S. military forces,” said Gerald R. Candelaria, DLA Energy Europe & Africa International Agreements chief.

As of July, DLA Energy has 40 fuel agreements with 23 countries around the world. Its International Fuel Agreements team synchronizes with regional DLA Energy offices to establish and maintain these long-term Defense Department fuel agreements with foreign militaries.

Lt. Col. Giorgi Maisuradze of the Georgian Defense Forces said the forum helped him better understand the Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreements process. ACSAs are the formal mechanisms that allow the DOD to acquire, and in some cases to provide, logistics support, supplies, and services directly with eligible countries and international organizations.

“It’s a very good event especially because we are conducting a lot of different exercises and activities with U.S. forces in Georgia,” he said. “This forum is really great for improving understanding of how the system works, especially ACSA and ACSA orders, and to eliminate some of the deficiencies we have in the process and better understand the procedures.”

Capt. Lampros Lampropoulos of the Hellenic Navy General Staff in Greece said the benefits are mutually beneficial.

“The collaboration between DLA and the Hellenic Navy is useful for both parties,” he said. “We are looking forward to improving future engagement.”

Maisuradze found value in meeting his counterparts in person.

“This conference has been great for sharing information and knowledge of other people, who is doing what,” he said. “This is perfect ground for finding people you’ve only met by email and to discuss issues face to face.”

Albania General Staff Lt. Col. Oliverta Dulo agreed.

“Through DLA, we have the opportunity to have fuel access for our troops when they go abroad for training exercises or other cases,” she said. “Now that I’ve been here, I now know the right process to follow and the right person to contact for help.”

Candelaria said his team works hard to maintain strong partnerships across Europe and help DLA Energy’s international partners understand the ASCA process and its benefits to all that participate.

“These fuel agreements are essential elements for U.S warfighters and partner nations not only during routine and emerging operations but in supporting international exercises around the world,” he said. “They help build supply chain efficiency, enhance interoperability with participating foreign militaries, and strengthen long-term collaboration with our partner nations.”

During the week, Italian, Spanish and British partners briefed participants on their fuel programs and experts discussed the Central Europe Pipeline System, Spanish Pipeline System, Turkish Pipeline Facility and Italian Pipeline. A DLA Finance team was also on site to explain invoicing and financial settlements.

“This forum provides a great opportunity to enhance partnerships, discuss worldwide capabilities and explore potential reciprocal fuel support, as well as a chance to reconcile fuel accounts between allies and partners,” said Army Lt. Col. Leslie Shipp, DLA Energy Europe & Africa commander.

DLA Energy Finance personnel presented a briefing, met one-on-one with international counterparts, and signed settlements totaling $80.4 million providing reimbursement to the Department of Defense Working Capital Fund.

Carl Petermann, a fuels management analyst for the U.S. European Command Joint Petroleum Office in Stuttgart, Germany, said the event was one of the best events he’s attended.

“Well done to the DLA Energy Europe & Africa team for putting on a first-class event,” he said. “I've been to a lot of conferences, forums and meetings over the years. However, I don't ever recall one being executed so well.”

The next forum is being planned for Sept. 17-19, 2024."

Each year, U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) engages in hundreds of theater security cooperation activities, events and exercises in Africa. These initiatives encompass a wide spectrum of training activities across various warfighting domains, reinforcing partner capabilities and fostering improved interoperability.

In order to assist with training activities and exercises, SETAF-AF Soldiers must maintain their own training and readiness. Soldiers permanently assigned to the unit are required to achieve qualification on an M-4 carbine, while those on temporary duty orders are expected to qualify on an M-17 pistol.

“The first things we look at before sending a Soldier to the continent is medical readiness, current with annual training and weapon qualification.” says Capt. Fernando Rubio, company commander of Intelligence and Sustainment Company, SETAF-AF.

SETAF-AF hosts ranges twice a year, specifically during the first and fourth quarters. This scheduling enables the unit to prioritize its support for executing theater security cooperation activities in Africa, including the largest multinational, joint, all-domain exercise conducted by U.S. Africa Command - African Lion.

“The operation tempo slows down during the first and fourth quarter of the year. That is the best time to be proactive with individual readiness and position us to be prepared for exercises such as African Lion and Justified Accord,” said Rubio.

SETAF-AF places emphasis on maintaining and improving Soldiers’ marksmanship by first refreshing their skills on the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST). The trainer is designed to simulate live weapon training and permit Soldiers more trigger time on a weapon, allowing them to increase confidence and familiarization once it is time to qualify their assigned weapon on the range.

“The EST helps Soldiers get comfortable with weapons they haven’t shot before and develop muscle memory…practice makes perfect!” states Sgt. 1st Class Erin Reagan, mobility and exercise non-commissioned officer with 79th Theater Sustainment Command assigned to SETAF-AF.

Soldiers are allocated one week to zero their weapons and refine their skills at the EST. Afterward, they have another week dedicated to qualify with their assigned weapons. Rubio said, “We make every effort to accommodate the schedules of Soldiers departing for and returning from diverse exercises in various parts of the world, including countries in Africa.”

The range is where Soldiers become familiar with their weapons, as the repetitive nature of firing live ammunition helps Soldiers develop muscle memory and fine-tune their marksmanship fundamental training. To qualify, Soldiers must shoot no less than twenty-three out of forty targets on the M-4 carbine, and twenty-one out of thirty on the M-17 pistol.

“You never know what’s going to happen, I can speak from experience. As soon as I graduated from AIT [Advanced Individual Training], I went to Iraq. The more you know about your weapon the better, if anything should happen, you can pick up that weapon and suppress fire,” continued Reagan.

Marksmanship is a fundamental aspect of readiness and embodies the Total Soldier Concept. It fosters weapon proficiency, reinforces safety protocols, and instills confidence in soldiers.

STUTTGART, Germany — General Randy A. George, Chief of Staff of the Army, addressed U.S. Africa Command Soldiers and personnel at Kelley Barracks on Thursday, September 28, 2023, to provide direction and inspiration for those serving within the combatant command.

""I want to thank each and every one of you for what you do,"" expressed George.

The Army Chief of Staff is currently in Europe providing guidance to Soldiers across various military installations. The theme of his tour includes key principles of military leadership, among them reputation, professionalism, and operational excellence.

""If you've got Soldiers on your staff or in your unit, it's imperative they are the absolute experts at their warfighting mission,"" stated George. ""Whatever your rank, the expectation is that you know your job.""

Articulating his expectations, George emphasized the importance of professionalism and expertise in contribution to a Soldier's reputation among peers and superiors.

On physical fitness, George highlighted the connection between fit Soldiers and operational efficiency and excellence. He emphasized the role of physical health in ensuring mental clarity, especially in the demanding context of military operations.

""Expect that you have to be athletes,"" said George. ""If you're more physically fit, you are better able to be a clear thinker.""

Acknowledging the significant role families play in supporting Soldiers, he stressed the importance of families as integral support systems, enhancing the morale and effectiveness of military personnel.

""My wife was in the military for a while,"" stated George. ""She was my classmate at West Point. My view is our families are combat multipliers.""

The 41st Army Chief of Staff also reiterated his ""Ready Army"" mnemonic, a foundational guide for leaders disseminated in August.

Concluding his address, George challenged the audience to empower peers and rising leaders in upholding professional standards despite hesitation.

""We have to push through that and make sure that we are getting after our standards. That's our profession. That's what a profession means."""

The Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) committee and members from the CJTF-HOA plans and policy section organized a three-day class in Djibouti City, Djibouti, Sept. 25-27.

The WPS level 100 class allowed students to engage in group discussions with their peers to focus on ways they can better integrate the WPS model and gender perspectives across management, development, and employment within the joint forces.

WPS focuses on teaching U.S. service members how to proactively integrate the needs and perspectives of women and empower them to participate in decision-making processes at all levels to influence international peace, security and prosperity. It also aims to work within both the ranks of the military and partner national defense and security sectors to protect the human rights of women and girls, especially during conflict and crisis.

U.S. Maj. Gen. Jami Shawley, CJTF-HOA commanding general, emphasized the importance WPS plays within the command, the African continent, and the military as a whole.

“If one woman is in the room, will she have a voice that has the power of every other voice,” said Shawley. “If not, use your voice, I promise you that for as long as you are here in my command, you will be supported and you will be listened to.”

As one of Shawley’s high-priority initiatives during her time at CJTF-HOA, the WPS has welcomed engagements with both Djiboutian and foreign partners to find ways to educate service members on gender perspective and how to promote equal representation of all voices.

Leading the WPS level 100 course was Denise Phillips, the CJTF-HOA WPS gender advisor, and her team. The intent of the level 100 course is to maximize the success and reach of WPS objectives and give the students the necessary resources they need to serve as Gender Focal Points within their command.

“Every human being deserves the right to feel secure within their ranks, within their jobs, and within their lives,” said Phillips. “The goal of this week’s course was to bring over 40 individuals from CJTF-HOA and spend the proper time to teach them how they can better implement the lessons they’ve learned in their sections and in their components back home.”

During the class, men and women from all branches of service and backgrounds learned practical lessons on how to make their workplace more secure and accepting of different gender perspectives. They also participated in moderated group discussions on problems they have seen in the commands they have served under and how they can solve these issues in their own ranks.

Among the 40 students in attendance was U.S. Army Capt. Ronald Lofano, Civil Affairs East Africa team leader. Lofano and his Civil Affairs team facilitate an English discussion group in Djibouti, teaching English pronunciation and grammar to Djiboutian citizens. A key aspect of his mission is to engage with the Djiboutian community, something he feels more prepared to do with the lessons he has learned from the 100 course.

“WPS impacts every facet of Civil Affairs operations,” said Lofano. “In our bi-weekly English discussion groups WPS plays an integral role in identifying and understanding the socio-economic and cultural experiences that impact women, children and men in vastly different ways.”

Another student, U.S. Army Col. Antionette Mulholland, CJTF-HOA logistics director, expressed the importance of looking inward and then

“In a lot of cases we’re so focused on trying to fix other countries when we need to look at ourselves first,” said Mullholland.“One of the most important things with WPS for me is to empower that next generation of female leaders. I see WPS as one of the key drivers of making sure that we fulfill the promises we’ve made to our young women and service members and that we will promote inclusion and equal opportunity within our ranks.”"

WASHINGTON ­­— As Dillon Agnew drove his car north on a sweltering summer afternoon in June 2021, he saw that the Mojave Desert stretched out seemingly in all directions.

The Soldier had just left a Denny’s in Barstow, California, and cruised past the gas stations and neon motel signs before he got on the desolate, two-lane road that leads to Fort Irwin.

His heart sank.

Agnew only saw coarse desert and small clutters of houses until he came upon a wooden banner bearing the words “Welcome, National Training Center,” with an AH-1 Cobra helicopter display perched above.

Single and in his mid-20s, Agnew enjoyed attending theater productions and night life. He didn’t see any semblance of a vibrant city near Fort Irwin.

“It’s about 31 miles and 45 minutes of nothing,” Agnew said of the drive through San Bernardino County. “So, I was a little disheartened.”

He knew that his new assignment would be more than a normal adjustment.

Located in the middle of the Mojave between the Calico Mountains, the California installation sits two hours from Los Angeles and 180 miles from Las Vegas. Although Agnew grew up in Southern California, he still found the dry temperatures stifling.

Isolated from civilization, Agnew found little to do in his free time at the desert installation. Soldiers assigned to Irwin often find activities limited to the post’s bowling alley, bars or making the commute to Barstow. Others simply stay in their barracks rooms and only leave to go to work or the gym.

So he buried himself in his duties as a medic; bonding with troops in training center rotations.

Weeks later, one of his supervisors asked him to become his unit’s representative for Irwin’s Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers, or BOSS program. Agnew knew little about the group other than it planned some social events for Soldiers.

Single Soldiers stationed in remote locations often struggle with feelings of isolation and depression. Sometimes it can even lead to suicidal thoughts. According to an April 2022 Government Accountability report, troops stationed in remote locations attempted to take their own lives more than other Soldiers.

The problem extends beyond the Army. According to the National Institutes of Health, remote locations have seven times the suicide rate of those living in urban areas.

“A lot of people haven’t experienced remoteness like this,” Agnew said. “You can look [around] and see the same brown mountains. And that can weigh on you.”

The Army started BOSS programs in 1989 to broadly improve the lives of Soldiers and boost unit morale through recreational activities and life skills classes. The Army believes that if it encourages Soldiers to take part in BOSS, it can retain more of its talent according to the service’s Morale, Welfare and Recreation website.

The events vary from kayaking, camping and museum visits to volunteer efforts and attending professional sports games. Each of the 67 worldwide BOSS programs hosts indoor and outdoor activities, many unique to the installation and the region. For instance, the program at Fort Wainwright, Alaska offers classes on preparing vehicles for winter while the Fort Irwin program takes Soldiers on hiking trips in California’s national parks.

BOSS also offers Soldiers the opportunity to voice quality of life concerns through their chain of command. The program supports the notion that a happy Soldier equals a more combat-ready Soldier. In the last fiscal year, more than 242,000 Soldiers participated in about 2,000 events. Camp Humphreys, South Korea has the largest participation with more than 119,000 troops actively taking part in team and morale building activities.

However, Agnew, who previously served as Fort Irwin’s BOSS president, said maintaining and building Soldier morale at remote locations like Fort Irwin can be a delicate challenge.

Something as simple as the Wi-Fi service suffering an outage can be devastating to single Soldiers.

The Army News Service spoke to Soldiers at two remote locations, Fort Irwin and Fort Wainwright, Alaska to learn how BOSS programs tackle recruitment challenges and how they give Soldiers an escape from everyday duty. And they tell how sometimes, the programs save lives.

“I think [BOSS] is really essential to how a young Soldier forms their opinion, not only about the Army, but themselves,” said 1st Sgt. Brian Samaniego a BOSS program member. “It helps not only their unit’s cohesion and morale, but you get that person out of the barracks.”

Braving Alaska’s endless winter

Thousands of miles north at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, Spc. Adrian Gonzales, recalled one December evening when he nearly ended his life.

The long winter nights ate away at him in the first few months that he arrived at the far northern installation, nestled in the Alaskan interior, 190 miles from the Arctic Circle.

Soldiers must prepare for Alaska’s harsh cold and ready themselves for possible frigid weather injuries, including frostbite and hypothermia.

As a gate guard at the installation, he got swept into spiraling depression. During most winters at Fort Wainwright, the sun only rises for short periods, leaving the region in darkness for up to 16 hours.

After work, he retreated to his barracks room, rarely stepping outside.

Then in December 2022, in the basement of a friend’s house, he held a weapon in his hand and contemplated suicide.

Gonzales had grown up in an Army family; his father had served for nearly three decades and he had grown accustomed to separation from loved ones. But even he found the isolation of Fort Wainwright daunting.

“I was breaking down,” Gonzales said. “I couldn’t take it anymore.”

Fortunately for Gonzales, he called a supervisor who calmed him down. The Soldier soon encouraged Gonzales to join Wainwright’s BOSS program. Gonzales, who arrived at the post in 2022, went on his first volunteer project: collecting trash along the Chena River. He also joined the Soldiers Against Drunk Driving program, run by BOSS members.

The program offers rides to Soldiers who have consumed alcohol in the Fairbanks area. From October 2022 through July 2023, Fort Wainwright’s SADD gave more than 1,000 Soldiers rides.

Gonzales found that the volunteer work gave him a purpose and feelings of accomplishment that he lacked when he confined himself to his dorm room.

“To say [BOSS] was eye-opening would be an understatement,” Gonzales said. He became one of many Soldiers across the Army who claimed the program saved them from suicide.

Suicides spiked at the Alaska installation from 2014 to 2021 with 17 Soldiers taking their lives. BOSS members keep a vigilant watch to help prevent suicide.

The Department of the Army’s BOSS representative Staff Sgt. Cody Mackall said that the program saved his life twice — once following a failed relationship in 2016. A phone call from a fellow BOSS member asking him to volunteer for a charity event prevented him from committing suicide.

Sgt. Matthew Ruiz, who grew up in a conservative Latino household in Arizona, said he had a jarring transition to living in Alaska and the Army. When he first woke up in a plane, the midnight sun in Fairbanks perplexed him.

“I had no idea what was going on,” he said. “It was … mesmerizing.”

Ruiz, a BOSS member assigned to an infantry unit, said the eight months of winter and two months of longer nights can lead to Soldiers isolating themselves. During the onset of the COVID pandemic, many Soldiers retreated to their barracks rooms. At the time, the BOSS program struggled to schedule weekend activities due to the closure of many businesses in the Fairbanks area.

“The things that get into Soldiers’ minds is usually the relationships or the alcohol,” Ruiz said. “[In] this program we try to make Soldiers’ lives better. And we always have something to do.”

Each month Fort Wainwright BOSS Soldiers ask peers to leave their barracks rooms and enjoy the immense Alaskan wilderness. The Wainwright BOSS program has taken troops to Grapefruit Rocks, a hiking area 50 miles north of Fairbanks. Solders have taken ATV rides, fished and went ice climbing.

“[BOSS] allows them to open doors and realize, “oh, I like to ice climb,” said Ruiz.

Although Ruiz said that BOSS participation has risen, recruiting new members remains challenging. The program currently has 180 Soldiers in the program at an installation that serves more than 6,000 active-duty members.

In an environment as isolated as the Alaskan interior, Fort Wainwright boss members understand the importance of keeping Soldiers active.

Sgt. Naomi Herbert, a six-year Army veteran who emigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria, said members try not to pressure Soldiers to participate, instead they encourage troops to visit to the local gym or bowling alley.

On Fridays and Saturdays, they encourage Soldiers not to wear uniforms and to address each other by their first names instead of rank.

“We’re trying to be an agent for change against depression,” said Herbert. “It is really hard to be here without families.”

Soldiers at Fort Irwin faced similar struggles.

Michigan native finds niche at Fort Irwin

Cpl. Kelly Kribs lived near the water most of her life and spent summers swimming and fishing. Kribs grew up in the riverfront town of Bay City, Michigan, south of Lake Huron.

Life circumstances thrust her toward military service, after working three jobs just to make ends meet.

After travelling to Fort Irwin for her first assignment in November 2019, she heard rumblings from fellow Soldiers about the California installation — none of them good. But several Soldiers from her Advanced Individual Training joined her on the assignment.

Kribs, who had never visited California, initially found the heat and dry air unbearable. Like many Soldiers at Fort Irwin, she limited her activities to staying in her barracks room. Then, other Soldiers told her about the BOSS program as means to get away from her duties as a visual information specialist.

She joined BOSS in mid-2021, and eventually becoming its president, determined to breathe life into a dormant program.

She understood the feelings of isolation new Soldiers experience at Fort Irwin having lived through it herself. Joining BOSS changed her.

“I was that Soldier who was just sitting in the barracks, drinking, playing video games, counting the bricks on the wall, you know what I mean?” she said. “But having that outlet and that opportunity to just … explore is a big deal.”

Kribs petitioned leadership of each resident unit to fund trips outside of the base. She talked about the importance of finding recreational trips for single Soldiers who often found themselves confined to their dorm rooms or frequenting the bars on post. She used the program’s Discord server to invite as many interested Soldiers as he could.

And Kribs began planning for more trips to the surrounding areas in Southern California.

“I'm a very social person,” Kribs said. “Having someone who's outgoing and willing to go talk to people and go brief every single week and walk up to random Soldiers at the bar on post and be like, ‘Hey, are you single? You should check out the BOSS program.”

In only eight months, Kribs, along with Agnew, grew the program from about 100 Soldiers to nearly 900 at an installation of about 4,800 active-duty members.

Originally Kribs said, the BOSS meetings consisted of talks on improving facilities such as upgrading furniture in the barracks or workout programs at the fitness center. Kribs said she would like Soldiers to experience a semblance of life outside of the installation where Soldiers can be themselves and form connections with their peers.

Soldier bonding

Irwin’s BOSS members have toured Universal Studios, attended a San Diego Padres baseball game and in June visited Catalina Island off the Los Angeles coast. Soldiers have even went skiing on Big Bear Mountain, a resort that has a top elevation of 8,805 feet and 748 acres for skiers.

Although Fort Irwin lies hours from the major cities, BOSS made trips to Southern California’s attractions more accessible.

“One of the selling points here is … you can go skiing in the morning and watch the sunset on the beach at night with a quick hour and a half drive. Right?” Samaniego said. “And I think making that available to them … and then letting them go on these trips and opportunities really opened up the BOSS program in a positive manner for everyone.”

Private 1st Class Nat Manansala, a 19-year-old Soldier with less than a year in the Army, said that joining the BOSS program provided a welcome introduction into the military. Originally shy and reserved, Agnew said he saw Manansala gradually build confidence and become more social with each bus trip.

Manansala said he didn’t have the best introduction to his first duty station and had to find his own way onto post without a sponsor.

“[BOSS] gave me a different perspective of what Fort Irwin could [be],” said Manansala, who manages the program’s social media accounts.

Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers began in 1989 as a program to address recreational needs of Soldiers. Today BOSS programs raise Soldier morale through activities both outdoors and in urban environments. Sometimes activities can help Soldiers combat depression and feelings of isolation. BOSS members can also take life and pro skills classes. (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

The program also provides “Boss Buses” where they will take Soldiers to the surrounding towns of Victorville and Barstow to go to the mall, movie theater or restaurants.

Dillon and Kribs spent many months working after hours to plan a regular slate of trips within the allowed 250-mile radius from Fort Irwin. Although they have the support of commanders and senior NCOs, they often must contend with scheduling conflicts with squad leaders, Agnew said.

The core of the program lies in the friendships built. BOSS members said that the trips and volunteer activities let Soldiers from different careers and walks of life learn about one another.

“I have a passion for helping people and helping these brand new Soldiers,” said Dillon who has been a BOSS unit representative, vice president and now president of Fort Irwin’s program. “And [when] I see them on every single trip, I know we’re helping people, giving them a break.”

Private 1st Class Albert Gray, a 19-year-old Soldier from Anderson County, Indiana, initially struggled with the harsh desert climate when he arrived at Fort Irwin in March 2023.

He found himself out of breath during training runs.

The death of his father Jerry, a retired Marine, encouraged Gray to enlist in the Army.

Gray, a combat engineer, joined the program first by volunteering for events such stacking tires for a paintball park. Gray said that he had not been around many people. Attending a BOSS trip to the Santa Monica pier and Long Beach helped him overcome his shyness. Gray became friends with a Soldier serving as a cavalry scout.

“I’ve never been around that many people,” said Gray, who described himself as an introvert growing up. “[BOSS] kind of opened me up as far as my social interaction.”

“It helped with my confidence,” he added.

Agnew said that Gray told a story becoming more and more common among BOSS members. And that’s when, Agnew said, he knows the program has done its job.

“If you come here not knowing anybody and you’re not very social, it’s hard to make friends,” he said. “I think we give people an avenue to make friends.”

BOSS programs give Soldiers the opportunity get away from the stresses of military life, by venturing into the surrounding communities and for a few hours, dissuade feelings of depression and isolation.

A Soldier from the 200th Military Police Command was presented one of the highest awards in the Military Police (MP) Corps.

Master Sgt. Grant Smith was awarded the Regimental Command Sergeant Major (RCSM) James W. Frye Noncomissioned Officer (NCO) of Excellence Award during a ceremony at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, Sept. 22.

“It's a true honor and a very humbling experience that I was not only nominated but that I won this prestigious award,” said Smith.

“It's my hope that winning this award will shed light not only on the U.S. Army Reserve and the 200th Military Police Command but give Soldiers an insight on how successful you can be even being a Reserve Soldier.""

This award recognizes two NCOs from two categories, sergeant to staff sergeant, and sergeant first class to master sergeant. The awardees are selected based on the NCOs who consistently demonstrate professionalism and dedication to the MP corps.

""[We] are super proud of the accomplishment of [Smith],” said Command Sgt. Major James Hickman, senior enlisted advisor at 304th MP Battalion, 290th MP Brigade (BDE). “He sets an example that's hard to follow and he makes us all want to do better. I'm glad that the regiment recognizes his leadership abilities. He deserves this award.""

Nominees for this award were judged on their duty performance, Soldier development, leader development, significant accomplishments, military and civilian education achievements, volunteerism, and overall impact on the MP Corps.

Smith’s recent contributions to the MP Corps included creating a leadership development program tailored for MP Soldiers within his brigade and developing a fitness program that increased his unit’s overall Army Combat Fitness Test first-time pass rate to approximately 90 percent.

""Smith always goes above and beyond for Soldiers. He always goes above and beyond in everything that he does, as a person and as an individual,” said Sergeant Maj. William Angelo, who previously served as the 290th MP BDE operations senior enlisted advisor, but now serves as the Readiness Training Academy’s senior enlisted advisor at the 83rd U.S. Army Reserve Readiness Training Center.

“It's a great honor to know him and serve with him, and just to be able to call him a friend. I am very appreciative the Army is recognizing what everyone else has already seen in him. He is just an all-around outstanding NCO.""

Smith enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1997. After spending six years on active duty, he then transitioned to the U.S. Army Reserve in 2003. He is currently the interim operations senior enlisted advisor for the 304th Military Police Battalion in Nashville, Tennessee.

“I believe that it's our responsibility to build and craft our own legacy and so what I want my legacy to be, "" said Smith. “When it's all said and done and I throw my boots up over the wire for the last time, I want my legacy to be about building the legacies of others.”

The annual RCSM James W. Frye NCO of Excellence Award was established by the U.S. Army Military Police School in 2022 to recognize the hard work and dedication of MP NCOs.

Smith is currently the only Army Reserve Soldier authorized to wear both the Marechaussee Award and the Regimental Command Sergeant Major James W. Frye NCO of Excellence Award."

Dolsan, Somalia - U.S. military members from Kismayo, Somalia partnered with the Kenya Defence Forces and Somali National Army Danab Forces to bring medical supplies and treatment to a local village as part of a Medical Civic Action Program clinic, July 1, 2023, in Dolsan Village, Somalia.

The 91st Civil Affairs Battalion, Special Operations-Airborne, coordinated with the Mobile Surgical Response Team to provide medical care to the villagers as the KDF screened patients and distributed prescriptions for those who were ill. Members of the Somali National Army Danab Forces and Somali National Army provided security while the KDF and 91st Civil Affairs Battalion assisted patients.

“With the partner forces, we were able to administer medical supplies to the local population,” said U.S. Army Capt. Ben Coad, 91st Civil Affairs Battalion Civil Military Support Element-Somalia Team Lead. “It’s a great opportunity for the Kenya Defence Forces and the SNA Danab to work together and to bolster those partnerships.”

Operated by host nation partner forces in coordination with U.S. joint services, MEDCAPs serve as temporary field clinics to provide limited medical treatment to the local population. U.S. forces regularly engage in MEDCAPs to work alongside African partners and provide medical care to remote communities, bolstering trust and security within the region.

“We have come to promote the safety of the local populace,” said Maj. D. K. Mosbey, KDF commanding officer. “It’s about the promotion of security, justice and local authority to the federal government of Somalia, to include Jubaland. Today we met with the chief of this area and had an opportunity for a positive engagement.”

Over 250 men, women and children sought medical aid at the MEDCAP for conditions ranging from Dengue fever to urinary tract infections. Patients that required specialized treatment were referred to the medical facility on Kismayo where more advanced treatment options were available from the KDF.

“It goes a long way towards building confidence,” said Capt. B. C. Omondi, KDF physician. “It has been a pleasure working with the locals, as well as working with our partner forces (Somali National Army, Danab, U.S. forces).”"

WASHINGTON — To keep pace with a changing battlefield, Army leaders said the service must continually adapt while maintaining a robust exercise schedule and adjusting to a challenging recruiting landscape.

In addition, the Army’s new Chief of Staff, Gen. Randy A. George said the service must continually change the force, through strengthening deterrence capabilities and bolstering interoperability with other services and multinational partners.

“We’re trying to look at [warfighting] as continuous transformation,” George said during a Center for Strategic and International Studies land power discussion Sept. 19. “What we want to do is tie all the pieces together and make sure we’re doing this in a continuous fashion.”

The Army engaged in two of the largest multi-national exercises, Super Garuda Shield in September and Australia’s Talisman Sabre in July and August. Super Garuda Shield, which concluded Sept. 13 in Indonesia, fielded participation from 14 nations including first-time participants Australia, Singapore and Japan. The event included a combined arms, live-fire and amphibious and airborne exercises.

In August more than 3,000 Soldiers completed Pershing Strike 23, a mass mobilization exercise at Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois; Fort Riley, Kansas; Camp Atterbury-Muscatatuck, Indiana; Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort McCoy, Wisconsin and other locations.

Earlier this year, the Army announced the branch’s joint, multi-domain series of experiments, Project Convergence, will no longer be an annual event. Instead, the service will adopt a more steady set of exercises throughout the year in support of the experiments. The service expanded the complexity and scope of its exercise during both Project Convergence 22 and Talisman Sabre 23, which included 12 partner nations with exercises across five states and territories.

Talisman Sabre featured a joint, mass exercise where U.S. forces and allies protected an island chain from a hostile force. In PC 22, the Army used autonomous vehicles to simulate longer distances that U.S. forces could see in future wars.

For the first time, Project Convergence included participation from the United Kingdom, Australia and the U.S. Space Force in 2022. The Army will resume its fourth iteration of Project Convergence 4 in spring 2024.

“What we found is generating that complexity and learning all the lessons from the previous years, Project Convergence really needed to take more than 12 months,” Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth said Tuesday. “So, we are not doing this now on strictly an annual cycle. And that allows us to both learn fully from last year's experience and really build the set of experimentation cases for the next year so that we get the most out of it.”

George added that the Army could explore more cost-effective options including using 3D printing drones and loitering munitions.

The ongoing Ukraine conflict has led to a greater focus on contested logistics, Wormuth said. In April, Army Futures Command announced the establishment of a Contested Logistics Cross-Functional team, which will reduce the service’s logistics footprint, use autonomous technology to extend operational reach and movement, and leverage data analytics to invest in predictive logistics capabilities.

To meet the requirements of supporting operations in the Pacific and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Army must continue to bolster recruiting, Wormuth said. In June, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks assigned the Army as the lead service for the defense of the U.S. territory of Guam.

“The Army, in terms of [operations] tempo, is about a busy now as we were during two decades of the global war on terrorism,” Wormuth said. “That’s surprising but when you think of everything we’re doing in Europe … with all that we’re doing in the Indo Pacific. We’re very, very busy.”

While the branch will likely fall short of its recruiting goals in 2023, the service has seen an uptick in the “pace” of new enlistment contracts over the last two months Wormuth said. Wormuth said that she would like the Army to be able to recruit about 60,000 new Soldiers annually to attend basic training.

“You could not fight a major war in Europe or in Asia very effectively with an Army that's smaller than 450,000,” Wormuth said. “That’s why it’s really an existential issue for us to resolve our recruiting challenges.”

George added that the service must holistically transform the way it trains and educates the Army’s people.

“People are decisive element of this and I think we’ve seen that in Ukraine with the will and the skill down at the very tactical level,” George said.

The CDE was held in Vicenza and brought together military medical professionals, planners and experts from SETAF-AF, U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Medical Command and others, alongside medical providers from Burundi, Chad, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The primary objective of the event was to work collectively to refine the fiscal year 2024 MEDREX execution strategy and discuss the framework for fiscal years 2025 to 2027.

MEDREX is a program designed and overseen by the SETAF-AF that allows medical personnel from the U.S. military and partner nation militaries to exchange medical procedures and strengthen treatment capabilities.

U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, SETAF-AF commanding general, welcomed participants and emphasized the importance of such collaborative events.

""The MEDREX program is a vitally important component of our global health engagement strategy,” Wasmund said. “The work you are doing here reflects your commitment to build strong partnerships and enhance medical capabilities that benefit the force and people in your communities.""

One of the highlights of the CDE occurred when participants from the various nations discussed the positive impacts and exchange of medical practices during FY23’s MEDREX events.

Discussions touched on addressing challenges within each country’s healthcare systems, lessons learned during the MEDREX prevously held in their country and strategies for future global health engagement. This knowledge-sharing served to create a cohesive approach to the planning and tailoring of the FY24 MEDREX plan.

“Medicine is universal, so regardless of where you come from or what language you speak medicine unites us all,” said Commander Doctor James Aggrey-Orleans, Ghana Armed Forces. Aggrey-Orleans is the MEDREX program director for Ghana and is in his fifth year serving in this capacity.

“The MEDREX program is important to Ghana because it allows our medical staff to work with our partners from the U.S. where we share and learn from each other,” he added.

During the CDE, African partners divided into small groups with their U.S. state partners and engaged in tabletop discussions to refine plans for next year’s MEDREX season. The State Partnership Program is a U.S. Department of Defense joint security cooperation program which began in 1993. Administered by the National Guard Bureau, the program links a state’s National Guard with the armed forces of a partner country in order to build long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships. Through SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-society relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic and social spheres.

The SETAF-AF CDE collaboration resulted in seven MEDREX events scheduled to execute in FY24 in Angola, Burundi, Chad, Ghana, Senegal, Rwanda and South Africa. The event concluded with a closing ceremony and served as a testament to the growing cooperation between participants in addressing healthcare challenges on the African continent.

(Photo Credit: Photo illustration) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — The Army Maternity Uniform Pilot Program, also known as “Rent the Camo,” provides eligible female Soldiers stationed in the continental Unites States with free maternity uniforms.

The pilot program is available to officers and enlisted service members in all three components of the Army.

“This program is going to help give [Soldiers] the one-stop shop they need,” said Maj. Irma Richards, Army Logistics, troop support. “By streamlining the process to where they only have one person to deal with, which is the MUPP representative, that eliminates the back and forth a female Soldier has going to several locations to obtain her uniforms.”

In June 2020, Congress passed the “Rent the Camo: Access to Maternity Wear Act,” which directed each military service to establish a pilot program for issuing and recovering maternity uniforms to pregnant service members.

The Army started their program in October 2022 with two active-duty installations and the Maryland Army National Guard before expanding to all installations in the continental U.S. in May. Pilot participation is not available overseas at this time.

The initiative is volunteer based. Once a member reports a pregnancy to their unit, the command may offer the opportunity to use the program. Then the Soldier works with her installation representative for direct online ordering.

The Army also incorporated new developmental items into the pilot; the Army physical fitness uniform – maternity, the tan maternity T-shirt, and the nursing T-shirt. These items are only available in limited quantities.

Each member receives five maternity T-shirts and three sets of the operational camouflage pattern maternity uniform. Pilot uniforms are delivered directly to the service member and will be kept during the duration of the pregnancy. The uniforms will be retained by the service member for up to 15 months from the time they are received.

The program saves Soldiers hundreds of dollars on uniforms.

Each installation representative receives feedback from the volunteers and passes that to program leadership. So far, 204 participants have volunteered.

The initial response from Soldiers has been extremely positive, Richards said.

The pilot will run until fiscal year 2025 or when the service reaches 1,200 participants in the program.

At the end of the pilot, the information gathered from volunteers will be used to create courses of action and recommendations for Army senior leaders to determine the best way forward.

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — Capt. Elizabeth Dupont, U.S. Army South G3/5 planning officer, has battled her whole life for what she wanted: her athleticism, her education and her military service. But all the challenges she faced to forge her life couldn’t compare to the trauma of losing her only child.

Despite all of the adversity she encountered, Dupont credits her family, upbringing and Hispanic culture for her ability to continue moving forward in life and persevere through it all.

A farmer's daughter

“I was born in San Juan, Texas which is near the border,” said Dupont. “My mom had me with a midwife and then crossed to Reynosa, Mexico, and that's where I was raised.”

Her mother, who had U.S. residency, crossed the border to give birth to Dupont and give her U.S. citizenship, which was a privilege her older siblings didn’t have.

The daughter of a family of farmers, Dupont is the fifth of seven siblings. She described her upbringing as humble with her mom cooking whatever vegetables they grew in their fields, and they wouldn’t often have meat.

Capt. Elizabeth Dupont, U.S. Army South G3/5 plans officer, stands in a field of vegetables on her family farm in Reynosa, Mexico, January 1, 2019. Dupont grew up in Reynosa, Mexico where her family would grow various vegetables. “I would go to school from 8 a.m. until noon, and after school and all day on the weekends I would go to work with my dad,” Dupont said. “Different vegetables, different seasons, selling the produce, we would work all year round.” (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

“So, you get what you get,” she said as a matter of fact. “My siblings and I shared beds and there was no air conditioning in our house, but we didn’t know any different.”

From a young age, Dupont said her father instilled an unwavering work ethic in her and raised her to have values that she would later come to find mirrored the Army Values.

She helped her father work the land, becoming disciplined as well as physically and mentally tough.

“I would go to school from 8 a.m. until noon, and after school and all day on the weekends I would go to work with my dad,” she said proudly. “Different vegetables, different seasons, selling the produce, we would work all year round.”

She looked at manual labor as a competition with her siblings, vying to be the best worker among them.

“Out of all of my sisters, my dad would wake me up because I wouldn’t complain,” Dupont bragged. “I mean my sisters would work, but they would get tired. I just wanted to beat them and show that I was able to do better than them in the field.”

That sparring spirit transferred over into athletics, where even after a long day of school and work, Dupont said she would find a way to play sports with her friends.

She said they play any sport they had the resources for, playing baseball or simply racing each other on foot. Of all the sports they played, she loved soccer the most.

“We would come home from work around 7 p.m., and right after that I would play soccer with my friends,” she said. “I was the one that had the ball, so they would always come look for me to play.”

Dupont said she would do everything possible to play sports or compete, like wear shorts under her school uniform just in case her friends wanted to play soccer, or even run track in her bare feet.

“My friends found out I was good at track, but most of the time I only had my uniform and girly shoes,” Dupont claimed. “So, I would just remove my shoes and run barefoot. Obviously, I was the only one who ran barefoot, but I was competing and winning!”

Moving to the U.S.

As Dupont grew older, three of her older sisters decided to move to the U.S. to attend school and work. At 14 years-old, Dupont had an opportunity to follow in their footsteps and moved to Edinburg, Texas.

“I arrived in December, in the middle of the school year, so they dropped me back one year, and then they dropped me another year because I was still learning English,” she admitted. “So, I started in eighth grade.”

Despite the two-year scholastic setback, Dupont said she took everything in stride and kept rolling along.

She became a freshman in high school and luckily had her sister, who was a senior, to help her navigate attending school in another country.

Dupont said, along with her sister's guidance, her involvement in high school sports was a huge help for her adapting to life in Texas.

“Sports got me through the challenge of adapting to American culture, because I was able to connect with other students through my athleticism,” said Dupont.

First-generation university graduate and ROTC

After overcoming the language barrier and culture difference of moving to the U.S., she decided she wanted to pursue a college education.

She saw an opportunity to pursue her passion of coaching with a degree in kinesiology and pay for her education through the U.S. Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

“I saw being an officer as simulating coaching but in a different spectrum,” explained Dupont. “I didn’t want to be a normal Soldier, but rather coach the Soldiers.”

She noted that she experienced barriers due to her race, ethnicity and accent, with other cadets criticizing her pronunciation and doubting her abilities, but when it came to the physical and mental aspect of training in the ROTC program, she said she was second to none.

Dupont admitted that her humble upbringing came as an advantage especially during the field training exercises.

“I talked to most of the other cadets and most of them said they had an easy life, but I didn’t and I’m proud of that,” remembered Dupont. “We got MREs and everyone was like, ‘what is this?’ But I just took what I could get, and when we didn’t have air conditioning, I didn’t make it a big deal’”

Dupont graduated at the top of her ROTC class and became the first in her immediate family to receive a college degree with both an associate and bachelor’s degree in kinesiology and was commissioned in August of 2018 as a second lieutenant.

She went on to attend the ordnance Basic Officer Leader Course at Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia and was stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas for her first assignment as platoon leader of the fuel and water platoon with 501st Brigade Support Battalion, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division.

Unimaginable loss

Dupont met her husband, Capt. Keith Dupont II, in October of 2018. They eventually wed and decided to start a family.

In May of 2021 their son, Keith Dupont III, was born with a strong personality from the start, said Dupont, and she felt the purest love she had ever known.

In May of 2021 their son was born with a strong personality from the start, said Dupont, and she felt the purest love she had ever known. “He was truly a baby that could light up any room with his smile and laughter,” Dupont said. “He was attentive and had a curious mind, but sleeping was not his priority for fear of missing out.” (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

“He was truly a baby that could light up any room with his smile and laughter,” Dupont said. “He was attentive and had a curious mind, but sleeping was not his priority for fear of missing out.”

But one night when he was about three months old, her son suddenly stopped breathing.

“He started having breath holding spells, and his whole body would just turn blue or purple,” said Dupont with tears in her eyes. “I knew CPR and stuff so the first time it happened I started doing it, and he just gasped for air and came back.”

Dupont and her husband brought their son to several specialists to understand and treat the symptoms as the spells worsened in severity and became more frequent.

“I started to know when he was going to have the episodes, because as soon as he would start to get bothered he would have one,” recalled Dupont. “I would already be standing by the oxygen mask.”

She said that after months searching for answers, doctors diagnosed their son with Gaucher disease.

According to the National Library of Medicine, Gaucher disease is an inherited genetic disease that affects various organ systems and tissues, including the central nervous system. There are three types which vary in the age of onset and which bodily systems they affect.

There is no cure for any of the three types, but there are treatment options for types one and three. The Dupont's son had type two, which has no treatment.

Over the course of 17 months Dupont said their son’s heart stopped 12 times, and each time they were able to bring him back with CPR.

But in January of 2023, their son passed away at 20 months old.

“When he passed we were in acceptance,” she said solemnly. “We were hurting, but we knew it was best for him to not suffer anymore.”

Coping and the future

Through all of the trauma and caring for her son, Dupont was able to complete the Captain’s Career Course and promote to the rank of captain.

She still remembers the pain of losing Keith III but is finding ways to cope like talking and spending time with her husband and seeing a behavioral health provider.

“It's quite a sensitive topic still since it just recently happened, but my husband and I pull through every day,” Dupont expressed with hope. “We kind of find that little peaceful moment with a workout or going out to see a movie.”

On top of finding peace, Dupont said that putting life into perspective is important to pushing through trauma like she has experienced.

“All of this has made me stronger in the sense of just looking at things more positively,” she said. “I'm just taking it day by day, because no matter what life throws at you, you just have to adapt, continue training and just continue going.”"

NAIROBI, Kenya – Representatives from U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) and several partners nations met with exercise planners from the Kenyan Defence Forces to conduct the mid planning event for exercise Justified Accord 2024 (JA24) Sept. 11 - 15, 2023.

JA24 brings together service members from the U.S., Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Somalia, Djibouti and the U.K. Key highlights include a multinational live-fire field training exercise, counter-improvised explosive device awareness and combined company-level assault activities.

One of the driving factors for a successful exercise is trust among partner forces. The mid planning event allows multinational planners to sit down with each other and develop that necessary trust by working through all the details together.

The training portfolio has expanded significantly from a tabletop exercise with limited participants just a few years ago to over a thousand service members from approximately 20 nations converging in Kenya for JA24.

The exercise is scheduled for late February to early March, 2024.

Each iteration, planners continue to include progressive and innovative elements into the exercise scenario, reflecting the most pertinent issues impacting East Africa.

""It's exciting that this year's exercise will include a course discussing partner nation gender focal points through the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) initiative,"" said U.S. Army Maj. Teisha Barnes, a civil military operations officer with SETAF-AF. ""In meeting with my KDF counterpart, Kenya has a significant interest in promoting the role of women in military service.""

Along with the WPS exchange, an AU staff officer course, a command post exercise and defensive cyber course will heavily engage participants in crisis response operations. The classroom-based portion takes place simultaneously with maneuver elements out in the field.

A key objective during JA24 for the KDF is to enhance their ability to conduct training in an austere environment, while integrating their joint and interagency forces. To that end, this year's exercise will be hosted at a new Kenyan venue designed at doing just that.

Working together with the Kenya U.S. Liaison Office (KUSLO), KDF planners recommended the brand new, U.S.-built Counter Insurgency, Terrorism and Stability Operations Center (CITSO) as the primary location for field training exercises at JA24.

""CITSO allows the KDF and partner forces to meet several training objectives, realizing the potential for this new institution to support peacekeeping operations in the region,"" said U.S. Air Force Maj. Scott Gregory, U.S. Embassy Nairobi KUSLO officer. ""The location is remote and has enough training area to support simultaneous maneuvers from multiple units.""

JA24 will also feature a multinational air advisory exchange where partner nations will share best practices related to crisis response. The goal is to build, sustain and expand relationships and the capabilities of partner nation air forces.

Together with U.S. Navy-led activities in Mombasa, this year’s Justified Accord has expanded into a joint multinational, combined event. The exercise is poised to increase joint readiness in preparation for an actual disaster or crisis response.

Selebi-Phikwe, Botswana — In a demonstration of international cooperation, the U.S. Army’s 2nd Security Force Assistance Brigade and the Botswana Defense Forces joined forces for rigorous training at the Mantswe a Ditschwene range here, Sep. 18, 2023. Amidst this austere environment, SFAB advisors and BDF soldiers worked to improve their proficiency at small-unit tactics.

The 2nd SFAB served as advisors for the BDF as they took part in a five-week Urban Combat Leadership Course (UCLC). This course consists of mainly small unit tactics training, with a focus on leadership development, casualty care, marksmanship, and close quarters combat training. The course culminated in the rugged terrain of Mantswe a Ditschwene range, with the BDF participants taking part in squad and platoon missions to include platoon raids and room clearing operations.

The collaboration marks yet another milestone of continued partnership for the 2nd SFAB, U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) and the BDF, a partnership founded on shared security interests and the pursuit of regional stability.

“Advising our partners at the tactical level on tasks such as room clearing, platoon raids and operations orders establishes foundational proficiencies that enable a more capable and professional force,” explained Sgt. 1st Class Stephen Patterson, 2nd SFAB maneuver advisor team sergeant.

The 2nd SFAB, charged with advising and training allies and partner forces in Africa, brought its many collective years of experience to the table. In adherence to Army tradition and doctrine, American instructors and their Botswana counterparts meticulously drilled soldiers in small-unit infantry tactics.

“We recognize the pivotal role that African nations play in promoting stability and security on the continent. Our partnership with African military forces is a testament to our shared commitment to peace and prosperity,” added Capt. Phil Cavanagh, 2nd SFAB maneuver advisor team leader.

The vast, unforgiving landscape of the Mantswe a Ditschwene Range posed unique challenges for the training unit. Soldiers had to adapt swiftly to the challenging terrain, where unpredictable weather and limited resources mirrored the conditions they might encounter in real-world missions.

""This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to strengthening alliances with our partners in Botswana. By honing their skills, we are not only preparing the BDF for any challenges they may face but also solidifying the bonds of friendship and trust between our two nations,” said Cavanagh.

""We value the enduring relationship between our countries,” said Maj. B. Selepeng, the officer-in-charge of BDF soldiers. ”This training will undoubtedly enhance the capabilities of our soldiers, allowing us to better serve our nation and contribute to regional security.""

Botswana's position in Southern Africa places it at the crossroads of various regional dynamics. It shares borders with South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, making it a critical point of contact with neighboring nations. This geographic centrality enables Botswana to monitor and respond effectively to regional security threats, including violent extremist organizations.

The 2nd SFAB is regionally aligned with U.S. Africa Command and is under the operational control of SETAF-AF. This mission in Botswana is one of many which 2nd SFAB executes on the African continent, maintaining periodic presence in up to 15 African countries. Engagements such as this underscore the importance of partnerships where global challenges require collective responses."

Daniel Mitchell, US Army Garrison Rock Island Arsenal commander and Command Sgt. Maj. James Brown, exercise with children at the Rock Island Arsenal Child Development Center in Rock Island, Illinois on April 4, 2023.

WASHINGTON — The Army has now staffed more than 70% of its total child development center work force, bringing the service closer to fulfilling its quality-of-life pledge to provide better care for military families, an Army leader said Tuesday.

More incentives for CDC workers led to the spike in the hiring of more Army childcare workers, after sitting at about 63% earlier this year, said Lt. Gen. Kevin Vereen, Army deputy chief of staff for installations.

In October 2022, Army leaders promised to bolster staffing at CDCs to improve the quality of service and to raise enrollment. Vereen said adequate childcare ranks as one of the top concerns of Soldiers and spouses.

“[CDCs] are important because we know families want to have safe, secure childcare facilities for their young ones so they don’t have to worry about what’s happening to them while they’re at work,” said Vereen, speaking during an online broadcast Tuesday.

As part of a 2022 Department of Defense mandate, the Army offered CDC employee applicants 50% off childcare fees at CDCs for their first enrolled child. Former Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston said last year that 100% of CDCs had previously operated understaffed, prompting the service to set a goal of fully staffing 90% of childcare centers.

“We are coming off a pandemic. We have a lack of workers not only across the childcare enterprise, but across almost every enterprise in the U.S.,” Vereen said. “We are in this mad push for talent. We are in the same pool of pulling for young, qualified people who want to serve long term not only in the Army, but in childcare.”

Army leaders said last year that adequate child care also plays a critical role in recruitment and retention. Additionally the service has funded 15 new CDCs over the past four years, Vereen said. Many CDCs across the Army extended their business hours in 2022.

In addition to childcare centers, the Army addressed housing concerns both for residents in the barracks and Army housing. Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth pledged to invest $1.5 billion in Army-owned housing and another $3.1 billion in privatized housing.

To gain a better understanding of housing concerns, Vereen has toured installations across the Army, most recently at posts in Alaska and at Fort Carson, Colorado, in August. There, Vereen met with junior Soldiers and commanders to gather feedback, with most of the conversations centering on housing and barracks conditions.

“Soldiers won’t complain,” Vereen said. “They’re folks on a mission. But we also know as leaders, we want to do everything we can to take care them.”

Barracks at Fort Carson will be renovated for the first time since 2000, with upgrades that include more living space for junior Soldiers and adding kitchenettes for enlisted troops.

Vereen inspected recently renovated Army housing, as well as units that still require more upgrades.

“We’ve been able to invest quite substantially in barracks,” Vereen said. “We’re not done yet. We have a strategy and this is [Wormuth’s] strategy to invest over $1.5 billion over the next 10 years in barracks.”

“I think we’re seeing the [results] and we’re excited where we’re going. We’re in the long game when it comes to infrastructure requirements.”

Finally Vereen praised the efforts of military spouses for not only supporting their military member but advancing their careers. Vereen said many spouses have taken advantage of internships and fellowships, including the 12-week paid DOD College Acquisition Internship Program.

Vereen said adding professional development to spouses’ resumes helps potential employers know that military spouses have extensive training and skills.

“It’s showcasing the talents of our spouses,” Vereen said. “They’re not a hiring risk because they’ve had multiple jobs over a small period of time and in some cases, they couldn’t control it; the Army caused a family to move.”

The Army and DOD has taken measures to help relieve spouses of hefty relicensure fees as spouses can now collect up to $1,000 in reimbursements for license and certification costs during a permanent-change-of-station move. The Army recently changed the application procedure so that spouses can more easily apply for seven different professional license and certification exam registration fees.

The service expanded its noncompetitive hiring authority for spouses with the DOD Military Spouse Employment Partnership, to connect spouses to 610 employers. More than 258,000 spouses have been hired."

WASHINGTON — On a summer morning in 2022, Kaileen Santos met with her supervisors in a Pentagon office. The staff sergeant considered leaving the Army to pursue a career in law enforcement or work for the government.

Maj. Josefina Martinez and Lt. Col. Izabella Lundy saw her as a Soldier who could innovate and thrive in challenging environments, and they didn’t want to let her go, so they encouraged her to apply for the Army’s Green to Gold Program, an initiative that provides enlisted Soldiers a means to earn a college degree and an officer’s commission while remaining in the Army.

“I [saw] the strength and motivation to do more for herself and her daughter,” Martinez said.

Santos applied for the scholarship with Martinez and Lundy’s encouragement and was accepted into the Green to Gold Program in December 2022.

Santos, the first member of her family to join the armed forces, will study health systems management at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte this fall. She will continue to receive her current pay, a stipend, basic allowance for housing and basic allowance for subsistence, which will help pay for tuition, textbooks and rent. Her Post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefits she is saving for her daughter’s education.

Santos will attend ROTC during the school year and a cadet summer camp between her junior and senior year.

“I never thought I'd get this chance or opportunity,” she said. “The changes that it’s going to make in my life — in my daughter’s life — it’s such a great feeling.”

Hometown hard knocks

Santos’ soft-spoken demeanor masks a tough interior from growing up in a rough neighborhood in southern Massachusetts.

New Bedford, a small coastal city settled on the Acushnet River along Massachusetts’ south coast, attracts tourists for its architecture and colonial history. But its gothic and federal-style buildings and the charming ambiance of its downtown hide a dark turmoil in its lower-income neighborhoods.

The town grew into a hotbed for gang activity, with 11 known street gangs, including the Latin Kings. In 2021 the city reported that 20% of its residents lived below the poverty line, with more than 80% classified as economically disadvantaged.

Youth in New Bedford often become addicted to narcotics, and some turn to prostitution.

“You walk down the street, and you see girls getting sold,” she said.

Santos’ mother Maria, a Honduran immigrant from San Pedro Sula, settled in New Bedford in the early 2000s. Santos lived with six siblings in the family’s modest house on the city’s west side. Her mother ran a Spanish grocery store which she has owned for 20 years.

Some of her classmates fell into a life of crime or joined a gang. One of her peers became pregnant at 12 years old. Santos saw several of her friends fall into the web of substance abuse, and many were absent from school. A male friend who fell into depression later committed suicide.

Santos admitted she didn’t focus on academics as a teen.

“I didn't really see a purpose in school when I was 18,” she said. “I was … naive and immature.”

Fortunately, Santos met retired Lt. Col. Kevin McGovern, an advisor at her school’s JROTC program. McGovern acted as a mentor not only to Santos but to her siblings. He saw potential in Santos and encouraged her to enlist in the Army and leave New Bedford.

“He tried to keep me on the straight and narrow,” Santos said. “He always kept an eye on me [and] encouraged me to do better.”

After graduating from New Bedford High School in 2012, Santos saw the Army as a path out of her hometown.

Life change

Santos enlisted and received a job as a human resources specialist, and the Army assigned her to Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt, Germany. She found Schweinfurt to be a beautiful, vibrant city and a stark change from her life in New Bedford.

“It really opened my mind and showed me that there’s more to life out there,” she said.

An assignment at Fort Knox, Kentucky, followed her tour in Germany, where Santos met and married her daughter’s father. At Fort Knox, she weathered the most tumultuous period of her life from 2015 to 2016, when she went through a divorce and became a single mother.

Santos eventually adapted to raising her daughter alone while thriving as a Soldier. She had successful stints at Fort Meade, Maryland, as a drill instructor, and then in her current position at Army headquarters.

Santos took college courses sporadically in her first years in the Army, but at Fort Meade, 1st Sgt. James McKay encouraged her to dedicate herself fully to her studies. She later began exploring leadership opportunities, including warrant officer options and commissioning opportunities.

Becoming a mother also changed her, and she became fiercely protective of her daughter, a seven-year-old who loves swimming, karate and gymnastics. Santos even became PTA president at her daughter’s school.

She also excelled in her duties as a Soldier. At Fort Meade, her commander selected her to compete in the 53rd Signal Battalion’s Best Warrior Competition in October 2018.

For the competition Santos ran kettle bell runs, performed simulated first aid and competed against five male counterparts in wooded areas north of Baltimore.

Santos was selected by the Department of the Army for special duty as a drill sergeant at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, before her assignment at the Pentagon.

“The Army’s definitely helped me find direction in life,” Santos said. “It’s always given me a goal to work towards.”

Under her wing

In her first 11 years in the Army, Martinez made a name for herself as an energetic NCO, climbing through the enlisted ranks quickly.

Martinez and Santos’ careers converged in Washington in 2021, when Martinez was the assistant executive officer for Director of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, and Santos served as the executive assistant and human resources NCO.

Martinez saw a bit of herself in Santos during their time at the Pentagon. Like Santos, Martinez left home at 18 and eventually landed a position as a senator’s office manager on Capitol Hill. But later, Martinez divorced her husband and had to adopt to life as a single mother.

Martinez enlisted in the Army in 1995, eventually finding her niche as a career counselor. Then she reached a crossroads in her career. Martinez found she adapted well to the Army structure and lifestyle, but decided she could better serve the Army, and care for her family, as an officer. She commissioned in 2006.

Now in her 50s, Martinez took the younger Santos under her wing, teaching her the importance of working collectively in the Office of the Director of Army Staff.

Santos learned quickly. Working in the same building as the Army’s top general officers didn’t faze her, and she became a trusted assistant of Piatt. Santos never let her career aspirations interfere with her role at Army headquarters, often redoubling her efforts after taking time off.

“She just instinctively knew what she was doing,” Martinez said. “She was always polite; she was just ahead of the game.”

Santos saw how the bonds she formed with her mentors — officers and senior NCOs — influenced her career and her life. She remembered how Capt. Jason Selby, company commander, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 19th Engineer Battalion, shielded her from unnecessary hardships at Fort Knox.

And she recalled the efforts of Martinez and Lundy to encourage her to apply for the Green to Gold Program. She wants to do the same for another Soldier and hopes to one day become a company commander.

“Staff. Sgt. Santos is a dedicated Soldier who is talented and committed to service in the Army,” Piatt said. “She is example of selfless service, and it has been a pleasure having her serve on my team.”

“[Santos’] accomplishments and potential to lead our Soldiers has risen to the level that is characteristic of a commissioned officer,” said Deputy Undersecretary of the Army Mario Diaz, a former Army officer and West Point graduate. “I am confident she will continue to be successful.”

FORT BUCHANAN, PUERTO RICO- Service members, civilians, and family members conducted a road march around the perimeter road here on Sept. 9 as part of the Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, to honor the 9/11 victims by carrying non-perishable food on their rucksacks.

""This anniversary also serves as an opportunity to encourage citizens to pay tribute to the victims by participating in good deeds, contributing to food drives, helping refurbish homes in their communities, or doing something to support and honor veterans, soldiers, military families, and first responders. It is a time to remember by serving,"" said Col. Charles N. Moulton, Commander of Fort Buchanan, the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean region.

Before departing for the road march, Fort Buchanan Department of Emergency Services members conducted a bell ringing ceremony to honor the first responders and how their courage embodies the spirit and resilience of our nation.

Brig. Gen. Carlos Torres-Febus, Puerto Rico’s National Guard Land Component Commander, led the Puerto Rico National Guard formation during the road march.

""9/11 will live in our memories forever. However, some soldiers in this formation were very young that day. Others were not even born. That is why we cannot let this anniversary pass without reflecting on and teaching our children about what happened that fateful day and the freedom we still enjoy despite the terrorists' efforts,"" said Brig. Gen. Torres-Febus before the road march started.

At the end of the 4-mile road march, the service members quickly emptied their rucksacks into pre-established containers. Quickly, Maj. Joseph Okpe, and Staff Sgt. Juan Merced, from the Fort Buchanan Religious Support Office, led a convoy to deliver the recollected food to the Puerto Rico Food Bank in Carolina.

""This is a great way to honor the spirit of service of all those victims of 9/11. That is what we are doing here, remembering their sacrifice, and serving others,"" said Maj. Okpe.

According to the Puerto Rico Food Bank officials, the food collected during the road march will make a huge difference to many local families.

""You have just delivered over 2,600 pounds of food, equivalent to over 2,200 servings, that will feed over 177 families from Puerto Rico for a week. Thank you to the military personnel, civilians, and families at Fort Buchanan for this great donation,"" said Mari Jo Laborde, Executive Director of Puerto Rico Food Bank.

According to the Puerto Rico Statistics Institute, food insecurity is a social problem in Puerto Rico that prevails in many sectors of the population.

As the Department of the Army's center of gravity in the region, Fort Buchanan serves a diverse military community comprised of approximately 15,000 Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard soldiers, Marine Corps Reserve, and the Navy's Operational Support Center personnel."

CASERMA EDERLE, VICENZA, Italy –The Vicenza Health Clinic had the honor of hosting U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Raymond Scott Dingle on Sept. 12, 2023 for this second visit to Italy since taking command of U.S. Army Medical Command in 2020. Dingle, the 45th U.S. Army Surgeon General, and commanding general, U.S. Army Medical Command, toured the clinic and recognized exception staff during his visit.

The primary focus of his visit was to underscore the importance of teamwork within the medical community, particularly in light of the ongoing transition of medical treatment facilities from MEDCOM to Defense Health Agency, and the roll out of MHS Genesis, the military’s new U.S. military’s new electronic health record system.

In an interview with Ashleigh Fields in July, Dingle said, “The greatest lesson that I learned through my military journey has been the importance of teamwork. The success of any individual, organization, or team is based upon the collective synergy of them working together or with others.”

Dingle took a personal interest in addressing the staff's concerns about the transition process. He highlighted the close partnership between the Defense Health Agency and MEDCOM. The transfer of Army hospitals to the DHA is designed to create a more integrated health care system, improve patient outcomes, and enable the readiness of the Army to support the Joint Force. Teamwork is vital to provide excellent healthcare to our servicemen and women.

Dingle also took the opportunity to recognize excellence at the VHC. He issued well-deserved coins to both Soldiers and civilians, in acknowledgment of their outstanding contributions.

Mr. Del’Antony Campbell, patient advocate at the Army Health Care Center Vicenza, was instrumental in organizing Dingle’s latest visit, having been present during the previous visit in 2021. With Dingle's upcoming retirement, Campbell was able to express his gratitude before the departure.

“We extend our heartfelt thanks to Lt. Gen. Dingle for his invaluable service and dedication to the U.S. Army medical community,” said Campbell. “As he embarks on his well-deserved retirement, we wish him the very best in all his future endeavors.”

206,ALFS 24 planning underway in Zambia,https://www.army.mil/article/270300/alfs_24_planning_underway_in_zambia,"Military planners for U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), visited several sites in Zambia Sep 18-22, 2023, for the African Land Forces Summit (ALFS) Initial Planning Event. The planning event is part of ongoing preparation for ALFS 24, scheduled for April 2024.

ALFS is a weeklong Chief of Staff of the Army event that hosts leaders from more than forty African countries for training and partnership-building with U.S. Army leaders. Last year ALFS took place in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. ALFS 24 marks the return of ALFS to southern Africa for the first time since 2019 when the event was held in Botswana.

The initial planning event sets the stage for SETAF-AF and Zambian planners to work together to build the event schedule, develop the ALFS 24 theme, and invite experts and leaders to present topics. In the months leading up to ALFS, planners will continue to meet with Zambian officials and businesses to tour potential venues, culturally significant locations, and other facilities to select locations for the training event. Planners gather information such as costs, building capacity, security, and connectivity capability.

International military engagements branch chief for SETAF-AF, Lt. Col. Robert Miller, is the lead planner for ALFS 24. Miller said that the event is the second of four planning meetings in Zambia to prepare for the summit. The first visit, the Pre-deployment Site Survey, took place in June.

""We are excited to have ALFS 24 in Zambia,” said Miller. “We were able to spend some time with our Zambian counterparts at ALFS 23 in Abidjan, and that allowed us to get to know our Zambian partners and start the planning process for ALFS 24.”

“Now that we are here on the ground in Zambia with our host partners, we are getting into the finite detailed planning for ALFS 24,” said Miller. “I know this is going to be a fantastic event.”

ALFS is hosted annually by SETAF-AF to bring together military leaders from the U.S. and Africa to discuss capabilities, build partnerships through face-to-face interaction, and discuss issues the partner forces face on the African continent.

207,Under Secretary says Army will build on momentum of modernization efforts,https://www.army.mil/article/269832/under_secretary_says_army_will_build_on_momentum_of_modernization_efforts,"Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo discusses Army modernization priorities during the 2023 Defense News Conference in Arlington, Virginia on September 6, 2023. (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON ­­— Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo said that the Army has taken the next steps in the development of its signature modernization programs. While he didn't say whether the service could fulfill its pledge to deliver 24 of its priority systems in the hands of Soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2023, he added that the service has achieved significant momentum in reaching its goals.

“Ultimately, we’ll get to a point where we can see everything fully fielded,” said Camarillo, speaking during a conference in Arlington, Virginia on the afternoon of September 6. “We have an incredible track record of success … I really think we’re seeing a bit of a renaissance in terms of our ability to stick the landing on these programs.”

Camarillo said the service currently has entered the initial, low-rate production phase of the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle; formerly known as the Mobile Protected Fire Vehicle. The M10 Booker will help light combat forces identify enemy weapons systems from farther distances and provide greater survivability for Soldiers in combat brigades.

The Army awarded the $13 million contract for the M10 Booker to Indianapolis manufacturer Allison Transmission. The branch also announced Wednesday that it will move forward with the M1E3 Abrams Main Battle Tank modernization program which will be more agile and lethal than the previous Abrams tank model. Soldier feedback and years of testing contributed to the development of the M1E3.

In August, the Army announced that it awarded two contracts for the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle, formerly known as the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle. The agreement with Michigan-based companies American Rheinmetall Vehicles and General Dynamics Land Systems includes the design and prototype phases of the five-phase program. The XM30, which will eventually replace the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, provides greater maneuverability and survivability than the Bradleys.

In June, the Army successfully fired a Tomahawk missile from its mid-range capability system, showcasing the full operational capability of the MRC.

Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo said that Army Futures Command has made significant strides in changing requirements to achieve rapid prototyping for the Army's priority modernization programs. (Photo Credit: Screenshot image) VIEW ORIGINAL

As leaders build toward the Army of 2030, AFC commander Gen. Jim Rainey has also worked towards setting the foundation for the Army of 2040. Army leaders said in March that the service must foster a greater understanding of future threats and technological change to prepare for that initiative. Among those efforts will be exploring how artificial intelligence and robotics can be incorporated into the service’s infantry and armored brigade combat teams on the future battlefield.

During last year’s Project Convergence, the Army’s series of joint multi-domain experiments, participants used air and ground robotic vehicles during experiments at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. In one of the tests, engineers flew a pilotless UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter.

“We’re looking at our operating concept,” Camarillo said. “How does that guide and frame our thinking about how our units are designed and the capabilities they’ll employ in the future battle space? One example that [Rainey] talked a lot about is human and machine integration. How do we incorporate them more organically in ways that we haven’t quite thought of or experimented with?”

Camarillo added that AFC has explored how long-range precision fires, the Army’s top modernization priority, impacts requirements for Soldier protection in the future. He said that AFC will continue to search for ways to incorporate autonomous systems, including the Autonomous Vehicle Transport System. This system will allow U.S. forces to maintain a higher operational tempo while providing greater force protection and sustainment.

Army engineers at the Aviation and Missile Center at Redstone, Alabama built the Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher to navigate on rough terrain. The 36,000-pound vehicle can be operated remotely and will provide Soldiers added firepower and longer sustainment on the battlefield.

The Army plans on expanding the scope and scale in the 2024 iteration of Project Convergence. During the last series in October 2022, the Army included participation from allies Australia and the United Kingdom and employed multi-domain operations over greater distances than the previous iteration.

Earlier this year, Army Futures Command announced that it would schedule more experiments throughout the year instead of hosting a series of demonstrations once annually. The Army will host Project Convergence 4 in spring 2024.

Camarillo praised the efforts of Rainey, who has led the Army’s modernization efforts since succeeding acting AFC commander Lt. Gen. James Richardson in October 2022, as well as the progress of AFC.

“We’ve begun to develop momentum on the modernization side,” Camarillo said. “Whether it's programs that have gone from prototyping to production, or it's systems that are very quickly developing prototypes that we can put them in the hands of Soldiers.

“I give AFC a lot of credit for finding ways to work very effectively with the program executive offices … changing the requirements process … and enabling us to begin that rapid prototyping.”

The Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa held their annual 9/11 memorial ceremony to commemorate the lives lost during the tragedy and highlight the importance of keeping the memory of 9/11 alive on Sept. 11, 2023 at Camp Lemonnier.

More than 100 service members from across Camp Lemonnier stood in formation to pay tribute. Distinguished guests including Djibouti Mayor Said D. Muhommud and Mario Fernandez, U.S. Chargé D’Affaires to Djibouti, were also in attendance.

“We must never forget the legacy of that September day,” said U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Jami Shawley, CJTF-HOA commanding general. “And let us hope that the legacy of that day is of a world drawn together in a common cause for freedom and for peace.”

CJTF-HOA service members who lived in New York during the attacks were invited to speak about their experience of the attacks and the impact it made on their lives.

U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Tommy Trejo, CJTF-HOA communications senior enlisted leader, was a student in middle school when the Twin Towers fell. On that day he was inspired to join the military and his calling led him to eventually enlist in the New York National Guard in 2007.

Since the he’s supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and now CJTF-HOA, which was established in October 2002 to counter transnational terrorist threats in the Horn of Africa.

“This task force was a direct result of the September 11th attacks and I’m proud to be serving here as not only a soldier, but as a New Yorker,” said Trejo.

In August 2001, a month before the attacks, U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Matthew Blake, CJTF-HOA director of human intelligence and counterintelligence, got a job as a law enforcement officer in the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York City. When he first heard about the attacks, Blake was a firearms instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia over 800 miles away from his hometown.

“I'll never forget. I was out on the range when I got my first alert text. My initial thought was it was probably just some young pilot who accidentally clipped the tower trying to show off. After a couple of minutes my alert beeper went off again. That’s when I realized our country was under attack,” said Blake.

His initial reaction, like millions from around the nation and the world, was one of shock. Upon arriving home Blake, a fifth-generation New Yorker, saw law enforcement, civilians, and service members come together like he’d never experienced before.

“Every person working out there remembers the sights, the smells, the sounds. But we also remember the resilience of our New Yorkers, of our American citizens, and of our partners and allies from around the world,” said Blake.

Twenty years removed from the attacks this unity is still present. Blake made it his personal goal to do his part in never allowing the memory of 9/11 to die out, this goal has led him to CJTF-HOA.

“Here today, we have Americans from all parts of our beloved country, we have our partners and allies from many parts of the world, and no doubt we have folks standing among us that were not even born when 9/11 happened,” said Blake. “Together we stand here in solidarity, all doing our small part in never forgetting.”"

KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany - The 7th Mission Support Command bid farewell to the 361st Civil Affairs Brigade and welcomed the 163rd Regional Support Group during a combined ceremony, Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023 at Daenner Kaserne, Kaiserslautern, Germany.

“Today is special because we are a part of history,"" said Brig. Gen. Karen Monday - Gresham, the 7th MSC commander. ""After years of faithful and successful service, we bid a fond farewell to the 361st Civil Affairs Brigade.""

Since the unit's reactivation in Sept. 2010, the 361st maintained a role as the only forward-stationed civil affairs element in the Reserve component, provided units in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (2012,) and supported dozens of U.S. Army Europe and Africa exercises, engaging with NATO Allies and partners.

Monday - Gresham welcomed the command team and the newly activated 163rd Regional Support Group. ""We are also fortunate to stand up a new brigade, the 163rd Regional Support Group,” she said.

Greater than two-thirds of the sustainment resources and capabilities for the total Army reside in the Army Reserve. The unit, headquartered at Camp Normandy, Grafenwoehr, Germany, is responsible for the management of sustainment and logistics assets in support of U.S. Army Europe - Africa missions in the region.

Units activating with the 163rd RSG include the 97th Chemical Battalion, the 729th Transportation Battalion, and the 783rd Military Police Battalion.

The 7th MSC is the only forward-headquartered U.S. Army Reserve command in Europe. Comprised of 25 units across Germany and Italy, the 7th provides ready, capable, units of action in support of U.S. Army Europe and Africa missions throughout the theater.

FORT BUCHANAN, PUERTO RICO- Members of Fort Buchanan's Directorate of Emergency Services and the U.S. Army Reserve-Puerto Rico 1st Mission Support Command conducted an active terrorist threat training exercise on Aug 30 here.

The exercise evaluated the installation's response to an active shooter situation at the 1st Mission Support Command headquarters, and a suspicious package at the Army and Airforce Exchange System. The exercise aimed to sustain the high level of readiness of emergency and safety personnel assigned to the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean.

Members of the Homeland Security Investigations agency participated in the exercise as advisors.

During the exercise, residents and visitors on and near Fort Buchanan heard warnings over the ""giant voice"" system, sirens, and detonations and saw emergency response vehicles and personnel in action.

""An active shooter attack can occur anywhere, and we must all be prepared. We all play a vital role in preventing these situations,"" said Hector Herrera, Army Counterterrorism Operations Specialist at Fort Buchanan.

The military command increased the Force Protection Condition Level (FPCON) to Delta level as part of the drill.

There are five levels of FPCON: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. The levels increase from Normal's lowest condition to Delta's highest and most restrictive condition. FPCON Delta led to the closure of all gates for a period of time.

""It is critical for the Fort Buchanan community to participate in exercises like this Antiterrorism drill to ensure we are prepared for any scenario at the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean. We hope it never happens, but we are prepared to deal with it quickly if it does. We thank every member of the Fort Buchanan community and the surrounding communities for their patience during the event,"" said Col. Charles N. Moulton, commander of Fort Buchanan.

As the Department of the Army's center of gravity in the region, Fort Buchanan serves a diverse military community comprised of approximately 15,000 Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard soldiers, Marine Corps Reserve, and the Navy's Operational Support Center personnel.

The installation also offers critical services to the civilian population of the Department of Defense, veterans, retirees, and their families, as well as more than 30 federal agencies located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

Taylor, a team leader assigned to Troop D (Air), 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 1st Infantry Division, near the hamlet of Ap Go Cong, Republic of Vietnam, June 18, 1968.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden presented Larry Taylor, a Vietnam War Army helicopter pilot, with the Medal of Honor during a ceremony at the White House Sept. 5, 2023.

The president upgraded the Silver Star award that Taylor originally received for his heroic actions rescuing a four-person patrol team in 1968.

“When duty called, Larry did everything to answer,” Biden said. “Because of that, he rewrote the fate of four families for generations to come. That’s valor. That’s our nation at its very best.”

Taylor, a Chattanooga, Tennessee native, joined the Army to continue his family’s tradition of military service. His great-great-grandfather fought in the Civil War; his great-uncle fought in World War I; and his father and uncles fought in World War II.

He commissioned through the Army Reserve Officer Training Program at the University of Tennessee in 1966. He volunteered as an armor officer before quickly switching to be a pilot, flying some of the Army’s first AH-1G Cobra attack helicopters.

After qualifying as an Army aviator, he was sent to Vietnam in August 1967 to serve with D Troop (Air), 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 1st Infantry Division. A distress call came into his unit late at night, June 18, 1968. A long-range reconnaissance patrol team of four Soldiers was surrounded and in danger of being overrun.

Taylor and his co-pilot had two minutes to fire up their Cobra and head out into the darkness. They only knew the general direction of the team. They were unable use the lights on the helicopter because they would give away their position and the position of the patrol team.

“I didn’t think I was ever going to find them,” Taylor recalled.

The reconnaissance team was hunkered down behind a cart path. They were on a mission in southern Vietnam to track North Vietnamese troop movement when they noticed a large enemy force positioned around them. They tried to escape the same way they came but were quickly surrounded.

Their only option was to take cover and prepare for the fight they knew was coming, said Dave Hill, rear gunner on the patrol team.

The team radioed for air support, which arrived not long after. As Taylor and his co-pilot flew overhead, they made radio contact with the men on the ground.

Taylor asked the patrol team to mark their location with flares so he and another Cobra crew could differentiate them from the enemy.

“We knew we would be discovered at some point because we were surrounded,” Hill said. “We popped the flares, and all hell broke loose.”

Bullets and rocket-propelled grenades started flying, some hitting the embankment in front of the Soldiers while others flew over their heads. Seeing enemy muzzle fire, the two Cobra gunships started making attack runs using their mini-guns and aerial rockets. According to reports, both helicopters took on intense ground fire from the enemy.

Each member of the ground patrol team engaged the enemy force with more than 600 rounds of ammunition, claymore mines and grenades. The grenadier of the unit had 75 rounds for the M-79 grenade launcher. After 35 minutes of fighting, they were nearly tapped out.

Both Cobras were close to being out of ammunition as well and running low on fuel. Thinking quickly, Taylor radioed the patrol team with a rescue plan.

He told the other gunship to fire its remaining rounds along the eastern flank of the patrol team. He would fire his remaining rounds along the western flank and then use his landing lights to draw the enemy’s attention.

He told the patrol team to reposition their claymore mines to the northeast and southeast. When the two Cobras made their attack runs, Taylor instructed the reconnaissance team to fire the mines and run to the nearby rice paddy clearing.

“That will give 'Charlie' something to think about,” Taylor said recalling his plan.

They all executed, and the patrol team met Taylor’s helicopter at the extraction point. The gunship was a two-seat aircraft with no room for passengers. It touched down under intense fire, and the Soldiers climbed under the helicopter onto the rocket-pods and landing skids.

Taylor immediately took off and got the helicopter out of firing range. He then dropped the patrol team off at a nearby safe location. Before the Cobra took off again for its return flight to base, the four Soldiers looked up at Taylor and all saluted.

“[Taylor’s] innovation was well beyond the call [of duty], as was his courage,” Hill said. Asked what chance of survival the team had without Taylor’s actions, Hill responded empathically, “absolutely zero.”

Taylor served in Vietnam until August 1968, flying more than 2,000 combat missions and taking enemy fire 340 times. It wasn’t easy but throughout the war Taylor never lost a man, he said.

“You do whatever you can to save the lives of the people you’re trying to rescue,” he explained. “Today, I’ve become lifelong friends with several of these people.”

Hill is now one of those people. Having not seen each other since that fateful night in Vietnam, they finally met at a long-range reconnaissance patrol reunion in 1999. They’ve been friends ever since and take turns attending their respective unit reunions.

The eight soldiers involved in the battle received several awards, including a few Silver Stars. Hill and a several others thought Taylor had done more to distinguish himself that night.

""Larry not only did his job, he went way above and beyond his duty at great risk of life,” Hill said. ""It was a failure at the time to adequately recognize his valor, his courage, his dedication, and we were determined to turn that around.""

The group contacted a congressman in Tennessee and started the process for nominating Taylor for the Medal of Honor. After more than seven years of work, they finally proved, with witness statements not previously seen, that Taylor deserved the military’s highest honor for valor.

“That’s the ultimate,” Taylor said of receiving the Medal of Honor. “You can’t get any better than that. I’m thankful that we were able to get the [Soldiers] out that night, and all four of them became lifelong friends.”

During his time in the Army, Taylor received more than 50 combat decorations, including the Silver Star, 43 Air Medals, a Bronze Star and two Distinguished Flying Crosses. He finished his military career as a captain and returned home to Tennessee where he has lived ever since.

A Patriot’s Day parade is scheduled in Chattanooga to honor him, Sept. 17, 2023.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Army Special Operations Command welcomed Ellsworth “Al” Johnson, a 100-year-old World War II Army veteran, into the community by presenting him with an Army Special Forces’ tab and a Green Beret during a ceremony at an assisted living center in Zeeland, Michigan, Sept. 1.

Johnson was recognized for his contributions during the war while serving in an Office of Strategic Services’ operational group, a precursor to Army Special Operations, and became eligible for the honor after an update to the Army awards regulation in 2019.

“We honor Mr. Johnson today as we look back at our roots and legacy in Special Operations,” said Brig. Gen. Lawrence Ferguson, 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) commanding general. “We talk a lot about people and warfighting in the Army, and when you look at Mr. Johnson and his time, it’s clear to see that although many years have passed, those two concepts are still with us today.”

During WWII, the Office of Strategic Services was an intelligence agency for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The command formed several small self-sufficient groups composed primarily of Soldiers that would enter enemy territory to perform missions and gather intelligence.

Johnson, an Army medic, volunteered to join the command and was placed in the French operational group following training. His 25-man team parachuted into France behind enemy lines in August 1944, just prior to the Allied invasion of southern France.

Their mission was to capture a hydroelectric plant and harass the German army while gathering intelligence for the unit’s headquarters in London. The team, given the code name “Patrick,"" spent nearly a month in France working with a French underground group.

The unit successfully captured the plant and the nearby town of Eguzon. They continued to torment the German army as it retreated through southern France.

Following this tour, Johnson volunteered to serve in China where he provided medical care and trained Chinese troops in airborne capabilities. He served as an advisor to a Chinese commando unit and parachuted with them during an attack against a Japanese-held town.

Johnson survived the battle and returned home to Michigan at the end of the war in 1945. The Office of Strategic Services disbanded that October.

“[Johnson] laid the groundwork for what we are today,” said Maj. Gen. Patrick Roberson, U.S. Army Special Operations Command deputy commanding general. “Everything that he did in 1944 — we model ourselves on in our training and the operations that we conduct. It’s our origin story.”

During the Korean War, U.S. Army leaders wanted to create an unconventional warfare unit to deal with guerrilla forces. Rather than start from scratch, they used the operational groups of the OSS from WWII as a model for the new unit structure.

This structure carried over in the formation of Army Special Forces under the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Division in 1952.

Surrounded by his extended family, Johnson was honored nearly two months after his 100th birthday.

“I’m overcome by the emotion but proud to be here today,” he said.

UNDISCLOSED LOCATION, AFRICA– Dump trucks kick up bright orange soil as they rumble past termite mounds and low-lying shrubs. Dust plumes rise from an excavator as it fills up a long line of trucks. Some of the dirt will fill up barriers, other dirt will be used to fortify targets on a training range, and still, more of it is being relocated to provide drainage for rain.

After a long day, the Soldiers responsible for these tasks are covered in the same orange dust that marks their trucks, a testament to their hard work. They try their best not to track it into their tent, letting the wind carry the orange off their boots and wet wipes to knock the dirt off their skin.

The Soldiers are part of the 294th Engineer Support Company, Missouri National Guard, currently providing support to the Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa.

“If they need a new road cleared out, then we’re there. If they need some [barriers] to be built, then we got it,” said Spc. Jared Alverson, 294th ESC horizontal construction specialist. “Our responsibility here is just to be ready and get jobs done fast while being as available as possible for the larger mission.”

The 294th ESC provides construction and maintenance capabilities to outstations and remote locations across the continent, giving friendly forces a launching point wherever it may be needed.

Aircraft swiftly and discreetly drop 294th ESC Soldiers off at their target location with their tools and supplies, and then the teams get to work. Their horizontal construction team moves dirt and rocks to flatten areas in preparation for structure specialists. They can also build up barriers and control points to begin securing a location.

“We can do various earth-moving operations, such as extending outposts and building new structures,” said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Caleb Cantrell, 294th ESC horizontal team noncommissioned officer in charge of projects.

The Soldiers possess a wide range of skills, encompassing everything from electrical technicians to plumbers to heavy equipment operators. Many maintain active careers in carpentry or as skilled tradesmen in their civilian capability, bringing outside experience and skills to the mission. Depending on the needs of the location, they could be driving forklifts, filling sandbags, or building guard towers.

The ability to construct and maintain infrastructure at forward operating locations is critical to the success of CJTF-HOA operations in the Horn of Africa, where security may be required to support the goals of African partners and friendly forces.

“This is the hardest working crew I’ve ever had the pleasure of serving with over here,” said Cantrell. “Some days are 18-hour days, but they’re still willing to go the extra mile.”"

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait – United States Army Reserve unit, 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command, and U.S. Army unit, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command completed a successful handover of responsibilities that culminated with a Transfer of Authority ceremony following a transition period known as relief in place at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, on Sep. 2, 2023.

1st Theater Sustainment Command deputy commanding general, Brig. Gen. Maria A. Juarez, along with 143d ESC Command Sgt. Maj. Ricardo N. Saunders, officially cased the command colors and transferred the unit’s mission to the 13th ACSC. The color casing ceremony signifies the end of the unit’s mission to provide sustainment support for Operation Spartan Shield in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.

As Juarez and Saunders cased the 143d command colors, 143d ESC Higher Headquarters Company (HHC) command team, Capt. Marlena Janes and 1st Sgt. Jacob Webb, simultaneously cased the company guidon.

Upon the 143d ESC command team’s completion of casing its respective colors and guidon, the incoming 13th ACSC command team uncased the colors and guidon for their command.

In attendance were distinguished guests, the commanding general of 1st Theater Sustainment Command, Brig. Gen. Eric P. Shirley; senior enlisted advisor to 1TSC Command Sgt. Major Albert J. Richardson, Jr., U.S. Embassy- Kuwait, Charge d' Affaires James Holtsnider, Task Force Spartan command team, and the Area Support Group – Kuwait command team.

Shirley, reviewing officer of the ceremony, opened with congratulatory remarks to Juarez and the 143d ESC “Just as the 143d ESC epitomizes the continued and vital contributions of Army Reserve forces in support of our Warfighters in theater, the incoming 13th ACSC represents that seamless integration between our components. No longer is there any distinction drawn between Active, Guard and Reserve Soldiers when it comes to supporting the mission.”

Following the commanding general’s remarks, Juarez rose to speak. “In this ever-changing theater, our role as a sustainment force requires that we find a way to support the Warfighter, regardless of terrain or obstacles, wherever they operate. This is absolutely a ‘no fail’ mission,” she stated.

Juarez spoke of the many accomplishments of the 143d ESC and thanked each section for their resilience, commitment, and unwavering support in the mission's success.

13th ACSC commanding general, Brig. Gen. Sean P. Davis ended the ceremony with acknowledgments, “We have been training for this for over a year. I have the utmost confidence in our Soldiers’ abilities to excel during this mission.” He continued, “This was the best RIP/TOA I have seen in over 20 years, thanks to the 143d.”

The 13th ACSC, based in Ft. Cavazos, Texas, enables the III Armored Corps by serving as the primary sustainment headquarters for all sustainment efforts. On order, the 13th ACSC is prepared to deploy and provide command and control of multinational and joint theater distribution, theater opening, and reception, staging, and onward movement in a multi-domain battlefield in support of the full range of military operations. This will be the 13th ACSC’s third rotation in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility since 2014.

1st Theater Sustainment Command is America’s only permanently deployed Sustainment Command in the Middle East that works alongside host nation allies and regional security partners to provide Army, Joint, and multinational sustainment solutions in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to deliver predictive and precise joint logistics, human resources, finance, health service support, and contracting capabilities to set and sustain the theater for multi-domain operations in competition or crisis."

Soldiers endure discomfort and pain for many reasons. They may do so as part of their wartime duties or in training. Everyone reaches a point where they choose to quit or drive on. Military awards – particularly badges – are earned, not given. Each course or task demands some level of sacrifice.

Many service members particularly value the chance to earn a foreign award. No badge is worn by as many U.S. servicemembers though as the German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge – GAFPB.

My introduction to the badge came as a 19-year-old draftee serving in the German Air Force, Luftwaffe, after graduating from Berlin’s John F. Kennedy School. This opportunity presented itself to me courtesy of my German mother. My American father was a U.S. Army JAG officer attached to the U.S. embassy in Germany at the time. I recall that the sewed-on GAFPBs adorning my basic training instructor’s uniforms served as a symbol of their competence and professionalism. Everyone in my unit wanted a chance to prove themselves and receive the badge.

My understanding of this particular award would evolve. I would earn, and then encounter, this badge throughout my career.

The badge in German is formally called the, “Abzeichen für besondere Leistungen im Truppendienst.” This term more accurately translates as, “award for special performance in military service.” In U.S. military service, we refer to it as the German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge, but it is officially the German Armed Forces Efficiency Badge.

Army Regulation 600-8-22, Military Awards, stipulates that foreign decorations will only be presented by a designated representative from the awarding nation. As such we work with our German partners as part of each event, and they generate and sign award certificates. Army Regulation 600-8-22 also includes the German Armed Forces Efficiency Badge as a named foreign badge specifically authorized for acceptance and wear by both enlisted personnel and officers.

A U.S. Army commander may also approve the wear of the foreign badge. Many units publish memorandums that authorize acceptance, retention and wear of the badge or use the DA Form 4187.

Events required to receive the GAFPB include completing various sports exercises including a shuttle run, flexed arm hang, and a one-kilometer run. Service members must also pass a first aid exam and demonstrate proficiency in their chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protective equipment. Pistol marksmanship is also key, with shooters required to engage three targets using five rounds. Most events conclude with the required ruck march or the challenging 100-meter swim and uniform doff.

German service members wear the badge on the left breast pocket of their utility and service uniforms, while U.S. Soldiers may only wear it on their Army Service Uniform coat and shirt and Army Green Service Uniform coat. Soldiers may only wear one foreign badge on their uniforms, centered or aligned with the right edge of unit awards or nameplate, above the right pocket and unit awards.

The West German Bundeswehr established the award in 1971, and service members of all branches may earn the badge. It is an award of the Federal Republic of Germany’s Bundeswehr and is available in three steps, or levels: gold, silver and bronze. Interestingly, the German military places more value on gold than we do in the U.S. military. U.S. O-1 rank is gold across all services and branches, while O-2 is silver. German officer rank is silver, while all general officer ranks are gold. As such the gold GAFPB is more difficult to earn than the silver or bronze.

The badge prominently features the Bundesadler – the federal eagle - surrounded by a wreath. It’s interesting and relevant that Germany and the United States of America share an affinity for the same bird and use it as national symbols.

After I left the German military, I attended university in the U.S., enlisted in the Army Reserve, and was later commissioned as a Regular Army officer. During the Basic Officer Leaders Course, German liaison officers detailed to the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence offered another opportunity to earn the GAFPB. I witnessed hundreds of young U.S. Army military police second lieutenants earn their badges.

Some years later, I was assigned as provost marshal to the 2d Cavalry Regiment based in Vilseck, Germany. I again saw our formations regularly host German partners during various GAFPB events. Units and individual soldiers drew close to German units and service members.

Last summer I was the officer in charge during a large GAFPB event held at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. We worked closely with German service members assigned to the German Armed Forces Command in Reston, Virginia. and the defense attaché staff detailed to the Federal Republic of Germany’s embassy to the United States. We hosted over 300 service members during the event.

I recently attended the 3d U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) GAFPB event. Historic Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall served as a backdrop for the competition. Abutting Arlington Cemetery and a stone’s throw from the Pentagon, the installation is also very close to the German embassy in Washington D.C.’s Foxhall Village neighborhood close to Georgetown. The defense attaché staff again took time to run over 250 service members through each event. This time I covered the event as a public affairs officer.

Supporting GAFPB events is both time-consuming and expensive for German service members and their commands. Each GAFPB event may take two or three days – not including travel. This takes leaders away from their missions and staff out of their offices. We must acknowledge the sacrifices they make as well.

So why do we go through all this effort to earn a badge? It's great training. Each event builds teams and camaraderie. Individuals reach their limits – and push past them. The badge is a visible symbol of an enduring partnership.

Over the years, I watched men and women fight through pain, fatigue and doubt. This year, a young soldier marched the soles off his feet, his boots red with blood and skin sloughing off. He made it past the ruck march. I’ve watched well-prepared swimmers cramp up in the pool, sink to the bottom, yet manage to remove their uniform blouse and trousers to complete the swim. I’ve seen senior leaders compete alongside their young soldiers, earning a badge - and respect - after over 25 years of service.

What I enjoyed seeing most, though, were the conversations and insights shared between allied service members before, during and after a GAFPB event. The briefest conversations between the Germans and our troops sparked interests that led to much greater understanding.

German Navy Rear Adm. Axel Ristau, the German embassy’s defense attaché, emphasized moral and physical fitness after the latest GAFPB. He also highlighted the alliance between the two countries. “It’s a visual sign of our outstanding bilateral cooperation, and we both, the Americans and German soldiers who earn this badge, can be very proud.”

Ristau earned his badge in 1987. He marveled at how this award binds two nations together. “It’s a sign of a transatlantic link. I wear, and my comrade here, wears the same badge on a military uniform.” He told me this as 213 U.S. servicemembers, their friends and families celebrated their achievement in Fort Myer’s Conmy Hall, its massive display screen showing enmeshed German and American flags braced by the gold, silver and bronze GAFPBs.

While not as far removed from earning my badge as Ristau, I also appreciate its importance and feel the same way. What at first to me was a badge worn by my respected instructors and superiors in the German military, has now, as a U.S. Army officer, become that symbol of proficiency and of true German-American partnership.

FORT BUCHANAN, PR — A pilot program, spearheaded in Puerto Rico, called Operation Connect the Dots provided Soldiers interested in increasing their general technical (GT) scores with two weeks of training on arithmetic reasoning, vocabulary, and paragraph comprehension, July 31 – August 11.

Around 45 Army Reserve Soldiers were the first to go through the program, part of the Army's more extensive Basic Skills Education Program — generally only available for those on active duty.

Sgt. 1st Class Nicholas Rice, 166th Regional Support Group's H2F System Manager, says the Basic Skills Education Program is designed to help soldiers who may have yet to obtain the ASVAB score they wanted upon entering the service.

However, with Operation Connect the Dots, Reservists now have access to the same education materials as their active duty counterparts, according to Connie Schauer, the 88th Readiness Division education services specialist.

""The Reserves Soldiers don't have the same opportunity as the active duty soldiers many times, and this gives them a chance to further their career,"" said Schauer.

Operation Connect the Dots was initially developed to fill crucial warrant officer slots; however, it became clear that other Soldiers could benefit from the training. The course was expanded to include Soldiers looking to become commissioned officers or reclassed to different military occupational specialties.

""It took me three years to get the program started,"" said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Taj Keeler, a property accounting technician with the 166th Regional Support Group. ""Readiness is usually based on metrics such as IWQ [individual weapons qualification] and collective training, but a shortage in retention and recruiting allowed us to showcase the talents we have organically in our division.""

Sgt. 1st Class Rice added that the course was established to further their education for the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery throughout the BSEP and provide them education through the Holistic Health and Fitness system.

""What we saw internally is that a lot of junior enlisted soldiers who took the test were in high school and may not have established strong English language skills, and therefore, the test isn't necessarily indicative of their current capabilities,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Rice. ""So, we wanted to align their current capabilities with future opportunities.""

The program was designed to follow the Holistic Health and Fitness system, which focuses on five domains to build the overall readiness of Soldiers. These domains include physical, mental, nutritional, spiritual, and sleep readiness.

""Using all five domains to build a basic foundation assists Soldiers in their learning and study habits,"" said Chief Keeler. ""This way, Soldiers are in the best state of mind and have ample time to study.""

Of the 45 students enrolled, 37 could increase their score above 110, and seven Soldiers increased their line scores to change their military occupational specialty.

""We saw incredible results; 82% of the Soldiers ended up getting a GT score of 110 or higher, and the overwhelming feedback from the Soldiers is that it helped change their life, said Sgt. 1st Class Rice. ""The H2F and BSEP made that possible.""

Several students shared their thoughts after the program.

""I saw this as an opportunity to do something better and to improve my score to get more opportunities,"" said Private 1st Class Jenifer Restos, 420th Quartermaster Company. ""I can be an officer, or I can reclass. I can do better with this higher score, and anything can come out of this.""

However, improving their scores was one of the many benefits of the course.

""I feel like I can do anything; whatever I put my mind to, I will accomplish it,"" said Spc. Jomar Gonzales, from the 215th Military Police Detachment. ""It feels great to be a part of this. I hope this happens more; this is going to help a lot of people.""

While the idea is, at the end of this course, each of the Soldiers would increase their GT score, Sgt. 1st Class Rice affirmed they would leave knowing the brigade cared about them and provided a system designed to improve them and their families.

Throughout the two weeks, the participants were encouraged to wear civilian clothes. Chief Keeler said this provided a more cohesive learning space where ranks were not a factor.

""So many Soldiers have barriers going into training; I wanted to appeal to their human side,"" said Chief Keeler. ""This way, they would be open to building better relationships with their classmates.""

The most crucial factor to consider is how this program can be viewed as a retention tool for the Reserves.

""These soldiers are the future and will help fill your ranks,"" said Schauer. ""If you don't challenge them, you'll lose them. If they're not being challenged, they're not going to stay. This is a way to help them jump-start their career.""

Chief Keeler estimates that at least 40 participants will be able to fill some of the critical slots in the unit. He says that by investing in them, they can see what they can achieve.

With Lt. Gen. Jody J. Daniels' focus on shaping tomorrow. Chief Keeler offers his perspective on the initiative.

""Shaping tomorrow by focusing on current soldiers,"" said Chief Keeler. ""These Soldiers will most likely be in front of the formation of incoming Soldiers in 2030. We need to continue to build them up so that the new Soldiers are coming into a safe environment, free of SHARP, EO incidents, and IG complaints. Giving them the tools to give back that's the overall goal of Operation Connect the Dots."""

JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, Va. — With family, friends and members of the Army’s Military Police Corps in attendance, Lt. Gen. Donna Martin, Army inspector general, awarded Capt. Luis R. Avila the Order of the Marechausse, silver, during a ceremony at the Memorial Chapel on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Aug. 23.

The award is one of the highest honors given to a military police member by the Military Police Regimental Association, and it recognizes a degree of professionalism, high standards of integrity and morality and esprit de corps.

“I can’t think of a more deserving Soldier and member of our regiment to receive this honor,” Martin said. “Today, we are here because the impossible was made possible with faith, family, courage and prayers.”

On his fifth combat deployment in December 2011, Avila was leading his company from the 720th Military Police Battalion on a search and rescue mission in Afghanistan when a 600-pound improvised explosive device detonated underneath his vehicle, splitting it in half, Martin explained.

The explosion killed three of Avila’s Soldiers and left him severely wounded. He lost his left leg, suffered two heart attacks and two strokes, and a lack of oxygen caused brain damage. The injuries he sustained left him almost completely paralyzed.

Two weeks after the attack, he arrived back in the U.S. in a coma and on life support. His family would stay by his side morning and night, continuing to have faith that he would recover. They prayed and started playing some of his favorite music in the hospital room.

“During those dark days, the family remained steady in their faith in God, and in Luis’ will to survive,” Martin explained. “When their faith was tested, they turned to music.”

Miraculously, Luis’ facial muscles began to twitch, and he eventually woke up from the coma after 40 days. However, he couldn’t eat, speak or see for more than three years.

Luis and his family never gave up hope, and they continued to play music. He even used music therapy as part of his rehabilitation.

“I think what has been very important going through my husband's road of recovery has been his courage and discipline to do things,” his wife Claudia said. “Since the day that he was capable of listening and understanding, he has been working on how to get better.”

He has taken on the challenge of recovery with the help of the medical team at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and the support system around him.

""It takes a strong family to endure hardship,"" Martin said. ""I can attest that the Avila family is the strongest family I've ever had the honor to know.""

With that support and through years of rehabilitation, Avila has regained some movement in his hands, leg and part of his speech. He now sings at many events throughout the National Capital Region.

He performed on television during the 28th National Memorial Day Concert at the U.S. Capitol in 2017 and during the Joint Chiefs of Staff change of command ceremony in 2019. He also sang twice during his Order of the Marechausse award ceremony.

“It's an extreme honor to receive this award, and I am extremely grateful for my [military police] brothers and sisters that have supported me along the way,” he said. “We really appreciate all you do for us, your service and sacrifice to our nation.”

The Military Police Regimental Association established the Order of the Marechausse in 2000 to recognize exceptional dedication, competence and contribution to the regiment. The award is presented in either gold, silver, bronze, or steel, based on the impact and years of service to the regiment.

Today, there are nearly 500 recipients of the silver medal.

“Capt. Avila is truly a role model for all Soldiers, peers and subordinates alike,” Martin said. “I know I speak for all of us here today when I say that the Military Police Corps Regiment is blessed to have you, Luis, as a member of our family.”

Avila continues to recover from his injuries. He has completed four Army Ten-Miler races on a bike with his son, finishing in first place in his category one year, and has won multiple gold and silver medals at the DOD Warrior Games.

She helped at least 70 enslaved people escape through the route of the Underground Railroad. (Courtesy Photo) (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — Harriet Tubman etched her place in history while traversing long distances and guiding runaway slaves to freedom.

But historians also credit the Maryland native as being the first female to lead a combat regiment when she spearheaded a Union Army raid during the Civil War.

To honor Tubman’s contributions to the U.S. military and her lifetime achievements, the Army Surgeon General and Army Chaplain Corps hosted a ceremony in Washington Wednesday to pay tribute to the woman who freed at least 70 slaves while making about 13 trips back to Maryland 170 years ago.

“When Harriet Tubman was making her mark on our world, people likely didn’t really see her,” said Maj. Gen. Deb Kotulich, Army Recruiting and Retention Task Force director. “She was able to slip in and out spaces often unseen because those around her didn’t expect her to have to ability to do anything out of the ordinary.”

“But she was … helping our military, saving lives and ultimately impacting the course of the U.S. Army’s fight against the Confederacy.”

On June 2, 1863, Tubman led 150 African American Union Soldiers in the Combahee Ferry Raid, an operation that rescued more than 700 slaves according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Wednesday’s ceremony celebrated the operation’s 160th anniversary this past summer, and next month will mark 174 years since Tubman made her escape to freedom.

Tubman served as a nurse and Union spy, using her navigation skills that she developed during her time travelling on the Underground Railroad. Tubman, already familiar with the terrain and clandestine activities in the region, helped the Union with raid planning and went on reconnaissance missions.

Tubman’s abilities helped educate future generations of Soldiers on the importance of battlefield sustainment. The Military Intelligence Corps inducted Tubman into its Hall of Fame in June 2021.

“She knew the field, she knew the environment, and she knew what was happening in the world where she conducted her operations,” said Maj. Gen. Heidi Hoyle, acting deputy chief of staff, logistics.

In 1865, the Army’s 12th Surgeon General, Joseph Barnes, appointed Tubman as nurse matron at Fort Monroe’s Colored Hospital in Hampton, Virginia. Tubman also travelled to Florida to treat and cure Union Soldiers with cases of dysentery, an infection of the intestines. Tubman used natural herbs to cure the Soldiers of the ailment, which became one of the leading causes of death during the Civil War.

A skilled cook, Tubman voluntarily baked goods to give Union troops energy while also preparing meals for the injured and the hospital staff. According to the Fort Sam Houston Museum, a young Tubman learned to bring food into the field while helping her father, an enslaved forester.

“I have no doubt that she heard all her life with a small stature and being a woman and an African American, what she could not do,” Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Scott Dingle said. “But Harriet did not let that stop her … because she knew based on the rooting and the word of God, that she had a mission in this world.”

Tubman earned a distinction for her field prowess before the Civil War began. After a June 1858 meeting in Niagara Falls, Ontario, abolitionist John Brown nicknamed her “General” Tubman, impressed by her bravery.

Tubman herself was born into bondage in Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Although she eventually escaped slavery on an arduous, 90-mile trek to Philadelphia, she returned to her home state again and again to liberate family members.

Although she stood only 5-foot-2 and suffered from headaches and narcolepsy, Tubman navigated her way through forests and rugged terrain to guide slaves to Northern states and Canada. While enslaved, an overseer threw a metal weight that landed on her head, causing her to suffer from hallucinations for the rest of her life.

During her night rescues of slaves, Tubman eluded men on horseback while traversing the countryside on foot.

“She was illiterate, so she couldn’t read the signs or which way to go,” Dingle said during a ceremony attended by Tubman’s great-great-great grandniece, Ernestine Wyatt. “But she had an invictus spirit.”

A devout Christian, Tubman turned to her faith to preserve through the most difficult times. Tubman managed to evade capture while leading slaves out of captivity said Col. Karen Meeker, MEDCOM command chaplain.

“Her faith was everything,” Meeker said. “It gave her the strength to overcome all the things that she faced in her life. It gave her a mission, a very high calling.”

Dingle said Tubman learned to overcome her small stature while cutting wood during her years in bondage.

“The physical labors prepared her to be the ‘Moses’ of the underground railroad – to lead in the harshest winter at times,” Dingle said.

In addition to her time at Fort Monroe, Tubman also served as a nurse in Washington D.C. and Beaufort, South Carolina. The Army lauded her Wednesday for her contributions to Army medicine, her missions as a Soldier and being a freedom fighter.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – The 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, hosted this year’s largest Army counterintelligence exercise July 8-21, 2023 to increase proficiency through realistic scenario-based training.

Vigilant Defender 23 holds the distinction of being the first ever counterintelligence battalion echelon culminating training event conducted, and the largest counterintelligence focused exercise ever under U.S. Army Reserve Command. Approximately 200 personnel participated, of which about 120 were counterintelligence agents.

Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, and surrounding San Juan provided the perfect backdrop for the exercise. As the only federal military installation in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, the 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) leveraged locations and trained in an environment with deep Hispanic and Latin American cultural ties.

The unit’s training objectives included completing realistic, full spectrum counterintelligence operations in scenario-based exercises that replicated real world conditions. Planners focused the exercise design on notional support to theater level intelligence support. The unit tailored counterintelligence training around conducting operations in a true Spanish language environment. This allowed counterintelligence agents and analysts to work with interpreters and overcome language barriers which enhanced realism.

Lt. Col. Cope, 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) commander emphasized the importance of training in Puerto Rico. “The predominant language here is Spanish, it's good for our agents who do not speak Spanish to come here and try to operate and navigate through this area.” He believes that the realism will serve agents well. “This makes them more adaptable and resilient to different environments.”

The Army Reserve’s 1st Mission Support Command supported training. Aside from coordinating world-class facilities on the installation, their Soldiers served as exercise role players. 1st Mission Support Command is headquartered on Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.

Cope singled out Col. Carlos Caceres, commander of the 1st Mission Support Command. “Without his full support, I don't think this exercise would have been at this level.” Cope added that Caceres’ personal involvement proved invaluable. “He brought in all his local contacts with the state police, Army Reserve, National Guard, FBI. He invited whoever was out there to come meet with us to discuss our event.”

Vigilant Defender 23 tested and validated the battalion’s ability to operate in a multi-component and interagency environment. 18 units and organizations participated. Army units came from across all three components. Multiple federal partners also participated and provided input.

U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command supported the exercise with participants and evaluators. Leaders acknowledged the close and growing relationship between the 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) and U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command. The battalion leveraged Counterintelligence Command’s real-world expertise to enhance the exercise’s realism.

Maj. Dan Burnett, 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) operations officer described the intricacies of coordinating such a complex event. “The real challenge in the reserve component is always conducting properly planned resourced and executed training. The Interrogation Group, and the Military Intelligence Readiness Command, all the way up to U.S. Army Reserve Command, did nothing but support this exercise.” He also acknowledged the Southeast Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center that dispatched numerous additional evaluators.

Burnett added that he believes all the effort was worth it. “We feel that this is a challenging exercise that is pushing the limits of our agents and analytic elements. And we really think that this is going to be a tremendous, memorable growth opportunity for all parties involved.”

The exercise task organization established field offices that reported to a regional headquarters. Each field office included a staff supporting a Special Agent in Charge (SAC) and military intelligence analyst support.

The robust exercise white cell scripted detailed scenarios designed to facilitate counterintelligence operations task training and evaluation. They also closely managed role players and coordinated observer controller – trainers. It took almost 8 months to write the scenarios, injects, and prepare supporting materials.

The 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion staff completed a staff exercise during Vigilant Defender 23 and received a 1st Army, U.S. Forces Command, external evaluation.

Col. Brent Stalder, Interrogation Group commander and Cmd. Sgt. Maj. Alexander McMillan, Interrogation Group command sergeant major, flew in to observe training and hosted a town hall July 14 in Fort Buchanan’s Ramos Hall.

Counterintelligence agents also conducted Threat Awareness and Reporting Program (TARP) training for individuals and units on Fort Buchanan. TARP is a counterintelligence agent led live-event annual training requirement for all Department of the Army personnel.

Many counterintelligence agents received a tier II certification in line with the Military Intelligence Training Strategy (MITS) through their participation in the exercise. Will-train Soldiers also received valuable experience as a precursor to the Counterintelligence Agent Course - CIAC.

Burnett sees the exercise as a model worth emulating. “We really hope that Vigilant Defender becomes the flagship counterintelligence event on an annual basis. We want to continue to partner and link together the active and reserve components for our mutual benefit.”

752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, is based at Fort Meade, Md. and supports U.S. Army Forces Command units, while providing support to U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command. Counterintelligence units are capable of detecting, identifying, neutralizing, and exploiting foreign intelligence activities, international terrorists, insider threats, and other foreign adversaries. The overall counterintelligence mission involves protecting the U.S. Army and DOD’s strategic advantages.

On a rainy Monday morning, 57 U.S. Army Soldiers started a weeklong journey in pursuit of a special honor.

For only the second time, the Army Reserve hosted an event for candidates of the Expert Soldier Badge, held Aug. 14-18, 2023, at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. Members of all three Army components (active duty, Army Reserve and National Guard) were invited to participate.

Earning this badge is no small feat. Soldiers must complete a variety of mental and physical challenges, and any slip up could mean going home.

Of the 57 candidates this year, only 16 remained at the end, standing tall as their shiny new badges were pinned to their uniform.

“I'm very happy,” said Spc. Dominic Chrisostomo, a member of the 1224th Engineer Company, part of the Guam National Guard, upon earning the badge. “I'm happy that I stayed in. I continued mission. I kept going and didn't let anything get me down, and I just kept moving forward.”

Throughout the week, these candidates had to complete tasks — 30 in total — related to weapon systems, medical and patrol knowledge. With only a single no-go allowed per day, the pressure was on.

Surprisingly, anticipation was one of the hardest parts of the event, according to Pfc. Tyson Clark, U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne).

“Especially when we're going through the lanes, the medical lanes, patrol lanes,” Clark said, “like trying to lay in bed at night, and you've got all these different tasks going through your head, and you can't sleep because you're stressed out.”

Clark was one of three Soldiers to earn the Straight Edge title, meaning he was perfect in every task.

“I guess I got lucky,” Clark said of the achievement. “I didn't mess up any of my tasks, but yeah, it was a wild ride.”

The ESB is open to all Soldiers (noncommissioned officers, warrant officers and officers) who are not serving in the infantry, special forces or medical branches and who demonstrate individual abilities to perform basic Soldier tasks.

Chrisostomo appreciated the chance to become reacquainted with those tasks after a couple years of focusing on his military occupational specialty.

“Being here, it kind of brings us back to pretty much our infantry side,” Chrisostomo said, “where we get tested upon this: patrols, the weapons, the medical. It brings back our level 10, and it ensures that we're still experts in our fields.”

More than just another decoration to wear on their uniforms, the badge represents the trials that candidates have overcome to show their expertise.

“It's a way to show other people the profession that we're in,” said Lt. Col. Joseph Proctor, 863rd Engineer Battalion commander. “When you're in any type of profession, you have to show other people what to aspire to. It's something that shows those who came before who's now and who's coming next.”

By earning this badge, Soldiers join an elite group and are then able to become graders at future events, passing on their knowledge and help to Soldiers.

When asked about coming back to help, Clark said he would be interested.

“I know it was very challenging for the graders, especially being here over a month,” Clark said, “even longer days than we had to endure. But I think it'd be a really cool experience to come back, train other Soldiers and help them experience the same thing and to also earn their badge.”

In addition to the tasks, Soldiers must also complete an Expert Physical Fitness Assessment, day and night land navigation, and a 12-mile ruck march. Failure to pass any of these requirements results in disqualification for the badge.

When asked if there was anything else to say, Proctor shared his appreciation for how the event was conducted.

“I think I did the math,” Proctor said, “and it was almost a one-to-one ratio of cadre and support staff to each one of us, if not more.”

Such individual attention is “a testament to what the U.S. Army is willing to put into the training that they did,” he continued, “and it's a testament of the Soldiers’ and staff's willingness to support our training. I wanted to say thank you to them.”"

U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael E. Langley, U.S. Africa Command commander, visited Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti on Aug. 16, 2023, as part of his official visit to the East Africa region.

During his visit, Langley patched Soldiers of the 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, South Carolina National Guard, to commemorate the unit's service in a combat zone in support of the Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa mission. After the patching ceremony, Langley shared some words of advice and encouragement with the Soldiers.

“Our service members are consummate professionals and perform incredibly well during their assignment here in the Horn of Africa,” Langley said. “Visits like this allow me to thank them for their service and physically show them that this command team supports their dedication to duty.”

The patching ceremony was just one part of Langley’s visit. He also met with Djiboutian President Guelleh to explore ways to enhance the partnership and cooperation between the United States and Djibouti.

The delegation went over a variety of topics, including economic development, regional defense and security, and the fight against terrorism.

“We discussed how we can work together to achieve our common security goals and expand our partnership,” said Langley. “Given our diplomatic, defense, and development engagements – what we call ‘Three Ds’ – in the region, the U.S. and Djibouti share aligned security and prosperity goals.”

Langley noted that Djibouti is a key U.S. partner and vital to regional development and establishing peace and stability.

“Solutions to these colossal problems must be a shared burden, with African nations at the helm of concerted international efforts and a U.S. whole-of-nation contribution that produces sustainable outcomes,” said Langley.

President Guelleh and Langley also talked about the numerous security challenges facing the region and about Djibouti’s various contributions throughout the region.

“Under the leadership of President Guelleh, Djibouti is playing an essential role in achieving peace and stability,” said Langley. “The country is contributing to peacekeeping and counterterrorism efforts in Somalia.”"

WASHINGTON — To better address obstacles facing female Soldiers serving in special operations units and to retain its top talent, Army Special Operations Command outlined 42 recommendations in a study released Monday.

The research’s findings will guide USASOC in optimizing female warfighters while noting their physical and anatomical differences.

“It is not about providing accommodations for women,” said USASOC Command Sgt. Maj. JoAnn Naumann. “It's providing tools that allow women to maximize their performance and continue to serve at all levels and across time.”

During the yearlong study, researchers found that 44% of the female Soldiers surveyed said they experienced equipment-fitting challenges relating to body armor, helmets and ruck systems. The problem can impact women’s abilities to perform basic Soldier maneuvers and skills.

Female Soldiers also reported that the time they spent planning pregnancies negatively impacted their careers, leading to Soldiers scheduling childbearing around career milestones or avoiding pregnancy entirely, according to the 106-page report, titled, “Breaking Barriers: Women in Army Special Operations Forces.”

Researchers held more than 40 focus groups and interviews with women and men from across the force. The study focused on the areas of equipment fitting, childcare, gender bias, social support, sexual harassment, pregnancy and postpartum, and morale and wellbeing. Retired Lt. Gen. Francis Beaudette, former USASOC commander, initiated the 2021 study, which had more than 5,000 respondents. Additionally, the survey addressed other concerns including challenges of small-statured Soldiers and access to healthcare.

The study also explored attitudes towards females serving in combat and special operations units. The survey results showed Soldiers had a favorable view of women serving in special operations units with no reported decline in morale. About 72% of women and 64% of men surveyed said they would support their daughter joining Army special operations units.

According to findings, 80% of men reported that gender-related concerns had no impact on their decision to remain in special operations forces. Researchers found most gender-biased comments and attitudes during the study came from senior NCOs, indicating a difference in generational views, Naumann said.

“Although disappointed by some of the findings and comments in the study, we are committed to addressing these issues with candor and transparency,” Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, USASOC commander wrote in the report’s introduction.

“To change culture takes time,” Braga added. “We have to be better — we must be better.”

The Women in ARSOF Initiative outlined three lines of effort to address the hurdles: mentorship and sponsorship, health and readiness, and modernization.

For mentorship and sponsorship, units can create a “culture of excellence” through education and accountability, said Lt. Col. Rachel Cepis, the director of the Women in ARSOF Initiative. For example, the Army can host more educational forums where Soldiers can learn how to schedule duties around breastfeeding or deal with postpartum related issues, as well as women’s health and nutrition.

Survey participants that have had children listed the top five postpartum challenges: (1) depression, stress, and anxiety, (2) inability to perform to the same level as the unit, (3) lactation, (4) maternity leave, and (5) diastasis recti abdominus.

Focus group participants said they experienced hardship finding adequate care during and after pregnancy. Soldiers also voiced concerns about pregnancy hindering career progression and having adequate breastfeeding locations, as well as convalescent leave following miscarriages.

The 10th Special Forces Group at Fort Carson, Colorado began a female mentorship program, while the 3rd Special Forces Group and 528th Sustainment Brigade at Fort Liberty, North Carolina, plan to establish a similar initiative at each battalion headquarters. The 528th Sustainment Brigade also hosts monthly engagements with female Soldiers.

“We're looking at it holistically. I'm excited to see the growth of women in our formation in all positions,” Cepis said. “And I'm thrilled that we're looking at ways to help them perform at their maximum potential.”

“This is about driving change and making ultimately, ARSOF and the [Defense Department] better,” she added.

In the second line of effort, health and readiness, USASOC partnered with Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick, Massachusetts to study physiological, metabolic and psychological responses during and after completion of extreme and prolonged training. USASOC has also submitted four topics to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services 2024 research solicitation: (1) women’s physical and physiological characteristics of elite female warfighters, (2) pregnancy and postpartum impacts on readiness, (3) long and short-term impacts of intentional dehydration, and (4) endocrine adaptations of female warfighters.

Cepis said USASOC is working with the Army, SOCOM, and academic partners to study the effects of menstrual cycles on female warfighters and ways to maximize performance. USASOC plans to examine sicknesses and illnesses that females suffer in the field and explore how to avoid musculoskeletal injuries related to female anatomy differences, she added.

Finally in modernization, the study recognizes the anatomical and anthropometric differences between men and women and Army Combat Capabilities Development Command [DEVCOM] at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland will be modernizing dress and duty uniforms as well as body armor that better fits the varying body types and sizes.

USASOC has done limited user assessments with the Army Modular Scalable Body Armor, a lightweight, adjustable bulletproof vest, and the Army Integrated Helmet Protection System, a multi-faceted head gear, which consists of protection and retention systems, a helmet cover and hearing protection.

The Women in ARSOF Director has partnered with DEVCOM to better develop items ranging from pregnant female service uniforms to female urinary devices.

USASOC founded the Women in ARSOF Initiative to specifically study female-modernization challenges while advising Army and SOF senior leaders. ARSOF also began publishing a newsletter series, created an online platform and developed a portal site to keep Soldiers updated on the study findings and ongoing efforts.

“I have never felt so heard and understood in my career until [the newsletter] started being published,” wrote a 25-year-old Soldier who has spent five years in special operations forces.

USASOC, headquartered at Fort Liberty, North Carolina, trains, equips and educates special operations units in support of the joint force.

CHICAGO – The Chicago Cubs honored Capt. Michael Ariola, a public affairs officer assigned to the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, during their Military Salute at the Crosstown Series versus the Chicago White Sox, August 16, 2023, at Wrigley Field.

Ariola was born in Chicago and raised in south suburban Darien and Downers Grove. He credits his family’s tradition of serving in the Army with his decision to join the Army.

“Both of my grandfathers served in the Army during World War II,” he said. “My maternal grandfather served as an air traffic controller in the Army Air Corps in the European Theatre and my paternal grandfather served in the Armor Corps in the Pacific Theatre.”

When the time came to serve, Ariola enlisted as a commissioned officer candidate and attended Basic Combat Training and Officer Candidate School at Fort Moore, Georgia. He received his commission as an Armor officer.

“I decided to become an armor officer because I wanted to serve in combat arms. Being part of a tank crew was very appealing to me, “said Ariola. “Maneuvering in a tank during training is very exciting and in a combat scenario, an Abrams tank provides substantial protection and tremendous firepower.”

On active duty, Ariola was stationed at Camp Casey about 40 miles north of Seoul, South Korea for two years.

“I served as a tank platoon leader and executive officer with the 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Brigade Combat team,” said Ariola.

Ariola left active duty after sustaining an injury and transitioned into the Individual Ready Reserve. During that time, he worked on his master’s degree in international affairs at the University of California, San Diego.

“Near the end of my degree program, I received several phone calls from the Army Reserve asking if I would like to join an active Army Reserve unit. I missed the camaraderie of military life, so I accepted a public affairs position with the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command,” said Ariola.

A job he finds highly rewarding with the flexibility to serve part time while pursuing a full-time career.

“I enjoy being a public affairs officer because I find it very rewarding to tell the Army Reserve story. It’s an honor to highlight the accomplishments of the disciplined, motivated, and patriotic men and women of the United States Army Reserve, while helping to improve awareness of the Army’s presence, mission, and commitment to the American people,” said Ariola. “Being a public affairs officer allows me to work with diverse civic groups, local and national media organizations, sports teams, local governments and educational institutions.”"

WASHINGTON — The Army took its next step in bolstering its top modernization priority with a successful launch of the Tomahawk missile from its mid-range capability prototype system on June 27, showcasing the potential of its newest, ground-based missile launcher.

Soldiers from the 1st Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington and Sailors from the Navy Program Executive Office Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons Office took part in the joint, live-fire exercise that demonstrated the system’s full operational capability. Earlier this year, the Army fired an SM-6 missile from the mid-range capability. The launches occurred at undisclosed test sites.

The Navy uses the Tomahawk, an intermediate-range, subsonic, cruise missile to strike targets from 1,000 miles away and can switch destinations in mid-flight.

The Army eventually plans to field an MRC battery which will be assigned to a strategic fires battalion under a multi-domain task force. The battery’s prototype design consists of four launchers and a control center.

Soldiers contributed to the design and testing of the Mid-Range Capability weapon system, which the Army will use to augment its long-range, precision fires capability.

“From the start of the [Mid-Range Capability] program, Soldiers and Sailors have collaborated to provide the Army with this important capability,” wrote the Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. “Soldiers have consistently participated in each phase of the development, training and testing of the MRC and continue to provide useful feedback.”

The MRC system will eventually support the joint, multi-domain mission. The SM-6 missile can engage multiple threats including terminal ballistic missile defense, anti-air warfare and anti-ship strike roles.

Improvements by near peer adversaries in their long-range artillery systems present possible threats to U.S. forces. The Chinese military has leveraged unmanned aerial vehicles or UAV, to produce precision munitions and greater target acquisition.

The Army made long-range precision fires its top modernization priority to upgrade and bolster its artillery and missile systems while developing hypersonic weapons and long-range cannons.

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO CAMP BULLIS, Texas – U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers assigned to the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater), Military Intelligence Readiness Command, conducted a variety of military intelligence exercises and other training as part of Rapidly Engaged 23, July 8-28, 2023.

Exercise Rapidly Engaged 23 was the culmination of over a year of planning and preparation. It provided Soldiers the opportunity to refresh their military skills in a simulated deployed environment.

“This was a great opportunity for us to test our skills, work together, and learn in a safe but challenging environment,” said U.S. Army Reserve Col. Ronald Bahl, commander of the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “There are very real applications for all the training we conducted. It was important that we take this seriously and make the most of it.”

U.S. Army Reserve Col. Melissa Adamski, the Military Intelligence Readiness Command commander, visited Camp Bullis, Texas, where she was able to connect with Soldiers, engage, and review lessons learned with the participating units. It was a unique opportunity for the Military Intelligence Readiness Command to gather knowledge that will be used in planning future annual training events.

Bahl relinquished command of the brigade to U.S. Army Reserve Col. Frederick Turner at the conclusion of Rapidly Engaged. Col. Adamski presided over the change of command ceremony. “I am taking command of a great organization with great Soldiers ready to keep learning and improving their skills,” said Turner, incoming commander of the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater).

Turner has had a distinguished military career including both active duty and reserve time. He joins the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) after departing his previous post where he served as the chief of the Intelligence Security Cooperation and Engagement Division at U.S. Africa Command.

During the training exercise, Soldiers were put through various simulated situations. They had to perform their assigned duties to accomplish their mission. Soldiers were trained on intelligence tasks, maintenance operations, and combat casualty care.

Soldiers assigned to 383rd Military Intelligence Battalion (Theater Support) and Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) set up and maintained TROJAN based communications during the exercise. Working together, both units maximized their efforts and completed their mission objectives, giving them an edge for future training and real-world operations.

The realistic training environment facilitated the cooperation between the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater), U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), and the U.S. Army Northern Command (NORTHCOM) G2. Soldiers participated in synchronized intelligence, communications, and security operations intended to build future cooperative capabilities.

“It is incredible seeing the whole brigade coming together as one,” said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Broday Winton, a human resource specialist with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “Being able to function and operate as a team in an environment where you have multiple things going on at once and still completing all your tasks was a great feeling.”

A training highlight was the Combat Casualty Care Course (C4). 23 Soldiers participated and completed the 4-day long course.

“It was a great experience being able to get this quality training alongside my unit,” said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Ashley Bailey, a signals intelligence analyst assigned to the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “I loved how everyone was so willing to help, teach and mentor me on a broad set of topics I didn’t know a lot about.” This was Bailey’s first battle assembly and annual training with a reserve unit after returning from her 7 month-long advanced individual training (AIT).

Besides intelligence and training operations, mechanics put in effort to boost the overall readiness of the brigade’s equipment. “It was amazing seeing our maintenance Soldiers at the motor pool working hard every day,” said U.S. Army Reserve Capt. Jose Lucio, commander of Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “These Soldiers completed over 100 work orders during the exercise and were able to exponentially increase our overall readiness for future operations.”

The 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) is a multi-component unit that provides information and intelligence support to Army and joint forces to support the range of military activities in Northern Command's area of operations."

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army combined the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center with the Australian Combat Training Centre for a one-of-a-kind collaboration during Talisman Sabre 23 in Townsville, Australia earlier this month.

The merged training center, led by Australia, tested nearly 10,000 troops from multiple partner nations during a 10-day field training exercise.

""Big exercises like this are where we can induce the fog and friction of stress,” said U.S. Army Col. Bryan Martin, Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center operations group commander. “[They are] the closest we can get to actual real combat on our respective combined forces, so that when that day comes, that they're trained and they're ready.""

The scenario called for the joint force to protect a chain of islands from an invading large hostile nation.

The enemy force, which was made up of service members from the participating countries, was given tasks and could make decisions to achieve their mission.

This allowed commanders to train their forces in a scenario and environment that could be encountered in the Pacific.

""This activity that's occurring here is just the richest, most immersive and most realistic, no-consequence training environment that we can possibly create,"" said Australian Army Col. Ben McLennan, Australian Defence Force's Combat Training Centre commander.

This was the first time the U.S. Army merged combat training centers with a partner nation.

Soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division combined with service members from Germany, Indonesia and Australia to form a task force under Australian command to expel the enemy force.

During the training, there was also a virtual portion. This allowed commanders to handle simulated battles, as well as having to deal with electronic warfare and cyberattacks.

“The Australian Army hasn’t participated in something of this magnitude since 1918,” McLennan said. “It’s energizing to be involved in an enterprise enabling the best of our teams to reach their highest performing potential.”

This was the third and final training rotation of the year for the JPMRC.

JPMRC was established nearly three years ago to provide realistic training opportunities for U.S. service members and partner nations in the Indo-Pacific. It’s the first new combat training center outside the continental U.S. in 50 years.

The center executes three training rotations annually, one in the terrains of the Hawaiian Islands, one in Alaska’s extremely cold weather, and one at a satellite location of an allied or partner nation in the region, such as Australia.

The rotations are run by the 196th Infantry Brigade, the training support brigade in the Indo-Pacific, with support from the 25th Infantry Division and the 11th Airborne Division. The training is a joint venture with participation from every U.S. military branch. There is also involvement from multinational partners including Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia.

Each exercise is built upon a multifaceted simulation. This system incorporates real-time feedback by employing virtual and constructive effects across multiple levels, which immerses participants in a comprehensive training environment.

“This allows us to keep trained and ready forces available and forward in the region,” said Gen. Charles Flynn, U.S. Army Pacific commander, during a media roundtable earlier this fiscal year. “It allows us to generate readiness in environments and in conditions that we’re most likely to operate in … It allows us to rehearse with a number of joint and multinational partners.”

Each fall, the team holds the first rotation of the year in Hawaii to train in jungle warfighting. They use the entire island chain with fictional battles taking place simultaneously in multiple locations.

The second rotation takes place in Alaska in the spring. This is an artic-focused training exercise. The final rotation is held in the summer at a satellite location like the one used during Talisman Sabre in Australia.

These joint service/multinational training rotations help strengthen partnerships and build on their combined defense capabilities.

""The landpower network is a key component in the security architecture that helps keep the Indo-Pacific region safe, free and open because it protects national sovereignty — something that’s very important to each of our allies and partners,” Flynn said. “The interoperability and close relationships we build while training together within the landpower network is a key advantage in competition and, if necessary, in conflict.”

CASS LAKE, Minn. - What started off as just another routine annual training event here quickly developed into something much more for one Army Reserve Soldier, who found herself on the front lines of saving lives in a real-world situation that she won’t soon forget.

“It was surreal, it was unexpected,” said U.S. Army Reserve Spc. Ana Baker, a healthcare specialist, assigned to the 399th Field Hospital, 803rd Hospital Center, 804th Medical Brigade, 3rd Medical Command.

Baker was here with her unit conducting a real-life medical assistance mission with the local civilian community providing no cost dental and medical care as part of an Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) mission. The IRT was part of Operation Walking Shield, a joint medical assistance operation with the Minnesota Army National Guard.

""The Innovative Readiness Training missions provide patient care to select communities within the United States,” said Capt. Jamie Eastman, company commander, 451st Medical Detachment, 405th Field Hospital. “They are not only a benefit to those communities in need, but also to the Soldiers who are involved in providing care by helping them to maintain proficiency in their medical skills.”

During the community mission, the Emergency Medical Services provider for the region offered ride-along shifts in their ambulances to the Soldiers who are healthcare specialists. This provided an opportunity for the Soldiers to gain civilian EMS experience in addition to performing their primary IRT mission.

“EMS ride-alongs and hospital clinical experiences are vital for ensuring proficiency of U.S. Army medical providers,” said Eastman. “Many National Guard and Reserve Soldiers have a civilian medical career to maintain proficiency, but not all have the capability. Training opportunities like this ensure Soldiers are ready to respond when the mission calls.”

It was on one of these ride-alongs that Baker’s otherwise normal day would quickly change into one filled with excitement and drama. “I was scheduled to go with the ambulance crew for a few hours that afternoon,” said Baker, who had never been in an ambulance before. “I had heard Soldiers who had gone earlier in the day talking about how it was boring and that nothing had happened, so I took a book to read expecting to have plenty of down time. About 20 minutes into the shift the EMTs (emergency medical technicians) got a call and they just said, ‘we gotta go’. I just thought, oh my goodness what is going on.”

Within moments the ambulance roared to life. With the siren blaring and emergency lights flashing, Baker and her EMS crew quickly made their way to the scene of a motor vehicle collision that had left a pregnant mother and her three young children in desperate need of emergency trauma care.

“I was riding in the back of the ambulance on the way there and I was nervous and excited and wondering what to expect,” said Baker. “I managed to put on my reflective vest and gloves and was just watching the EMTs and following their cues.

When we stopped, I could see a car that had ran off the road and had slammed into a tree backwards. There were several people already on the scene, and one of them, a bystander, handed me an 18-month-old boy, who had been involved in the collision. I took him into the back of the ambulance where I helped take his vital signs and assess him for injures.”

Soon another child from the accident would be brought into the ambulance as well. This time it was a two-year-old girl who had a large bump on her forehead.

Baker, who has a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications and psychology, spent the next hour on the scene with the children, doing her best to keep them calm and entertained while the responding emergency medical personnel called for a life-flight helicopter for the mother. Eventually the children would be treated and released to family members on the scene.

“It was an unfortunate situation, but it’s real life, and sometimes bad things happen in real life,” said Baker, a native of Jamaica. “I learned a lot from this experience. I saw how the EMTs approached the scene, how they interacted with the patients and young children and how they had a special approach to dealing with people in a situation like that to help them not only physically, but emotionally as well.”

Baker remembered how her Army medical training had helped prepare her for the stressful situation. “In our initial training we had a civilian instructor that would shout at us and really put a lot of added stress and pressure on us,” she said. “I see now why he did that. That added level of stress in my training helped me be calm during this real-life situation.”

Not only did those on the scene witness Baker’s calm demeanor and helpful medical expertise, but she also made an impression on her superiors.

""Spc. Baker is a passionate and motivated Soldier in our field hospital,” said Eastman. “Her drive and character were put to the challenge during this motor vehicle collision, where she was able to provide patient care in conjunction with the EMTs from the Leech Lake Ambulance. We are proud of her and the service she provided to the community.""

Looking to the future, Baker says she is hoping to get promoted soon, and is looking for an opportunity to deploy. “I want to deploy and see what that’s like,” she said. “While I’m serving in the Army Reserve I’ll continue to look forward to my annual training and just soak up as much information I can.”

She also plans to take additional classes to help her prepare for a future leadership role.

With her unit training complete and the incident now a memory, Baker reflects back on that incredible day. “I was in the right place at the right time,” she said. “It opened my eyes to a lot of things, and it’s an experience I’ll definitely remember for years to come.”"

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Army is working on a new Antiterrorism Strategic Plan that is scheduled to roll out this fiscal year.

The plan, which is being coordinated with the Department of Defense, will update policy, training, exercises and how the Army analyzes and shares information about terrorism.

“The threats we faced 20 years ago aren’t the threats we face today, nor are they the threats we will face in the future,” said Maj. Gen. Duane R. Miller, Army provost marshal general. “Our adversaries are constantly evolving with the use of technology to identify vulnerabilities. It’s through this strategic plan that we hope to address any vulnerabilities and any threats we may face in the future.”

The program will help put Army civilians, contractors, Soldiers and their families on common ground with the service’s antiterrorism goals and objectives moving forward, he added.

The Army’s Antiterrorism Division worked with multiple federal organizations, including the Department of Homeland Security, as they developed the antiterrorism program. This allowed them to share information on best practices and emerging technologies that could pose a threat.

Training, education and awareness remain the key elements in the service’s efforts to prevent terrorism at home and overseas, Miller said.

“The more aware our community members are, the more likely we are to obtain advanced warning to defend against terrorist attacks,” he said. “Constant vigilance, timely threat reporting, knowledge of antiterrorism prevention measures and Army leadership advocacy are vital to sustained prevention.”

August is dedicated as Antiterrorism Awareness Month to educate members of the Army on the threat and provide information on how to prevent acts of terrorism.

“Soldiers who are aware of the risks and who report concerning behavior can help prevent threats from impacting the local community,” he said. “Don’t be a bystander. Do your part as a member of the team.”

According to Miller, the fight against terrorism has shifted in recent years from terrorist groups overseas to individual domestic terrorists fueled by extremist ideologies.

To combat the evolving threat, the Army has updated the antiterrorism program and continues to look for ways to improve protection efforts. The service is continuing to field and expand the capability of the Joint Analytic Real-time Virtual Information Sharing System.

JARVISS is a desktop and mobile application that pulls information from more than 80,000 sources to give commanders real-time data on potential threats, so they can make informed decisions.

Along with advances in technology, the Army and the National Guard continue to conduct annual exercises to stay ready. The Ohio National Guard held their emergency response exercise in April with support from local emergency services.

The exercise evaluated how the responding agencies can affect control and containment of the situation as well as the effectiveness of the facilities’ response capabilities.

National Guard units from 12 states along with multiple federal and local agencies completed an emergency response exercise at the Anchorage Fire Department Fire Training Center in June. The training is designed to maintain readiness, validate response procedures and collaborate with partners.

These efforts, along with others throughout the service, allow the Army and local partners to stay vigilant in the fight against terrorism.

“We must understand the threat and be prepared to prevent any impact on Army readiness,” Miller said. “We’re confident the outcomes from implementing the strategy will align policy, training, doctrine, partnerships and information sharing to meet the challenges of terrorism over the horizon.”

Army personnel can report suspicious behavior to their chain of command or submit a report online through INSCOM's iSALUTE form.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than 30 U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group (NE-MARSG) and the Western Medical Area Readiness Support Group (WE-MARSG) downtrace units, Army Reserve Medical Command; have been sent to the National Capitol Region (NCR) in support of the NCR Low Density Medical Skills Sustainment Training, August 6-19, 2023. Additionally, a subset of U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers under 807th Medical Command (Deployment Support) and 3rd MCDS echelons have joined their AR-MEDCOM brethren to augment the mission.

Also known as the NCR 68-Series operation, the NCR LDMSST is a twelvefold and collaborative effort between the three aforesaid USAR medical commands to provide medical caregiver, laboratory, and logistical support to Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, the DiLorenzo Pentagon Health Center (DPHC) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).

""The mission of the AR-MEDCOM Soldiers is for them to backfill on shortages that the training facilities have, which is very large,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Master Sgt. Dexter Hilliman, the senior logistics noncommissioned officer of the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group (NE-MARSG), Staten Island, New York; and the coordinator/noncommissioned officer-in-charge of the National Capitol Region 68-Series operation. ""With all of these (Military Occupational Specialties) being available, and from the two or three training meetings that we have here, they gave us a list of MOSs and the amount of Soldiers that they help with. We were able to fill 80 percent of that on our first rotation, and we will fill over 90 percent on the second rotation because we have a lot more Soldiers that came in than the first rotation.""

U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Alex Steward, a combat medic assigned to the 7457th Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Richmond, Virginia, said that although he has civilian job experience in emergency room settings, the real-world training environment in the DPHC presented him with new insights.

""As a junior-enlisted Soldier, it helps humanize some of the upper-ranking people,"" Steward said. ""Before here, I had very little experience with high-ranking officers and high-ranking senior enlisted. So to be able to take care of them is a lot more helpful to make me be able to understand that they are also people. I mean, they have rank and they have been in the military longer than I've been alive, but it is good to be able to (get) experience and talk to them.""

In adherence with the ""tough, realistic training"" doctrinal mantra of the Army Reserve, training participants attain the dual benefit of working in real-world environments whilst improving upon their knowledge and skill sets.

""What I like to call this mission is the National Capitol Region's strategic partnership,"" said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Dominic Payne, the deputy commanding officer of the NE-MARSG. ""When you call it a strategic partnership, that means that both sides are getting everything done better. And when we talk about realistic training, you cannot get more realistic than actually working at an (Military Treatment Facility), at a warehouse, or at a clinic providing support in whatever area that it might be to all of the components and probably the civilian or retiree personnel that go through those facilities.""

""That's as real world as it gets, and with the possibility of a large-scale military operation where we will probably be integrating with a lot of MTFs across the board, this type of partnership is going to be critical for us to be able to operate efficiently because we are going to get the most up-to-date training from MHS Genesis, and they'll be able to work those systems as well as any other logisitics systems that they have out there in order to do their mission,"" said Payne.

Despite the short-term duration of the Army Reserve medical Soldiers at the NCR training sites, their presence has nonetheless been a significant force multiplier to Active Component service members.

""This is 100 percent important for them to be here to look at our equipment and do maintenance on our equipment because without them, we cannot do anything,"" said U.S. Army Sgt. Cynthia Jarvi, an animal care specialist of WRAIR, Army Futures Command. ""We're going to be deadlined basically... and the animals would be in danger and the people would be in danger, so it is 100 percent important to have the (medical logistics specialists) around so we can get this equipment maintained and serviced properly. With them doing what they just did, that 100 percent makes our mission become even better.""

Lastly, Hilliman attributes a large portion of the mission actualization to AR-MEDCOM's Operations, Plans and Training (G-3/5/7).

""I have to thank the AR-MEDCOM G-3/5/7 for putting this together,"" Hilliman said. ""I will mention Maj. Quentin Stewart and 1st Lt. Knakita Cruz, as they were very, very instrumental in making this a success. No way that myself or my co-leader, Sgt. 1st Class Alexander Jordan, would have been able to do this on our own.""

The next rotation of the NCR LDMSST is slated to provide coverage at the training sites from August 20 to September 2, 2023."

“Contact! Contact!” Soldiers yell out to each other as they begin to take simulated fire from up the hill.

It is was part of a week-long training event for the 204th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade at Camp Williams, Utah. They call it “annual training,” but this is hardly routine. More than 250 Soldiers are involved to help get the 204th MEB ready for an upcoming mobilization to Africa.

To be ready, they have to get back to basics. That means lots of review and practice of squad tactics and individual Soldier skills.

“The Army identifies when you get mobilized what they want you to accomplish,” said Capt. Timothy Klase, the training officer for the 204th. “It's what we call the army warrior tasks and battle drills and that’s what we needed to do.”

Each Soldier had to complete around 70 individual tasks. They included operating a radio, applying a tourniquet, land navigation, and tactical movements. Soldiers participated in small group instruction, then demonstrated their ability to perform each task individually during the first two days of training.

“Then you compile all of those warrior tasks into battle drills that progress and build on each other,” said Klase. “You might start filling (programming) an individual radio on your own, then it will progress to utilizing that radio in a squad formation that's under attack.”

During training, the Soldiers encamped in an area called the “One Station Unit Trainer” (OSUT). The OSUT has a half a dozen classrooms, a bivouac area, and lanes to test Soldiers on their skills.

One of the lanes required squads to react to a near ambush. Lane observers gave each squad an order. Then the squad would organize and plan the mission according to what they had learned in the classes.

Most of the Soldiers participated last week to conduct five days and nights of intense training. The event, however, had been building for months.

“We started setting up six to eight months ago in order to develop the scheme of what the commander wanted,” said Sgt. 1st Class Ian Moffat.

Moffatt is a construction engineer with 189th Combat Arms Training Brigade, First Army. It’s an active duty unit based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord whose job is to train other units getting ready for deployment.

“The commander tells us exactly what his priority mission-essential tasks are and then we align that with the actual mission that the unit is going to do,” said Moffatt. “Once the commander agrees to it, we design training for the unit.”

In addition to classes for all of the individual tasks, the final plan included four combat scenarios, night driving, and land navigation.

During the land navigation lane, Soldiers were given a map and a compass and had to locate four unique points spread out across several square kilometers. They had to do it once in the daytime, and once again at night with low visibility.

Klase and Moffatt were part of a small team to develop the plan in its early stages. That team grew as the training date approached.

By the time of the training event there were around 70 Soldiers in support of those getting trained. Those getting ready to deploy were grouped into 15 squads, each with an officer and a noncommissioned officer in charge.

Every Soldier, regardless of rank, role, or experience, had to complete the same training before they can mobilize. It’s a way, say leaders, to ensure that everyone has mastered the basics.

“You just don't know what type of battle we're going to be in, so you have to really prepare for really anything and everything that comes your way,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Garrett Whatcott.

Whatcott is currently serving as the command sergeant major for the 625th Military Police Battalion, which is part of the 204th. He has deployed twice but said it’s always good for Soldiers to refresh their battle skills.

“These are perishable skills,” said Klase. “Some soldiers may have just done this last month at basic training but others of us haven't deployed in a while so it may have been 10 years since we last did this.”

Pvt. 1st Class Adan Patino is one of those Soldiers who had recently done it. A signal operations specialist assigned to the 217th Brigade Signal Company, he is only a few months out of basic training.

“Even though we are all assigned different [jobs] it's still important for us to know how to maneuver through any situation. So, we have to keep good skills in case we're needed out on the field,” he said.

The 217th is a subordinate unit of the brigade and will be deploying too.

“We’ll probably have to [set up retransmission stations] for our antenna out away from the base so it's important for us to know how to how to maneuver,” added Patino.

The 204th will join with Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), headquartered in the Republic of Djibouti.

“At the very bottom line we are Soldiers,” said 1st Lt. Laura Roberts, a cyber warfare officer assigned to the 204th. “If things hit the wall, then you know we will have to revert back to some of these basic tactics.”

Roberts was a squad leader during the week-long annual training.

“We might not be doing these specific things during our mobilization but it's good to know that we can support each other and be prepared to support the mission,” she said.

The brigade’s mission in Africa includes operations to enhance partner nation capacity, promote regional stability, and dissuade conflict.

CJTF-HOA is critical to U.S. Africa Command's efforts to build partner capacity to counter violent extremists and address other regional security partnerships, according to the task force website.

“The point of this is is when we go downrange the Army trusts that we're Soldiers first and that we can execute basic soldier tasks,” said Klase.

For many of the Soldiers, the battle training is as much about team building as anything else.

“These warrior tasks build the team so you can better prepare yourself to react to any type of situation that you may have,” said Whatcott.

While they were not in classes or on the training lanes getting evaluated, Soldiers spent time with their squads rehearsing movements and getting to know each other better.

“It’s just fantastic bonding,” said Roberts. “You know these people are going to be at your left and right downrange. “I couldn't have had a better squad so honestly they led themselves for the most part.”

“It's been a really good experience. It’s been a lot of one-on-one conversations a lot of training everyday just to prepare for when we're actually getting graded,” said Patino.

“Ultimately I want to be a member of a team too,” added Klase. “After I spent so much time on the training plan I had to hand it off to someone else to execute so I could be that member of the 15-man squad actually operating on the ground,” he said.

“It's a great team-building experience. We need this before we get deployed to build that team cohesion,” said Whatcott.

The 204th will continue training specific to the requirements of the Africa mission until the deploy next Spring."

FORT BUCHANAN, Puerto Rico – The readiness of soldiers is essential to not only the unit but the U.S. Army Reserve as a whole.

Special events arranged by the 1st Mission Support Command help soldiers remain seasoned in their respective Military Occupational Specialty.

Lt. Col Heath Dickinson, Staff Sgt. Darian Vigo and Sgt. 1st Class Marangelie Ramos discuss the ""Operation Trazando Camino"" and why it is essential in the talent retention mission.

Staff Sgt. Vigo explained that the event targets all personnel wanting to further their careers. However, it focuses on those in excess positions in the unit manning report of their respective units.

""The purpose, first and foremost, is to provide career enhancement opportunities for soldiers in excess positions that don't have a clear career path,"" said Lt. Col. Dickinson. ""We're offering MOS reclassification opportunities to enable them to move into a MOS with upward mobility, and that they can pursue promotions.""

According to Lt. Col. Dickinson, the operation broadens noncommissioned officers' experiences by also offering broadening opportunities such as to become a drill sergeant, instructor, or controller trainer.

As Sgt. 1st Class Ramos stated, these broadening opportunities can provide other enhancement skill sets that will set soldiers up for success.

""We hope that it will lead them to consider broadening assignments, which helps them develop,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Ramos.

Lt. Col. Dickinson reveals that this will benefit the talent retention mission since they have one of the highest levels of volunteerism in the Army Reserves."

WASHINGTON — The Army unveiled an engraving that honored the efforts of a Vietnam War veteran who led an inexperienced, outnumbered South Vietnamese company to victory nearly 60 years ago.

The service added Col. Paris Davis to the granite wall bearing the names of fellow Medal of Honor recipients at the National Museum of the U.S Army Wednesday.

“I am overwhelmed by what has happened today,” Davis said after the ceremony.

Davis’ actions in June 1965 not only assured U.S. forces a pivotal victory but prevented three American Soldiers from being captured.

President Joe Biden awarded Davis the Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony on March 3 and the Defense Department later inducted Davis into its Hall of Heroes March 6.

“It’s from your life … that this nation remembers you, honors you and owes you,” said Army Director of Staff, Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, who hosted the ceremony. “By making history, you have given peace to a nation that did not appreciate you nor appreciate the Vietnam War and from an Army that often did not see you as equal. And inside you weren’t equal; you were better.”

June 18, 1965, Davis, three Special Forces troops and a South Vietnamese company faced a large North Vietnamese force near Bong Son, Binh Dinh Province. Despite suffering several injuries, the 5th Special Forces Group armor officer continued to fire upon the enemy and engage in hand-to-hand combat.

Amid enemy rounds, then-Captain Davis rescued three injured U.S. Soldiers from enemy fire. Davis then refused medical evacuation and instead oversaw the transportation of the wounded troops.

“Throughout the day Paris Davis distinguished himself with bravery above and beyond what is humanly possible,” Piatt said. “Paris simply would not allow the enemy to win. He refused to fall and refused to let his team fall.”

Davis, one of the first Black Special Forces officers in the Army, continued to direct air and artillery fire upon the enemy. Davis’ efforts helped stop the South Vietnamese force from being overrun.

Davis thanked his friends, fellow veterans and family who stood by him until he received the nation’s highest military honor. The Army previously awarded him a Silver Star and Purple Heart.

“The power to do what you did is hard for even other Soldiers to understand,” Piatt said. “We admire your actions. The world has benefited from your deeds.”

In his remarks, Davis emphasized the importance of showing kindness and empathy to those who cannot help themselves or may be physically limited such as the disabled.

A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Davis attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He commissioned into the Army in 1959 and graduated from the service’s ranger and airborne schools in 1960.

Davis deployed first to Korea and then Vietnam in 1962 before being selected for Vietnam again in 1965. Davis went on to serve 26 years before retiring from the Army in 1985.

After the ceremony, Davis, his daughter, Regan Davis-Hopper, and his friends and family walked the garden grounds and looked upon his name and other recipients on the plaque.

236,Army SHARP professionals enhance skill sets at national training conference,https://www.army.mil/article/268985/army_sharp_professionals_enhance_skill_sets_at_national_training_conference,"The U.S Army Reserve’s 85th Support Command and First Army’s Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocates pause for a photo on Chartres Street during the 49th Annual National Organization for Victim Assistance training conference, July 31 – August 3, 2023, in New Orleans, Louisiana. This year’s NOVA conference consisted of nearly 100 different workshops where Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program professionals heard firsthand from subject matter experts who shared lessons learned and best practices.

NEW ORLEANS, La. – “This type of training conference is important for Army SHARP professionals because it expands our network and resources on a national level. When assisting Soldiers serving on active duty, in the reserve, and in the National Guard they are not always in one location,” said Sgt. 1st Class Joel Perkins, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, 157th Infantry Brigade. So being able to call upon a network of advocates whom we have met at the conference to help us in times of need is of great benefit to us.”

The Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program is designed to prevent the occurrence of sexual harassment and assault, provide victim advocacy to ensure prompt and sensitive care for victims, and encourage reporting of all occurrences by providing reporting options.

Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocates from across the U.S. Army attended an annual training conference hosted by the National Organization for Victim Assistance in New Orleans, July 31 – August 3, 2023.

NOVA is a nonprofit organization committed to the recognition and implementation of victim rights and services. In 2003 NOVA established the National Advocate Credentialing Program. Army SHARP professionals receive training certified by the NACP and are credentialed through the DOD Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program.

SARCs serve as a point of contact to coordinate sexual assault victim care. They track the services provided to victims starting from the initial report of a sexual assault and ensure that victims receive appropriate and compassionate care to overcome trauma.

The VA provides essential support and care to the victim to include providing non-clinical information on available options and resources to assist the victim in making informed decisions as they progress through resolution and healing. The VA maintains communications and contact with victim as needed for continued victim support.

“As Victim Advocates, we walk the victims through the process and ensure they have access to the resources they need. We put them on a path to feel like themselves again, and reclaim their voice,” said Sgt. 1st Class Stephanique Jones, Victim Advocate, 2-364th Training Support Battalion, 5th Armored Brigade.

Army SHARP professionals expressed the value of networking with the other approximately 2,000 victim assistance professionals in attendance at the event.

Staff Sgt. Chastity Caldwell, Victim Advocate, 3-313th Logistics Support Battalion, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, shared her thoughts on the value of the NOVA event.

“Attending this event allows us to meet with other professionals outside of the military who have had experiences that we might not normally encounter in our organizations. Connecting with those individuals provides us with knowledge that we might not have been taught in the Army schoolhouse and better prepares us to assist Soldiers in navigating them through those situations,” said Caldwell.

This year’s NOVA conference consisted of nearly 100 different workshops where Army SHARP professionals heard firsthand from subject matter experts who shared lessons learned and best practices.

“The face-to-face interaction with the presenters during the sessions has been fantastic. There is so much knowledge to draw upon, across a wide spectrum of topics, such as advocacy and trauma care,” said Sgt. 1st Class Leticia Rodriguez, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, First Army, Division West. “A venue like this gives you the opportunity to tailor your training to fit your interests and role. This training helps you build your knowledge base to be a better advocate and then teach others what you have learned here.”

Throughout the four-day training conference, Army SARCs and VAs emphasized the importance of seeking help for those who have been victimized.

“For Soldiers that have been sexually assaulted, more than anything else, seek council,” said Master Sgt. Alaine Latoya Gilpin, Victim Advocate, 4-409th Brigade Support Battalion, 4th Cavalry Multi-Functional Training Brigade. “Find the grit and courage to get the services you need. Do what feels most comfortable to you. For instance, the Army gives victims the option of restricted or unrestricted reporting. Some Soldiers do not feel comfortable informing their chain of command and having an unrestricted case, so Soldiers should use the options they feel are the best fit for them.”

Filing a restricted report allows Soldiers to confidentially disclose a sexual assault to a SARC or VA without notifying the command or law enforcement. Soldiers can change a restricted report to an unrestricted report at any time.

Filing an unrestricted report allows for an official investigation, command notification, and reporting to law enforcement. An unrestricted report can be made to a SARC, VA, law enforcement official, a commander or health care personnel.

Throughout the event, Army SHARP professionals further stressed that victims of sexual harassment and assault in the military have options for seeking help.

“Understand that you have the option go to any Sexual Assault Response Coordinator or Victim Advocate within the Department of Defense to get help. It does not matter what service the SHARP professional is with. We are all credentialed the same and we will take those reports and get the servicemembers the help that they need,” said Sgt. 1st Class John Sydnor, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, First Army, Division East. “If you don’t feel comfortable with the people where you are, then you can go to another place.”

If you are a victim of sexual assault in the military and need assistance, call the DoD Safe Helpline: 877-995-5247."

WASHINGTON — While on his way to Australia for exercise Talisman Sabre 23, 1st Lt. Jared McCully, transportation officer with the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary), found out he was invited to a local black-tie charity event.

He, alongside a few other U.S. service members and an Australian counterpart, were to be guests at the mayor’s annual banquet.

The team had not come prepared for such an event.

“Of course, when you’re limited to what you can pack in your duffel bag, a tuxedo isn’t what you anticipate bringing,” he said with a laugh. ‘We didn’t want to offend anyone by declining the invitation because we realized we were the only ones to get the guest of honor invite.”

In the small coastal town of Bowen in northeast Australia, finding appropriate attire for everyone invited would prove challenging. That’s why McCully’s commander left it to him.

I’m known as the guy who deals with the unique challenges, he acknowledged.

He went to work and found out the closest place to rent what they needed was almost three hours away. With no time to lose, he and a few other Soldiers hopped in a car and made the successful journey.

Not long after, he was sporting his tuxedo and meeting members of the community.

“It’s one of those things, where you don’t think while doing a mission in a small town in Australia that you’ll get sent to the black-tie charity event,” he said.

This was just one event in what turned out to be an action-packed exercise that he won’t soon forget.

After graduating from the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps at Gettysburg College, Pennsylvania in 2019, the Canton, Ohio native knew he wanted to work with Army watercraft. This capability allows combat forces to move equipment and sustainment supplies from sea to shore.

He specifically sought out the 7th Transportation Brigade and has worked there since joining the Army. For the last year, he has been in the role of port location analyst.

He goes to desired training locations months in advance and scouts to see if the area’s infrastructure and community support are compatible for joint logistics over-the-shore.

JLOTS is an operation that allows vehicles and equipment to move from sea to shore in remote environments that don’t offer port access. It gives the Department of Defense a way to continuously provide support and sustainment for troops over a long period of time.

“I see logistics over-the-shore as being a very essential program for the DOD,” McCully said. “This is going to be one of those tool sets that provides us with the adaptability to access places that not many other forces in the world have access to and to also sustain ourselves.”

Planning for the JLOTS operation at Talisman Sabre 23 started almost 14 months ago. After working with the Australian Defence Force, talking with subject matter experts, and having U.S. Army divers survey the possible locations, the team received approval to conduct operations at Kings Beach in Bowen.

McCully and the team working JLOTS arrived in Australia weeks before the kickoff of the exercise. They quickly started setting things up.

JLOTS is a 24/7 operation with the crews working in 12-hour shifts. Much of the work is done at sea when weather permits. The team must receive the equipment, label it and prep it for the move.

“There is a lot of work being done behind the scenes,” he said.

Being one of the senior members of the operation, McCully, who is also the JLOTS project manager, is often tasked with helping solve problems as they arise. He is also the one who gets to brief and escort distinguished visitors to explain the operational capabilities.

“Most people don’t know what Army watercraft are,” he said. “Trying to get stakeholder buy-in and support from external organizations has been one of my key focuses during this exercise.”

He met with community leaders, U.S. and Australian senior military leaders, congressional staff and Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth.

Prior to the secretary's arrival, McCully learned he would be promoting to captain and saw the dates would coincide with the visit. He connected with her team to see if she would lead the ceremony for him and other service members promoting or reenlisting.

She agreed, and they worked it in as the culminating event of her time at JLOTS.

“It’s one of those fun stories that I’ll get to tell for the rest of my life,” he said.

McCully not only engaged with senior leaders during the exercise, but also with the local community. U.S. service members participated in several community engagement events while in Australia.

They visited local schools, community job fairs and attended the occasional banquet. These engagements provided opportunities to build strong bonds with the community and Australian partners.

“This has probably been one of the best training areas we have ever been to,” he explained. “I want [the community] to have a positive impression of us. We’re not here to take advantage of the resources. We’re here to call this a second home for a little while, even if it’s just for a few months.”

McCully said he made lasting memories while exploring Australia and working with his teammates to display the JLOTS capability.

After more than a month of preparation and days of execution during the exercise, the team was able to bring equipment ashore using a causeway ferry. The harsh weather conditions prevented the team from using their preferred method of a trident pier, an 1,800-foot floating bridge that connects ship to shore.

“It’s not every day the mission you’re doing is arguably the most important mission in the Army,” he said. “Expeditionary logistics is not designed to be easy, but we are here with our partners to take on a mission many would shy away from.”

That event was the culmination of more than a year of planning and weeks of work for McCully and the team. The job he accomplished during that time did not go unnoticed by those around him.

“Jared was instrumental to the success of the JLOTS mission across a variety of facets,” said Col. Samuel Miller, commander, 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary). “From the early stages of operational planning, to coordinating with stakeholders on numerous key leader visits, Jared took the initiative far beyond what you would expect of a junior officer.”

Now, as the exercise ends, planning will start for the next JLOTS in the Indo-Pacific in 2024.

CAMP ATTERBURY, Ind. — Approximately 160 U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from the 7212nd Medical Support Unit, Rochester, Minnesota; the 7215th Medical Support Unit, St. Louis, Missouri; and the 7405th Troop Medical Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota performed medical and dental validation for active duty, National Guard, and Reserve component Soldiers that took part in Mobilization Exercise Level III, or MOBEX III, as part of Operation Pershing Strike 2023 in Camp Atterbury, Indiana, July 10 to August 5, 2023.

MOBEXs are annual training exercise of varying levels to assess all Mobilization Force Generation Installations and their capabilities in deploying troops en masse.

""What we are training for currently is for in case we have a large-scale mobilization operation, or LSMO,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Arvie Webster, a family nurse practitioner assigned to the 7453rd Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Mesa, Arizona, and the officer-in-charge of the Army Reserve medical task force.

""So, if we have to deploy a bunch of forces all at once, we got to make sure that they are medically cleared as well as hitting these other training points, whether it is training that they going to do when they are deployed and also getting them ready and their families ready,"" said Webster.

Despite just three days of reception, staging, onward movement and integration, Soldiers from both MSUs and the TMC processed and supported the large-scale influx of active duty, Guard and Reserve Soldiers prior to and during their MOBEX III engagements.

""We also got 1,500 Soldiers through the soldier readiness processing portion, medically and dentally ready,"" Webster said. ""The troop medical clinic also saw over 275 Soldiers. What (U.S. Army Medical Command's) standard is that they want to make sure that we can get at least 40 Soldiers in an hour through soldier readiness processing, but what we've actually done in this exercise is we exceeded that goal.""

Eric J. Holcomb, 51st Governor of the State of Indiana, officially recognized the 7212nd MSU's prodigious efforts in exceeding that standard.

""Some of the units were so impressed with the care that we provided that actually the unit was awarded the Indiana Commendation Medal,"" Webster said. ""So it was a huge success, this whole entire exercise.""

During periods of downtime, many of the medical Soldiers pursued cross-training opportunities and other learning experiences.

""When we only had one or two patients in the TMC, we would also do training with the providers for the different specialties that they had so we could get specialized training, and everybody loved it,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Sgt.

It was constant learning, and it made a big difference on how everybody here in the TMC enjoyed being here,"" said Yuzenko. ""At the same time, we were making the best of it and making sure that everybody has optimal training and the best experience and be able to get the most knowledge out of this mission.""

Although the medical task force is comprised of Soldiers indigenous to their units as well as cross-level augmentees, they nonetheless established and maintained unit cohesion throughout MOBEX III.

""For the most part, everybody worked well together,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Alicia Wheat, an automated logistical specialist assigned to the 7215th MSU. ""We were able to do all stations like dental, (automated neuropsychological assessment metrics), the medical portion, labs, immunization and periodic health assessments.""

Due to her positive experience in working with Army Reserve medical Soldiers, Wheat said that she is inspired to pursue military occupational specialty reclass into a practical nursing specialist.

""It's been honestly really wonderful to be here and actually have this experience and see how it works and see what I have in store once I actually reclass,"" Wheat said.

Lastly, Webster said that the rapid-fire transition between the walk-crawl-run phases would have not been possible without the groundwork laid by Active Guard Reserve, or AGR, Soldiers involved in the planning and development process.

""A large component of this is our AGR Soldiers that are consistent for us, so even though leadership may change during yearlong planning, those AGR Soldiers are a constant and gave us the whole entire backbone to make this a successful operation,"" Webster said. ""AGR Soldiers should have a huge shout-out to how much of an intricate role they play and how they lay the foundation work for us so we're able to go in and do our jobs.""

""If you think about all of those different Soldiers from all different areas, and how they were able to flow together and make such a successful mission, it's amazing. It just shows the dedication and professionalism and the subject matter experts and knowledge that they bring with them,"" Webster said."

WASHINGTON — A panel of Army senior leaders will select 12 Soldiers and civilians to learn the intricacies of cyber strategy and policymaking.

As part of the service’s broader effort to retain and recruit its top talent, the first annual Secretary of the Army’s Cyber Strategic Seminar will give participants the rare opportunity to receive exposure to top Army and government leaders.

The proposed activities in the nine-month session include meetings with officials from across the federal government, industry and academia, and practical exercises with Army senior leadership. The dozen finalists will also brief Army senior leaders at the conclusion of the program.

The seminar, jointly administered by Army Principal Cyber Advisor Michael Sulmeyer and Army Cyber Command commander, Lt. Gen. Maria Barrett, will also help identify and train the Army’s top talent in cyber security.

“What we're looking for is to develop leaders who have a particular aptitude for cyber-related issues,” Sulmeyer said. “And hopefully, they will use this program to increase their awareness and creativity around how cyber operations fit into multi-domain operations, [and] how cyber operations can inform operations in other domains.”

As the Army competes for top talent in cyber security, the seminar will showcase career opportunities in the field.

The Soldiers and Army civilians will discuss topics that include weapons systems security, intelligence support to cyber functions, the defense industrial base and acquisition support to cyber operations. Participants will gain an understanding of partnerships with foreign allies to defend and secure critical data, as well as meet with leaders in cyber security across government, the private sector, and academia.

The dozen selectees will include Soldiers in the grades of sergeant to sergeant first class, warrant officer 1 through chief warrant officer 3, and first lieutenant to major, and civilians GS-9 through GS-13. Finalists must have a minimum secret clearance and be available to attend all sessions of the seminar.

The group will meet monthly for a different activity planned by Army Cyber Command. The application period began last month and ends Aug. 11. The participants will be announced at the Association of the U.S. Army annual meeting in October, with the seminar set to begin shortly after.

The search will not be limited to individuals in cyber or tech-related positions. Soldiers and civilians in all military occupational specialties and career fields can apply.

“What we wanted to do is to identify the Army's top talent across enlisted [Soldiers], warrant officers and civilians and provide a way to broaden their exposure to strategic policymaking, to be able to take them to different venues,” said Sulmeyer, who previously served as senior policy advisor for U.S. Cyber Command. “Our hope is that [the seminar] is a tool not just to develop their careers and make them into even stronger Army leaders, but also to retain them in the force.”

Cyber and data centricity have increasingly become important factors in multi-domain operations. Secretary Wormuth has prioritized recruiting Soldiers with expertise in the field.

“[Secretary Wormuth] has placed such a premium on strategic recruitment and retention,” Sulmeyer said. “[The seminar] was a way that she thought the Army could lead in identifying our top talent and giving them exposure to strategic cyber issues.”

Interested Soldiers and civilians can apply at the Secretary of the Army's Cyber Strategic Seminar SharePoint. Candidates must self-nominate to apply but will need a supervisor endorsement if they are selected for an interview. Finalists will be selected based on an interview and written application.

By Capt. Carl Amolat, 1st TSC-OCP Safety Officer

During the 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command’s deployment in Kuwait, the Safety Office of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command Operational Command Post noted an uptick in sports-related injuries.

Several sports injuries involved overly ambitious physical training goals and wildly ambitious strength and conditioning plans as root causes. The saying “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” readily springs to mind.

Prior planning is that preventative measure. What goes into it is a realistic understanding of one’s capabilities, limitations, and environmental and work conditions. Factors such as age, injury history, sleep schedule/hygiene, acclimatization, and physical training history all play into developing the starting point.

Having established this starting point and knowing the desired goal makes planning for said desired goal a lot more accurate. This is where consistent and balanced effort over time comes into play. Sgt. Maj. Shannon Thornbury, 143d ESC Support Operations Sergeant Major, a kinesiologist in civilian life, has these focal points for balanced strength and conditioning plans:

Aerobic. The core of any fitness program should include some form of continuous movement. Examples include swimming, running, and dancing.

Strength. These exercises help increase muscle power and strength. Examples include resistance training, plyometrics, weightlifting, and sprinting.

Calisthenics. These moves are usually performed without gym equipment using large muscle groups. They’re done at a medium aerobic pace. Examples include lunges, situps, pushups, and pull-ups.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT). This type of exercise includes repetitions of short bursts of high-intensity activity followed by low-intensity exercises or rest periods.

Boot camps. These are timed-based, high-intensity circuits that combine aerobic and resistance exercises.

Balance or Stability. These exercises are designed to strengthen muscles and improve body coordination. Examples include Pilates, tai chi poses, and core-strengthening exercises.

Flexibility. These exercises help muscle recovery, maintain range of motion, and prevent injuries. Examples include yoga or individual muscle-stretch movements.

It is possible to combine one or more of these areas in a training session, i.e., purely aerobic work such as 10-20 minutes of swimming following a strength training session without overstraining. However, This requires some experience and being aware of one’s limitations.

It seems contradictory to intentionally look away from the type A personality impulse to precisely do that. However, an injury that either sends a Soldier home early or puts that Soldier on a limited duty profile for a lengthy period is ultimately not a prudent risk.

It may be frustrating, and daresay discouraging, to watch younger, stronger, and fitter Soldiers move heavier weights, run faster, and play harder on the sports pitch. However, bear in mind it took a fair amount of consistency on their part to get to that point.

Suppose one is starting from a previously sedentary lifestyle before mobilization. In that case, it will be a recipe for injury to copy training programs used by the more athletic Soldiers previously mentioned.

It requires a certain degree of self-discipline to train consistently, day in and day out, and trust the training process without a bit of envy of more physically capable peers. But consistency gets sustainable results and avoids or mitigates injuries. Small, continuous improvements add up over time."

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait -- “Maximum disclosure, minimum delay.” Like a prize fighter sparring in the gym, this is something that is pounded into service members studying to become public affairs mass communication specialists at the Defense Information School to remind themselves to provide the American public unclassified information about the U.S. Military and its activities. Aiding the public affairs office, unit public affairs representatives (UPAR) are non-public affairs Soldiers identified to increase public affairs (PA) capability across the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility (USCENTCOM AOR). On July 25, 2023, U.S. Army Central (USARCENT) public affairs Sgt. Maj. Jeremy Bunkley held a UPAR Brief to inform UPARs of their responsibilities and capabilities, at Camp Buehring, Kuwait.

“Due to the distributed nature of forces throughout the CENTCOM AOR, the role of the UPAR is imperative in assisting higher echelon PA in telling the holistic public affairs and CENTCOM story,” said Bunkley. “Public affairs officers (PAOs) and noncommissioned officers (NCOs) are assigned at the brigade level and higher. Because of this, the role of the UPARs is extremely important at the battalion level and lower, as they serve closely with battalion commanders as lower-level subject matter experts on PA plans and policies, gather video and photography to create public affairs communication products, and conducting media opportunities at the battalion level.”

Army Regulation 360-1 defines the PA Program as the guide to conducting public communication strategy for information, command information, leader engagements, and community outreach activities directed toward both the external and internal publics with interest in the Department of Defense. PA policies and principles apply across the range of military and peacetime operations and states the guidelines for UPARs.

UPARs serve closely with battalion commanders as lower-level subject matter experts on PA plans and policies on embedding the media, engaging the local media, and conducting media opportunities at the battalion level. Commanders appoint a UPAR to any unit that is not supported by a designated public affairs officer.

“During my time in public affairs, our field has constantly been understrength,” said California Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Lani Pascual, the public affairs operations NCO, assigned to 40th Infantry Division, Task Force Spartan. “UPARs make a huge impact by augmenting our collective efforts. They are the on-ground experts who are embedded and can cover their unit's missions.”

Pascual added that the PA mission is information-based and to be successful they must connect to Soldiers and glean their stories. UPARs can share the experiences of the Soldiers they serve with that the public affairs office may not have the opportunity to know.

Prior to being appointed a UPAR with 642nd ASB, Spc. Courtney Scholl, a human resources specialist and UPAR, assigned to HSC, 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, had not used a professional camera but was happy with the opportunity and personal growth that she found.

“I had never done something like this before,” said Scholl. “This was my first time using a professional camera and taking photos. I soon began to enjoy this extra duty that I had along with my everyday tasks. As the UPAR for my battalion I hope to broadcast all that Soldiers are doing in hopes for other people to understand what Soldiers do, their impact on the mission and the Army as a whole.”

Army Reserve 1st Lt. Larry Subramanian, a transportation officer assigned to 382nd Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, wanted to attend UPAR training because he wanted to share the experiences of his unit with like-minded Soldiers.

“I witness great work achieved by the CSSB team to support our units daily,” said Subramanian. “UPARs give us an opportunity to provide to our higher commands, allies, families, friends and the American taxpayer exposure to our day-to-day work and we are appreciative of what they do.”

USARCENT operates under the values that people, partnerships, readiness, and innovation are the best way to sustain and improve the operational practicality that leads to mission success.

“Ultimately, teamwork and information sharing are key,” said Bunkley. “…especially for the Soldiers who are new to the UPAR responsibilities. We wanted to bring them together to share the USARCENT commander’s public affairs campaign plan and discuss the ways in which they can best support that and their own commander’s communications objectives. This is an important additional duty, and we want them to know that as public affairs practitioners, we are here to help them succeed… this was a great turnout, and it shows how important winning in the information environment is to our commanders across the USARCENT footprint.”"

CAMP ATTERBURY, Ind. – It’s a recipe for cooperation when active Army, Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers train together in a challenging environment. Add some Indiana heat and you have Pershing Strike.

“Pershing Strike is a yearly exercise that’s led by U.S. Forces Command and executed by First Army. It’s really to test the Mobilization Force Generation Installation’s ability to conduct large scale mobilization operations in support of large-scale combat operations, “said Col. Troy Mills, Commander, 157th Infantry Brigade, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “The active and reserve component bring in expertise in their fields based on Military Occupational Specialty or branch, as well as being the subject matter expertise for that MOS. We provide that relevant training to the National Guard and reserve component units as they come through Camp Atterbury.”

One of those units is the Kentucky National Guard’s 2113th Transportation Company based in Paducah, Kentucky.

“We made it through the train ups and evaluations here at Camp Atterbury as a more cohesive team,” said 1st Lt. Hope Smith, Company Commander, 2113th Transportation Company, Paducah, Kentucky. “Probably the most effective training the unit received was the convoy training.”

Convoy training was one of the training opportunities Soldiers conducted and were evaluated on, under the watchful eyes of the observer coach/trainers.

“We will be checking on safety. Making sure everything is safe,” said Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Nicodemus, OC/T, 1-290th Transportation Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “One of the biggest things is that Soldiers know how to conduct proper reporting procedures and make sure they have the correct protective equipment before they go on the convoy.”

Before the convoy left, Nicodemus checked on communications between the trucks.

“If they don’t have communications, that’s a concern to me,” he said.

Part of the training focused on dealing with civilian protestors.

A Soldier who participated in the convoy, Staff Sgt. Brent Cope, 88 Mike, Truck Driver, 2113th Transportation Company, Paducah, Kentucky, said the training provided Soldiers with a shift in thinking about how to react to protestors that they might encounter.

“One of the key factors is everybody has the mindset that we’re still in Iraq and Afghanistan. When we were briefed on the convoy, we were told to treat the protestors like civilians,” said Cope. “Be kind and polite and treat them like neighbors, not (threats). Know the country you are going to be in. Customs and courtesies go a long way.”

“It’s all about getting (repetitions) and sets before they get into theater. The Soldiers are getting the opportunity to haul supplies,” said Col. Timothy Starke, G-3, Kentucky National Guard, Paducah, Kentucky. “It’s great to be able to do it at Camp Atterbury. We see Pershing Strike as a great opportunity for our unit to be validated here. As part of the foundations of training, the most important units are led by staff sergeants. They need reps on communications and Soldier skills. We must be able to operate de-centralized.”

Helping Soldiers identify areas for improvement and maintain good practices is the job of the OC/T.

“We are not here to point out their flaws. We are here to have them self-identify. What we mean by self-identify is to learn how to do better and succeed in the mission,” said Staff Sgt. Jessica Ecker, OC/T, 2-338th Training Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “It’s also to identify what they did well and continue to include that in the mission.”

Ecker, a medical logistics Soldier with 14 years of Army Reserve service, values her role as an OC/T.

“I like being an OC/T because I’m integrated with so many different military occupational specialties. It helps me grow as a Soldier,” Ecker said.

Army Reserve Soldiers assigned to the 157th Infantry Brigade conducted annual training while operating as support elements to Pershing Strike. They practiced skills such as firing the 50 Caliber machine gun.

“I’m firing the 50-caliber machine gun for the first time,” said Sgt. Devon Diel, 25 uniform, Systems Support Specialist, 3-411th Logistics Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “I’m working with my assistant gunner who lets me know where the targets are and how to adjust my weapon.”

Spc. George Cooper, 91 Bravo, Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic, 3-411th, (LSBN) Camp Atterbury, Indiana helped feed the ammunition and assisted Diel with targeting.

“It’s fun to shoot. The range instructors give us guidance on how far out the target is and how to adjust fire,” said Cooper, who served four years on active duty and is completing his first year as an Army Reserve Soldier.

“It’s an adjustment being an Army Reserve Soldier compared to active duty,” Cooper said.

Soldiers also practiced land navigation using a magnetic compass.

“It’s good Soldier training. It’s a relief from paperwork and meetings. It’s nice to do something fundamental,” said Capt. Robert Duncanson, Assistant S-3, 3-338th Transportation Support Battalion, Blacklick, Ohio. “As an OC/T unit, it is essential to be solid in the fundamentals in order to give good feedback to the units we are training.”

Duncanson, a public affairs student at Ohio State University, touched on what his service is like in the Army Reserve.

“What I really appreciate is the camaraderie and professionalism of the Army Reserve Soldiers that I work with,” said Duncanson. “It’s reassuring to have so many leaders who can work independently and accomplish a task on short notice.”"

Gen. Ronald Blanck, left, pins on brigadier general rank on Mack Hill, center, during a promotion ceremony.

WASHINGTON — More than 50 years ago, former Surgeon General Ronald Blanck received a harrowing introduction to the Army.

Then a young military physician, he deployed to the central highlands of Vietnam in September 1968, treating Soldiers on the front lines.

Blanck, like many of his peers at the time, volunteered for the mission in the days before the U.S. military began drafting young men to serve in the Vietnam War. During the conflict, Blanck focused primarily on preventative care: immunizations and vaccinations.

“Vietnam kind of shaped my view of the military,” said Blanck, 81. “That loyalty, selfless service … it really meshed with the way I wanted to practice medicine.”

For 14 months Blanck treated Soldiers, sometimes tending to the wounded in the field in the Vietnamese towns of An Khê and Buôn Ma Thuột. He often had to adapt to the challenges of the environment.

Blanck, one of the first doctors of osteopathic medicine to serve in the Army, recalled one instance when members of a firing battery became ill from drinking contaminated water. He built a makeshift medical bay in the dining facility, setting up beds and inserting IVs into the arms of the Soldiers. He also treated the Vietnamese people for bubonic plague.

After Vietnam, Blanck completed his medical residency, that included time researching tropical diseases in Malaysia. Now board certified in internal medicine, Blanck decided in 1973 that he wanted to make the Army a career.

In the three decades that followed, the native of Ephrata, Pennsylvania would rise to numerous leadership positions including commanding Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and eventually becoming the Army’s 39th Surgeon General from 1996-2000.

Blanck, who retired as a lieutenant general in 2000, recently reflected on the evolution of the Army Medical Corps, which celebrated its 248th anniversary Thursday. He said that the Corps has shifted from a physician-centric focus to an emphasis on the collective efforts of the nurses, medical technicians, pharmacists and social workers. The Army Medical Corps includes 4,000 physicians that specialize in various disciplines in clinical, research and operational medicine.

“The physician is critical to most of the care provided, but does so now as a contributing part of the team, listening to others in the team, and together coming up with the best solution for a patient,” Blanck said. “That's the evolution going from a medical corps being physician centric to now much more of a team effort. Someone once told me, medical care today is a team sport.”

While the Army’s Medical Corps and military medicine cover trauma, orthopedics, and intensive care, one aspect of its services often gets overlooked. Blanck said preventative care, like the services Blanck provided to Soldiers in Vietnam, plays a critical role in disease prevention.

“Trying to keep Soldiers … healthy to fight is the first and foremost and part of our job,” he said. “And it’s to take care of those who are injured or wounded. So it’s evolved into something that really takes all of use working together.”

At Walter Reed, one of the nation’s largest military medical facilities, Blanck founded a Gulf War veteran’s treatment center built in 1993 specifically to treat Gulf War Syndrome, an unknown illness that causes muscle and joint pain, dizziness and memory lapses. The facility later became a deployment health center.

“We would work with people and say, ‘Hey, we know you're sick; we acknowledge it; we don't know what it is. Now, let us help you deal with your symptoms, pass the PT test,” Blanck said. “That was a monumental effort and meant a lot of people could continue to function instead of having depression, sitting at home or being discharged from the military.”

Blanck became the first assistant dean of students at Bethesda’s Uniformed Services University, an institution chartered by Congress, and he also held teaching positions at Georgetown, George Washington and the Howard School of Medicine.

As chief of Army Medicine at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, where each of the medical residents he trained successfully passed their board exams. In addition to serving as a resident at Walter Reed, Blanck also commanded both the U.S. Army Berlin Hospital and the Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center.

After his appointment as the Army’s highest ranking medical officer, Blanck instituted changes that still influence Army medicine today. He made education and medical training a higher priority and assured that qualified physicians and doctors were appointed to critical positions in the field. During Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, the Army saw even greater emphasis on readiness and training.

Blanck redefined the area of responsibility of the Office of the Surgeon General and opened the position to more career fields, allowing nurses and others the opportunity to eventually serve as surgeons general. In 2012, then-Lt. Gen. Patricia Horoho became the first nurse and first woman to serve as surgeon general.

Blanck also started what would become an eight-year process for the then 91B combat medics to become 68W combat medic specialists, resulting in better trained and highly skilled medics. Under the new military occupational specialty, all 68W medics qualify as emergency medical technicians and received training in advanced airway skills. Combat medic specialists now must recertify every two years to keep themselves MOS-qualified.

Retired Army Medical Command Sgt. Maj. Walt Scott said Blanck created a welcome workplace during his time as surgeon general. Blanck approved an enlisted master’s program, allowing senior non-commissioned officers the opportunity to attend graduate school.

“Lt. Gen. Blanck is a leader that was always forward-thinking, approachable, has a wildly great sense of humor, and [was] a professional that always has time for you,” Scott wrote. “Lt. Gen. Blanck created an environment where Soldiers and employees would run to him, not away.”

Blanck closed some hospitals while retaining the same number of staff, he said. Blanck added more medical personnel to larger hospitals including what is now Fort Liberty, North Carolina and Fort Moore, Georgia.

“We were running hospitals where they should have been clinics, and we were running clinics where there was no justification for having … care available,” Blanck said. “So I closed some hospitals, downsized some others, not people, I kept the same number of people.”

“You need to have patients coming into our facilities for us to take care of them, which is how we stay current; how we continue to practice and [be] ready for deployment,” he said. “And if you don't have those patients, then you're not training for deployment. You're not emphasizing readiness.”

During his tenure as Army surgeon general, Blanck worked closely with the surgeons general of the Navy and the Air Force and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs to establish lifetime TRICARE for veterans, including those over 65.

Blanck said that he remains against reductions in military medical care. He said cutting services at Army and military hospitals and treatment centers has sometimes sent patients to civilian care. Patients should be brought back to the direct care system, Blanck added.

Since 2009, Blanck has served as chairman of Martin, Blanck and Associates, whose offices sits on the south side of the District of Columbia suburb, Alexandria, Virginia. The company provides assistance to firms in federal, state and nonprofit sectors and has an expertise in federal healthcare systems and policy.

Although he retired from the Army 23 years ago, Blanck still has kept his medical license for five decades and occasionally will take appointments at clinics.

And sometimes, he makes house calls.

FORT BUCHANAN, Puerto Rico—Standing in formation at an assembly hall filled with over 300 guests were the leadership and soldiers of the 166th Regional Support Group, 210th Regional Support Group, and the Caribbean Readiness Group, representing over 4,700 soldiers assigned to the 1st Mission Support Command.

Various distinguished guests were in attendance, including the Hon. Omar J. Marrero Diaz, the secretary of state of Puerto Rico; the Hon. Luz Arce, the former senator for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the Hon. Nellie Gorbea, the former secretary of state of Rhode Island.

As well as high-ranking officials such as Maj. Gen. (Retired) Felix A. Santoni, the emeritus civilian aide to the secretary of the Army for Puerto Rico, Brig. Gen. (Retired) Fernando Fernandez, the former 1st MSC commanding general, and Gen. Raul Rodriguez, the commander of the 103rd Sustainment Command, eagerly gathered to witness the exchange of leadership from one commanding officer to another in a traditional change of command ceremony on July 30, 2023.

For this occasion, the official party consisted of Maj. Gen. Robert D. Harter, the 81st Readiness Division commanding general, Col. Carlos M. Caceres, the 1st MSC outgoing commander; and Col. Carlos E. Gorbea, the 1st MSC incoming commander.

Once the sound of Ruffles and Flourishes was completed, Chaplain Capt. Farlin Reynoso led the invocation, bringing people of different faiths into a moment of reflection—afterward, the master of ceremony, Maj. Kathryne Iaccuzi recognized the devotion and loyal support of the 1st Mission Support Command soldiers and their families.

With ceremonial precision, 1st Sgt. Osvaldo Morales marched forward and requested permission to post the colors, to which Col. Caceres loudly responded: Post the colors!

With the color guard marching in perfect unison, the master of ceremony narrated the history of the 1st Mission Support Command, reminding the audience of the rich legacy of the federal organization.

Consequently, the official party stepped forward and rearranged themselves to initiate the transfer of authority. Command Sgt. Maj. Michael P. Meunier II passed the colors to Col. Caceres as his last official act as his command sergeant major.

In the same manner, Col. Caceres presented the colors to Maj. Gen. Harter relinquishing his command and showing gratitude for the opportunity to lead and serve the soldiers of the 1st MSC.

Finally, Maj. Gen. Harter passed the colors to Col. Gorbea, entrusting him with the responsibility and care of the command as the new commanding officer for the 1st MSC.

""By authority of paragraph 2-2D, AR 600-20, the undersigned assumes command of the 1st Mission Support Command, effective July 30, 2023,"" declared Maj. Iaccuzi. ""Signed, Carlos E. Gorbea, colonel, United States Army Reserve, commanding.""

The colors, now under Col. Gorbea's care, were passed back to Command Sgt. Maj. Meunier as a symbol of trust as he will now serve as the senior enlisted leader and advisor to him.

As the transfer of authority was completed, Maj. Harter approached the podium to deliver his remarks. He emphasized the milestone and relevance of the Army Reserve organization in the region.

""What do we have in the 1st Mission Support Command?"" Maj. Harter asked. ""Around 71 units, thousands of soldiers spread across Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands not only providing warfighting support in defense of the Nation but also, providing support during emergencies and natural disasters.""

Afterwards, Col. Caceres delivered his farewell speech, reflecting on the shared accomplishments and expressing profound admiration towards the 1st Mission Support Command and its members.

""Commanding the 1st Mission Support Command has been an amazing experience, and it is hard to say goodbye,"" said Col. Caceres. ""As the saying goes, times fly when you are having fun, and for Sonia (Col. Caceres' wife) and I, it truly feels like it was yesterday since we arrived because it has been a gratifying experience.""

Col. Caceres, a military intelligence officer, assumed authority of the 1st Mission Support Command on October 16, 2021. His awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary and Service Medal. He is married to Sonia Caceres and has two daughters, Veronica and Valerie.

Lastly, Col. Gorbea gratefully accepted the responsibility of leading the organization, highlighting his vision and commitment to fulfilling his commanding officer role.

""The 1st Mission Support Command has an honorable legacy hence moving on to the future, I would like to maintain its ability to provide combat-ready soldiers to deploy across the world,"" said Col. Gorbea. ""I believe the 1st Mission Support Command has much to offer the world.""

Col. Gorbea is married to Andrea Hermann, and they have two children, Stella and Rafael Gorbea. He was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He graduated from Princeton University in 1998 with a Bachelor Degree in Mechanical and Aerospatiale Engineering. He possesses a Master of Business Administration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Doctoral Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Munich Technical University.

WASHINGTON — Only 43 days separate the creations of the Continental Army that was formed by the original 13 American colonies and the Army Medical Corps. That short period of time speaks to the importance the corps plays in the mission of the Army.

Several current and former Medical Corps officers shared their thoughts on the corps, their careers and providing health care.

“Military medicine is invaluable to the security of this nation,” said retired Maj. Gen. Jeff Clark, former chief of the Medical Corps. “We in the Medical Corps are a part of an overall team that together is able to provide world-class health care.”

Since July 27, 1775, Medical Corps officers, previously referred to as surgeons, have provided a continuity of care to veterans, military members and their families.

Today, more than 4,000 physicians form a corps of 40 specialties in three main areas: operational, clinical and research medicine. These Soldiers do everything from surgery to vaccine research to delivering babies.

Helping service members bring new life into the world is where Lt. Col. Haroon Samar, family physician, got his start.

As a resident at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center on Fort Cavazos, he helped a young military family during the pregnancy of their first child. The couple trusted him so much they asked him again to help deliver their second son a year later.

“It was really an important time for me to be truly appreciative of the opportunity to be a part of such big moments in their lives,” he said. “I think those moments left an impression on me because I realized just how much trust these young families and these Soldiers put in me. I did my best to learn and grow from that and be as good a doctor as I could be.”

Army physicians go through years of medical school and training to take care of patients. The amount of work can be demanding, but can also fuel their passion.

“I loved everything about it,” said Lt. Col. Elizabeth Polfer of her time on surgery rotation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “The long hours didn’t bother me because I enjoyed everything I was doing.”

Medical Corps officers enter service at the rank of captain and can take many paths in their careers. They can stay in a specialty field or bounce around between different areas.

Clinical medicine provides care on military installations. Operational medicine supports Soldiers in the field, while academic and research medicine focuses on education, training and research at Army medical centers and laboratories.

This flexibility to pursue different avenues allows Medical Corps officers to gain valuable experience.

“I think that is what the Army continues to do and probably does better than any other job, is to just enrich you with job opportunities for growth development and leadership,” Samar said.

Medical Corps officers have made significant impacts on health care throughout history.

Maj. Jonathan Letterman started the first Ambulance Corps to help wounded Soldiers on the battlefield during the Civil War. Maj. Walter Reed led experiments in the early 1900s that discovered the link between mosquitos and yellow fever. During WWI and WWII, Maj. Gen. Norman T. Kirk organized new treatments for amputees.

In the early 2000s, retired Lt. Gen. James Peake led a study to improve battlefield survivability. The study showed most patients were dying before they reached a hospital from either blood loss or compromised airways.

The study led to increased general training and the creation of the Combat Lifesaver Course where Soldiers learn how to apply tourniquets and insert a common airway.

“Soldiers who receive CLS training are better equipped to provide critical medical care when it’s needed,” said retired Maj. Gen. George Weightman, former chief of the Medical Corps Branch. “Commanders can rest assured that their troops are prepared for any situation that arises.”

While advances in medicine and ways to treat patients continue to evolve, the basic function of the Medical Corps remains the same.

“The privilege of serving two professions simultaneously — arms and medicine — being patient-focused, knowing that’s why we are important to the team, does not change even though the world around us changes and what the Army is asked to do changes,” Clark said. “I think those fundamentals are enduring.”

The Army Medical Department consists of the Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, Medical Specialist Corps, Veterinary Corps, Army Nurse Corps, Army Dental Corps and the Civilian Corps.

These groups, along with Enlisted Medical Corps, work together as a team to deliver care to patients around the world.

“I came to Army Medicine because the Army gave me a chance to pursue a dream to be a doctor,” Samar said. “I’ve stayed for as long as I have because I got the chance to a part of a wonderful team. That has kept me in this long and I’ll continue serving because the Army continues to surround me with awesome people.”

The Army recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of TRADOC and FORSCOM. (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — This year marks 50 years since the founding of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and U.S. Army Forces Command.

“TRADOC today is not exactly like the TRADOC established in 1973, but throughout that time, the command has persevered as an organization and fulfilled its numerous missions — especially training” said Britt McCarley, TRADOC chief historian, who has been with the organization since 1988.

TRADOC and FORSCOM were founded during World War II as one organization known as the Army Ground Forces. When formed in 1942, the Army Ground Forces was the largest training organization ever established in the U.S. with 780,000 troops, which peaked at 12.2 million Soldiers by July 1, 1943.

After several reorganizations, Army Ground Forces finally settled into the two organizations they are today: TRADOC and FORSCOM. TRADOC and FORSCOM’s split 50 years ago came from a need to support two separate missions.

“TRADOC recruits and trains the next generation of Soldiers — develops adaptive leaders, helps modernize the force and shapes the culture of the Army. TRADOC was born out of innovation and that is still our mission today,” said Gen. Gary M. Brito, commanding general, TRADOC. Brito added that TRADOC provides institutional training throughout a Soldier’s career.

“TRADOC is improving our Army’s ability to fight and win large scale combat operations through the conduct of multi-domain operations.”

In addition to recruiting, training and education, TRADOC also establishes standards and drives improvement in the Army wherever it can. Whereas FORSCOM’s mission is to train and prepare the force to be globally responsive to build and sustain readiness for commander requirements.

“For me, the most rewarding part [of working for TRADOC] is the chance to be part of an organization that contributes to the common good of the United States,” McCarley said. “Defense of the nation is fundamental to the life of any country, and the opportunity to contribute to the larger American defense mission is the most rewarding part of my civilian service.”

On average, TRADOC trains more than 750,000 Soldiers and service members every year in its 32 Army training centers.

“I could not be more honored to serve with the dedicated team of civilian and military members, who support our Army mission every day,” Brito said. “But this 50-year anniversary isn’t TRADOC’s alone — it carries added significance to the Army as it is also the anniversary of U.S. Army Forces Command and the all-volunteer force. I look forward to our next 50 years and what the future has in store for our great Army.”

GEORGETOWN, Guyana – As the Caribbean-focused multinational exercise, TRADEWINDS 23, hits full stride in Guyana, a team of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and Dominican Republic instructors traveled by land and sea to various training sites to speak about humanitarian law, human rights and Women, Peace and Security (WPS).

SOUTHCOM Human Rights Coordinator, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jose Rodriguez said the promotion of human rights is a major objective of TRADEWINDS and the principles that the team covered was a crucial aspect to interoperability.

“Respect for human rights is consistent with democratic values, so we promote those values that unite us and strengthen our partnerships,” said Rodriguez. “We have common threats in our [region] and we have to face them bilaterally and multilaterally. Respect for human rights is a part of that interoperability.”

More than just a human rights training, TRADEWINDS is an annual SOUTHCOM sponsored, joint, combined, multinational and interagency exercise designed to strengthen partnerships and interoperability, increase all participants' training capacity and capability to mitigate, plan for and respond to regional crises and security threats.

Dominican Republic army Col. Juan Perez Richiez, instructor at the Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law School in the Dominican Republic, said in order to achieve these training objectives, it is necessary to have a mutual understanding of how to legally and ethically operate during peacetime and war.

“When we are talking about international humanitarian law, we are talking about the law of armed conflict, and that is something every soldier needs to know and needs to learn during peacetime,” exclaimed Perez. “So then, when he or she is at war, in combat, they know what they can or can’t do.”

Perez went on to say that he has been working in the field of human rights for over 20 years all across Central and South America and the Caribbean and said he has seen a positive change in the preservation of human rights.

“I really think teaching human rights is not only my obligation, but it’s one of the best things I could do with my life,” admitted Perez. “I’ve seen that many armed forces had no or very little prior knowledge of human rights, and after these trainings,…human rights have been preserved at another level.”

A common theme throughout the training was that equality is a crucial aspect of human rights, and the WPS initiative works to promote gender equality and increase the meaningful participation of women to prevent conflict and maintain peace.

SOUTHCOM’s Gender Advisor, Jennifer Typrowicz, said gender integration in defense forces is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do.

“The SOUTHCOM WPS initiative is a priority, and we implement some sort of WPS training in everything that we do,” affirmed Typrowicz. “We have seen [defense] forces in [the SOUTHCOM] area of responsibility start to include more women.”

Typrowicz came to Guyana for TRADEWINDS 21 to instruct WPS training for its inaugural inclusion in the exercise, and she has observed an increased awareness and effort from the Guyana Defense Force (GDF) to integrate women into more roles in their military.

“When I was here in 2021, I walked around and not many people knew what WPS was, and since then we’ve seen them change policies,” claimed Typrowicz. “They now have women that are able to serve at the border which wasn’t something that was happening in 2021.”

Typrowicz said she believes the leadership support is imperative to accomplish change, and the GDF Chief of Staff, Brigadier Omar Khan, confirmed his endorsement for more women involvement in the force.

Khan requested that SOUTHCOM hold a WPS training for the GDF senior leaders in the days before TRADEWINDS 23.

“Military leaders have to take a lead in women’s integration in the whole spectrum of governance, including the security force,” said Khan. “The WPS initiative has a correlation in that the more we behave as responsible men and shape our male youth, we will have a better society, and part of that is respecting women, understanding their needs, and how we need them whether in the public sector, the private sector or the security sector.”

According to Guyana Defense Force Maj. Jaime Castello, lead planner for TW23, this is the second time in three years that Guyana has hosted Tradewinds and there was a great national, regional and international effort put into ensuring the exercise came to fruition.

“Now, after months of planning, extensive coordination and tireless organizing we have finally arrived at this momentous occasion,” said Castello. “The planning committees, logistical teams and those involved have worked tirelessly to produce a plan … and design realistic scenarios that will challenge, inspire and foster growth among the participants.”

These plans will achieve the goals of the exercise as well as improve interagency interoperability according to the U.S. Ambassador to Guyana, the Honorable Sarah-Ann Lynch.

“The goal of this exercise is to improve the security responses of participating Caribbean nations and focus on skills building in interdiction, security and interagency cooperation,” said Lynch. “Participation of intergovernmental organizations such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Regional Security System, the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security, and Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency are especially crucial to the success of this exercise.”

The Tradewinds exercise has been held annually since 1984, only missing one year in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the goals of enhancing the collective ability of participating nations’ defense forces to counter regional threats and conduct humanitarian aid/disaster relief operations while developing strong relationships and reinforcing human rights awareness."

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait – On June 15, 2023, Soldiers with Charlie Company (C Co.), 142nd Division Sustainment Support Battalion (DSSB), a unit subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade, conducted convoy training at Camp Buehring, Kuwait, utilizing a Reconfigurable Vehicle Tactical Trainer (RVTT).

RVTT is a system that enables, using electronic vehicles and weapons, within a simulated environment with a 360-degree virtual landscape. It allows Soldiers to interact with the simulated environment by utilizing electronic vehicles and weapons such as a .50-caliber machine gun and a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV), which the C Co. 142nd DSSB Soldiers utilized during their training.

Crews of three Soldiers—with one evaluator occupying the fourth seat in the HMMWV—utilized two available RVTT trailers to conduct the training while 1st Lt. Christopher Niarchos, commanding officer of C Co. 142nd DSSB, and Staff Sgt. Gregory Schwartz, the senior gunner with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 382nd Combat Support Sustainment Battalion, provided radio communications inside a nearby trailer simulating an operations center.

Niarchos served as the mission commander in the simulation, asserting that the training significantly honed his radio communications skills. He also expressed confidence in his company’s increased adaptability and readiness for future vehicle-related missions.

However, he was quick to credit Schwartz for significantly enhancing the effectiveness of the training program.

“Units need supplies, and transportation Soldiers are responsible for delivering those supplies,” Niarchos said. “If you are moving supplies, you need to be able to protect those supplies, and so it’s great to have help from someone with extensive experience in gunnery to help with training.”

Schwartz gave directions via radio to truck commanders, who then relayed the direction to the driver of the electronic vehicle.

Strong sergeants like Schwartz lead their teams toward mission success by instilling a culture that shuns the concept of failure.

Pvt. Brianna Meza, a motor transport operator with C Co. 142d DSSB, who served as a gunner during this exercise, said that the leadership at the training helped her emerge from the new experience of convoy gunnery with confidence in her ability to communicate effectively with her crew and protect the convoy.

Guidance was not solely confined to the ranks of the mission commander and senior gunner but resonated through all team levels.

Leadership and mentorship extended to the participating Soldiers long before the gunnery training.

Staff Sgt. Michael Barrientos, a motor transport noncommissioned officer with C Co. 142nd DSSB, who served as his crew’s truck commander, recounted his mentorship of a junior Soldier in his unit, Pvt. Shane Merrigan.

Barrientos played an instrumental role in guiding Merrigan toward a more collaborative approach to his tasks. This evolution unfolded gradually, with Merrigan’s transformation becoming increasingly evident throughout the training.

During this specific exercise, Barrientos observed a notable change in Merrigan’s approach. Merrigan embraced collaboration and emerged as an integral part of the crew, a testament to his growth and Barrientos’ successful mentorship.

Strong sergeants, such as Barrientos, prioritize comprehensive readiness, encompassing not only their troops’ physical and mental well-being but also their gradual development into collaborative team players through dedicated mentorship and guidance.

Strong sergeants, of course, make strong Soldiers.

Merrigan articulated the core tenets of leadership intrinsic to his role as a gunner, emphasizing that his top priority is to ensure the safety of his crew and the convoy.

“I need to make sure that whatever cargo we are delivering, or whatever personnel we are delivering, is safe,” Merrigan said. “And so it is my job to keep my eyes open—stay alert, stay awake and keep everyone safe.”"

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait -- The 369th Sustainment Brigade (SB), Task Force Hellfighter, cased their colors, and the 371st Sustainment Brigade (SB) uncased their colors during a transfer of authority (TOA) ceremony at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, July 3, 2023.

The ceremony signified the end of the duties and responsibilities of the 369th SB, New York Army National Guard, commanded by U.S. Army Col. Seth Morgulas, and the assumption of those duties and responsibilities by the 371st SB, Ohio Army National Guard, commanded by Col. Michael Burgett.

In attendance were distinguished guests U.S. Army Reserve Brig. Gen. Maria Juarez, deputy commanding general of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command - Operational Command Post and Command Sgt. Maj. Ricardo Saunders, command sergeant major of the 143rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command.

Juarez, conducted the transfer of authority ceremony.

Juarez said that Morgulas and Command Sgt. Maj. Curtis Moss, the senior enlisted advisor of the 369th SB, achieved repeated mission success in the complex United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) area of responsibility with successful command of 2,800 Soldiers spread across 32 locations.

“The Hellfighters significant achievements and numerous and seemingly endless showcase of an impressive skillset and endless dedication will without question have a lasting impact on the future of our partners in securing their borders, deterring aggression and stabilizing the region,” Juarez said.

The 369th SB provided command and control of five direct reporting battalions, achieving mission success while running dynamic distributed mission command in support of Combined Joint Task Forces - Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Spartan Shield.

Morgulas said that while the Hellfighter Soldiers who served in Kuwait from late 2022-2023 did not endure combat conditions comparable to the original Hellfighters—where Sgt. Henry Johnson fought against a German raiding party during World War I—but none the less planned, coordinated and executed missions that made history.

“I’ve been assigned to many units and worked with many great teams during my 31 years of service, but I’ve never worked with as amazing a group of Soldiers as the Harlem Hellfighters,” Morgulas said. “Hellfighters, your dedication and ability to rise to any challenge has been truly inspiring.”

The 369th SB cased their colors, and their subordinate units—the 369th Special Troops Battalion, Headquarters and Headquarters Company 369th SB, 187th Signal Company—did the same.

Casing and uncasing colors is a military tradition that originated centuries ago so Soldiers could recognize and follow their units into battle.

The 371st SB, and their subordinate units, uncased their colors as they began their new mission.

Burgett kept his remarks brief. He thanked the Hellfighters for making the transition easy and said the 371st SB Sustainment Warriors would carry on the sustainment mission."

CHICAGO – The rock group Boson has a phrase ‘It’s been such a long time’ in their 1976 song titled Long Time. And it could not be truer for a man who began his military career as a student at Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida.

On June 21, 2023, 19,000 baseball fans cheered for U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Brian Dunn, at the Chicago White Sox stadium, on a night that recognized Dunn, along with U.S. Navy Veteran Monica Urbieta who was honored as the “Hero of the Game’ for her service on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. George Washington in the Persian Gulf.

“So that was pretty impactful,” said a clearly elated Dunn. “(What an honor) by the White Sox organization, with my family here on Pride night with my husband, Mike. And to have someone that I served with come up and say hi filled me with a lot of gratitude.”

Before walking to the mound, Dunn exchanged greetings with fellow Army officer, retired Maj. Kelvin Pickens, whom he worked with at Fort Sheridan. Pickens currently works instant replay for the Chicago White Sox.

“When I joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. in 1993 there was an outright ban on service members that identified as (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning),” said Dunn. “Now 30 years later, the military has full support of our LGBTQ service members. The military’s view of our LGBTQ service members has come a long way. I’m very proud to wear my uniform and to be honored here for my military service on Pride night.”

Dunn’s husband, Mike Graves, was equally proud watching from his seat.

“It was a surprise but it’s a great thing. He really deserves it,” said Graves, a Navy veteran who served four years as a Torpedoman’s Mate on a ballistic missile submarine. “He’s a great representative for the Army. He is providing a service above and beyond and he does it happily.”

Ron Skarbek of Wilmette, Illinois, and a White Sox fan, said “It brought chills to me,” as he watched Dunn being applauded by the fans.

Like Dunn, Skarbek started out in ROTC at college and served as an Army officer from 1972 to 1976.

“I was a military police officer. Most of my time was stateside at Fort Gordon, Fort Benning and the Presidio,” said Skarbek.

Throughout history, LGBTQ Soldiers and civilians have bravely served and defended the country, often despite personal challenges and barriers to service.

Before he was assassinated, President John F. Kennedy spoke about diversity during a commencement speech at American University on June 10th, 1963.

“Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal,” he said.”"

Military Intelligence Readiness Command Soldiers and family members attended a Building Strong and Ready Teams event held June 23 – 25.

Building Strong and Ready Teams is a command directed, chaplain led, community partnered effort that strengthens spiritual readiness for Soldiers of all ranks and their families. This program was previously known as Strong Bonds.

The MIRC’s event took place over a weekend which allowed entire families to attend.

Chaplain (1st. Lt.) Carlos Joel Venezario served as an event organizer and presented materials in many of the small group settings. “The Army’s goal here is to provide tools and resources to build ready teams by maintaining the support that Soldiers have back at home. Being able to feed that and strengthen that is what's very important.”

Venezario explained that while the program has a spiritual component, no sessions are mandatory.

He also touched on what others believe they know about Building Strong and Ready Teams events. “I definitely like to address the stigmas people may have about these weekends. A lot of people think that these events are for people with broken marriages, or broken families. And that is not the case. Sure, people may need some help, or maybe need some resources coming in. But the majority of people coming here, they're not broken. They're people who want tools to better themselves.”

Venezario’s wife, Kendra Adams-Venezario, also helped lead the event. “This program contributes to the longevity of careers and the resiliency of families. You know, the military has one of the highest divorce rates in the country. The struggle that comes with moving so often and being separated from your support group and, all of that, it's trying on anybody.”

Adams-Venezario is working on a master’s degree in dispute resolution and has received training from the Army. This was the second time Adams-Venezario assisted in leading an event.

Her background and experiences as a military spouse informed her perspective and enhanced implementation of the program. “We're teaching active choices. That's all rooted in psychology. The course was written by a licensed psychologist and Family Therapist, the information that's included in it is all supported by psychological and scientific research. We talk about the impact of these things on marriage and the types of tools that work, the things that you do that harm your marriage and the things you can do that heal it.”

Nine couples attended the event. The program also included hotel lodging, childcare and meals. Venezario-Adams touted the event design. “Being able to provide that kind of support for families, and to give them the opportunity to spend time together, and to improve their relationships with one another, I think, is really beneficial.”

Spc. Anna Negm, a budget analyst working in the MIRC G8, attended with her husband Mike and young son. Negm agreed that the event provided value for her family. “It's a perfect setup, because as a lot of people who are here, we are also busy. This is a great way for us to spend our weekend while we do something for us as a couple. And yet we have our child here who's having a great time with his friends. And then we reunite and still have that family time during the weekend. It's perfect.”

Mike added, “We were able to check so many boxes, and attend this training really for a happier, healthier home. It's going to benefit all of us. We wouldn't have been able to attend without the childcare provided.”"

CHICAGO – The Chicago Sky Women's National Basketball Association team honored U.S. Army Reserve Maj. Tiesha Stephens for her military service during their Juneteenth observance home game verses the Indiana Fever at Wintrust Arena, June 15, 2023, in Chicago.

Stephens, who serves as a human resources officer for the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, received a plaque by the team mascot “Sky Guy” during the “Military Moment of the Game” for her outstanding commitment and service to the country.

Following her on-court recognition in front of thousands of roaring spectators, Stephens reflected on being publicly honored at the game.

“It was a great honor to be recognized during the Chicago Sky’s Juneteenth Game with my daughter present,” said Stephens. “Representing the Army during this holiday was a heartfelt privilege, and we truly enjoyed the experience.”

Juneteenth National Independence Day commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. While the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Lincoln, legally freed slaves throughout the Confederate States on January 1, 1863, Texas resisted for two years until U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger led an advance force of 1,800 men from the XIII Corps to the port city of Galveston, Texas.

Granger assumed command over the Military District of Texas, and issued General Order No. 3 on June 19, 1865, formally enforcing provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas for the first time. Juneteenth is celebrated on the anniversary of the order and derives its name from combining June and nineteenth. Juneteenth officially became the eleventh United States federal holiday in 2021.

Stephens, joined the Army in 1997 and received her commission through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. She has mobilized in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

Stephens’ awards include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Army Achievement Medal, among many other awards, throughout her years of service."

JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST, N.J. — Reserve members from the U.S. Army and Air Force spent the last week training at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey for the 2023 Inter-Allied Confederation of Reserve Officers, or CIOR, military competition being held in Helsinki, Finland.

The competition, known as Milcomp, is a pentathlon designed to challenge reserve members from across the alliance physically with a focus on military skills, according to the CIOR website. The categories

include pistol and rifle shooting, an obstacle course, utility swimming (with obstacles), and military orienteering often referred to as land navigation.

“Those five skills translate to a regular Soldier and how a Soldier in everyday life can succeed,” said Staff Sgt. Daniel Kelley, international marksmanship coach and Olympic orienteering coach for the team. “We have young people here learning very valuable life-skills.”

Kelley added that this week was all about getting the competitors in the right mindset while becoming proficient in each category.

“This week has been long and hard,” said 1st Lt. Brianna Mirmina, a first-year competitor and Bethany, Connecticut native. “It’s been challenging but a great experience.”

Many members of the Army Reserve began training in early May, while trials week started June 12 and ended June 17 with individuals being placed on their respective teams.

“It has been super busy and a lot of hard work,” said Staff Sgt. Gavin Hopler, from St. Louis, Missouri and CIOR Milcomp rookie. “I think it’s really helped us hone our skills and set us up for success.”

Next stop is Sweden for one more week of training, then to Finland for the three-day competition.

“I expect them to represent the United States very well,"" said Command Sgt. Maj. Russell Moore, CIOR pistol coach. “They’ve put a lot of effort into it, and hopefully they can translate that into a good outcome.”"

WEST POINT, N.Y. -- U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from both the Army Reserve Medical Command and the 3rd Medical Command (Deployment Support) were dispatched to the U.S. Military Academy to provide real-world medical support and advisement during the Summer Leadership Experience 2023 here, June 3-9 and June 10-16, 2023.

Held twice every year at the prestigious West Point academy, SLE delegates cadets into the role as cadre and support staff to lead and guide potential cadet candidates throughout the course.

""The Summer Leadership Experience is a program led by the Directorate of Admissions where we send in 1,100 rising high school seniors and give them a one-week exposure to the U.S. Military Academy in academics, physical training and military training,"" said U.S. Army Col. Peter Mack, Directorate of Admissions Medical Officer at West Point. ""It allows them to see if the academy life would be like for them.""

To ensure minimal hospitalization and attrition reduction of cadet candidates due to injuries and illnesses, West Point leadership always incorporate Army Reserve medical Soldiers and equipment for every SLE session.

The pilot program for Army Reserve medical support during SLE resulted in over a 90 percent decrease in hospitalization for cadet candidates.

""We went from sending 110 cadet candidates to the hospital for simple things such as headaches, sprains, bumps, bruises, and contusions,"" Mack said. ""When medics started treating that, that number dropped that we sent to the hospital from 110 down to 10. Afterward, we expanded the program to bring nurses and medical providers.""

According to U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Francis Deravens, a combat medic assigned to the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group, Staten Island, N.Y., him and other Soldiers work tirelessly and expeditiously to maintain the status quo.

""Overall, we are a Level 1 real-world clinic just providing simple aid,"" Deravens said. ""Anything from dehydration to if someone needs to get transported to the hospital. As of (five days into the SLE events), we have seen around 60 individuals - a mix between candidates, cadets and also staff. At the end, we typically see about 100 people in the end of one week for various reasons.""

Aside from the benefit of the partnership between West Point and the Army Reserve, this experience has also been conducive to medical Soldiers in the upkeep of their skill sets and aptitude.

""It has been a really good experience, as this is the first time that I've done any true medical coverage since Advanced Individual Training,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Zachary Epstein, a combat medic assigned to 451st Medical Detachment, a 3rd MCDS unit out of Hartford, Connecticut. ""We've seen all sorts of different injuries and illnesses, from bumps and bruises to twisted ankles to anxiety effects. So it has been good, especially working closely with the providers.""

Furthermore, cadet candidates obtain a greater understanding of what medical Soldiers can provide in both the training and operational environment.

""The exposure to the Army Medical Department is incredible, no matter what branch that they go into; whether it is Combat Arms, Combat Support or Combat Service Support, they are going to be dealing with medical in any operation that they do,"" Mack said. ""So they get to see this firsthand, and can see what the medics can do to keep their Soldiers in the fight rather than evacuating them to a higher role of care and losing them for training and for any military operation. It enhances the mission, and it is a force multipler and this has been an incredible experience for them.""

The next iterations of SLE are currently slated for June 1-7/June 8-14, 2024. Nonetheless, Army Reserve medical support will remain an integral component of SLE preplanning and execution.

""We can't live without Army Reserve medical support,"" Mack said. ""It makes this program safe, it makes it run very smoothly, and it also helps enhance the training because we can keep Soldiers in the fight and allow them to continue training without them going to the hospital."""

U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade conducted a relationship-building, information-sharing dialogue that commenced on May 31, 2023.

The dialogue signified a historic milestone. For the first time, U.S. and Israeli forces came together to share knowledge and respect for the handling of fallen warriors.

This successful convoy allowed the U.S. Army to set up the Mobile Integrated Remains Collection System (MIRCS) in Israel, showcasing its capabilities and presenting a robust, streamlined and dignified system for handling fallen warriors.

According to U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Yensy Carty, 673rd Quartermaster (QM) Company mortuary affairs team noncommissioned officer in charge, the MIRCS provides a solution to the challenging task of adequately collecting, preserving and transporting the remains of fallen warriors on the battlefield.

The system offers a respectful way to manage remains through state-of-the-art preservation technology, advanced collection equipment, identification and documentation, the preservation of personal effects, tracking and reporting, as well as religious sensitivity.

The 673rd QM, an Army Reserve unit based out of Delaware, demonstrated the solemn and meticulously choreographed ritual, known as dignified transfer, to the Israeli military personnel. It is a process filled with respect and honor, symbolizing the U.S. military’s gratitude for the ultimate sacrifice made by fallen warriors from the U.S. and those from partner nations.

U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Gabriel Montalvo, with the mortuary affairs team, said it is a real honor to demonstrate the values associated with the ritual given to each fallen warrior and show allies that this is the respect their service members receive.

“What my team and I provide is a respectful preparation for the last goodbye of a family to their fallen warrior,” Montalvo said. “The process allows a family to have closure with their service member.”

The Israeli military personnel shared information about burial traditions with U.S. Army personnel by showing a traditional, kosher wood casket.

According to Jewish tradition, man is created equal. Therefore, he is equal in death, which is why Rabbinic authorities recommend using simple caskets that reflect this democracy and prevent the unnecessary expense of elaborately adorned coffins.

The sharing of burial traditions between Israeli and U.S. military personnel was more than an exchange of customs. It revealed mutual respect and understanding for every individual’s equality and inherent dignity, both in life and death. This recognition extends beyond burial rituals, influencing a broader cooperative relationship between the two nations because allies and partners enable strategic readiness.

Capt. Amanda Longoria, the officer in charge of the 673d QM mortuary affairs team, said it was essential to learn about Israel’s needs regarding interacting with U.S. mortuary affairs.

“The U.S. and Israel are going to work more together in the future,” Longoria said.

“I feel honor, empathy and compassion for what I do,” Montalvo said. “And I feel honored sharing what I do, and I would gladly share my experience with partner nations again.”"

U.S. Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade conducted a convoy to Israel on May 30, 2023, to participate in a mortuary affairs subject matter exchange with the Israeli Defense Forces.

Spanning hundreds of miles with challenges such as heat temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the journey of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command into Israel ensured that a new chapter of collaboration and mutual learning unfolded.

The convoy centered around the transport of the Mobile Integrated Remains Collection System, a crucial tool for handling mortuary affairs on the battlefield, which rested on the M1075 Palletized Load System, a truck-based logistics platform.

Louisiana National Guard Spc. Emmanuel Moore, a wheeled vehicle mechanic with the 3673rd Support Maintenance Company, stressed the importance of this exercise.

“Transporting the MIRCS allows us to check our movement processes,” Moore said. “Moreover, carrying out this operation with Israel strengthens our relationships and mutual understanding.”

Allies and partners enable strategic readiness—the Army’s ability to mobilize, deploy and sustain forces in large-scale combat operations.

According to Fleet Master Chief Derrick Walters, Senior Enlisted Leader, there are currently 21 countries under the purview of U.S. Central Command—with Israel being the most recent addition.

“It’s a growing process as we envelop Israel in USCENTCOM as a regional partner,” Walters said. “This is critically important for regional security and stability.”

Indeed, external readiness constitutes a crucial factor in the success of these operations. Collaboration with allies like Israel is instrumental in accomplishing a mission’s immediate objectives and laying the groundwork for strengthened international relations and future joint efforts.

This exercise also demonstrated the importance of interoperability between the U.S. and its allies. The smooth transition of the MIRCS into Israeli territory, and the subsequent discussions around mortuary affairs, were made possible by clear communication, understanding of respective military protocols and mutual respect between the U.S. and Israeli forces.

Without clear communication and shared readiness, the complexities of border crossings and customs procedures could have led to challenges and misunderstandings of customs procedures.

The result could be an investigation or confiscation of essential items, causing substantial mission delays or even loss of crucial supplies hindering the actual setup of the MIRCS, and potentially altering the course and outcomes of the mission.

Due to the cooperation, understanding and respecting custom regulations, these challenges were prevented."

“The Feldjaeger is a first-class organization,” said Brig. Gen. Vance Kuhner, deputy commanding general of the 200th Military Police Command. “They add muscle and competence that our alliance requires to thwart aggression from anyone who wants to destroy freedom, democracy, law and order.”

“Today was so complete,” added Brig. Gen. Kuhner, who, as a civilian, serves as the northeast Special Agent in Charge for United States Customs and Border Protection. “Appropriately, we started our day by solemnly remembering our German military police who gave their lives in service. We need to remember them as we as allies serve and protect our citizens.”

The pageantry also amazed Brig. Gen. Kuhner. “The parade was splendid, and that Bundeswehr band [the Heeresmusikkorps Hannover] is the absolute best military band I’ve ever heard.”

The Feldjaeger’s demonstration of law enforcement and tactical support proved they can bring lethal force to any nefarious actors who dare attempt to interrupt route security.

Anthony Kresta, a commander with the Carrollton (Texas) Police Department serving on extended active duty, who serves as the operations sergeant major for the 200th Military Police Command. “The professionalism demonstrated was unmatched by anything I have seen in my forty-year career.”

Orchestrating the entire event was Brig. Gen. Sandro Wiesner, commander of the Bundeswehr Military Police Command.

“It is no coincidence that so many companions from the political sector, military, police, and civilian partners from Germany and abroad, active duty and reserve personnel, the German Military Police Association, and retired personnel and friends of the German MP are going to celebrate this special day in Hannover with the rest of us,” said Brig.

During the ceremony, Brig. Gen. Wiesner quoted 19th-Century Prussian field marshal Helmuth von Moltke, stating, “When one issued an order to a Feldjaeger, one was safe.” Brig. Gen. Wiesner further metaphorized, “In our house the lights are on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days all year long. We are and will always be highly responsive.""

“The 200th Military Police Command looks forward to more training opportunities with the military police commands who serve countries dedicated to protecting freedom from tyranny,” added Brig. Gen. Vance Kuhner. “Just as a football team doesn’t meet in the locker room right before the big match, our military forces ought not meet moments before crisis. We should train together, and we will continuously train together so that together we can defeat our adversaries.”

“We thank Brig. Gen. Sandro Wiesner for his leadership,” added Brig. Gen. Kuhner. “We met great Military Policemen this week from Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Lithuania, Austria and the Netherlands who are dedicated to preserving law and order. We stand shoulder to shoulder with them.”

Brig. Gen. Vance Kuhner, deputy commanding general (support) for the 200th MP CMD, was charged with overseeing the command during the exercise. According to Kuhner, the three top areas of focus for the unit were deployability, alliance and partnership, and the rule of law.

“Our staff exercised their ability to talk to our allies and partners along with our higher headquarters [during this CPX],” said Kuhner. “In doing so, the staff learned a lot about itself. We learned some new areas that we must focus more on, but we also learned that we could do it. We are ready, we're relevant, and we're ready for the future.”

Since many soldiers in the command work in policing in their civilian lives, the transition to a military police mission was somewhat seamless. This exercise included planning considerations of law enforcement, rear area security, and detainee operations missions. Furthermore, the exercise challenged the command to integrate functional skills from medical, chemical, engineer, information operations, public affairs, to civil affairs.

“This gave our headquarters staff as well as one of our subordinate brigades (300th MP BDE) the opportunity to come and participate in a larger exercise that included our multinational partners, as well as U.S. Army Europe and Africa staff, and to inject ourselves into not only the planning process, but the execution of working as a theater level military police command,” said Col. John Dunn, chief of staff of the command.

“This was the first opportunity that we had, as a military police command, to participate in a command post exercise of this level,” added Dunn. “It really gave us the opportunity to exercise our staff functionality, with higher headquarters as well as our subordinate units, our sister units to our left and right, and our multinational partners.”

Kuhner told the command staff during the exercise as a teaching moment that it’s not enough to do just policing anymore. On the battlefield, a variety of scenarios may play out at any time, and the command must be ready to step up. The CPX was an opportunity to train for a variety of possible real-world scenarios.

""We worked first on getting the [battle drills] right, and once we got it right, we worked on speed,” said Kuhner. “Our ability to get the products out, get the coordination done, work with our down trace brigades, making sure that they're doing what needs to be done to support to the [Combined Forces Land Component Commander], I really saw nothing negative. I saw really nothing that I would say we weren't ready to do. We're ready to do all of it.""

Sgt. Maj. Anthony Kresta is the operations noncomissioned officer in charge for the command. He called enlisted personnel “the glue that holds the staff together,” ensuring continuity between staff sections.

“Having the opportunity to come here to the European theater to train with our U.S. counterparts, as well as our multinational partners, has been one like I've never experienced in my nearly 40-year career,” said Kresta. “This unique opportunity has given us the ability to train as staff, and especially from the perspective of our enlisted soldiers and our noncommissioned officer corps, an ability to demonstrate to our staff officer members of the team that we are full force multiplier when it comes to the operations of our command post.”

The CPX, part of DEFENDER 23, was a computer-assisted exercise designed to build V Corps’ ability to conduct operations throughout Europe in a multi-corps, multi-national and multi-domain environment. This exercise took place June 5 to 14 and included approximately 2,000 personnel from USAEUR-AF, V Corps, as well as 1,000 multi-national personnel from five allied and partner countries that include Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, Netherlands and Romania.

MARTINSBURG, W.Va. - Three West Virginia National Guardsmen participated in the Women in Strategic Intelligence Seminar in Doha, Qatar, May 14-18.

Maj. Taylar Belfield and Tech. Sgt. Victoria Bagley, both assigned to the 167th Operations Support Squadron, and 1st Lt. Abbey Welborn, 111th Engineer Brigade, joined servicemembers and civilians from the Qatar Armed Forces, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Army Central and U.S. Air Forces Central for the event.

The three women presented information in their respective areas of expertise at the seminar.

Supporting the Department of Defense Women, Peace, and Security Strategic Framework and Implementation Plan, the seminar increased understanding of how strategy drives intelligence gathering, analysis, product development and decision making.

The seminar also provided an opportunity to build relationships between the West Virginia National Guard and the Qatari Armed Forces, partnered through the National Guard Bureau’s State Partnership Program.

The first day of the seminar focused on topics specific to women in, and working in support of, the military. The next three days, participants discussed intelligence topics, followed by a practical exercise on the final day.

“The experience of meeting these ladies who are trailblazers in their country, they’re very impressive women, it was the best all-around [temporary duty assignment],” Belfield said of engaging with the nearly 30 Qatari women who support the Ministry of Defense as civilian intelligence analysts.

The biggest takeaway for Bagley was the common ground they found with their Qatari counterparts as discussions bounced between personal and professional topics.

“We think we are so different based on culture, but there are so many similarities, especially when you’re focusing on gender. As soon as kids or family is mentioned, everyone wants to share their personal experiences,” Bagley said.

She noted the support the Qatari women have from their male coworkers, who recognize their value and see the unique perspective they bring to intelligence analysis.

“Qatar is forward-leaning in the Middle East when it comes to women and the workplace, and I think there’s so much value in having them as a state partner,” Belfield said.

The West Virginia National Guard and Qatar have partnered since 2018 through the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program. West Virginia Guard members helped their Qatari military partners prepare for and execute the FIFA World Cup in 2022. Most recently, West Virginia National Guard and Qatari military leaders met in Doha for a State Partnership Program engagement in March.

The 268th Inland Cargo Transportation Company, from the 1st Mission Support Command, undergoes extensive training for an upcoming deployment. Since 9/11, nearly 100% of the Army Reserve units in Puerto Rico have mobilized and deployed as a member of the Joint Force.

Recently, the transportation unit completed Operation Tin Man at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, where the soldiers were responsible for managing equipment at the Central Receiving Shipping Point and moving it to the Gulfport by operating tactical vehicles.

Here at Camp Shelby, the CRSP yard is divided into three areas of operation the storage, holding, and ready line.

""As an 88H, a cargo specialist, my duty was to load and unload 20-foot containers from platforms with the RT240 at the CRSP yard,"" said Spc. Hector Martinez.

The Kalmar RT240 Rough Terrain Container Handler is one of the many tactical vehicles used in the armed forces to handle standard shipping containers and is considered the backbone of military logistics.

The 88Hs performed single stacks of the containers at the designated ready line. Then the Palletized Load System cargo transfer team unloaded the container to the PLS so the 88Ms could transport it to the final destination, explained Spc. Martinez.

The 88Ms is the military occupational code for motor transport operators, according to Sgt. Jonathan Collazo, performing real-life missions during annual training, enables the Army Reserve soldiers to train on different aspects of transportation.

The motor transport operators conducted convoy operations, equipment movement, preventive maintenance checks, and inventories.

""The mission was an opportunity for the soldiers to gain more experience and proficiency in their MOS,"" said Sgt. Collazo.

The Army Reserve soldiers fostered a culture of learning among each other, enabling the young soldiers to build their expertise; consequently, the transportation team could safely move over 400 containers, concluded Sgt. Collazo.

Operation Tin Man enabled the Army Reserve soldiers to be mission ready as they managed and transported the equipment, ensuring delivery was made on time and in good condition.

The Army Reserve forces in Puerto Rico have become an essential part of the total force, with streamlined, deployable forces and citizen Soldiers who embody the warrior mindset and spirit."

Travel is a routine part of the 787th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion’s training, but this time the journey will take it overseas.

The Army Reserve unit, based in Dothan, Ala., departed its headquarters Sunday morning, June 4, 2023. A handful of family members and friends said their farewells outside the building as their Soldiers loaded on buses to leave at dawn.

The battalion had prepared for its European deployment since before November. Command Sgt. Maj. Clint Halstead, the unit’s senior NCO, said morale rose when the unit learned its new missions would mainly involve convoys and moving supplies – reflecting its normal transportation work.

“It was intensely motivating,” he said. “When a mission set is put in front of you, all that training is more inspiring because you’re going to a real place.”

The initial trip on June 4 took the unit to Fort Cavazos, Texas, for the pre-deployment process. From there, the 787 CSSB will travel to support Operation European Assure, Deter, Reinforce. Many of the Soldiers have never served outside the United States before; those who did shared their personal experiences and advice with the others as they prepared for departure.

Sgt. 1st Class Phillip Rogers, the first sergeant, has deployed three times to various countries – Iraq, Afghanistan and Jordan. He said it will be important for the troops to keep in contact with their friends and families, maintain their finances, keep in touch with their personal spirituality and communicate with their leadership.

“If they don’t do it, they end up keeping to themselves,” Rogers said concerning communication. “They end up in a place where they’re in a rough spot … We can’t help them when we don’t know.”

This will be the first deployment for Staff Sgt. Devon Fields, a petroleum supply NCO, who said he was excited to finally go overseas.

“It’s been a long time coming,” he said. “It’s not easy leaving my family for this amount of time, but my wife understands this is a requirement and has the support she needs.”

Fields has a form of support he’s taking with him – his twin brother, Staff Sgt. Tyawan Fields. The brothers joined the Army together and went to basic together. Now they serve in the same unit and will be able to experience Europe at the same time.

Previously, they both tried to get on multiple deployments, but Tyawan, a transportation management coordinator, managed to go first and was sent in 2021 to Kuwait. While they talked by phone throughout that time, both agreed being there for each other in person will be an improvement.

“Going through it together makes it easier,” Tyawan said.

His wife, Jakelia “GeGe” Fields, said even though he just got back last year, she is now better prepared for the family hardships that come with a deployment – such as him missing the milestones their children will go through during the year.

“I think it’s going to be a little easier,” she said. “I know what to expect and what not to expect.”

Some Soldiers felt the same way. Spc. Jose Martinez, a communications specialist, previously deployed to Kuwait and Iraq. He said he was more relaxed about deploying this time and was glad he was going with the 787 CSSB.

He said his fellow troops have a sense of pride about using their skills for the missions they’ll be conducting.

“Being able to apply it for the Army overseas gives you a sense of accomplishment,” Martinez said. “A lot of them are excited for it – doing their job on the daily.”

The unit itself has a long history of doing its job and has been in Dothan in various forms since 1968. It went to Afghanistan in 2003 and supported Operation Inherent Resolve with a deployment to Iraq and Syria in 2018.

Maj. Hugh Carswell, the battalion executive officer, led a farewell ceremony the day before the unit left. He expressed confidence in the troop’s abilities, noting that the experienced Soldiers will help the newer ones.

“I think we have leadership in each section to fulfill the mission,” he said. “They know what their role is and they know what they’re doing. They have the confidence to get the job done.”

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait - U.S. Army sustainers with the 1st Theater Sustainment Command’s Operational Command Post provided logistics support to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility during the bilateral military exercise held between the U.S. and Israel militaries known as Juniper Caracal 2023, held in May 2023.

The Juniper exercise series, including Juniper Oak 23-2, and Juniper Falcon 23-2 which were completed in earlier this year, are designed to enhance interoperability between both nations’ militaries and ensure U.S. and Israeli forces are ready and prepared to respond to any contingency, particularly those involving ballistic missile defense or crisis response.

Col. Gerry L. Jackson, 1st TSC alternate command post director, explained how this exercise demonstrates the long-standing commitment and cooperation between Israel and the United States.

“Our partnership with Israel is key. The Juniper Caracal exercise helps strengthen our partnership and our working relationship with Israel,” said Jackson.

The exercise was planned by members of both the 1st TSC and IDF and consisted of participants from the 673d Quartermaster Company mortuary affairs team and the 730th Quartermaster Company transportation team. These teams conducted a convoy operation and a demonstration of combat readiness by showcasing the capabilities of a mobile integrated remains collection system.

The MIRCS is a self-contained shelter with four main areas: a receiving and processing area, a refrigerated storage area for remains, an administrative area, and a storage section for operational supplies. It consists of all components necessary to deploy, move and operate in support of a full spectrum of military and peacetime disaster support. It can be transported via land or by air.

Sgt. Maj. Lachelle Wiggins, the Juniper Caracal noncommissioned officer in charge, said that she was pleased with the success of the exercise.

“As we build our partnership with the IDF, it is these positive interactions that generate readiness and build trust in our capabilities as technically and tactically proficient professionals,” stated Wiggins.

The Juniper exercise series serves as an opportunity for U.S. military personnel and the IDF to exercise together and to learn from one another. JC23 represents another step in the deliberate and strategic relationship between the U.S. and Israel and contributes to overall regional stability."

CHICAGO – Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs honored U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Amrit Sandhu, of the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, during a Memorial Day home game versus the Tampa Bay Rays at Wrigley Field in Chicago, May 29, 2023.

A nationally televised game with 38,163 in attendance, Sandhu was publicly honored on the field for the game’s “Military Salute”. He was presented with an official game ball by the Cubs organization and received a standing ovation from tens of thousands of spectators.

Recognition for Sandhu came in conjunction with multiple Memorial Day honors at Wrigley Field, including the unfurling of a large American flag that covered the outfield section, a moment of silence for our nation’s fallen heroes, and a spotlight honor to a “Gold Star” Marine family.

Sandhu was joined by his two sons, Timur (12) and Edward (8). It was their first MLB baseball game.

Sandhu immigrated to the United States from Gurdaspur, Punjab, India in 2008. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve in September 2015 as a Financial Management Technician, and in January of 2017 Sandhu was sworn in as a United States citizen. He is currently serving as Budget Analyst for the 85th USARSC, headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois, outside Chicago.

Reflecting on his 8-year career in the Army Reserve, Sandhu noted he “loves to wear the uniform, and to be a part of a strong team in the U.S. Army.”

“I plan to extend my contract – I’ll feel like I’m missing something if I don’t,” said Sandhu.

Sandhu also elaborated on the feeling of receiving the honor at the game.

“Here today at Wrigley, it feels very special to be supported and respected by the crowd. I appreciate the opportunity to be honored on this special day – Memorial Day,” Sandhu said. “My boys will have a unique memory for the rest of their lives. Every kid wants to be out on that field, and they made it out there.”

Sandhu took the field, along the 3rd base line in the second inning, just prior to the Cubs batting. As Sandhu appeared on the Wrigley jumbotron in left field, and broadcast nationwide, Timur and Edward remarked “It feels pretty cool to see dad get cheered by the crowd, and to see him up on the big screen”.

From his vantage position a few feet from the Chicago Cubs dugout, Edward later noted “I bet I’m better at baseball than they are”. Edward plays grade school baseball.

Many spectators were displaying their support for members of the military during the Memorial Day game at Wrigley. One spectator, John, wearing a camouflage Army baseball cap and dog tags, said he was honoring his parents – both World War II Army veterans that served in hospitals and treated Soldiers coming back from the Pacific.

“It’s incredible to see the Cubs honor Sergeant Sandhu on the field,” said John.

As the game neared its end, Timur said he wanted to play baseball with his dad when they got home. While enjoying a ballpark hotdog a few feet from Chicago Cubs’ Miles Mastrobuoni’s 3rd base position, when asked if he was going to play with the baseball the Cubs gave him, Timur remarked “No, I’m saving that”.

The Chicago Cubs defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 1-0 in the 9th inning."

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. – Soldiers assigned to the 85th U.S Army Reserve Support Command joined their local communities to honor service during the Memorial Day weekend, May 27-29, 2023.

The Rolling Meadows Memorial Day parade brought together veterans, local residents, first responders and military personnel to share in the remembrance of fallen heroes.

As in many communities across America, residents and veterans young and old stood silently to listen to Lt. Col. Brian Dunn, Assistant Chief of Staff G-1, 85th USARSC, speak at the Veterans Memorial Carillon Monument on the cost of freedom and what Memorial Day means.

“Since the founding of our Nation, more than 42 million Americans have stepped forward to serve this country, and more than a million have died so their children and future generations could live freely,” said Dunn.

“They came from across our nation and every walk of life. Each different, each an individual who made a choice, yet all shared the same dream of freedom that gave birth to our nation and carried the light of liberty to millions across the globe.”

Marine Pfc. Walter Sanojca of Chicago was one of them. Killed during fierce fighting at the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945.

A loss felt to this day by his niece, Lara Sanoica, Mayor, Rolling Meadows, who reflected on the meaning of Memorial Day.

“For me, personally, (Memorial Day means) my great uncle, Walter Sanojca, who died in the Battle of Okinawa,” she said. “It impacts families for generations. It’s very important we have this day. I continue to serve by running for office. I want to make sure his sacrifice is not forgotten.”

While Rolling Meadows paid homage to fallen service members, the Chicago Cubs baseball team held a recognition during their Saturday evening game, later that night, to honor military service through local serving service members. A cheering crowd of more than 36 thousand Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball fans honored Brig. Gen. Richard Corner, Commanding General, 85th USARSC, during the second inning of their game with the Cincinnati Reds.

“It was an awesome experience,” said Corner. “The crowd and the gratitude people have.”

Cubs’ fans enjoyed watching him too.

“I think it’s fabulous. Our nephew is in the Army at Fort Bragg, North Carolina,” said Michelle Dixon of West Dundee and a Cubs spectator. “To see the general (Corner) honored is great. To see that he is having a successful career and serving his country.”

On Monday, area residents watched the 104th Annual Memorial Day Parade and Ceremony in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

Corner and retired Sgt. Maj. Dennis Koski participated in the parade waving to the crowd as they passed by in an Army style jeep. Following the parade, Corner delivered the keynote speech for the ceremony.

“We can never replace our fallen heroes. We can never repay them. But we can always remember. Words cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage,” Corner said. “We only hope that every day we can prove worthy not only of their sacrifice and service, but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones that they left behind.”

The local mayor added a new discovery on a fallen veteran from the community.

“Arlington Heights is a very special place especially on Memorial Day,” said Mayor Tom Hayes, mayor of Arlington Heights, Illinois. “Our 59th hero is Private John Sieburg.”

It was only recently discovered Sieburg was one of Arlington Heights fallen heroes dating back to the Civil War.

Private Sieburg served with the 8th Illinois Cavalry Regiment as a dispatch rider carrying critical messages between military commanders.

He was shot through his hip, knocked from his horse and died October 12, 1863.

Nadine Lussman traveled from her home in Switzerland to pay tribute to her great granduncle.

“It’s very moving for us that John Sieburg now has a place in Memorial Park in Arlington Heights, his ancestral home,” she told the Daily Herald newspaper. “He’s come home in a way.”

Katie Stack, the widow of Marine Lance Cpl. James Stack who served with 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, reflected on the memory of her husband. He was killed by a sniper in Sangin, Afghanistan back in 2010.

“I want my husband to be remembered as this goofy, loving, charismatic man who loved his daughter and me beyond anything in this world,"" said Stack. ""Every single moment he came home he was so excited to see her and sit next to us from all the time he was away. He loved his job. We came first, but his job came second. I want him to be remembered as a hero who fought for this country.”"

Missions are not always executed with full capabilities. As a result, commanders will often accept prudent risk where necessary to ensure the mission is completed. When gaps need to be filled, commanders may choose to exercise talent management from within their ranks. That happened to be the case with the generator subject matter expert, Spc. Alexander Darrow.

Darrow, a deployed Reserve Soldier and the only tactical power generation specialist assigned to 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command, works on a power generation system in Jordan with purpose and passion.

As a tactical power generation specialist, Darrow has supplied the power needed to run virtually every aspect of activity on the air base. In addition, Darrow’s job supports the unit by providing power for equipment that is required to accomplish the mission. The power supply provides the air base with electricity, heat, and air-conditioning, allowing the alternate command post to communicate with the operational command post.

Darrow has worked on power generation supplies for almost three years in the Army. However, he began working on wheel bearings with his grandfather around the age of 8, leading to his knack for fixing things. His prior maintenance experience and advanced individual training from the Army make him a true subject matter expert.

Since arriving in Jordan, Darrow has performed maintenance and repairs on transmissions, small engines, small all-terrain utility vehicles, skid-steer loaders, power-generation equipment, and associated equipment in mobile and stationary power plants.

“I’ve been working on prime equipment since I’ve been out here,” said Darrow, explaining how the tasks are outside his military occupational specialty. “But in actuality, a generator is a generator. So I’m just really happy to be out here supporting the mission. I feel like I’m making a difference.”

143d ESC Headquarters & Headquarters Company Commander Capt. Marlena Janes said, “Sending a junior Soldier to a pretty remote area to run the generators without a noncommissioned officer is a risk.” However, sending Darrow on the solo mission led to successful operations on a remote air base because of the amount of equipment he could troubleshoot, order parts for, and fix as parts came in. “I would absolutely do it again.”

Commanders’ ability to accept risk and empower junior leaders such as Darrow provide real-world scenarios for Reserve Soldiers to hone skill sets in a mobilized environment. These opportunities encourage not only professional development but leadership through empowerment. As a result, leadership, training, and experience gained through military service are second-to-none."

As an Army Reserve Soldier and an Army Civilian, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Christopher Mondi embodies the limitless possibilities of the Army slogan, “Be All You Can Be,” by bringing skill sets from both worlds to a deployed environment.

Mondi serves as a food service technician, deployed with the 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command in Jordan, and an Army Civilian logistics management specialist for a quartermaster company. His training has led to opportunities to travel, experience other cultures, and serve a greater purpose abroad.

“What brought me here was taking accountability of the property on base, visiting the first field fielding team in theater and making sure everything is going alright with them, as well as key leader engagements with the Jordanians,” Mondi said.

Previously, field feeding teams did not come into the theater. “The mission has changed, as far as the requirements,” Mondi states.

In 2015, the Combined Arms Support Command unveiled a consolidated field feeding company concept, where food service specialists are consolidated into a single company within sustainment brigades.

In doing so, units can request a field feeding capability to support operational requirements, much like they do with other sustainment requests and other combat service support functions, if required.

The 564th Quartermaster Company is the first field feeding team to report to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. “They are their own team. They don’t have a first sergeant and a commander. They are all they have, and they fall in under a sustainment brigade for support,” said Mondi.

“It’s great to be here and be able to work with these young Soldiers. As [the Army] has gone through the years, we haven’t always had 92Gs that were cooking. So it’s nice to see them out in the field and doing the job that they came to join the Army for.""

The U.S. Army is committed to building high-performing and cohesive teams in an inclusive environment to accomplish its mission. Soldiers like Mondi continue to demonstrate that the Army builds leaders and provides them the opportunities to be influential advisors to peers and leaders around the world."

FORT POLK, La. — The United States and Colombian armies are continually looking for ways to further strengthen the already rich partnership they share. The latest example of this comes as an infantry company from the Colombian Army was embedded with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, alongside U.S. Soldiers from the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade, during a recent Joint Readiness Training Center rotation at Fort Polk, Louisiana.

“The importance of this JRTC Rotation with the Colombian Army is two-fold; it helps the Colombian Army understand a new operational environment including how to operate in large scale combat operations and it builds readiness for the U.S. Army,” said U.S. Army Maj. Joseph Macchiarella, U.S. Army South Colombia foreign area officer. “3rd Brigade, along with the 1st SFAB, were able to train on their critical task to integrate allies and partner nation forces into operations as well as identify gaps in capabilities which will need to be addressed in the near future.”

When asked about the importance of military partnerships like that between the U.S. and Colombian armies, Col. Richard Taylor, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division commander, discussed how strategic friendships and partnerships are the bedrock of any large organization.

“We know that the U.S. Army does not operate alone; every opportunity to serve alongside our partner forces is a chance to strengthen bonds and establish trust,” he said. “Both traits are crucial for interoperability and ultimately allows us to jump, fight and win on the hardest day of ground combat.”

Taylor also commended the professionalism demonstrated throughout the rotation saying, “The soldiers and leaders of the Columbian army are disciplined, lethal and highly competent. Our paratroopers gained knowledge from serving with them throughout the rotation.”

Though there are several challenges presented anytime two nations’ armies operate alongside one another. Consistent, realistic training builds an understanding that can ease those concerns should this partnership be put to the test in a real-world operation.

“There are still many challenges to achieve interoperability, but combat training center rotations are the perfect scenario to identify shortfalls and work to find an immediate solution,” said Macchiarella at the conclusion of the rotation. “There were many lessons learned by all participants, and now the challenge remains on how to improve before the next big event.”

The military partnership between the U.S. and Colombia has been longstanding and in recent years the two nations began working together toward a common, more optimistic goal.

“Since 2021 the U.S. and Colombia have had a process of preparation and training a unit from the army with the goal of working up to a battalion level in order to improve and achieve true interoperability,” explained Colombian Maj. Gen. Alvaro Vicente Perez, deputy commander of the Colombian Army. “We started in 2021 working together at the platoon level and during this JRTC rotation we trained together at the company level.”

Training at the company level as opposed to the individual squad or platoon level provided a greater understanding of each other’s capabilities and tactics during a large-scale combat operations type of environment.

“The most important thing about training like this, after talking with our soldiers, is the opportunity to interact, train with, and understand the capabilities of other armies like the United States and see operations from another point of view,” continued Perez.

In addition to this U.S.-hosted JRTC training rotation, Colombia played host last fall to U.S. Soldiers from both the Illinois and Georgia Army National Guard during Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 which was a two-week training exercise at Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia. The exercise included a Women Peace and Security panel discussion during which senior leaders from both armies shared experiences and ideas on furthering the roles of women in security efforts in their respective countries."

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – On a bitterly cold, desert morning at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, U.S. Army South Soldier, Sgt. Aaron Thomas, a geospatial plans and analysis team leader in the 512th Engineer Detachment, stood nervously on the starting line of the Bataan Memorial Death March on March 19, 2023.

“I knew it was gonna be challenging, and I didn't want to fail,” Thomas said with uncertainty. “But hearing stories about how bad it was for other people, you know, I kind of let that weigh on me. The furthest I had rucked during my training was only 10 miles.”

According to The Bataan Memorial Death March website, the event is a 26.2-mile ruck march to remember the roughly 75,000 U.S. and Filipino service members who became prisoners of war (POW) in the Philippines during World War II and were forced to march approximately 65 miles through the jungle to confinement camps by their Japanese captors.

Thomas held his detachment’s guidon, but a friend suggested he put it in his 35 pound ruck sack. Instead, he chose the challenge of carrying it the distance and listened to the memory of his older brother’s voice telling him not to take the easy route.

“Whatever it is that I’m doing, it’s the memory of my older brother’s voice telling me not to quit that has always been there to get me through the tough times and tough decisions,” he admired.

Thomas, from Las Vegas, New Mexico, is no stranger to long journeys carrying either a mental or physical weight, or both. Though his family members all found various levels of success in life, through determination and resilience he was the first to earn his high school diploma.

Thomas noted that he was held back a grade twice in high school and enrolled in a dual credit program in order to graduate on time, forcing him to attend night classes at a community college just outside of town. This challenging time of his life was compounded when he broke his foot in a skateboarding accident and was forced to use crutches to get around. One night during class, a blizzard rolled in, his phone died and he was unable to call for a ride home.

“I just started walking with my toes exposed out the end of my cast,” recounted Thomas. “The snow was so bad that I couldn’t see the light poles, I fell a couple of times, I had to hop a cattle fence, and I kept thinking I needed to move faster because if I kept shoveling all this snow into my cast, I’m going to get frostbite. It was the worst three miles of my life.”

Thomas said he reminded himself why he was going to school in order to keep motivating him to keep moving forward: to set an example for his younger siblings.

“Walking back through that snow, I was thinking, like, why am I suffering,” he remarked. “But I thought that if I didn’t change something, my little brothers and my little sister were just going to live the same sad story and drop out. I wanted to break that cycle.”

Thomas pushed through the snow that night and moved on to graduate, even achieving an associate's degree and a certificate in welding. His younger siblings moved on to graduate as well, with one of his brothers getting two degrees and becoming a pastor, his other brother joining the U.S. Navy and his sister becoming a sous-chef.

Thomas thought back to that turbulent, stormy night during the cold morning of the Bataan Memorial Death March and was enkindled.

“I thought about how I had already walked through a blizzard, and that was way worse than the morning of the march,” he claimed.

Even with his previous experiences and the training for the march, Thomas said he had doubts and reflected on the few people who doubted his ability to complete the 26.2-mile course. But he looked at the other competitors and listened to the story of the Bataan POWs who marched more than double that amount with a determination to finish.

The event began and Thomas stepped off on the long trek, befriending a fellow Soldier and finding motivation in his age.

“The first several miles were uphill and I walked with a 57 year old Army Lieutenant Colonel who had served 11 years in the Marine Corps before switching to the Army,” he said. “Seeing him out there gave me a lot of inspiration, because if he can do it at his age, I can do it at 33 years old.”

He used that inspiration when fatigue set in around the halfway mark of the course.

“I definitely reached muscle failure a few times, just every muscle wanting to give up,” he revealed. “Being out there alone at times was the biggest challenge though, but I met a lot of cool people along the way. Some stranger even gave me a shot of pickle juice which helped me a lot with cramping.”

Thomas said his favorite part of the event was the views of the mountains, hills and desert, but they were starkly different from the views during his past marches as a civilian. He found more influence from other times he had to carry heavy weight on long marches with dreary city views.

After he earned his welding certificate, he found a welding job in Los Angeles, bought a car and moved out to California. But an unfortunate event led him to seek change.

“I invited my friend to come visit me out in California, and one night I lent him my car,” he remembered. “He parked it on the street during a street sweeping day and it got towed and impounded.”

Thomas said he found himself on a five mile walk everyday to and from work, but this time he carried a heavy load.

“I didn’t have a secure place to keep my tools or welder at the job site, so I put all my tools in a backpack and carried my welder,” he remarked. “It sucked, and it dawned on me that I could be getting paid to do this and have other benefits in the Army. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Thomas said he took inventory of what he was fighting for in his life: a meager wage, a tiny apartment and a job with no benefits. He knew he was cut out for something different and decided to enlist in the Army as a geospatial engineer.

Back on the Bataan Memorial Death March course, as his muscles failed him and his hands swelled, he remembered the contrast between his past and his present. He also remembered he was trying to set an example as a leader for the Soldiers he was leading back at his unit.

“They may not be my little brothers and sisters, but I treat them like they are and I lead by example,” he said with gratification. “I feel like if I can do stuff like the Bataan at 33 years old, it should be a walk in the park for some of these younger Soldiers.”

Thomas ran the last few miles, fighting to the very end. As he approached the finish line, he was surprised to see a couple faces he recognized.

“I was thinking, that old guy over there looks familiar,” he said with a grin. “ It was my dad and then I saw my mom. My dad was still hooked up to his oxygen tank, so I knew his journey to the finish line was probably a lot worse than mine. That moment made me really appreciate the people that I have in my life.”

His dad, Keith Thomas, a disabled Navy veteran whose service was cut short when he was struck by a tractor-trailer, claimed that it was a challenge to make it to the event, and it almost didn't happen because of icy roads.

“We wanted to surprise him and cheer him on, but we had some severe weather come through,” said his dad wearily. “We told him we wanted to come down there but because of the weather, things had changed. He had no idea we were going to be there, and we were in the perfect spot as he was coming around the corner to the finish.”

His dad expressed that it was an absolute joy to see his son cross the finish line.

“It was an apex moment in my life to see him and see what he had accomplished, because it was a grueling course,” his father said with warmth in his voice. “Some of the things he has done in the Army give me a whole new respect for his service and for the Army.”

The pride his parents feel for their son’s accomplishments carry over to Thomas as a feeling of self-assurance.

“I don't think there's anything that I can't do, and I haven't failed myself yet,” he said with satisfaction. “Maybe one day I'll get to that point where my body fails me, I mean, I can't say that'll never happen. It just hasn't happened yet, and I don’t expect it to happen any time soon.”

Thomas said he did a 12-mile ruck march with his Soldiers less than a week after completing the Bataan Memorial Death March in preparation for the Norwegian foot march later this month."

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — After more than five months of planning, U.S. Army South hosted their inaugural Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Symposium in downtown San Antonio, Texas on Feb. 22 and 23, 2023. Representatives from 16 Central and South American and Caribbean partner nations participated in panel discussions, question and answer sessions, senior leader discussions, and a presentation on the overall WPS framework.

“The United States Women, Peace, and Security strategy is a whole of government approach that guides our departments in implementing strategies that focus on the effects of armed conflict on women and girls,” said U.S. Army South Command Sergeant Major, Ronald Graves. “Symposiums such as this help to build and foster diverse teams of professionals and enable the opportunity for women to serve in leadership positions at all echelons.”

With each of the countries in attendance at varying levels of gender equality in their militaries, this forum served as a space to exchange ideas and best practices that have worked for each respective nation. During the discussions leaders vocalized the small wins that have gradually contributed to impactful changes.

“While this is the inaugural symposium, we are looking for more forums like this where military personnel from the region can get together and highlight WPS initiatives and the critical roles women in our militaries are playing,” said Cmdr. Judy-Ann Neil, Acting Inspector General of the Jamaica Defense Force. “Events like this give you an opportunity to hear from women in other militaries in the region and learn that despite the geographical and language barriers our challenges as being women in the military are really the same.”

One of the female leader’s attendees had the opportunity to hear from was retired Lt. Gen. Nadja West, 44th U.S. Army Surgeon General, who served on the panel centered on what it takes to build cohesive teams. During West’s panel she was asked how other countries can improve teamwork and ensure their voices are heard within their own militaries.

“The advice I gave was that actions speak louder than words, and if you’re seen to be able to do your job just as well as the Soldier next you, no matter what their gender is or whatever type of identifier that they have, that’s one way of breaking down those barriers and concerns about being a valuable member of the team,” West said.

West also took time to listen and appreciate what other women in the room had faced in their careers and how they overcame their own unique obstacles as women in leadership.

“It was really great to see women from other countries leading and serving in their militaries and coming together to try to determine how they can bring some of the lessons back to improve teamwork within their own militaries and their own countries,” she explained.

One thing that was evident throughout all the discussions was the common theme that the Department of Defense’s WPS Framework and Implementation Plan cannot be headed solely by women. Instead, it takes partnering with men in the profession of arms who are willing to lean forward, be open minded, and help implement positive changes that lead to stronger and more diverse organizations.

“I had the opportunity to hear the experiences of women who are pioneers in their countries' military services sharing experiences on the development of leaders,” said Brazilian Army Lt. Col. David Alencar who serves on the Brazilian Army Commander’s Personal Staff. “The experiences that were discussed make us reflect on the subject and drive us to want to implement these policies in our countries.”

Overall, everyone in attendance agreed that opportunities to discuss and further WPS strategies should happen more frequently.

“The decision the U.S. Army and participating armies have taken to have an event like this is great because these spaces give us the opportunity to continue enriching the subject of how to integrate women into security and defense,” said Ecuadorian Cpt. Elizabeth Munoz, Chief of Security and Accident Prevention for Army Signal. “I hope we can continue having these spaces so we can continue to have more and more women and men participate.”"

In 2000, the United Nations developed the Women’s Peace and Security (WPS) initiative fully recognizing the need for women to be included as a critical factor in achieving sustainable international peace and security. In full support of WPS, the Colombian army hosted a WPS panel discussion alongside U.S. Soldiers on Nov. 16, 2022 at the conclusion of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 at Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia.

Colombian army Sgt. Maj. Astrid Rubio Acosta, senior enlisted panel member and first female to hold the rank of sergeant major to serve in the Colombian army, used her opening remarks to provide words of encouragement to those in attendance speaking to the importance of setting goals and not allowing gender to get in the way of achieving those goals.

“Today, you must be fully convinced that you can do whatever it is you set out to do in your life,” she said. “It’s up to you to pave your own way and take your goals and find ways to achieve these goals.”

U.S. Army Maj. Kyle Ullmark, executive officer for the Illinois National Guard’s 2nd Battalion, 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, followed this by speaking to the importance leaders have in empowering their junior leaders and raising their confidence level to help them succeed both during their time in service as well as when they decide to move on to a new career outside of the military.

Colombian Women’s Day, which was celebrated just two days prior to the panel, is an annual celebration of women’s achievements in the country and recognizing women who serve as inspirations to the public. Commander of the Colombian National Army, Maj. Gen. Luis Mauricio Ospina Gutiérrez took a moment during his panel remarks to acknowledge one of his inspirations to continue serving.

“Sergeant Major Rubio, who is sitting on this panel with me, is one of the main examples that has been able to break the taboo of women serving in leadership roles as she is the first female to serve as a sergeant major in our army,” said Ospina. “It is because of her setting the example that new students at the NCO academy know now more than ever that anything is possible in their career.”

Leaders such Rubio and Lieutenant Katherine Romero, the Colombian army’s first female Huey II pilot who served as an aviation leader throughout Exercise Southern Vanguard 23, are certain to inspire soldiers for generations to come which many women did not have in the past.

U.S. Army Lt. Col. Michelle Martinez, Commander of U.S. Army South’s Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, recalled how her journey in the Army started with her having a small selection of female leaders to look up to.

“When I joined the Army 25 years ago, I did not think I would make to the position that I am,” she said. “Out of ten lieutenant colonels approximately four are selected for battalion command and of those four maybe one is a female but now the times have changed and the doors are open.”

Martinez continued by acknowledging how U.S. Southern Command’s Commanding General, Gen. Laura Richardson, is an inspiration and is paving the way for females serving in the Army today, including herself, to know that they can truly achieve anything they set their heart and mind to.

With more than 100 countries throughout the world including many who are not U.N. member nations currently having an implemented National Action Plan the importance of WPS on a global level cannot be overlooked and this panel is a small event that had a big impact on everyone in attendance."

DORAL, Fla. — The U.S. Army South-led “Programa Integral para Suboficiales de Alta Jerarquía,” or PISAJ, concluded on Nov. 18, 2022, after 13 days of training, briefings from war-fighting functions and tours of facilities between Washington, D.C. and Miami.

“PISAJ is not just an exchange focused on personal development of the Colombian noncommissioned officers, but also the advancement of the entire Colombian NCO corps,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Ronald J. Graves, the U.S. Army South senior enlisted advisor. “It’s repetitive engagements like PISAJ that help us create a shared understanding through relationships and trust.”

The impression this iteration of PISAJ has left on attendees will further progress their personal military development as well as the modernization of their militaries overall, said Colombian Army Sgt. Maj. Eli Mosquera Cruz.

“This experience with the U.S. Army has helped me better understand the role a sergeant major plays in developing individual soldiers and the army as an institution,” said Mosquera. “The wisdom gained and success we have achieved here is not only for the individuals attending but also for the sergeants major who will serve after us.”

One of the four female senior NCOs attending this iteration of PISAJ is the first female Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of Joint Chief of Staff of the Colombian military forces, Command Sgt. Maj. Consuelo Díaz Álvarez. She said every day her soldiers strengthen the capabilities of the Colombian NCO corps.

“Our sergeants major are leaving here stronger with wisdom and experience that will empower them to be better people and better leaders,” said Díaz. “Every day of PISAJ, we shared doctrine, reinforced our capabilities and learned lessons that will make us better advisors to the commanders of the Colombian army, and I know they will implement what they learned here to make our army stronger.”

Sgt. Maj. of the Colombian Army Mauricio Páez Acosta said the experiences and lessons learned during PISAJ are invaluable in providing a level of critical thinking necessary to lead soldiers.

“When a sergeant major comes to this program, they carry with them a different vision of how to lead their soldiers, facilitate the commander as well as how to influence the Colombian NCO corps,” said Páez. “As an advisor to the commander, we see things from a different perspective and we shine an opportunistic light on challenges he or she may face.”

Soldiers from the Illinois and Georgia National guard stood side by side with their Colombian Army counterparts one last time on the parade field of Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia during the closing ceremony of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23) on Nov. 16, 2022.

“I thank you for your professionalism, full dedication, and focused engagement throughout the week,” said U.S. Army South Commanding General, Maj. Gen. William Thigpen, as he spoke to the formation of more than 400 U.S. and Colombian Soldiers. “Our U.S. Soldiers participating from Georgia and Illinois National Guard were able to coordinate logistics, experience the rigors of Colombian Army’s training, and hone their squad and platoon level skills in Colombia’s challenging jungle terrain.”

Thigpen also took time to acknowledge Colombian Army’s Counternarcotics and Transnational Threats Command who trained alongside the U.S. Soldiers stating, “Your entire organization’s professionalism, tactical prowess, and enthusiastic approach to planning and executing this exercise was commendable.” He continued by saying, “I know your Army relies on your organization to conduct real-world missions every day, in a high-threat environment and the U.S. Army truly appreciates the opportunity to train with some of the finest Soldiers in this western hemisphere.”

Throughout the two-week exercise, U.S. and Colombian Army Soldiers used their previous training and experiences to collaborate and execute various situational training lanes including movement to contact, patrolling in dense jungle terrain, reacting to direct and indirect fire and medical treatment and evacuation techniques.

During the final day of training, Soldiers from both Armies put all they had learned to the test as the conducted a final combined assault operation which included an air insertion and navigating at night through the jungle during a torrential downpour.

Commander of the Colombian National Army, Maj. Gen. Luis Mauricio Ospina Gutiérrez spoke about the unique experience many of the Soldiers on the field had throughout the past two weeks and regarded the importance of the partnership that was further strengthened during ExSV23.

“I thank God allowing us to share this experience that enriches both of our nations capabilities,” he said. “The defense integration alliance with the United States of America is acknowledged as one of the most successful in the region and this training has helped to increase the level of training and interoperability of our Armies.”

The ever-increasing ability for the U.S. and Colombian Armies to work together through challenges was established during the Korean war and has garnered an increased level of interest in recent years.

“We have been developing this exercise annually alternating the headquarters between both countries,” he said. “It began in 2019 with the presence of a platoon from the South Carolina National Guard who trained alongside a platoon from the counter narcotics and trafficking brigade at this same facility and continued in 2021 when the counter narcotics and trafficking brigade conducted an exercise with the South Carolina National Guard at Fort Polk, Louisiana.”

The shared experience and insights that ExSV23 has provided for both Armies proves that this exercise was a success meeting all the training objectives laid out throughout the numerous planning conferences that led up to the past two weeks of execution.

Both Thigpen and Ospina concluded their remarks highlighting their eagerness to continue working together in the future at all levels and further building upon the already strong partnership the two Armies have established."

CAMP SMITH TRAINING SITE, N.Y. – Forty-six 101st Expeditionary Signal Battalion Soldiers spent Oct. 24 to Nov. 7 ensuring their communications gear will keep Army command posts talking to each other when they deploy to the Middle East in 2023.

The Yonkers-based New York Army National Guard signal battalion will mobilize 344 Soldiers to deploy to Kuwait to support the Army’s Task Force Spartan Shield in August.

Before mobilizing, they had to ensure that the satellite communications equipment and other components of the battalion’s Warrior Information Network-Tactical system were working properly, according to Lt. Col. Paul Mulligan, battalion commander.

Mulligan said the 46 Soldiers who volunteered for the additional annual training spent two weeks identifying component and equipment shortages, updating software systems, ordering parts, and submitting work orders for items they could not fix.

“This event was crucial in identifying equipment issues so we can request resources to fix them,” Mulligan said.

The Soldiers worked on 126 pieces of equipment, including the communications systems, vehicles and generators.

The Warrior Information Network-Tactical system, or WIN-T, is the Army communication system of transmitters, receivers, routers, switches, modems and cables that allows Army units to securely transmit voice, data, text, video and graphic data.

Mulligan said the 101st can deploy 30 teams and equipment to link command posts from the battalion up to the theater level.

Along with making sure the equipment is working, the training also gave Soldiers a chance to learn more about the equipment, said 1st Lt. Manuel Baltazar from the battalion operations staff.

“This training is crucial to increasing our Soldiers’ readiness as operators for their equipment,” said Baltazar, a former enlisted Soldier who is deploying as the battalion plans officer. “They’re doing cross-training on equipment they have never operated before, so it’s helping really increase the unit’s knowledge overall.”

Army Spc. Domingo Perez, a New York City police officer in civilian life, said he appreciated the chance to learn more about the battalion’s systems while troubleshooting them.

Perez, a multichannel transmission systems operator and maintainer, said he was learning a lot about the Phoenix satellite terminals used to communicate over vast areas by digging into the technical manual, or TM.

“The TM is your best friend,” Perez said. “Go into it and learn the Phoenix, learn how to troubleshoot it. It is very productive.”

Pfc. Janaiya Alexander, a wheeled vehicle mechanic in the battalion’s Alpha Company, appreciated the opportunity to work on vehicles for an extended period.

“It’s great to have more than a weekend to work on the trucks and Humvees,“ Alexander said.

Mulligan said the next step for his Soldiers would be installing the parts that were ordered.

That gear will be used for the battalion’s pre-mobilization training and then packaged and shipped to Kuwait.

The Georgia Army National Guard’s Fort Benning-based Team 6120, Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 54th Security Forces Brigade, 648th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade deployed Oct. 30 to Nov. 18, 2022, to Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia to support and participate in Exercise Southern Vanguard 23.

Southern Vanguard 23 is an annual exercise conducted by U.S. Army South within the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility which trains units at the operational and tactical levels to increase coordination between the U.S. and Western Hemisphere forces, in this instance, Colombia.

A Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB) is a specialized United States Army unit formed to conduct security force assistance (SFA) missions: to conduct advise, support, liaise, assess operations at echelon to enable operations with allied and partner nations. SFABs are intended to reduce the burden of such operations on U.S. Special Forces organizations after extensive SFA missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, allowing them to focus on training and operating with allied and partner national elite units.

“Team 6120’s focus for Southern Vanguard is to increase Colombian Army’s capability and capacity to conduct mission command at the Battalion operational and tactical level,” said Maj. Chris Dumais, commander and team leader, Team 6120. “Our Advisor’s developed a Combined Staff training plan focusing on the NATO Seven-Step operational planning process and direct support during a Combined Task-Force exercise.”

As a result of the Advisor’s security force assistance effort to build the institutional knowledge for the Colombian Army to support future multinational, regional and combined/joint interoperability at the tactical level between Colombian allies and partner nations. Overall, in accordance with the Integrated Country Strategy of the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, the goal of Team 6120 is that U.S. forces are the partner of choice in future training and potential operations for the Colombian Army.

SFAB Team 6120 is a 12-Soldier team comprised of experts in maneuver, fires, intelligence, explosive hazards, and support who are embedded with the Colombian Army to increase their ability to work with U.S., NATO, and partner nations.

The primary focus of the SFAB’s during the exercise is to assist the Colombian’s ability to perform command and control duties of their force conducting operations throughout the exercise.

“Our combined level of experience working in forward environments and our level of training provide the Colombians with subject matter experts which improve their ability to focus their forces,” said Sgt. 1st Class Hector Umaña, operations noncommissioned officer, Team 6120.”

Additionally, the SFAB are validating the Colombian soldier’s communication plan at the tactical-level and utilizing new command and control devices such as the CivTak (Civilian Tactical Awareness Kit) to improve situational awareness of the platoon and squad leaders. The ability to understand and anticipate the operational picture assists leaders in understanding the operational picture and can exercise disciplined initiative in the absence of orders from higher.

“The ability to utilize the CivTak and validate their communication procedures ensure commanders at all levels have the proper information,” said Sgt. 1st Class Thomas Davant, fires support advisor, Team 6120. “It ensures they have a common operating picture.”

The partnership between the U.S. and Colombian Army dates back almost 70 years ago to the Korean War when the Colombian Battalion, (an infantry battalion of the Colombian Army that served under United Nations Command during the Korean War from 1951 to 1954) the first Colombian military unit to serve in Asia, was attached to the U.S. 7th Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Divisions under 8th Army. There we fought and sacrificed to defend the freedom of our ally. The Colombian Battalion suffered 163 killed in action, 448 wounded, 60 missing, and 30 captured over the course of the conflict.

One of the most important missions of Team 6120 is ensuring partnerships at the tactical level and improving relationships between the U.S. military and Colombian forces. Team 6120 has inserted members at the team-level of the Colombian Army to accomplish this.

“Colombian Soldiers are definitely interested in our operational experiences over the last twenty years, and we are learning how they operate in decentralized environments at the tactical level,” said Staff Sgt. Jose Hernandez, explosive hazards advisor, Team 6120. “They are some of the most professional and dedicated partner forces I’ve had the pleasure to work with.”"

Bilateral exercises are an important part of building relationships between nations and enhancing the abilities of partner nation armies to work together through various missions and problem sets. Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23), currently taking place at Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia, is U.S. Army South’s premier training exercise designed to accomplish these goals.

“The interoperability, opportunities and experiences for me and my guys can’t be understated,” said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Nate Myers, a squad leader assigned to 2nd Battalion, 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Illinois Army National Guard said when asked about the exercise. “An example of what we have learned is that here in the jungle terrain we have learned a lot from the Colombians on how to conduct operations from a different tactical formation than we normally do.”

Reciprocally, the Colombian Soldiers are taking full advantage of this learning opportunity ensuring they learn everything they can from their U.S. Army counterparts.

“The importance for us in this exercise is to have the opportunity to exchange knowledge with our partners in the U.S. Army,” said Colombian Army 1st Lt. Simon Mosquera who is working as an Observer, Controller and Trainer throughout ExSV23. “It also allows us to improve in our capabilities in order to save lives and defend our country.

The ability to share best practices for military operations between armies is invaluable for everyone involved but it is not the only thing taking place of value. The friendships and memories being made at the lowest levels are something that will be remembered far into the future.

Colombian Army Staff Sgt. Octavio Munoz, a platoon sergeant assigned to the BRNCA 1 Special Anti-Drug Brigade and Staff Sgt. Myers direct counterpart, talked about the friendships being made at the barracks when the Soldiers are resting from a long day of training. He said, “we have the opportunity to share with each other about our families including our parents, wives and kids.”

Munoz also talked about the U.S. Soldiers learning the traditional Colombian game “Rana” which involves tossing metal rings or coins into the mouths of frog statues from a short distance away. “At first they were not very good but each day they are playing with us in the barracks area and continue to get better,” he said.

“So far it’s been an excellent experience and everyone has been extremely welcoming and friendly,” explained Myers. “I think I can speak for the entire platoon when I say that since getting on the ground we have had the most friendly and welcoming environment and it has greatly contributed to our experience as well as our ability to train here together.”

When the Soldiers assigned to the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team eventually depart back to their home state of Illinois they will take with them knowledge, experiences and friendships that will last a lifetime with many of the Soldiers exchanging email address and have plans to stay in touch through social media in the future."

More than 300 U.S. and Colombian soldiers stood tall in formation on the parade field of Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia, during the opening ceremony of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23). Exercise Southern Vanguard is U.S. Army South's premier annual training exercise taking place at the operational and tactical levels intended to increase interoperability between the United States and Western Hemisphere forces.

“Your role here in this exercise is the single-most important phase of building partnerships between nations.” said Brig. Gen. Rodney Boyd, Assistant Adjutant General for the Illinois Army National Guard, during his opening remarks at the ceremony. “Your work is what makes our militaries interoperable.”

He went on to explain some of what the Soldiers assigned to the 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Illinois Army National Guard and the 1st Battalion, 54th Security Force Assistance Brigade, Georgia Army National Guard can expect to experience working alongside their Colombian Army partners.

“Over the next week, the junior NCOs and company-grade officers will take the baton and develop the relationship between our two countries at the tactical level,” he said. “You will build deep personal connections as you conduct combined, company-level tactical operations.”

Brig. Gen. Fredy Coy, Colombian Army Chief of Staff of Operations, emphasized the relationship between the armies of the United States and Colombia and the history of their interoperability dating back more than 50 years ago.

“This relationship started a long time ago when we responded in Korea and conducted operations together,” he said during his remarks. “In Korea, this was the first time we were interoperable with our partner nations.”

While combined training exercises such as ExSV23 build upon the lethality, effectiveness and interoperability of all armies involved, the lasting friendships are equally important.

Boyd recalled his experience as a battalion commander training alongside the Ghanaian Army explaining that among his fondest memories are the friendships he made working alongside his Ghanian partners.

“To this day, I am in contact with a member of the Ghanian Army that I met during that exercise,” said Boyd. “Hopefully, you all will build similar memories over the course of the next week.”

Coy concluded his remarks by thanking the planners from both countries for developing and planning the exercise and by professing his hope that ExSV23 will be a great exercise for everyone involved.

As the ceremony ended, Soldiers from both Armies, instead of going their separate ways, lingered to discuss the training that lies ahead of them throughout the duration of the exercise."

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — As she sat in her office reminiscing about her life journey to becoming a U.S. Army Soldier, Master Sgt. Kathryan Torres, U.S. Army South lead sexual assault response coordinator, shed a tear thinking about the recent passing of her father.

“My dad was the most inspirational person for me even though we didn’t always see eye to eye,” Torres said emotionally. “He came to California from Puerto Rico as a young man, barely able to speak English, to pursue his dreams.”

Her father’s adventuristic nature rubbed off on Torres who is the middle child of three sisters.

From Fajardo, Puerto Rico, Torres was interested in sports and being outdoors while her sisters were more concerned with making friends and going out.

“I just wanted to be outside, climbing trees, playing sports and getting dirty,” she said with a childish grin.

Between her father’s wanderlust and her mother’s stability, Torres had great yet opposite role models even though her parents divorced at a young age.

Her mother raised her and her sisters as a single parent and worked nights at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station while her daughters slept and as her mother slept during the day, Torres stepped in the caretaker role for her younger sister.

“My older sister went to live with our grandmother, so my younger sister sees me a lot like her second mother,” Torres said proudly. “I did a lot of the housework, yard work and by age seven I could cook a full course meal.”

Her parents put a huge focus on education in and out of the home. Her mother pushed for her daughters to speak proper English at home and her father pushed them to achieve a university education.

Torres graduated high school at 17 years old and got a scholarship for a university in Puerto Rico, but her father encouraged her to attend Mount Saint Mary’s University in California where he worked.

“Making the choice to leave behind everything and everyone that I knew and loved was very difficult, and I was very overwhelmed by the college culture,” said Torres. “It definitely was not what I expected, so I was there for about a semester before going back to Puerto Rico.”

When she returned to Fajardo, she found herself alone. Her sisters had moved, her mother had joined the Navy Reserves and relocated to Florida, and she had no other blood relatives in her hometown.

She began practicing cosmetology at a local barber shop and working as a manager of a grocery store, but after a few years she was unsatisfied with where her journey had taken her.

“Being back home, I wasn’t hanging around a good crowd,” she said. “People I knew and grew up with were getting locked up for drugs or crime or even getting killed. It was one of those moments where I looked around and said, ‘I have so much more to offer, so what am I doing here?’”

Torres said she always wanted to be an agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Drug Enforcement Agency or serve in the military. The fastest way for her to escape the bad situation she was in was to join the Army.

She enlisted as an Ammunition Specialist in September 2005, and shipped off to Basic Combat Training, or BCT, as soon as she could.

“After I graduated from BCT and Advanced Individual Training, my first duty station was Fort Carson, Colorado, and I got there in February,” Torres said anxiously. “I had never experienced winter, so I left Puerto Rico in a tank top, shorts and flip flops. Right before we landed, the pilot said it was nine degrees in Colorado Springs.”

Torres said she was blessed with patient leadership that gave her time to acclimate to the new climate and although it took her some time to get used to the very different weather from Puerto Rico, Torres quickly adapted to the military lifestyle.

Torres deployed to Iraq October of 2006 and then again June 2010, both in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Those deployments taught her a lot about the people she surrounded herself with.

“What I learned the most was that the people you need behind you in battle and in life are always going to be there whether it’s family or battle buddies,” she said. “You have to learn how to lean on them.”

Torres said her first deployment was very different from her second due to the arrival of her son.

“My first deployment I was on a forward operating base in southeast Baghdad, and my parents kept telling me, ‘Please don't go over there and be a hero,’ because they knew that is who I am as a person,” she said. “The second, I was on a personal security detachment so I was on the road a lot, but my son wasn't even two years old. So being away from him was really hard.”

Her son’s father was also deployed in Iraq at the time and contracted a severe case of meningitis. Due to security concerns in the region, she was not able to receive updates on his status.

“It was a lot to deal with on top of the stress of completing the mission,” Torres expressed. “I did a lot of meditating during that deployment, because I was the rear vehicle commander and when we went out the gates, my team needed me to be focused. I learned I could handle a lot more stress than I could have ever imagined and still perform under the pressure of combat.”

After her deployments, Torres went through the U.S. Army Drill Sergeant Academy in Fort Jackson, South Carolina to help transform civilian volunteers to become Combat Engineers.

During her time at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, she noticed something wasn’t right with her daughter.

“I was supposed to get stationed in Hawaii, but my daughter, who was about one year old, began regressing in her development,” she said. “I thought she might be autistic, and there was an opening at Army South on Joint Base San Antonio - Fort Sam Houston which is the main post for medical across all branches. So, I took the position, arrived here, and ultimately she was diagnosed with autism.”

Fortunately, she was able to get all the medical treatment her daughter needed, but Torres needed the support of her family once again as her mission required her to travel often. Her mother assisted with childcare as she traveled all over Central and South America and the Caribbean.

Torres was able to receive a compassionate assignment into her current position to allow for continued medical treatment for her daughter.

Through all of her assignments, deployments and missions, Torres attributes her triumphs and successes to the support of her family, friends and battle buddies. Specifically, her mother, Tammy, and her two sisters, Jennifer and Tamara, who stepped up to care for her children throughout the years and always pushed her to be the leader she was meant to be.

“I've always had an amazing support system back home from my family and friends and in the military as well,” Torres said with a smile. “When you have that, it makes all this pretty easy. I mean 17 years in the Army has gone by pretty quick, and the rest of my story is still being written.”"

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – U.S. Army South’s staff officers, noncommissioned officers and civilians had the opportunity to take part in the first iteration of the U.S. Army War College’s (USAWC) mobile Theater Army Staff Course Sept. 12-16. Participants ranged from those who arrived within the last two weeks to those who had been assigned to the headquarters for over a year.

The five-day course consists of over thirty briefings from USAWC faculty and included instruction from Army South directorate leads with the first block of instruction focusing on the history of Theater Armies.

“The Theater Army is an essential headquarters that the Army provides to the joint commanders, in this case [U.S.] Southern Command, in order to do all manner of functions that the Army provides to all joint commanders and joint headquarters,” stated retired Army Col. John A Bonin.

Bonin, a distinguished fellow of the Center for Strategic Leadership, elaborated on what makes the Theater Army unique.

“Unlike most Army headquarters it has at least two bosses,” he explained. “It has an Army boss, the Department of the Army, for resources, guidance and for supervision and Army functions, but they also support and work directly for a joint commander who are all four-star combatant commanders.”

Throughout the week, participants were given the opportunity to dialogue and query instructors on best practices when operating at this level of command.

Sgt. Maj. Juan Rivera, Army South G2 Sergeant Major, was thankful for the opportunity to learn from the USAWC faculty and senior Army South directorate leads.

“It allowed me to understand how my directorate integrates into the broader Theater Army mission as well as how we work with other directorates to meet the CG’s intent,” he said. “I also learned that it’s really hard for us to get resources so the job for the staff is to negotiate on behalf of the command to get the resources we need to accomplish our missions.”

The course was led by a senior mentor, retired Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, who provided critique and analysis throughout the day-to-day instruction.

“We want to help new members of the team understand what sort of organization they’re a part of, because there is always an assimilation process, and we can help accelerate that by giving them a better appreciation of the challenges and the requirements of that particular command,” emphasized MacFarland.

He went on to express the complexities facing Theater Armies today which include refocusing doctrine to large scale combat operations (LSCO) as well as gaps that Army South specifically has that are important to the overall mission of an Army Service Component Command/Theater Army.

He further explained that his team’s intent was to explore those challenges and help the Army South team begin the process of creating solutions for those challenges identified during the course.

MacFarland expressed how an economy of force theater like Army South, which is severely-resource constrained, requires creative and innovative thinking to accomplish the mission in front of them.

“The big challenge in this theater of operations is perhaps declining Russian influence but growing Chinese influence. This is our front yard and it’s important for us to continue to ensure that the western hemisphere remains an American hemisphere,” he said. “The key terrain here is obviously the Panama Canal, which is so essential to our war plans in the Pacific and Europe and the ability to shift resources between them. It was critical in the second world war, and it will remain critical throughout the 21st Century.”

MacFarland also discussed Army South’s role in the geostrategic balance of power within the region.

“We also need to make sure we don’t have any malign influence causing us problems in our front yard driving ever higher levels of migration, criminal activities, intelligence collection against us and destabilizing of our partner nations,” he said. “We must ensure, despite a scarcity of resources, none of that happens, and at the same time disrupt China’s plan for extending its Belt and Road initiative across the globe.”

Army South as an organization has evolved over the decades with roots stemming from the Caribbean Defense Command, U.S. Army Caribbean, to an eventual merger with Sixth United States Army in 2008.

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO - FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – The smell of food, sounds of music and traditional dancing were on display as the Soldiers and civilians assigned to United States Army South (ARSOUTH) officially kicked off National Hispanic Heritage Month on the morning of Sept. 16, 2022 with a celebration of culture in front of the headquarters building.

National Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated annually from Sept. 15 – Oct. 15 since it was expanded from its original week-long celebration by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. The mid-month start and end dates are significant to Hispanic heritage with five countries celebrating their independence on Sept. 15 along with numerous others throughout the date range.

“It’s important to celebrate all history and culture and our Army would not be what it is today with the contributions and successes of Hispanic Americans,” explained Sgt. 1st Class James Davis, U.S. Army South’s Equal Opportunity Advisor and National Hispanic Heritage Month celebration event coordinator. “Their contributions throughout history are found throughout the Army including right here at Army South, which can be seen in our Hall of Honor where we inducted retired Lieutenant General Marc Cisneros earlier this year.”

During his service, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Cisneros served as the commanding general of ARSOUTH and Joint Task Force Panama during Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 and 1990 which led to the successful capture of Gen. Manuel Noriega.

The theme of this year’s celebration is Unidos – Inclusivity for a Stronger Nation. According to the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) website, Unidos can be translated to mean “united,” “connected” or “close.”

“We are a multicultural Army made up of Soldiers from all backgrounds and walks of life, so I believe Unidos is a great word to sum up the celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month,” said Davis. “Throughout our Army and throughout Army South this concept is an important aspect of who we are, and it truly makes us a stronger more cohesive unit.”

Dr. Hector Martinez, guest speaker for the event said, “Hispanic cultures around the world are unique in their own ways but share a common core of similarities; a certain inner-pride in what it means to be Hispanic.”

He continued his remarks by recognizing two Hispanic American leaders, Medal of Honor recipient Master Sgt. Leroy Petry and community activist Lizzie Vasquez, and by challenging those in attendance to follow their lead and make a difference in their community whether they are Hispanic American or not.

With a month dedicated to celebrating the achievements, histories, contributions and cultures of Americans with Hispanic ancestry, ARSOUTH will benefit greatly by having a more profound understanding of the partner nations they work with on a regular, sometimes daily, basis.

ARSOUTH’s area of responsibility encompasses 31 nations and 15 areas of special sovereignty with almost 500 million people speaking over 100 different languages. Soldiers and civilians assigned to the command regularly travel throughout the region building and strengthening relationships with many of these countries promoting unity and cooperation throughout the Western Hemisphere.

“It’s good for non-Latin American U.S. citizens to know what their neighbors are like, what their culture and backgrounds are and to understand that the fusion of our culture brings about something beautiful,” explained Mexican American Maj. Teddy Villasenorloya, one of ARSOUTH’s Foreign Area Officers. “Whether it’s professional engagements or military engagements, we can go out there and make friends with everybody since we know each other’s backgrounds.”

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Representatives from U.S. Army South traveled to Honduras to lead a Central American Working Group meeting during a three-day event held from September 7-9, 2022.

The CENTAM Working Group includes armies from three Latin American nations: El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The event marked the third time all participating nations gathered to continue coordinating efforts for 2023 and proposing future events for 2024 through 2027.

Honduran Gen. Jose Luis Sauceda Sierra, Commander of Joint Doctrine and Military Education, welcomed all participating nations to the country and emphasized the importance of working together to increase capabilities.

“With this we become more efficient and perform better in all of the exercises, this way we would have better results allowing us to improve our capabilities to support our force and improve their professionalism,” said Sauceda Sierra.

Lt. Col Miguel A. Gonzalez, International Military Affairs Chief for Army South Security and Cooperation Division and the head of the delegation for the U.S. Army, thanked Honduras for their hospitality and highlighted the importance of the meeting.

“The purpose of the CENTAM Working Group is to strengthen the bilateral and multilateral relationship and develop capabilities of mutual interest to counter the proliferation of threat networks and respond to crises that threaten regional stability,” said Gonzalez.

After introductions, each army provided a brief overview of their operations and explained challenges they have faced during the previous year. In addition to the overviews, the working group discussed lessons learned from CENTAM Guardian 22 to help with the success of CENTAM Guardian 2023.

CENTAM Guardian is a multinational exercise designed to increase rapid response, security operations and strengthen hemispheric cooperation and collaboration, explained Marco V. Rosito, CENTAM desk officer in Security and Cooperation Division for Army South.

“We realize there are common issues affecting the region and if we address them together we would be more effective than addressing them as individual countries,” said Rosito.

The three-day working group closed with proposals, objectives and activities for support from now until 2027, and finished with the signing of the minutes signaling the commitment for the armies to continue cooperating.

“Through this event we support and cooperate with our regional partners to improve our border security efforts,” closed Gonzalez.

The next CENTAM Working Group meeting is the gathering of principals where they will review and approve the staff work and activities coordinated for the next year."

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — Summer is here and it’s a busy time for U.S. Army personnel and families as they move to their next assignment. Despite domestic improvements regarding COVID-19, the pandemic still proves problematic in other parts of the world and continues to affect the shipping industry.

In response, the U.S. Transportation Command, U.S. Army and the Army Sustainment Command are working hard to continuously improve the permanent change of station process for its customers and family members.

“The pandemic has impacted all sectors of the global market. Ports, port agents, customs, trucking, rail and shipping are all part of those sectors that have been impacted by the pandemic, and they continue to see shortfalls in labor, drivers, material, fuel, increased operating costs as well as other operational resources,” said Col. Courtney Abraham.

Abraham serves as the director of the Army Personal Property Lead Element — or APPLE — and commander of ASC’s Joint Personal Property Shipping Offices-Mid Atlantic, or JPPSO-MA.

Located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, APPLE is the Army’s lead integrating organization in the Defense Personal Property Program and the collective Joint Enterprise. Its mission is to plan, manage and provide technical oversight to Army Personal Property Shipping and Processing Offices globally.

APPLE maintains operational control of both JPPSOs located at Fort Belvoir and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. JPPSO-MA is one of six Army-led shipping offices. This organization executes personal property movement services to authorized personnel within a specified area of responsibility. The JPPSO-MA supports shipments within portions of 12 states, including the Washington, D.C. area.

This PCS season brings many improvements compared to previous years, said Abraham. USTRANSCOM has adjusted domestic and international transit times to provide better predictability and expectation management for Soldiers and families for delivery of their household goods, he said.

“All overseas PCS locations could be impacted, no one greater than another,” Abraham said. “The Personal Property enterprise continues to monitor changes in the global supply chain closely and continually communicates with our industry partners in order to implement the best business practices to support our Soldiers and families.”

In late 2020, ASC began equipping units with tablets specifically to aid quality assurance inspectors in the field. “Quality assurance inspectors can perform operations and reporting while on the road, utilizing their WiFi-enabled tablets, mobile devices or hotspots,” Abraham explained.

Tablets allow inspectors to reach more customers in the duty day, as well as to immediately provide customers with resources, handouts and report findings into the USTRANSCOM system of record without having to return to a traditional office.

Additionally, the Army has a 75% onsite physical inspection standard by quality assurance personnel, surpassing the Defense Transportation Regulation standard of 50%. The Army currently has an 87% physical inspection rate, meaning an inspector has provided in-person representation at time of pack, pickup or delivery.

Abraham detailed the following changes to the overall PCS process that have been implemented since May 2021:

Improving inventories : “We are working with the moving companies to shift from paper copies of inventories and use electronic inventories to the greatest extent possible. This will provide an improved record of the household goods pack-out and the condition they were in when packed. This effort is to accelerate the inventory and accountability process of household goods, eliminate paper copy exchanges, and enable digital transmission and storage of the inventory records offering better services to members and families when moving. Electronic inventories will be mandatory in 2023.”

Also known as ‘spread dates,’ this refers to the seven-day window during which your moving company is required to pick up your shipment. This policy is designed to give you more control over requesting a specific date range to schedule your move.”

: “The moving company will identify points of contact and email the Soldier/family with that information to facilitate better communication before, during and after the move, improving the overall PCS experience.” Simplifying claims : “Created a standardized form to simplify filing an inconvenience claim across the DOD.

In the past, the threshold was 60% of the total shipment.”

: “Moving companies are already required to place seals on containers, but we’re adding a requirement that customers be notified if any seals are broken, that seals be replaced, and that these actions and communications are noted in the record.” Better communication : “Increased service provider availability by phone – added Saturday customer support requirement during peak of the relocation period; provider must return calls on same business day and wait times cannot exceed 20 minutes. Additionally, movers are required to provide customers a 24-hour notice of delivery and make two attempts to contact the customer, with each attempt at least six hours apart, before transferring the customer’s shipment to storage-in-transit.”

Simplified convenience claims processing; improved in-transit visibility; single point of contact with moving companies; and have choice to repair or receive repair costs for damages, including full replacement cost.”

process reduces travel payments to less than two days. The Basic Allowance for Housing rate is in effect at all 40 on-base Intercontinental Hotel Groups Army Hotel locations in the U.S. through the end of fiscal 2022.

IHGs have agreed to only charge Soldiers at their BAH rate when they must stay in temporary lodging for extended periods of time due to housing or household good delivery challenges.

MILPER Message 22-0045 (CAC-enabled): Allows commanders the flexibility to change report dates by 30 days either before or after the initial report date, or up to 60-day deferment working with the Installation Directorate of Human Resources to get approval.

Despite all these improvements and bearing aforementioned challenges in mind, Abraham said the Soldier still has much input regarding how successful a PCS can be. He recommended Soldiers always do the following to ensure their PCS goes as smooth as possible:

Once orders are received, visit the installation transportation office immediately to receive household goods counseling and complete shipment application(s).

Communicate challenges with chain of command early, so they can assist and work with the installation transportation office to identify all possible options to support the Soldier and their family; there are several choices available to Soldiers and families to support challenges during their PCS Move.

Provide feedback via the Customer Satisfaction Survey. As of May 15, all customers are now asked to complete a brief survey via text message regarding various milestones throughout their move — entitlement counseling, pack/pickup, delivery and claims.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas – U.S. Army South hosted component planners and military representatives from seven Caribbean and South American countries for PANAMAX 2022 Planning in Crisis (PIC) training here from 6-10 June, 2022.

PANAMAX 2022 is a U.S. Southern Command-sponsored, multinational annual exercise scheduled for 1-12 August, 2022 with a purpose of strengthening partnerships, enhancing readiness and improving interoperability between U.S. Armed Forces and partner nations. This planning event served as an opportunity to build upon the combined capabilities of planning and executing complex operations during the upcoming exercise.

“One of our number one priorities is always partnership,” said Maj. Gen. William Thigpen, commanding general of U.S. Army South and PANAMAX 2022 commanding general of multinational forces. “Although we come from different countries, different services and we speak different languages we’ve got to develop a very common framework and sight picture on how we see our planning process.”

Chilean Army Logistics Division Commander and Deputy Commanding General of Multinational Forces for PANAMAX 2022, Maj. Gen. Ricardo Stangher, said the PIC is an opportunity for all of the military branches of partner nation forces to practice the planning process and procedures together as well as share common doctrine.

“During this exercise, we have been able to engage with partner nations and their staff to exchange views and establish professional bonds which will carry forward in a future scenario that will require a multinational response,” said Stangher. “Training together in this PIC exercise brings us closer to having a greater certainty regarding the efficiency of the joint planning procedures that could eventually be applied in a situation that affects regional security.”"

It was February 2022 when Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Grinston announced that in conjunction with the annual U.S. Army Best Warrior competition the Army would also conduct the inaugural U.S. Army Best Squad Competition.

Throughout the Army, squads immediately began training hoping to be selected to represent their division in September with the goal of being recognized as the best squad in the Army.

For Staff Sgt. Reycel Dasher, an infantryman serving as one of the many noncommissioned officers on the U.S. Army South staff, this opportunity presented an additional challenge in order to compete, he didn’t have a squad to lead.

“I had very little time to prepare once I had identified my squad but the second I identified them we started training on EIB and ESB tasks,” he said as he explained that U.S. Army South doesn’t work in traditional infantry squads. “I immediately started doing PT with them and asking them general knowledge and it was different because they came from different backgrounds as far as how long they have been in the Army.”

Leading a squad is something Dasher has done in the past, so his experience helped gear his training and boost his confidence even though the squad was assembled from different sections of U.S. Army South.

“It was difficult because it was short notice,” explained Dasher. “I’m also the only infantryman in our squad and the rest of them are geospatial engineers that I don’t really work with.”

He further explained that working with new Soldiers happens regularly in a traditional infantry squad as Soldiers are promoted or are moved for various reasons. While working with newly assigned Soldiers wasn’t new to Dasher, this type of competition was new.

Not knowing what to expect in a squad-oriented competition made the first day a bit of a shock when the teams arrived and immediately took a written exam as individuals.

“Next time I will put a little more focus on practicing board questions since that is how this competition started out with a written test,” he said. “It had a lot of general knowledge but things you may not have thought about in a long time.”

Once his team got in the swing of competing, he felt better about the chances his squad had of not only competing well but potentially winning.

“So far, I think our squad is doing really good. It looks like we are killing it out there and at least with the ACFT I know we had a good squad average,” Dasher explained at the end of the first full day of competition.

With the rest of the competition remaining unknown he had one final thing to say when asked about how he was feeling.

“I’m just taking it as it comes and not trying to fatigue my body too much and I’m definitely having fun and I will definitely try to do this again in the future as a squad leader.”"

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — It has been less than a year since Sgt. Ester White’s mom passed away. She credits her fellow Soldiers with helping her get through the difficult time by letting her know she was an integral part of the team.

“If I was a civilian at the same timeframe my mom passed away, I would’ve acted out way differently than I would have now,” said White, an automated logistics specialist assigned to U.S. Army South. “As a civilian, I would have just not gone back to work at all. But with the military, while I was on leave people were texting me, ‘when are you coming back? We need help!’”

White was born in Korea where she spent most of her childhood. Oftentimes, she has been mistaken as Pacific Islander, but she was born to a Korean mom and a dad of Black and Native American descent.

“I grew up in an Asian household,” said White. “Even though my dad was American, he speaks Korean.”

In 2012, White joined the Army National Guard at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania. In 2016 she began serving active duty and was stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Carson, Colorado; U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, South Korea; and completed a nine-month rotation in Europe.

“In Korea, all of my Soldiers were straight out of [advanced individual training] and never left their barracks, so I found ways to get them out, and I was their tour guide,” said White. “It felt good to do something like that because it reminds me of my mom who was like that. She was always happy and always helping people. So It makes my day when I know I’m able to help my Soldiers.”

White, whose goal is to become a warrant officer or a first sergeant, said being in the Army has given her purpose and drive and has taught her resiliency. She plans to serve every day carrying on her mother’s legacy and following in her footsteps.

“Even though my mom was really tiny, she has really big shoes to fill,” said White. “I feel like my mom was the perfect person, and people can’t be perfect. But, when everyone says the same thing about my mom and how she impacted so many people in her life, I want to do things for people the way she did.”"

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (May 23, 2022) - In recent years, Latin America and Caribbean countries have suffered major environmental disasters whether by torrential hurricanes or catastrophic earthquakes in the region, causing floods and landslides that left thousands of people displaced and a high human death toll. During a two-week period in 2020, Guatemala and Honduras were slammed by Hurricanes Eta and Iota which led U.S. Army South to deploy Soldiers to the region to assist in humanitarian assistance efforts.

As part of Army South’s mission to respond and be ready in disaster situations, the command facilitated the first-ever CENTAM GUARDIAN exercise held May 1-20, to build readiness, resilience and confidence across the Central American region.

“This exercise is an important opportunity to build the capacity of our armies and critical civilian support organizations,” said Col. Chip Karels, Army South G3/7 director of training and exercises (TREX). “Each of the three phases of the exercise were designed to build both capability and capacity from the tactical, Soldier skills level to multi-national disaster response.”

G7 TREX planners led the planning effort for CENTAM GUARDIAN 22, but Karels mentioned creating the exercise was an Army South team effort across the command with planners from other directorates providing crucial support in their areas of expertise.

Divided into three phases, CENTAM GUARDIAN consisted of a field training exercise (FTX), a humanitarian assistance and disaster response table-top exercise (TTX) and an operational command post exercise.

The FTX involved U.S. Soldiers from 7th Special Forces Group, Puerto Rico Army National Guard, and 60 Soldiers from the Salvadorian Army. The FTX consisted of basic Soldier skills including first aid, movement, land navigation, and basic rifle marksmanship.

“The multi-national nature of CENTAM GUARDIAN inevitably led to challenges based on competing requirements and the diverse areas of training within each event,” Karels said. “The support from the partner nations was excellent and it was only through their significant efforts that the exercise was able to succeed.”

Prior to the TTX, the participants received two days of academic classes to review their basic knowledge of urban search and rescue methodologies to prepare them for the disaster scenario.

“It’s not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’” said Jesus Escalona, Costa Rica Red Cross director of operations, expressing the reality of natural disasters which takes place in the region. For the TTX, the scenario involved an earthquake causing major damage in El Salvador; to include building collapses, trapped survivors and landslides.

“We’re evaluating the process for El Salvador to see how well they will do when their resources come to an end because of the damage,” Escalona said. “We want to see how they can get resources from Honduras and Guatemala, but in real life, it may be any other country that comes to their aid.”

He emphasized the responders must have interoperability between their nations when requesting for resources and quickly be able to navigate around “the bureaucracy and red tape” in order to get aid, equipment and other resources they need.

During the After Action Review several agencies noted deficiencies with plans, processes, and authorities within their organizations. They agreed to work the issues and test them at next year’s CENTAM GUARDIAN 23 exercise.

Evaluation from the academics portion and the table-top exercise provided Hernan Ramos, group leader, Search and Rescue Unit, Permanent Contingency Commission (COPECO) of Honduras, to reevaluate his organization’s practices on urban search and rescue.

COPECO is part of a Central American network of government disaster relief agencies known as the Coordination Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters in Central America.

“We are able to look at our current standard operating procedures, the equipment we have, and examine how we jointly work with another country in the event we would have to have a multinational response,” Ramos said. “An earthquake that happens in Honduras, for example, could have devastating impacts on our neighboring countries as well. This exercise allows for all the responders to speak the same language.”

With new members as part of the COPECO team, Ramos saw the TTX as an opportunity to stress those newcomers who have not yet participated in a real-life crisis.

“The objective is to give them a better understanding and some experience here, so when a real disaster happens, they’ll have some knowledge on the systems to react,” he said. “Those of us with more experience also get a chance to refresh and recollect best practices; and share our experiences with our new team members.”

According to Karels, the CPX was designed to develop collaboration and information sharing opportunities to combat against transnational organized threats. Honduras and Guatemala participated with brigade headquarters elements, with El Salvador worked at the battalion level.

The CPX was structured around a coordination cell manned by liaison officers from all three partner nation armies. Events were injected into a national headquarters, processed and then passed to the coordination cell. The coordination cell turned the data into information and passed it to the appropriate national headquarters to process for action.

The CPX and HA/DR TTX were supported by Soldiers from the 321st Civil Affairs Brigade and the 54th Security Forces Assistance Brigade.

During the closing ceremony, Brig. Gen. Lynn M. Heng, Army South deputy commanding general, praised the Salvadorans for hosting the exercise and highlighted the significance of the training.

“I thank our El Salvadoran hosts and everyone who has worked so hard bringing this exercise to life – it was truly a tremendous training event,” Heng said. “The importance of this cannot be overstated since most humanitarian missions occur on short notice and we simply never know when we could find ourselves working together in the future. Our ability to coordinate and respond collectively as a region to facilitate the timely arrival of humanitarian assistance will certainly support the effort to save lives and alleviate suffering.”

With the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season on the horizon, Ramos mentioned he was appreciative of the U.S. Army for coordinating CENTAM GUARDIAN 22. As he prepared for departing El Salvador back to Honduras, he felt his team benefitted from the training scenarios would be ready “if and when” a natural disaster strike.

“Having the U.S. Army coordinate this exercise is great, coming from a technical and economic stance, because the regional countries don’t have a lot of support,” Ramos said. “For us, having an ally that has the technical capability, financial power and experience in the field is a great help for us to strengthen our national capacity in terms of emergency management.”"

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — “In traditional military operations we need to be able to shoot, move and communicate. We need to identify key positions, know the terrain and know enemy capabilities. Cybersecurity is the same concept,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Luis D. Nieves, a U.S. Army cyber defender assigned to the U.S. Army 915th Cyber Warfare Battalion. Nieves was chosen as an Army expert during a recent cyber defense subject matter expertise exchange between the U.S. and Argentine armies.

Personnel from U.S. Army South coordinated this three-day exchange with the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Directorate to share how U.S. Army cyber defense plays a role in military operations and defense of the nation.

“We had U.S. Soldiers engaging with the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Division personnel at all echelons from strategic leadership, action officer to the analyst level,” said Sgt. Maj. Albert Dernberger, Army South Fires and Effects Directorate senior enlisted advisor. “It is a very collaborative environment when we talk about cyber and trying to figure out how the adversary maneuvers in that space, so we learn a lot from each other.”

Dernberger explained that we look at cyber partnerships as key players in developing a holistic defensive posture.

“Other countries see similar threats, together we can identify tactics, techniques and procedures of the adversary, and use those things to bolster our security, and in return we are providing that information back through various mechanisms so our partners can bolster their security as well,” he said.

Col. Luis P. Guimpel, director of the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Division led the Argentine army during the exchange and will also serve as the cyber operations cell lead during the annual PANAMAX exercise taking place at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, in August 2022. PANAMAX is a multinational exercise that provides training opportunities for nations to work together and build the capability to plan and conduct complex multinational operations.

“We have always been partners, and these events continue to build that partnership,” said Guimpel.

U.S. Army South has a long-lasting relationship with partner nation armies’ cyber communities of interest and work with cyber professionals in the region to build cybersecurity capacities and capabilities through exchanges, offering opportunities to participate in international cyber conferences and participation in cyber cells during multinational and bilateral exercises.

“We learned a lot about the Argentine army’s challenges with defending their military networks from cyber attacks, and we were able to discuss some of the shared challenges such as talent retention and organizational development,” said Dernberger.

As the exchange came to a close, Guimpel shared knowledge from one of his military professors during his time as a young army lieutenant.

“No one person or organization can know everything,” he said. “That piece of information holds true today, over 30 years later. It is imperative that we continue to come together and share information so we can continue strengthening our defenses.”"

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – U.S. Army South hosted the 7th annual Peru-U.S. Army Staff Talks at the U.S. Army South headquarters May 16-18 where delegations from the Peruvian and U.S. armies reviewed over 100 agreed-to-actions to take place over the next six years.

The U.S. Army Staff Talks Program serves as a bilateral forum for strategic-level discussion between respective armies to develop professional partnerships and increase interaction between partner nation armies.

“The staff talks allow us to, above all, establish mutual trust (and) to develop our intuitional transformation plan,” said Lt. Gen. David Ojeda Parra Peruvian Army chief of staff. “This is our third institutional transformation plan, which is the second transformation plan that has received support from the United States Army. That complements our efforts strongly because we are aiming toward the same goals, interests and shared values.”

During these talks, the U.S. Army works to develop activities with our partners in an effort to work together toward common goals. Agreed-to-actions can include anything from joint engineer projects, exchange programs between elite military schools, subject matter expert exchanges, doctrine exchanges, research and development cooperation and exercises.

“One of the engagements Army South is helping to facilitate between the Peruvian army and the U.S. Army Core of Engineers is a civil military emergency preparedness program,” said Maj. Allan M. Blair, U.S. Army South political-military plans officer.

“Support for emergency and risk management is one of the objectives we both want to achieve. We created the first multipurpose brigade, which has received support from Army South. The intent is to achieve a brigade-sized force interoperable with the U.S. Army,” said Ojeda.

Blair mentioned other efforts are underway for the next several years to include helping the Peruvian army modernize their doctrine and transform their human resources management systems.

As part of the Peruvian Army’s transformation plan, Army South G1 Director Col. Stewart J. VanBuren will lead a delegation from U.S. Army South along with senior members from the Peruvian Army’s Directorate of Personnel Resources to the U.S. Army Human Resources Command at Fort Knox, Kentucky.

“This engagement supports the Peruvian Army’s 13-year plan to completely transform the processes and products by which their Soldiers are managed, assigned, schooled, retained and retired,” said Lt. Col. Jason C. Atkinson, Army South chief of human resources, plans. “The significance of these activities is we apply the tenets of Lean Six Sigma and continuous process improvement to the Peruvian Army’s human resources doctrine, policies and methods. The end result will be an improved process management to better support interoperability between the United States and Peru.”

As a result of the staff talks, the Peruvian army also plans to participate as observers in Exercise Southern Vanguard in Colombia and Brazil. The Peruvian army also plans to conduct an iteration of the multi-lateral exercise in Peru in 2028."

SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras – U.S. Army South finished a contingency command post (CCP) deployment exercise here on May 19, to increase readiness for upcoming contingencies in the U.S. Southern Command’s (SOUTHCOM) area of operations.

During the nine-day forward exercise, over 60 Soldiers from Army South, 470th Military Intelligence Brigade, 410th Contracting Support Brigade (410th CSB), and 56th Signal Battalion set up the CCP tactical operations center, tactical satellite communications, and participated in several operations and intelligence briefs with Army South, U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) and 410th CSB to rehearse their staff function as SOUTHCOM’s command and control element during contingency operations.

“There were metrics that [the CCP team] had to meet to ensure that they could deploy and be an operational command post in an austere environment,” said Brig. Gen. Lynn Heng, Army South deputy commanding general. “In the future, we will build upon that and bring in some more entities and organizations to build out our capabilities.”

Contingency operations are large-scale and require a coordinated U.S. government response, and training like this is key to ensuring that all participants are prepared in case a real-world crisis takes place.

The CCP will support SOUTHCOM, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), other federal agencies and non-governmental organizations during humanitarian crises, natural disasters and other contingency operations in the Caribbean, Central and South America.

“The BHA is the lead federal coordinator of international humanitarian response, and that means USAID has the mandate to assume that leadership position and determine the strategy and approach for U.S. government response of pulling in the relevant interagency support if required.” said Kaitlyn Neuberger, USAID’s humanitarian assistance advisor to the military at SOUTHCOM. “In order for the military to get involved the Department of Defense (DoD) must provide a unique capability or service that can’t be provided by civilian organizations.”

Neuberger went on to say unique and rapid DoD capabilities like air traffic control, transportation and civil engineering are most commonly necessary during natural disasters like the 2010 Haiti earthquake and Hurricanes Matthew and Iota.

Contingency operations are multifaceted, which is why the CCP trains and rehearses to deploy expeditiously. Maj. Sean Buchanan, CCP operations officer in charge, said there are communication and logistical requirements to accomplish mission success during humanitarian or disaster relief.

“This size element hasn’t deployed since the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and a lot of internal and external logistical coordination went into getting here and back for this deployment exercise, so it was a balancing act between the movement of equipment and personnel,” said Buchanan. “Once we were on the ground, we were able to integrate as a staff to get everything set up and establish communications within just over 24 hours of arrival.”

Setting up communications enables the joint task force commander to have situational awareness of what is happening on the ground and relay that information to all other entities involved.

Chief Warrant Officer Morgan McCarty, CCP network operations chief, said without having efficient communication between all agencies involved in a mission, they would not be able to have coordinated operations.

“We were able to set up many different levels and types of communications, such as commercial internet, virtual teleconferencing, radio, telephone and several others to provide communication between everyone involved in the operation,” said McCarty. “Our team did a great job of stress testing our network capabilities, rapidly troubleshooting and fixing any issues that arose during this expeditionary exercise, so we can successfully execute a contingency mission in the future.”

Another operational piece is logistics. In order to get DoD personnel and equipment to a contingency operation takes a lot of combined effort.

Lt. Col. Michelle Martinez, Army South G4 sustainment division chief, said the logistical requirements depend on the mission and what capabilities are already established at the location.

“A lot of what we need to logistically consider is based on where we are going and what type of logistical support is required, but we need to ensure all classes of supplies are provided, to include material handling equipment, air/ground transport, contract support, waste management, etc.” said Martinez. “We also work with engineers to get building material needed for building, establishing a secure perimeter, or other projects that may need to be executed during a natural disaster.”

Army South also coordinated with Army Support Activity (ASA) Soto Cano personnel to provide sustainment for the CCP staff.

“Our teams worked closely together to ensure access to facilities and support logistics,” said Col. Carl Hennemann, ASA Soto Cano garrison commander. “Events just like this help improve readiness and ensure, when requested, both teams are ready for a wide array of support to include disaster relief response.”

The teamwork involved in an operation of this nature reflects Army South’s enduring commitment to its partners and the importance of collective readiness when contingencies such as humanitarian crises, natural disasters and other destabilizing factors arise.

Army South is part of a multinational and whole-of-government team working to advance stability and security throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean in order to protect our shared values and way of life."

DAVENPORT, Iowa – As legendary poet laureate/pop artist Bob Dylan sang early in his career in the mid-sixties, “The Times They Are A-Changin’” and so agrees the U.S. Army Sustainment Command leadership regarding where its personnel may be going to work.

But what will the 21st century workplace look like at ASC, headquartered in Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois? Twenty-two years into this century, that question has not been definitively answered quite yet. But, with forward-thinking and knowing it can’t stay the same, ASC leaders are now exploring for possible answers.

Up until March 2020, the look and function of the workplace predominantly looked the same as the 20th century, except for newer high-tech equipment. That all changed, however, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the majority of workforce to telework.

Previously, only a few Civilians teleworked Army-wide. Telework was typically approved by management on a case-by-case basis, based on unique employee circumstances. What many thought would be a temporary change unfolded into Civilian and military personnel working from home full time. Only now, two years later, with COVID-19 deaths lessening, the workforce is being told it’s time to start coming back.

But, come back to what?

With that in mind, ASC personnel consisting of Matt Sannito, deputy to the commanding general, ASC; Col. Scott Kindberg, ASC chief of staff; Lee Hansen, ASC deputy chief of staff, G1 (Human Resource Management); and, Shannon Nielsen, general engineer, ASC, recently met with Rena Gainey, owner and creator of opportunities, of coworkqc, at her business office located in downtown Davenport, Iowa.

Gainey has nearly 30 years of experience as an executive coach and trainer in corporate leadership development with Deere & Company.

She is in the business of helping companies embrace the possibilities of how the 21st century can meet the needs of the current and future workforce in order to recruit and retain the best talent.

Coworkqc is a shared workspace and community center for entrepreneurs, freelancers, remote workers and startups. The motto of the business is “Work, Create, Collaborate.”

One thing is for sure, the ASC workforce will not continue to do business the way it did prior to the pandemic. A shared workspace in some form may be a good alternative to working full time inside the headquarter’s office space at the arsenal.

“We are a global business. Our personnel work in all corners of the world. Not a single Army Field Support Brigade is on Rock Island Arsenal,” Hansen pointed out. “In essence, this makes all of our AFSBs remote workers with Rock Island as their ‘home’ headquarters. Some will never set foot on Rock Island Arsenal, yet, they are able to accomplish the mission without being physically confined to Rock Island Arsenal.”

Hansen added that a distributed workforce is not a new concept. “We just need to take advantage of the opportunities the pandemic gave us and to move forward,” he said.

“The pandemic only accelerated the evolution by demonstrating, very rapidly, to a large number of supervisors, that teleworkers can sometimes be more productive than a worker confined to a legacy brick and mortar office,” Hansen explained. “The employees also realized a greater work/life balance can be achieved creating a win-win for both the employee and the headquarters. Even small quick tasks like being available to accept Amazon packages or walking [their] kids to/from the bus stop can go a long way in improving work/life balance.”

According to various internet sources, shared workspace or coworking is the situation in which several workers from different companies share an office space, allowing cost savings and convenience through the use of common infrastructure, such as equipment, utilities, receptionist and custodial services.

It is also similar to a flexible office space, which is a type of workspace designed to provide employees with a variety of different places and ways to work.

Unlike traditional offices with fixed and assigned desk positions, workers in a flexible office space can choose the area of the office that best suits the type of work they need to do at that moment.

Flexible workspaces can be easily rearranged to accommodate changing business objectives, or quickly scaled up and down to fit teams of different sizes. These kinds of dynamic office spaces are typically designed to be used in conjunction with flexible working arrangements to provide teams with the freedom to work where, when, and how they want, various internet sources stated.

There is also flexible working , which is a term used to describe any working pattern that falls outside of traditional office hours or locations. That can mean working in different spots around the same office, working from home, at a remote desk or working part-time or staggered hours.

Consequently, workers don’t have to stick to normal business hours or endure busy commutes. Instead they can manage their time and energy resulting in more creative work, as well as being happier and more productive than their office-bound colleagues, internet sources stated.

Flexible working gives the workforce the opportunity to work how they want and where they want, fostering a healthy work-life balance in the process. By choosing their own schedules, employees can work around obligations such as medical appointments and school drop-offs, while avoiding rush-hour traffic and packed buses and trains.

Kindberg said he wants ASC to be able to hire the best talent, which often is restricted because of the limited employee pool in the Quad Cities or hesitation to move to the area. For instance, Kindberg said he would like the ability to hire someone from New York City, but have them work remotely if that person desires and the mission supports it.

“We must evolve in our remote and telework posture in order to attract a greater depth of talent, and a diverse workforce moving forward,” Kindberg said.

“Overall as an organizational headquarters within the Army, we need to adapt and embrace our ability to mission command remotely, and this type of facility/environment is the way of the future,” he said.

“The global pandemic hastened employer’s willingness to embrace a distributed workforce and this two-year experiment proved to be a successful business model,” said Sannito, a member of the Senior Executive Service. “If we are going to continue to succeed in our missions and attract/retain the best workforce, we must embrace our changed business processes to match the new culture of the organization by offering a variety of working environments that ensures all employees thrive in the best setting for themselves.”

Hansen said he is aware that in order to compete with private businesses who have embraced more progressive work policies, ASC must adapt as well.

“ASC has already lost personnel to other units who have a more aggressive telework/remote work program. We will continue to lose personnel and will find it become increasingly difficult to hire replacement personnel if we are unwilling to fully support policies more in-line with other industries,” he said.

Nielsen, the general engineer, has a different perspective on changes to where and how the workforce may work.

“We have gotten creative in how we create relationships with our teams and our customers over the last two years. I see a collaboration working environment as a new tool for the workforce to use to continue to build on our skillsets,” Nielsen said.

“There is hard-fast criteria outlined in existing Army regulations on space allowances, as well as dynamic considerations -- like in union agreements -- that will need to be considered and incorporated into such a plan. When the time comes to create the product, it will be crucial to have a defined plan in order to meet the intent of the concept.”

Nielsen said from a space perspective, ASC must find what actions can be taken to be the most beneficial for employees to do their best work, what flexibilities can be offered, how to introduce these ideas to existing employees, and how those concepts can be incorporated into a plan that meets facility criteria codes/expectations.

As any ASC Civilian or Soldier knows, the parking lot is still pretty empty for the most part. But what does that mean regarding infrastructure of ASC’s headquarters?

“Workplace features, like chairs, furniture, and office equipment, are not currently being used to their maximum utility,” Nielsen pointed out. “By using shared spaces, like team rooms for groups coming to the office to collaborate on a hot project, we will foster those personal relationships in addition to saving money by occupying a smaller footprint.”

Nielsen added there are many base operation services that are currently underutilized, such as running the heat for an unoccupied floor or paying for janitorial services that are unnecessary in vacant areas.

“If we are to continue the trend of a hybrid work model by being in the office less than 40 hours per week, we can find financial savings in Army-provided utilities and lifecycle management,” she said.

Hansen explained that a shared workspace concept is no different than a college student occupying a study desk/space in the university library.

“The student would occupy a study table, study desk or meeting room based on their immediate needs. As their needs change throughout the day, so can their study/work location. The same thing can occur with our employees,” Hansen said.

While much discussion will be needed before anything takes root, Sannito said that change is inevitable.

“I am an absolute champion for a new framework that allows greater access to talent, lower costs, higher productivity and enhanced work-life balances by trusting our workforce to get the job accomplished,” Sannito said. “We can and need to be the leader regarding where work gets done.”

SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras — U.S. Army South Soldiers arrived here yesterday for a nine-day deployment exercise with more than 60 Soldiers to set up a contingency command post (CCP) in preparation for future forward operations in the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) area of responsibility.

A CCP is a rapidly deployable headquarters capable of providing Joint Task Force support designed to plan and conduct small-scale contingency operations.

“Our standard operating procedure is to go forward with wheels up within 96 hours of the initial deployment notification and be operational within 48 hours of landing in the country,” said Maj. Sean Buchanan, Army South CCP operations officer. “Once operational, we will work with the United States Agency for International Development and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance to provide situational awareness for the commander.”

This exercise was designed to rehearse the transportation of Army South equipment and personnel as well as test their capability to rapidly deploy the CCP in support of emergent SOUTHCOM requirements.

Buchanan said he is pleased with his team's performance so far.

“We have a lot of Soldiers who are new to Army South and the CCP, so there was some learning and discovery yesterday during the setup of the main tent,” said Buchanan. “But everything is going very well so far and we are ahead of schedule.”

Army South Soldiers will test and establish communications with Army South headquarters and SOUTHCOM.

Staff Sgt. Patricia Kimbrough, CCP communications and signal non-commissioned officer in charge, said her Soldiers remain prepared for CCP deployments.

“We train on setting up our terminals and testing our signals and communications once a month,” said Kimbrough. “So this exercise is an opportunity to validate our operations and troubleshooting.”

Kimbrough’s team can set up signal terminals and establish communications within two hours of landing in the country.

Preparation for a deployment of the CCP is an ongoing process. The CCP is a response team that reacts to several categories of contingencies, such as humanitarian missions and natural disasters.

1st Sgt. Richard Sosa, of the CCP mayor cell responsible for logistics and unit readiness, was able to get the unit administratively prepared to support the exercise. Sosa said previous exercises and rehearsals assisted in the successful execution of this exercise.

Over the last several months, Army South has conducted level 1 and 2 deployment readiness exercises (DRE) and a staff exercises (STAFFEX) to enhance and hone in on readiness and maneuverability of mission essential assets.

“We have to be ready and engaged at all times to respond to any contingency operations in our area of operation,” said Sosa. “The level 1 and 2 DREs helped us identify Soldier readiness, and previous STAFFEX helped us create a battle rhythm on how to approach the sustainment and logistics piece of this exercise,” said Sosa.

One of the Army South CCP’s most high profile deployments was in support of Operation Unified Response as part of Joint Task Force-Haiti following the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake that destroyed vast areas of the capital and left over two million people homeless on Jan. 12, 2010.

The efforts of Joint Task Force-Haiti contributed immensely to international relief efforts in the largest disaster response mission in modern U.S. military history, earning U.S. Army South the Joint Meritorious Unit award.

Army South and their assigned units consistently work to increase skills, abilities, and readiness to operate as a cohesive Army Service Component Command team in support of U.S. Southern Command."

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Zoe Marie Kimbell Tompkins smiles and laughs before knife-handing her Soldiers into formation during a change of responsibility rehearsal on JBSA Lackland Air Force Base, March 17, 2022.

Kimbell, the operations non-commissioned officer in charge at 470th Military Intelligence Brigade, is originally from China. She does not know exactly where she is from because her parents abandoned her due to China's one-child policy. She said she was lucky to survive.

“In Chinese culture, males are favored because they carry on the family name and they stay at home and take care of the parents, and the female usually gets married and lives with the husband's family,” said Kimbell.

Thankfully, the infant Kimbell was found and taken to an orphanage where she spent the first year of her life. She then moved into the foster care system before finally being adopted by an American family at 18 months old.

“I was a lucky kid growing up because not everybody had the familial support I had,” said Kimbell. “My parents put in a lot of effort just to have me, and there was never any point where I felt that I was not a part of a family.”

Even with the love and support of her parents, Kimbell still struggled with her own identity. She identified more with her parents' Italian and Czechoslovakian heritage than her Chinese ancestry.

“The biggest thing that I struggled with was my own identity because, by DNA, I am Chinese, but I don't identify with that culture,” she said. “I was the only Asian kid at my school until high school.”

Despite this internal conflict, Kimbell did well in school and had several options set before her at graduation. Her only challenge was choosing a direction to take her life.

“When I grew up, I was a theater nerd, but I just wanted to do it for fun because I didn’t think it would be a sustainable career,” said Kimbell. “I realized I could go to community college and get my general education out of the way, but I didn’t have a major that I really enjoyed. Then, someone jokingly brought up joining the military, and I realized that was not a bad idea.”

Kimbell counted her blessings as she reflected on her life and decided she wanted to give back to her adopted country in any way possible. During her senior year of high school, she enlisted in the U.S. Army as a signal intelligence analyst.

As she climbed the ranks, Kimbell developed as a leader and was inducted into the Sgt. Audie Murphy Club, or SAMC, on Aug. 13, 2021. The SAMC recognizes non-commissioned officers for exemplary performance and leadership. Soldiers are nominated by company leadership to compete, followed by boards, essays and written exams testing Army regulations and leadership decisions.

“The whole process of competing for the SAMC was a learning [experience],” said Kimbell. “The biggest lesson I learned was that it doesn’t matter what your rank is or how long you have been a Soldier; being a good leader is about knowing your Soldiers and doing everything you can to help them grow and succeed.”

One of the most impactful things about leadership Kimbell has learned is her own self-awareness.

“Before I joined the Army, no one told me you don't always have to be the one talking,” she said. “Early on in my Army career, I thought one of my mentors was a jerk because he would always tell me to stop talking, but at one point, he told me, ‘You've got to calm down. We hear you, but you need to bring your energy down to your audience.’”

Kimbell said she learned from that mentor that a leader needs to be able to hold up a mirror, not just from a social standpoint, but also a leadership standpoint and make an honest — sometimes brutal — self-assessment.

As Kimbell continues to excel in her Army career, she attributes her success to her family.

“I had a come-to-God moment, where I realized that I got a pretty solid deal in that I have an amazing family with all the love and support that I could imagine,” she said. “In a way, serving my country was my way of saying thank you to my parents and the country that gave me a second chance.”"

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District has delivered an additional secure home for part of the Israeli Air Force’s fleet of F-35 fighter jets, with a small ceremony marking the completion of another Hardened Hangar project on site earlier this year in March.

The United States has partnered with Israel for several years on its F-35 program through the Foreign Military Finance, or FMF, program where the two nations partner on construction of strategic facilities.

“This project is a key element of the US-Israeli partnership to deliver a unique set of hardened hangars and operations facilities to house a squadron of F-35’s for the Israeli Air Force,” said U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District Commander Col. Patrick Dagon.

The project was the result of close partnership and coordination from beginning to end, with the Israeli Ministry of Defense providing the designs as well as local quality assurance specialists to complement the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contract and project management efforts.

The ability to resist against a variety of threats is a key component of this project. The project team worked closely with a blast designer to account for site conditions and other concerns to ensure every component of the facility, including utilities, storage, life support and more are designed to highest, state-of-the-art standards for rugged survivability against any threat.

In addition to security, functionality is key with the site enabling for the rapid deployment F-35’s at a moment’s notice as well as interconnectivity with similar facilities the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also working on in the country.

Israeli Air Force technicians began installing a secure communications network concurrent to final construction efforts so the site could be occupied immediately and begin supporting missions right away.

“Every Israeli Ministry of Defense and Air Force leader who speaks about this project explains how this is not a theoretical and potential need - but rather an immediate and critical part of their duty to provide protection to the citizens of their country against the constant threat from enemies in the region,” said Contracting Officer’s Representative Ben Diamond with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Israel Area South Resident Office. “When they speak I feel a sense of genuine pride in the outcome and appreciation for our efforts to deliver this asset to their security and defense and I feel humbled to be able to make such an impact.”

The work is part of a larger partnership between Israel and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that has been in place for decades, beginning in 1979 after the Camp David Accords. That historic agreement called for the U.S. to support construction of new Israeli facilities to replace its Sinai airbases abandoned as part of the agreement and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led that construction effort.

Since then the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has partnered with Israel on billions of dollars in construction efforts both through the Foreign Military Finance program as well as in support of similar agreements like the Wye River Memorandum geared toward encouraging peace in the region.

“Europe District is proud to continue supporting our allies in Israel through this strategic partnership of building facilities supporting regional security goals,” Dagon said. “These projects enable Israel to improve their defense capabilities and work toward common security goals while cementing cooperative bilateral military relationships.”

This latest F-35 project completed in Israel is not the first such hardened hangar project the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has helped deliver in Israel in support of the F-35 program and it won’t be the last. Work is already underway for multiple additional similar facilities to be constructed in the coming years as well as facilities to ensure their connectivity going forward.

Diamond looks forward to continuing to support the program as long as his assignment in Israel continues.

“There’s nothing as loud and motivational as the constant roar of the F-35’s taking off to remind the team on the ground the purpose of our dedication to the success of this project.”"

WASHINGTON -- Thanksgiving is going to look a lot different for just about everyone this year thanks to the global pandemic. Unfortunately, that includes our service members stationed overseas.

Large group gatherings in dining facilities used to be the standard for our deployed men and women when it came to celebrating Thanksgiving. This year, that setup will likely look more like grab-and-go style takeout instead.

Months of Effort

It's no easy feat to get all that food prepared and shipped to service members across the globe.

DLA Troop Support started planning and preparing for this year's meal as early as March. A lot of the ingredients are at prime vendor locations by September, while the high-volume items, such as the turkeys and 131 tons of trimmings, start arriving overseas in October.

""The holidays will look quite different this year for everyone,"" said Army Brig. Gen. Gavin Lawrence, DLA's Troop Support commander. ""I'm proud that our workforce is doing everything possible to make sure our warfighters get a proper holiday meal, especially since many of us will not be able to be with our family and friends. We want to make sure they get that taste of home no matter where they are in the world.""

McCoy said most overseas locations received their supplies for the meals by mid-November.

DLA Troop Support supplies America's armed forces with $19 billion annually in food, uniforms, protective equipment and other vital items. A well-prepared Thanksgiving meal during a tough time of year is definitely something our troops can be thankful for!

WASHINGTON -- The Army plans to adjust how it promotes its noncommissioned officers that could impact Soldiers who are serving in combat, starting a family, or attending the non-resident Sergeants Major Course, said the Army’s top enlisted Soldier.

Starting Jan. 1, NCOs unable to complete the required professional military education, or PME, courses may qualify to be temporarily promoted from sergeant through sergeant major, said Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston during a media briefing Monday.

The temporary promotions aim to help an array of Soldiers who are either deployed, are pregnant or during postpartum, or attending the non-resident Sergeants Major Couse, Grinston said.

The promotions include both the pay and benefits expected from ranking up and will be in place until the rank is either permanent or expires, whichever comes first, he said.

The new policy will impact NCOs across the board, with changes starting in the January promotion cycle for all Army components.

Depending on the component, the fine print is different. For example, Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers must already be selected for or serving in the next higher-graded position vacancy to qualify.

All Soldiers, regardless of component, must also meet or exceed the cutoff score and sequence number for their respective ranks, according to a memo signed by Lt. Gen. Gary M. Brito, the Army’s G-1. In addition, they must be next in line on an approved order of merit list during fiscal year 2021.

Active-duty and full-time reservists will have no later than one year to complete their education upon redeployment. Traditional reservists will have 36 months from their redeployment date to complete their education.

The timeframe to complete PME is also extended for pregnancy and postpartum circumstances. Active-duty Soldiers and full-time reservists will have 24 months, and traditional reservists will have 36 months from the end date of their pregnancy-based profile.

“With this new temporary promotion [policy], we have the ability to have Soldiers starting a family being given the opportunity to be promoted with their peers and still get their professional military education after they complete their postpartum profile,” said Sgt. Maj. Mark Clark, the G-1 sergeant major.

Before the new policy, deployed Soldiers often had to request time-consuming exceptions to be considered for promotion without the required PME.

“This new policy doesn’t make [temporary promotions] an exception -- it makes it a standard,” Grinston said. “Those Soldiers, who are otherwise fully qualified, will be temporarily promoted with their peers. Everything will be streamlined.”

To understand the scope, around 300 deployment-related exceptions were approved in 2019, Clark said. But under the new policy, deployed Soldiers are no longer forced to deal with paper shuffling that may keep them from being promoted.

Those few hundred requests are based on a smaller operational tempo overseas. If the ops tempo grew back up to 100,000 or so deployed troops, Grinston said, “the requests for deployment-based promotions would be a lot higher.”

For pregnancy and postpartum circumstances, no such requests existed before.

In addition to deployments and pregnancy-related profiles, the policy also benefits senior NCOs enrolled in the non-resident Sergeants Major Academy, Grinston said. “So now non-resident master sergeants won’t have to wait to be promoted with their peers.”

Under the new policy, temporary promotions for senior NCOs will be based on non-resident course enrollment through graduation, following graduation of the resident course, to ensure they are eligible for promotion alongside their peers.

This will allow non-resident master sergeants to complete their course, while remaining eligible for promotion.

If a Soldier promoted with a temporary promotion is unable to attain their PME, like the Basic Leader Course, by the specified date indicated on their promotion order by either not attending or failing altogether, then they will be reduced to their former grade, he said.

If a Soldier is reduced to their previous grade, it doesn’t mean they will owe all the pay netted during their temporary promotion, Clark said. Their former rank will be restored with their original date of rank and effective date.

The updated policy is consistent with previously established changes for deployed Soldiers in the sergeant first class and master sergeant ranks, who, like with the latest changes, can be promoted if fully qualified on a fiscal 2021 order of merit list but lack the required PME.

Although the change comes amid an increasing number of new recruits, the SMA said, the change is less about keeping pace with a growing Army and more in-line with its top priority of placing people first.

At the end of the day, Grinston said, the temporary promotions are another way to “have the policies in place to allow our people to progress” through the ranks.

WASHINGTON -- Lily Palfrey knows her father's job is to look after his Soldiers, and she wanted to help him do just that.

Her father, Army 1st Sgt. Frank Palfrey, is the senior enlisted advisor for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade.

A year before her father deployed, Lily began planning to send care packages to each of the Soldiers in her father's company as part of a 4-H project (4-H is a youth development organization.)

Starting in September 2019, Lily collected donations, raised funds for shipping, held packing events, created 154 packages (24 more than her original goal), completed customs forms and created shipping labels with each Soldier's name on it.

Frank Palfrey who is the senior enlisted advisor for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, organized 154 care packages to be sent to her father's deployed unit.

She had to work with various people and organizations to get enough to send to all the Soldiers. When she found out some items couldn't be shipped, she donated them to veteran homeless shelters in her local area.

When the COVID-19 pandemic arose, Lily was forced to create a COVID-19 mitigation plan. This plan included a virtual presentation, which included videos from other military kids talking about what it was like to have a parent deployed.

Soldiers received the packages at their various locations in the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade's area of operations in the Middle East in October.

HHC mailroom clerks were awarded challenge coins for their efforts sorting and distributing all the packages to Headquarters and Headquarters Company Soldiers.

WASHINGTON -- The Army Talent Management Task Force will conduct a prototype of the Sergeants Major Assessment Program (SMAP) from November 14 – 18, 2020 at Fort Knox, Ky.

In conjunction with the Battalion Commander Assessment Program (BCAP) for Fiscal Year 2022, 32 sergeants major will participate in the prototype program.

The participants are under consideration in the Command Sergeant Major/Sergeant Major Evaluation Board for selection to battalion command sergeant major positions. The prototype program is voluntary and the results are non-binding.

BCAP FY21, which debuted earlier this year, assessed 750 officers who were competing for battalion command and key billets. The program incorporated a series of assessments, peer and subordinate feedback, an interview with an operational psychologist, and a double-blind panel interview. The results of BCAP helped the Army determine which officers demonstrated readiness for battalion command.

The sergeant major participants will take a series of assessments in line with the officer experience during the Command Assessment Program. This includes the collection of self, peer, and subordinate feedback, an APFT, cognitive and non-cognitive assessments, and an interview with an operational psychologist. The prototype will culminate in a double-blind interview between sergeants major participants and a panel consisting of nominative command sergeants major and senior commissioned officers.

BCAP FY22, is set to select officers for battalion command and key lieutenant colonel billets in fiscal year 2022. This is the second BCAP and comes two months after the Army’s first Colonels Command Assessment Program which selected officers who will command brigades and fill key general staff positions.

By the end of BCAP FY22, more than 1,800 majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels will have gone through one of the three command assessment programs. This year, BCAP will include officers from the Army Acquisition Corps. The Air Force and the Navy will also send officers to the program to help determine the suitability of a command assessment program for their respective services.

The Army Talent Management Task Force held the first Battalion Commander Assessment Program at Fort Knox in January 2020. The principals identified through the BCAP represent officers who possess higher potential for continued service and are more physically fit, better communicators and less toxic. A board of senior officers, brigadier generals and colonels, determined whether each officer was ready for command or not yet ready. During the first BCAP, 90 officers were determined not yet ready for command and 660 officers were slated as principals and alternates.

An officer’s selection as a principal or alternate for battalion command is based on the Centralized Selection List board ranking and their performance at the BCAP. When compared to the legacy Centralized Select List process, the BCAP resulted in a 34 percent change in officers chosen for command and key billets. Out of the 436 officers chosen for command and key billets, 26 legacy principals declined to participate in BCAP, 25 legacy principals were found not ready for command, and 99 legacy alternates moved up to become principals.

In September 2020, the Army conducted the first Colonels Command Assessment Program (CCAP) to determine readiness for command and strategic potential among officers eligible for O-6 level command and general staff positions. Results from the CCAP are forthcoming.

Since the Army began adopting transformational changes to the management of the Officers Corps, there has been a demand to apply lessons learned to new talent management programs for the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps. Other talent management initiatives in the preliminary stages of development for NCOs include the Army Talent Alignment Process and the First Sergeant Talent Alignment Assessment.

Dominate the information environment with weaponized truth

FORT HOOD, Texas -- In an overview into the contested information environment in Iraq and Syria, Col. Myles B. Caggins III will lead a Warrior’s Corner discussion with questions and answers at this year’s virtual Association of the United States Army 2020 Annual Meeting and Exposition Oct. 15, 1:15 p.m.

Caggins, who just returned to Texas from serving as the spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve, will discuss the information challenges faced by the 77-nation Coalition fighting to destroy ISIS, from not just terrorist organizations and state sponsors of terror, but major powers and occasionally, allies.

“It’s about relentless engagement,” said Caggins. “Dominate the information environment with weaponized truth. I want our adversaries to react to what we are doing.”

Caggins will also discuss some of the techniques developed by CJTF-OIR to cut through language and technological barriers and combat active enemy influence and disinformation operations.

To connect with audiences, the U.S.-led Coalition worked with security partner spokespersons in Iraq and Syria and often conducted press conferences and engagements in Northeastern Syria, Suleimani, Erbil, Kirkuk, Al Asad, and many other locations, working with Arabic, Kurdish, and Western media.

“The core audience was those who were affected by ISIS, and those threatened by ISIS or security forces fighting ISIS,” said Caggins. “We tried to inform and inspire, without offending anyone.”

The discussion includes critical questions for military leaders on the culture of communication, training, resourcing, and competing to win in the public information environment.

Maj. Gabriela S. Thompson, past Coalition media outreach officer, will participate in the discussion.

Those interested in participating in the discussion need to register with AUSA.

WASHINGTON -- Based on the current conditions in Afghanistan, the Defense Department expects there will be fewer than 5,000 U.S. military service members in that country by the end of November, said David F. Helvey, who is currently performing the duties of assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs.

""We've long maintained that our force presence in Afghanistan is conditions-based,"" said Helvey during testimony today before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, national security subcommittee. ""This August, the president [decided] that the conditions of Afghanistan were sufficient to reduce our force presence to between 4,000 and 5,000 by the end of November 2020.""

At that force level, Helvey said, the U.S. maintains an ability to conduct the core aspects of its existing missions in Afghanistan. One of those missions is to participate in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission, which is focused on training, advising and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. The U.S. also conducts a counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan that works with partners to mitigate terrorist threats there.

Right now, there are no orders to reduce the force presence any further, Helvey said, though there is planning to draw down to zero troops in Afghanistan by May 2021. But those plans can't be implemented unless the conditions of an agreement with the Taliban are met, he said.

""As [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo] said in Doha, the Taliban must uphold their counterterrorism guarantees to the United States,"" Helvey said. ""We also expect the Taliban to meaningfully participate in Afghan peace negotiations, and to do their part in preventing outside actors from negatively impacting the peace process.""

In late February of this year, the U.S. and the Taliban signed an agreement that includes, eventually, the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Since the signing of that agreement, the U.S. has reduced forces to 8,600. Part of that agreement also requires the Taliban to agree to no longer allow its members, or other groups, to use Afghanistan as a location from which to threaten the security of the United States or its allies.

Since the signing of that agreement on February 29, Helvey said, no U.S. military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan.

""Ultimately, what we want to be able to see in Afghanistan, is an enduring peace,"" Helvey said. ""In that type of environment ... the terrorist organizations, terrorist groups, will not be able to operate, will not be able to plan, will not be present. That's the focus, and we're looking to get the Taliban to adhere to its commitments.""

WASHINGTON -- Americans regard the National Guard as a United States-based force, but, in truth, it's hard to go anywhere in the world and not see a soldier wearing an Army National Guard patch.

Over the past few months, there were 77,000 Army Guardsmen and over 100,000 National Guardsmen on duty, Army Lt. Gen. Jon A. Jensen, director of the Army National Guard, said during an interview.

There are 335,000 Army National Guard soldiers in the 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia. Today, there are more than 22,000 Army National Guardsmen deployed as part of the warfighting mission for the joint force. This has been consistent since the early 2000s, the general said. ""As you look into the future, you know, we're going to continue to do that as the combat reserve of the Army and as an operational reserve,"" he said. ""But we'll also simultaneously always be that response back home, as well.""

The National Guard has personnel deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, Djibouti, Europe, the Pacific, Guantanamo and many other countries. State guardsmen also maintain contacts with many foreign militaries under the State Partnership Program.

But over the past months of this year, the National Guard has been ubiquitous: helping medical authorities combat COVID-19; working with civilian authorities to fight fires throughout the West; helping communities hit by weather events; and helping calm areas wracked by violence.

Early on, the guard was used to help civil authorities against COVID-19. ""We've still got over 18,500 Guardsmen in support of COVID-19 response with more than 15,000 of them from the Army Guard,"" Jensen said. ""I think we'll continue to do that mission, obviously, until the pandemic's over.""

To date, guardsmen have administered more than 8 million COVID-19 tests. They're also helping in long-term care facilities.

""Our logistics effort has been amazing, as well, with over 350 million meals that have been delivered and 12,000 tons of bulk food,"" he said.

When the virus first hit, there were concerns about medical facility space. Guardsmen worked with the Army Corps of Engineers to create alternate care facilities in major cities. ""Ultimately, we built a 15,000-bed capability that didn't exist prior to the pandemic,"" Jensen said.

The Guard has also been involved in contact tracing. That is, identifying those positive for COVID-19, then contacting those who had been in close proximity of the person with the positive case.

These missions will continue, and the guard will probably be called upon to help once a vaccine is developed and deemed safe. Jensen was clear that the guard has not been asked to do anything yet, but prudent planning requires consideration. The guard, with its all-terrain vehicles and helicopter assets, could help transport the vaccine to hard-to-reach places. Guard personnel could also help with the actual administration of the vaccine, if called upon.

""We all know that the key to this thing is going to be getting a vaccine and then getting the vaccine out to the population,"" the general said. ""We will be ready to do whatever is asked.""

And the guard is doing all sorts of other missions to support fellow citizens. The Army National Guard is actively engaged in fighting 76 wildfires in the West. This year is on track to be the worst fire season since 2003, officials said. In California alone, more than 900 National Guard personnel are helping state authorities and firefighting crews. Guard aviators rescued 159 civilians and are battling 23 fires that have burned nearly 2 million acres.

Guardsmen are also helping in Colorado, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Idaho and Utah. They are working on 53 fires that have charred over 830,000 acres.

The year is tough. In fiscal 2018, guardsmen helped with wildland fire suppression operations for 26 fires. Last year, it was for 12 fires.

The hurricane season is also at its height. There are still more than 3,000 soldiers in Louisiana and Texas helping the states recover from Hurricane Laura. Now, Hurricane Sally is threatening the Gulf Coast.

The guard also has about 2,000 soldiers supporting the Southwest border mission. ""And that mission will grow,"" Jensen said.

The National Guard was also called upon to help in the disturbances following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Jensen — who was the adjutant general of Minnesota before taking his current job — said he also noticed the calming effect of the guardsmen. ""I think the National Guard has gained a tremendous amount of public trust and confidence due to our overseas deployments,"" he said.

He also noted that guardsmen have been prominent in the COVID-19 response and other high-profile civil support missions dating to Hurricane Katrina. ""Whether it's hurricanes or wildfires or ice storms or COVID-19, I think there is just a great amount of awareness and appreciation for what the guard has been doing since 9-11, and what the guard has continued to do,"" Jensen said.

The final piece of that puzzle is the guard as part of the communities they serve. ""We're in over 2,600 communities across the country,"" he said. ""In Minnesota … our little motto [is] 'We live here. We work here. We serve here.' There's just a very strong community connection to the National Guard, and that when we come, we arrive in a non-threatening way. And I think I think that has been appreciated. And I think people have responded to that.""

WASHINGTON -- The June 3 revision of Army Regulation 600-8-10, which covers leaves and passes, is part of the largest update to Army military leave policy in more than a decade, said Larry Lock, chief of Compensation and Entitlements for the Army’s G-1 office.

“The new regulation encompasses recent changes in leave and passes, rearranges the sections to make it more user friendly, clarifies policy, and covers the new leave forms,” he said. “It also aligns the terminology more closely with” Defense Department Instruction 1327.06, or Leave and Liberty Policy and Procedures.

The result is a regulation that is more comprehensive and will reduce confusion, especially for Soldiers working in joint environments, he said.

The DOD Instruction covers leave and liberty procedures and sets a blueprint so the Army can be uniform with the other military services. Based on input from Soldiers, the Army took the opportunity to improve the Department of Army Form 31, or Request and Authority for Leave, and the DA Form 4179, or Leave Log.

“We’re an all-volunteer force since 1973, and to sustain our force we want to take care of our people,” Lock said. “One way to do that is to streamline the process for requesting leave, and enhance morale by encouraging Soldiers to take time off.”

Updated leave forms

Last updated in 1993, the time to update the leave form had come, he said, especially with so many changes to the regulation.

“To be a more usable form given changes in the types of leave, the Army updated the DA Form 31 to make sure commanders and Soldiers clearly understand what type of leave was chargeable and what type was non-chargeable,” Lock said. “Soldiers, Army leaders and commanders need to keep track of leave, for personnel reasons and for audit purposes.”

In other words, depending on the types of absence Soldiers request, they can now more clearly distinguish it as chargeable or non-chargeable on the leave form. Soldier feedback resulted in larger Leave Address, Remarks and Organizational Address fields. While it is not required by regulation, Soldiers can now enter three or more addresses where they expect to stay while on leave.

“We now have an improved process, and that has improved the DA Form 31,” Lock said.

The DA Form 4179, Leave Log, was also updated to help personnelists track the absences requested, approved or disapproved for Soldiers in their organizations.

Both the new DA Form 31 and the new DA Form 4179 are available on the Army Publishing Division website. All Soldiers are encouraged to always download the latest versions of the forms as improvements will continue to be made.

Parental leave

While new parents have been able to take advantage of the military parental leave policy, or MPLP, since last year. The revised AR 600-8-10 includes the MPLP, and further explains the policy. The leave policy associated with childbirth can be somewhat confusing, and the revised regulation helps Soldiers navigate through the different leaves, Lock said.

There are three different types of leave associated with the birth of a child: maternity convalescent leave, primary caregiver leave, and secondary caregiver leave.

New birthparents are authorized 42 days of maternity convalescent leave upon release from the hospital or birthing center. As this is convalescent leave, it is non-chargeable.

The primary caregiver, as designated by the Soldier, is authorized 42 days of non-chargeable primary caregiver leave that must be taken within 12 months of qualifying birth events, but it does not all have to be taken in a continuous block.

The secondary caregiver is authorized 21 days of non-chargeable secondary caregiver leave, which also needs to be used within 12 months of the qualifying birth and is not required to be taken in a continuous block. The regulation has full details and covers exceptions to the normal leaves.

Much of the MPLP was already in place and has not changed since last year’s policy, Lock said.

The Army is striving to help troops better understand their benefits, especially the young Soldiers who make up the majority of new Army parents, he added.

Previously, a parental leave of only 10 non-chargeable days was available for non-birthparents, and had to be used within 45 days after the birth. Now, secondary caregivers leave is a very significant leave change in support of family quality of life.

Other leave issues

Soldiers may request a non-chargeable absence to assist at major events for Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and similar groups. This was previously authorized by AR 600-8-10, but it now falls under an umbrella category that supports participants in competitive sporting and other events.

“The military is pretty arduous duty. Soldiers earn 30 days of paid leave per year, beginning with their first year on the job. No other American industry out there comes close to that,” Lock said. He suggests that all Soldiers should often check their leave balance.

“Every month Soldiers have the personal responsibility to verify the accuracy of their leave and earnings statements, which shows their balance, the amount of leave they used during the current fiscal year, and the number of leave days they will lose if they don't take it before the end of the fiscal year,” he said.

For eligible Soldiers, the Remarks section, beginning on Oct. 31 will state the maximum leave they can carry over at the end of the fiscal year, and when the ability to carry more than 60 days will expire. This should be checked every month, because leave usage affects the carry-over amount. Soldiers should not rely on Special Leave Accrual, which is restricted to a very limited number of cases and review at the Department of the Army level.

One of the biggest leave problems, Lock said, is getting Soldiers to take their leave.

“Soldiers are very dedicated to their jobs, to the point that they are reluctant to take leave,” he said. “It is good to know that they are really dedicated, but they also need to make their own well-being and their Families a priority. This will contribute to improved performance and increased motivation when back at work.

“At the end of the day, it’s up to Soldiers to track their leave,” he added. “It is a commander’s role to grant time off, when possible, but it is still the responsibility of every Soldier to manage their own leave.”

Commanders are responsible for having an effective annual leave program that provides Soldiers with the opportunity to take leave, to include an extended leave, during the year, operational requirements permitting.

AL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar (AFNS) --In a joint endeavor to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces and the people of Lebanon after a deadly explosion in Beirut, U.S. Airmen and Soldiers stationed in Qatar worked to load the first U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III with humanitarian aid, Aug. 6.

Personnel from the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, Air Mobility Command’s 8th Expeditionary Air Mobility Squadron and 816th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron on Al Udeid Air Base, and the Area Support Group-Qatar from Camp As Sayliyah worked to palletize food, water and medical supplies delivered to Beirut later that day.

“Support of this magnitude at such speed wouldn’t be possible without the joint effort of all members of Al Udeid Air Base, our U.S. Army counterparts at Camp As Sayliyah and our gracious Qatari partners,” said Brig. Gen. Daniel Tulley, 379th Air Expeditionary Wing commander. “In the wake of tragedy, it truly takes a combined effort to make the mission happen. We do this every day in Qatar, and that’s exactly what we are doing in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces.”

Soldiers from the ASG-Qatar at Camp As Sayliyah packed and loaded 11 pallets of humanitarian aid, which contained more than 28,800 military field rations, known as MRE or meals ready to eat, 11,520 bottles of water and two pallets of medical supplies and transported them to Al Udeid Air Base with support of a local Qatari transport company.

“In short notice, ASG-Qatar assembled Soldiers and limited contract support to quickly palletize 11 pallets to be flight-worthy; consisting of water, MREs and medical supplies,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Pura, ASG-Qatar director of logistics. “(I’m) truly grateful to the Soldiers and civilians who stepped up to support the mission. I appreciate our Air Force personnel support from AUAB, it’s nice to see a combined effort from all.”

Upon their arrival to Al Udeid, the pallets were received by Airmen from the 8th EAMS, and processed for loading onto a C-17 bound for Beirut.

“At a moment’s notice, our mobility Airmen and the global air mobility support system stand ready to take action in tough situations like the explosion in Beirut,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Nicholas Lee, 8th EAMS commander. “The 8th EAMS is proud to be able to answer the call to support the Lebanese Armed Forces and help those in need of supplies with rapid global mobility.”

(Photo Credit: Courtesy Photo, Defense Commissary Agency) VIEW ORIGINAL

FORT LEE, Va. – Commissaries worldwide are now selling reusable and disposable protective masks, the Defense Commissary Agency’s director of sales announced.

Two brands of masks, one reusable and the other disposable, became available to most stores worldwide in late June, said Tracie Russ, the agency’s director of sales. Commissaries in Hawaii are selling a reusable mask from a local supplier.

“The safety of our customers and employees is a top priority for the commissaries,” Russ said. “Providing these masks for purchase is one of many protective measures we’re taking to help reduce exposure to COVID-19.”

The following brands and types of masks are available for purchase in commissaries:

Hanes: 10-pack, reusable, adult size, 3-ply 100-percent cotton, washable up to 20 times

Midwesttrading: KN95 1-pack disposable mask and a 10-pack, 4-ply mask, fit adjustable, inner layer contains air filter

Puna Noni: (available only in Hawaii commissaries), reusable, 3-ply cotton/poly shell, removable felt filter

“Commissaries are selling masks to meet our customers’ needs, especially during this pandemic,” said LaRue Smith, a category manager. “We don’t want our customers taking an extra shopping trip for something they can get in their commissary and at a lower price.

“There is an expectation that the supplies will be plentiful in the future,” Smith said, “but at this time we ask our customers to limit their purchase to only what they will need so that the supply will be available for all of our customers.”

Since April 6, commissaries have required some form of face covering for their store employees, to comply with the April 5 Department of Defense directive mandating that standard for anyone entering military facilities.

By April 10, commissaries expanded the face covering requirement to include customers or anyone else entering a commissary. The DeCA guidance does not supersede the existing installation policies. It applies to all agency stores and other facilities worldwide where no local directive has yet been issued.

Since the start of the outbreak, most retail stores experienced a run on anything resembling personal protective equipment. In those days, the closest that agency stores had for PPE were disposable gloves.

Through May, glove sales increased by nearly 32 percent. In addition to sales of masks, commissaries have also increased its volume of disposable gloves and hand sanitizers.

Army Lt. Col. Angela Parham, DeCA’s director of health and safety, reminds customers that wearing PPE is only one part of the preventive measures required to help combat COVID-19.

“DOD’s face covering mandate aligns with CDC guidance to help prevent asymptomatic people, who may not know they’re infected, from spreading the virus to others,” Parham said. “Even when you wear a mask or other face covering, it is still important to practice good hand hygiene, social distancing and refrain from touching your face.”

Commissary customers should continue to refer to the federal government’s response to coronavirus, COVID-19 website and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Coronavirus site for updates and guidance regarding this virus. Updates related to the commissaries can be found on DeCA’s Coronavirus page.

Not rain, snow, sleet, extreme heat or even COVID-19 can stop the mail.

""There are 58 mailrooms here on [Camp] Arifjan alone,"" Army Staff Sgt. Robert Harris, the mail operations noncommissioned officer in charge for Task Force Spartan, said. ""We alone are responsible for 1,300 people.""

Harris and his team start their day at 8 a.m. and play a critical role in getting the mail to service members and civilians who serve Task Force Spartan, among other organizations.

""We start our day picking up the mail from the main mailroom,"" Harris said. ""The main mailroom sorts things out by the smaller mailrooms we have on post. Then we come and pick it up to sort it out by person.""

""When we arrive to pick up the mail, we never know how much there will be — could be just a few packages or over 200 packages,"" he continued. ""There was a short time when COVID really started shutting things down, and we didn't see much coming in, but that was a very short time.""

COVID-19 has affected the world and changed the way many businesses operate, so it comes as no surprise that it would affect mail delivery also.

""COVID only slowed down mail for a short time, maybe a week or so,"" Harris said. ""Getting mail to service members and contractors is of the utmost importance, especially during these times when people look forward to packages from home or something they've ordered like a book to help pass downtime.""

Receiving mail can help boost morale not only for service members and civilians overseas, but also for friends and family members who get mail from loved ones abroad.

""Sorting the amount of mail we receive sometimes can become overwhelming,"" Harris said. ""We have had to shut down the mailroom twice since being here. We never want to make that call, but when we get over five or six bins full of mail, it can be very difficult to get it sorted in time for pickup that day.""

There can be many reasons for mail to be delayed, especially due to the restrictions during a worldwide pandemic.

""Mail may be delayed sometimes, but my team and I make sure that when we get things in, we process it and update the roster as quickly as possible,"" Harris said. ""With so many things closed down because of COVID-19, mail is one of the few morale-boosting things left.""

Harris and his team work hard every day to make sure service members and civilians get their mail.

""At the end of the day, we are here to make sure people are getting their mail with as little delay as possible,"" Harris said. ""For some getting a letter or package from home can turn a bad day or week around.""

The soldiers of Task Force Spartan are being led by the New York Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division. The mission is a unique, multi-component organization, made up of active Army and National Guard units, rounded out by Army Reserve support units.

Through Operation Spartan Shield, Task Force Spartan maintains a U.S. military posture in Southwest Asia sufficient to strengthen defense relationships and build partner capacity.

WASHINGTON -- More than 200 enlisted Soldiers serving throughout the Middle East and Africa were slated to travel to Kuwait for the Army's Basic Leader Course in March. Then the military banned nonessential travel in response to the increasing threat of COVID-19.

""I found out I wasn't going to BLC the day I was leaving,"" said Army Sgt. Robert M. Raitano, the noncommissioned officer in charge of intelligence with the 207th Regional Support Group. ""My bags were packed.""

The three-week course is crucial for young Soldiers. It is the first official step in learning how to be a noncommissioned officer, and the class is required before they can be promoted to sergeant. Even if personnel can get a waiver while on deployment, they still are required to attend the school when they return to the United States.

Some Soldiers had waited for years for the opportunity to take the course. Army Sgt. Aquenda R. Roundtree, the operations noncommissioned officer in charge with the 248th Area Support Medical Company, said she had been trying to go to the school since 2017, but her transfers among various Georgia National Guard units derailed those efforts. The latest cancellation promised another long delay.

""I was, like, 'Wow – again?'"" she said, ""because they kept pushing it back.""

In April, the NCO Leadership Center of Excellence delivered a solution: an online version of the class supplemented by instructors stationed at each base. Despite the course being primarily online, the students were still required to lead physical fitness training while maintaining social distancing requirements.

The students' units provided the assistant instructors. At Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, the 207th Regional Support Group and the 248th Area Support Medical Company combined efforts to create a class for five students. Army Staff Sgt. Heather Bojarski, a small group leader with the U.S. Central Command NCO Academy at Camp Buehring, said other participants were spread throughout more than a half-dozen countries – all reporting back to the school in Kuwait.

The assistant instructors at Al Asad attempted to recreate a school environment as much as possible. They reserved a meeting room and had internet connections installed so the students could train together. The NCOs scheduled physical training sessions in the morning prior to classes and had the students march to meals together to practice drill and ceremonies.

""I was thinking we'd just be sitting there online all the time,"" Roundtree said. ""I didn't expect everything that happened.""

During class hours, students regularly responded to questions and reacted to each other's discussion points using their laptops. Outside of class, they had to prepare written papers and a public speaking presentation. Roundtree, who was the first student to serve as class leader, helped ingrain the standards and common procedures their group followed throughout.

""We always tried to stay ahead of the game,"" she said. ""Everyone was held accountable so nobody fell behind.""

Raitano, who said he originally joined the military five years ago with no specific goals in mind, said the class helped him clarify his understanding of leadership, followership and what kind of person he wants to be. He zeroed in on servant leadership, particularly after helping classmates with the required school tasks.

""It took constant hours of practice and preparation,"" he said. ""Being able to see results from that was very inspiring.""

Teamwork became essential as the students aided each other in their studies and practices for the practical exams. Students gathered after class hours to work on drills.

""We never really had a moment where we feuded or didn't agree with each other,"" Raitano said. ""We came together fairly well.""

Both Raitano and Roundtree, similar to others in their class, received their promotion to sergeant shortly after graduating.

""There were a lot of things I didn't know,"" Raitano said of the lessons he learned from the classes. ""There are things I will pick up and use in my day-to-day life.""

From her office in Kuwait, Bojarski said the remote class program has continued to be successful. According to the school, out of 201 students in the first class, 193 graduated in May. The second class started in June.

""I liked the challenge,"" she said of the emergency BLC. ""I liked that it tapped our resiliency….and it pushed me to think outside the box.""

The unique situation has led to the innovative use of technology in some cases. When one of the students was having trouble passing their physical resilience training drills, the assistant instructor used a video call to contact Bojarski and let her watch for issues.

""I could actually see what the sergeant was doing,"" she said.

Likewise, in subsequent BLC classes the school increased its use of the online Defense Collaboration System, which has increased the small-group leaders' ability to communicate with remote students every day.

""It made me more accessible to them,"" she said, noting it allowed them to problem solve together. ""That's what we're here for.""

ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. – For many Soldiers and their Families, spring and summer bring not just warmer weather, but new orders and permanent change of station moves. Although COVID-19 concerns have temporarily halted many but the most essential military moves, now is a good time to think about how to keep your current or future residence healthy and minimize housing hazard risks like lead or mold exposure.

“Residents should frequently inspect their homes and report or repair small issues and minor damages before they become major issues and large repairs,” said Vickie Hawkins, an industrial hygienist and chief of the Army Pubic Health Center Industrial Hygiene Field Services Division.

Hawkins and her APHC team provide installation housing managers with support in conducting inspections of Army Family housing, and remotely provide industrial hygiene consultation, report review, sampling interpretation, guidance and support for mold, lead, asbestos, and radon concerns.

Hawkins said the greatest risk for lead hazards in the home are lead paint in pre-1978 housing or if the parent has a hobby or job that involves lead.

Installations and Residential Communities Initiative property landlords must inform all new tenants of Army Family housing what is known about lead-based paint and lead hazards in their units. Installations must also provide residents with the EPA pamphlet Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home.

“In general, lead present in intact paint is not a hazard,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins recommends immediately reporting any paint damage or deterioration for repair. Paint on impact surfaces (windows, window sills, doors) and hand rails have the greatest potential to chip, flake, or create dust.

“Frequently wipe down these surfaces with a wet cloth and clean floors to reduce the potential of exposure to lead in the paint,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins explains paint can also be found on the exterior of the house and in soil around the home.

""Remove shoes or wipe soil off shoes before entering your house if you have concerns over lead in the outside,"" said Hawkins.

If a parent works or is involved in a hobby where they are exposed to lead, change out clothes and shoes before coming into the home, said Hawkins.

“Children are especially susceptible to lead exposure,” said Hawkins. “Talk to your medical provider about blood lead level testing if you have any concerns.”

Residents concerned about mold should focus on controlling moisture, which is the key factor in reducing mold exposure risks, said Hawkins.

“Frequently check your home for signs of leaks and water damage especially around plumbing, doorways, windows, and ceilings,” said Hawkins. “Also inspect your roof for damage. It is important to find the source of any leak or water damage and to make repairs immediately.”

If wet or damp materials are dried within 24-48 hours after a leak or spill happens, mold will not grow in most cases, said Hawkins. Regularly clear exterior drains and gutters on the home to prevent blockages that could cause water to enter the home. Ensure the drain spouts are extended 4 feet away from the house and the ground cover is graded/sloped so that water runs away from the house foundation. Keep air conditioning drip pans clean. When showering, run the bathroom fan or open a window. Use exhaust fans or vent appliances that produce moisture (stoves, dishwashers, clothes dryers, etc.).

For regional areas that may have more humidity or moisture in the air, Hawkins recommends using air conditioners and de-humidifiers when needed.

“It may be tempting to turn off your air conditioning while you are out of the house or on vacation, but in warm humid climates the air conditioning helps keep the humidity down inside your home, which reduces the risk of mold growth,” said Hawkins. “Address any visible mold growth promptly and speak with your medical provider if you are concerned that something in your home is making you sick or otherwise impacting your or your child’s health.”

Hawkins also has a few general recommendations, some of which come from her experience inspecting Army Family housing.

“During inspections, many homes were observed with the clothes dryer vent blocked with debris at the back of the dryer inside the home and at the outside exhaust pipe opening,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins recommends keeping the dryer exhaust free from any debris, including the pest-proofing screens covering these openings. Failure to keep these free from any lint or debris is a potential fire hazard and an efficiency destroyer. Residents should report any conditions related to clogged dryer vents to their housing management office.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recommends housing residents cover electric sockets, childproof cabinets and drawers, and put up gates or close doors where fall hazards are present. Store household chemicals and poisons out of reach of children and away from food, and frequently wipe down and clean children’s toys. Ensuring smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are properly installed is also important.

The APHC has webpages with resources and tips for homeowners in dealing with mold and lead in the home:

The APHC has also created the Housing Environmental Health Response Registry for residents who have any concerns about Army Family housing or related health concerns. They can contact the registry telephone number (1-800-984-8523; overseas DSN: (312) 421-3700) for more information on housing environmental health hazards, assistance seeking medical care for housing-related illnesses and concerns, and to have the U.S. Army Medical Command share their concerns with Army leadership. Contact care representatives are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. More information on the registry can be found at the Housing Environmental Health Response Registry site.

The Army Public Health Center enhances Army readiness by identifying and assessing current and emerging health threats, developing and communicating public health solutions, and assuring the quality and effectiveness of the Army’s Public Health Enterprise.

WASHINGTON -- Soldiers now have an added incentive to choose the personally-procured move, or PPM option, when moving to their next duty stations this summer.

Aside from limiting exposure to COVID-19, a revision to the Defense Department’s Joint Travel Regulations has increased the monetary payment to Soldiers who choose to move their household goods.

From May 26 through Dec. 31, Soldiers using the PPM program can receive a payment equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost the government would pay to move their items. When Soldiers choose the option, they shoulder the cost and responsibility of packing and moving their belongings themselves and the payment compensates them for those expenses.

The PPM program gives Soldiers an alternative to a traditional permanent-change-of-station move, where a government-contracted moving company ships their household goods to their new duty station.

With more Soldiers expected to make PCS moves during the latter part of the peak moving season, an updated policy couldn’t have come at a more opportune time, said Larry Lock, Army compensation and entitlements chief G-1.

While much of the country remains under COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, making a PPM might be the more practical option for some Soldiers and their families, he said. Safety restrictions vary by state and commercial movers will be heavily tasked, he added.

The change could help increase the number of PCS moves in what the Army’s G-4 predicts will be a busier moving season. Moving more Soldiers to their new duty stations helps the Army maintain readiness and meet its global force requirements, said Derrick Candler, chief of Transportation Policy Division, G-4.

“Industry may face challenges to support this huge increase during the summer season,” Candler said. “This initiative can help increase the number of moves to ensure our people can get to their next duty station as quickly as possible. This will have positive effects on the entire Army and DOD. The PPM also reduces the strain on families and moving companies.”

As part of the continued efforts to improve quality of life for its military families, the Defense Travel Management Office had pursued the change to ease the burden of families who prefer the PPM over a traditional move, Lock said. He added that PPM moves typically result in a cost savings for the government and the policy update will pass those savings onto the families.

In April, the DOD signed a $7.2 billion contract with a single company, New Jersey-based American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier Group, to move household goods for the military.

After Dec. 31, Candler said the policy will be re-evaluated in conjunction with each military branch on whether the reimbursable costs will remain at 100 percent or return to 95 percent.

The DOD has made monetary allowance payments of 95 percent for PPMs since 1998 when it bumped the sum up from 80 percent. Candler said that each service must collectively agree to make the change permanent.

“Now, we're hoping based on this change and the moves that take place during the summer, that we can justify continuing this,” he said. “All the services benefit from this increase.”

Lock said typically younger, single Soldiers, or young couples with no children choose the PPM option. Soldiers with more time in service and those with larger families often choose to have their household items shipped by a government contractor.

Also possibly boosting the number of moves this summer is a change to granting exceptions to policy for the COVID-19 stop-move order. Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy delegated approval authority for PCS moves, temporary-duty assignments, and military leave to the first brigadier general or Senior Executive Service officer in a Soldier’s chain of command.

Approval authorities may grant exceptions for Soldiers determined to be mission essential, for changes necessary for humanitarian purposes, and for extreme hardship.

Soldiers who fall under an exception must travel with printed copies of the approved exception to policy. Soldiers exempt from travel restrictions will be required to carry a memorandum signed by their supervisor that states the reason for exemption.

Soldiers and civilians enrolled in military education programs qualify as exempt from travel restrictions and do not require an exception to policy. These programs include officer training and education programs, non-commissioned officer professional development and specialty training programs and civilian training, education and development programs.

WASHINGTON -- Despite some delays in fielding necessary equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Army’s top enlisted leader believes the service will still successfully implement its new Army Combat Fitness Test.

Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston said Thursday he remains optimistic that most units will have the necessary equipment for the test by June, despite the impact of the virus.

Grinston said he has spoken to representatives at U.S. Army Materiel Command and the fielding process remains on schedule.

He also reminded Soldiers to continue physical training sessions from home.

There’s “no excuse not to do PT. And it's always a great opportunity,” he said during an online event, hosted by the Association of the U.S. Army.

Grinston said the ACFT is better suited for physical distancing than its predecessor, the Army Physical Fitness Test, as most of the exercises are done while safely distanced from others.

During the 2-mile run, for instance, a limited number of lanes can be made available to runners and the event does not need to be done in large groups. The hand-release pushups test requires another individual to properly count repetitions, but the tracking person can count at a 6-foot distance.

As of now, both ACFT and APFT requirements are suspended, pending further guidance. Soldiers can use their last APFT score to remain promotion eligible, and the Army extended the expiration dates of previous APFT scores.

When Soldiers eventually take the APFT again, large groups will also be prohibited from running the 2-mile run together. Soldiers counting repetitions on pushups during the APFT must also remain 6 feet apart. While taking the situps test, Soldiers can now use a heavy bar to hold their feet down instead of having another Soldier hold their knees, Grinston said.

“Do I think we're confident when we start the ACFT that we can do it given the conditions of a COVID-19 environment? Absolutely,” Grinston said.

Soldiers will also be required to wipe down each piece of exercise equipment with sanitizer after completing the corresponding test.

“If you touch the bar for your max deadlift, you wipe the bar down and then you move on to the next station,” Grinston said.

Virtual transition

Grinston lauded the efforts of Army recruiters who have turned to using online tools to contact potential recruits. He said recruiters have used tools that include FaceTime to secure contracts and commitments from recruits. He said that he still expects the service to meet its end-strength goals by the end of the fiscal year.

The Army started changing its recruiting strategy by loosening restrictions on social media use for recruiters and establishing an esports team. The service also established virtual recruiting stations. Grinston said many recruiters have adapted to using the virtual space so well, that he expects recruiters to continue to use online tools after the pandemic has passed.

“We really got ahead of this about a year ago when we started doing different marketing or doing things in the digital space that really led us up to [COVID-19 stay-at-home orders],” Grinston said. “And so when we did the brick and mortar closures, we already had some of the digital recruiting going on. Some of the recruiters just really took off.”

POINT MUGU, Calif. -- The Army is hunting for top talent to fill the ranks of specialized units for multi-domain operations, following the first one standing up last year in Washington state.

In 2019, a mixture of the Army’s space, cyber, and electronic warfare capabilities was activated as a cohesive unit called the Intelligence, Information, Cyber, Electronic Warfare, and Space Battalion -- or simply I2CEWS.

The battalion has become “the centerpiece of the Multi-Domain Task Force,” Gen. John M. Murray, commander of U.S. Army Futures Command, said Tuesday during the Association of Old Crows virtual EMS Summit.

Located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, the battalion combines non-lethal Army capabilities with kinetic capabilities, such as missile defense. The I2CEWS operates in support of U.S. Army Pacific, and AFC has “plans to stand up more as we begin to experiment with this formation,” Murray said.

The Multi-Domain Task Force is a model of how the Army envisions joint-warfighting on future battlefields against near-peer competitors, like Russia and China. Before the Army activates additional formations, though, Murray said it will first need the right talent to fill the ranks.

“The No. 1 thing is finding talent, and I'm convinced we have some of that talent already in our ranks,” Murray said. “And we're going to have to go into our recruiting pools to find some of that talent. The Army is already beginning to explore innovative ways in talent management.”

Some innovative talent management programs include the Assignment Interactive Module 2.0, or AIM 2.0. The information system is a way for officers to build detailed resumes and take part in a market-style hiring system for their next assignments as organizations post specific positions they are looking to fill.

Talent management will also be part of the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army, or IPPS-A, a web-based human resources system already adopted by the National Guard, that will soon integrate the Army's personnel, pay and talent management functions into one secure web-based application.

Much like how traditional battlefields will change under the information age, the Army will also recruit talent differently. For example, Murray explained, “Thirty-eight years ago, when I was offered a four-year Army ROTC scholarship, they couldn’t care less what I majored in.

“So, I picked the easiest major I could find,” he admitted. But today “we’re offering [cadets] a six-year scholarship to come out with a degree the Army needs, and if they can’t meet our requirements, then they’re not going to join the Army.”

The Army has taken other steps to attract and keep cyber talent, such as hosting cyber hackathons, boosting pay and incentives, and direct commissioning.

But “the most attractive way to retain our cyber warriors is the thrill of the mission. To be honest, [cyber warriors] are doing things they could not do outside the Army without spending time in jail,” Murray said, regarding cyber warfare missions.

Cyber warriors direct and conduct integrated electronic warfare, information, and cyberspace actions. They are responsible for the aggressive defense of Army networks, data infrastructure, and cyber weapons systems.

For Murray, who is responsible for leading a team of more than 24,000 Soldiers and civilians in the Army's modernization enterprise, helping shape the Army’s future force is personal.

The four-star talked about his eight grandchildren, especially one granddaughter who, he believes, will one day be ""an infantry commander wearing airborne and Ranger tabs."" It’s her generation he’s working for, he said, not “old Soldiers like me.”

Murray wasn’t the only one with that mindset.

“I use some of the same equipment my father used, and my nephews are now flying some of the same equipment that I flew,” said Lt. Gen. Neil Thurgood, director of hypersonics, directed energy, space, and rapid acquisition.

“We need our grandchildren to fly new and modernized equipment as we continue to go forward,” Thurgood added. “So to those of us that have aged a little bit in the process of our careers, it is personal, because we spent that time with our Soldiers, and we spent that time with our families.”

In the end, that's really what AFC and “the whole team, to include our acquisition partners, brings to our Army, delivering solutions that our Soldiers need when they need it,” Murray said.

“This is about our kids and our grandkids that will defend this great nation going into the future,” he added. “That's really what personalizes this mission for me, and that's a heavy rucksack to carry.”

FORT MEADE, Md. -- Security force assistance brigade Soldiers from the first-ever team to operate in Africa spoke of their recent mission Wednesday in training Senegalese soldiers on logistics support.

The discussion was part of a recruiting push to add more qualified Soldiers to the Army’s six SFABs, which are still hiring using virtual assessments and bonuses worth nearly $60,000 for in-demand career fields.

SFABs have previously deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, the latter of which is where the 4th SFAB will deploy this fall to replace the 3rd SFAB.

Upcoming missions will also include counter-narcotics advising in the U.S. Southern Command region, as well as others in the Indo-Pacific region and back to Africa, said Lt. Col. Kevin Field, the SFAB recruiting team lead, during a livestream on Facebook.

The SFAB mission is a re-focused train, assist and advise strategy that envisioned the specialized units in hotspots around the world.

Since they serve as permanent organizations, the units provide a more concerted effort than previous ad hoc advise and train formations, while also freeing up conventional brigade combat teams and Special Forces units.

“With the Army standing up the SFABs, it allows us to professionalize the delivery of the security assistance mission, because we have a dedicated force,” Field said. “That’s all they do. It also helps us preserve the readiness of our BCTs to respond to worldwide contingencies.”

African mission

In the first mission outside U.S. Central Command, the 1st SFAB’s Logistics Advisor Team 1610 traveled to Senegal in March to instruct its military personnel in preventative maintenance, vehicle recovery and motor pool operations.

While the training went well, team members said, the location still presented them with an unusual work environment.

Due to the reduced U.S. military presence in Africa, the team had limited tactical communications and quality medical facilities available to them, while they also had to work out of a hotel for three weeks.

“A deployment on the continent of Africa is much different than what most of us have experienced through deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq and brings about different challenges, especially for a small team,” said Maj. Michael Pachucki, the team leader.

One of the highlights for Staff Sgt. Braxton Pernice, the team’s maintenance advisor, was the vehicle recovery portion of the training.

It allowed the Senegalese soldiers “to put hands on their equipment and get familiar with how to utilize their recovery trucks,” he said. “Overall, it was a great training event and we learned a lot from them as well as they learned a lot from us.”

Pachucki, who also deployed with the 1st SFAB to Afghanistan in 2018, said his assignment with the brigade has been one of his most rewarding in his 15-year career.

“What I will promise you if you come to an SFAB,” he said, “is the opportunity to grow personally and professionally, work with great people, and receive individual and professional training opportunities not often seen in other units.”

Promotions, bonuses

Not only do SFABs have a unique mission, they also had higher promotion rates than other Army units last year, Field said.

Enlisted promotion rates from sergeant first class through sergeant major at SFABs ranged from 33% to 65%, compared to about 17% to 41% across the Army. On the officer side, promotion rates from major through colonel at SFABs ranged from 79% to 89%, compared to 21% to 67%.

“I will tell you that most of those individuals, they’re going to be promoted with or without SFAB in their files, because we are hiring highly-qualified individuals,” Field said. “That’s also another way the SFAB helps you get promoted, because you are being exposed to some of the top NCOs and officers in our Army from various [military occupational specialties].”

Some of the slots that SFABs are currently looking to fill include: military intelligence (35 series); unit supply specialist (92Y), fire support specialist (13F), signal (25 series); and combat engineer (12B).

As much as $58,300 is also being offered in selective retention bonuses for specialists through staff sergeants in the 35 series, as well as for information technology specialist (25B); military police (31B); and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialist (74D).

Even if an enlisted Soldier does not qualify for a bonus that Soldier can still receive a $5,000 assignment incentive pay.

Positions in the SFAB also count as a broadening assignment, providing tactical options for NCOs other than being a recruiter or drill sergeant.

“This gives you the same credit as doing one of those jobs, except that you get to stay and work within your MOS and be exposed to some of that same equipment,” Field said. “So, by time your time in the SFAB is complete and you’re rotating back to your BCT, you don’t need to be re-greened. You’ve been working in your MOS with Soldiers out there.”

WASHINGTON -- A new contract to facilitate the movement of household goods, an integral part of any move to a new duty location, is expected to make things easier for both service members and their families.

The U.S. Transportation Command awarded the contract to American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier Group Inc. on April 30. The first move under the new contract won't take place until February, Transcom's director of acquisition said at a news conference today.

""The ... contract is an important component of improving service members' experiences during the relocation process, and fundamentally restructures DOD's relationship with the household goods industry in order to improve access to, and management of, quality capacity to meet peak demand and enable the department to fix the accountability and responsibility lacking in today's program,"" Ken Brennan said.

The New Jersey-based business was chosen for the contract because the proposal the company submitted provided the best service for the best value for service members, Defense Department civilians and their families, Brennan said, adding that the carrier group beat out six other competing proposals.

Rick Marsh, the director of the defense personal property program at Transcom, said the new contract will bring great benefit to service members and their families.

Right now, he said, there's no single contractor the DOD uses to move household goods. As a result, he said, no portion of the industry is motivated to spend money to enhance the service they provide to service members and their families.

""There is ... no rationale to invest in quality suppliers and invest in your network,"" Marsh said. ""You can't forecast the work that you're going to perform. Our current model leads to using day laborers and other folks that maybe aren't as well-trained as moving professionals should be.""

By centralizing the work in one company, he said, DOD lets industry know what the demand is for household goods movement, and that allows for investment.

""They can hire and invest in very highly trained employees to come into service member homes to handle pack out or delivery,"" he said.

As far as accountability is concerned, he said, the department has more than 300 personal property offices at installations and another 42 shipping offices around the world that will have formally-appointed contracting officers and quality assurance evaluators.

""We're going to be working off of a centralized quality assurance surveillance plan to ensure we have accurate, rigorous oversight over the contract,"" Marsh said.

For families who have issues with their move, he said, there will be new avenues to rectify problems.

""I would say most of the issues that we have in our current program revolve around communication,"" he said. ""We're going to be able to bring tools to the table that we simply can't deliver today under the current program, to be able to put families in touch with representatives from industry faster — to make the claims process much cleaner, much simpler, and for them to be, to have it settled and to be made whole ... much faster than they are today.""

Currently, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many service members are unable to relocate as they might have expected during the summer months, while others will be allowed to move if granted an exception, Marsh said. For those who are allowed to move under such an exception, efforts will be made to protect both families and movers from COVID-19.

""In an effort to protect the force and deliver a safe moving experience to DOD families, DOD has directed a series of health protection measures for personnel moving during the stop-movement period,"" he said.

DOD has directed that industry personnel adhere to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's health protection protocols, Marsh said. That includes wearing face coverings, minimizing crew sizes, cleaning frequently-touched surfaces and practicing good hand hygiene while conducting moves in family housing.

Additionally, Marsh said, moving crews will need to verify the health of their teams upon arriving at military families' homes.

""When a moving crew arrives at the curb for a pack out or delivery, moving companies will present written verification that members of the crew have been screened for illness and will be properly equipped to adhere to these protocols,"" Marsh said.

If a family does have concerns about the health of the team that arrives to move their household goods, Marsh said, they are also empowered to ask those movers to not come into their home.

""If families aren't comfortable, they should stop work and reschedule their move,"" he said. ""A DOD representative will contact every DOD member during every move, in-person or virtually, to ensure protocols are being followed. And if something's not right, local transportation offices and the personnel's chain of command will get involved to make it right.""

WASHINGTON – The Army launched a new survey which allows Soldiers to voice their concerns directly and anonymously to Army leadership.

The Department of the Army Career Engagement Survey (DACES) is a survey for all Active Duty Soldiers. DACES replaces earlier exit surveys which were only given to Soldiers as they departed the Active Army.

DACES is a customized survey, with questions tailored to the individual Soldier based on their responses to previous questions. This reduces the amount of time required to take the survey by eliminating unnecessary questions. Although the current version of DACES takes around fifteen minutes to complete, future versions will take even less time, as DACES will ask more specific questions based on an individual’s demographics. During the survey, Soldiers will also be provided a chance to request more information about career opportunities or to be contacted for additional information.

Starting in May, Soldiers will receive a link in their email inbox during their birth month directing them to the DACES web page. In addition to an annual birth month survey, all Soldiers will be required to complete the survey as part of their out-processing requirements when they depart the Army.

The Army will use the results of DACES to inform retention efforts. DACES will help the Army create retention incentives and quality of life programs in order to retain talent. DACES will not share the results of the survey with a Soldier’s chain of command or personnel manager, allowing Soldiers to share information candidly.

The first surveys have already been sent. Users may only take DACES if they are using a DOD-furnished computer on a DOD network, if they are connected to a DOD network through a VPN, or if they are using CITRIX.

FORT CARSON, Colo. -- In a rare virtual ceremony, the Army’s latest security force assistance brigade to stand up officially activated Tuesday as it prepares to deploy to Afghanistan this fall.

The 4th SFAB, based at Fort Carson, is the fifth of six similar units to stand up after the Army activated the first one in 2018, as part of a re-focused train, assist and advise strategy that envisioned the specialized units in hotspots around the world.

The SFABs serve as permanent organizations that provide a more concerted effort than previous ad hoc formations, such as military transition teams or security force assistance advisory teams.

To create the previous units, the Army pulled from conventional brigade combat teams that then reduced their effectiveness.

“And though necessary at the time, all of this had a long-term, negative impact on total force readiness,” said Gen. Michael Garrett, commander of U.S. Army Forces Command. “Back then, we treated security force assistance as a peripheral task when, in fact, it is central to the National Defense Strategy and our Army’s mission.”

Since 2018, SFABs have deployed to assist foreign partners in Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Members of an SFAB train, deploy and redeploy together as part of an enduring group. After some time resetting back at home, the teams in that same brigade deploy again.

Security force assistance is far from a new concept, the general said, as today’s heritage can be traced back to the Military Assistance Command-Vietnam created in the 1960s for the war.

The general said there is now an increasing need for combat advisors, which free up BCTs to better prepare for large-scale ground combat with near-peer adversaries.

“They are Soldiers who can build teams, solve complex problems and succeed in uncertain environments,” he said.

The newest combat advisors have already learned specialized skills from the Military Advisor Training Academy, as well as advanced medical training; survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training; and foreign weapons training.

In June, the 4th SFAB is slated to conduct the next rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center in Fort Polk, Louisiana.

It will be “the first one out of the chute as we work to figure out how we maintain readiness as we adjust to the new normal,” Garrett said.

Brig. Gen. Mark Landes, commander of the Security Force Assistance Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, dialed in via videoconference for the ceremony, which had Garrett and a few others spaced 6 feet apart with the unit’s guidon inside a large conference room.

Landes called the ceremony “historic and atypical,” but noted that while the ongoing threat from the virus has changed how the Army operates, it has not changed its essence.

“COVID-19 has allowed us another opportunity to showcase our character, our capability and our adaptability,” he said.

The ceremony signified 4th SFAB’s transformation into a trained and deployable formation, he said, adding he was impressed with how much it grew since January 2019.

“Every person in the unity and victory formation was selected and relocated to the unit,” Landes said, referring to the unit’s motto. “Every pencil and piece of paper had to be obtained using systems and processes that also had to be developed and incorporated.”

The 5th SFAB, out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, will be the last SFAB to stand up, slated for this summer. The 54th SFAB, a collection of National Guard Soldiers from several states, activated in March.

With about 800 Soldiers, the 4th SFAB is scheduled to replace the 3rd SFAB to continue the mission in Afghanistan.

“These SFABs are advising, assisting and developing professional organized militaries that can fight for themselves,” Landes said.

Its commander, Col. James Dooghan, said he was confident that each advisor is fully trained and equipped with the best tools to tackle the challenge.

“We selected the right people in the right positions to be ready and effective in assessing, advising, mentoring and assisting our international partners,” he said. “We’re proud to officially announce our activation and we look forward to this mission.”

WASHINGTON -- Army researchers are working to rapidly develop and test experimental vaccines to combat COVID-19, Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy said.

The Army is also collaborating with the private sector and other government entities on 24 vaccine candidates, some of which are headed for human testing after having been tested on animals, McCarthy told reporters at a recent Pentagon news conference.

If history is any indicator of future success, there is reason to be hopeful. Being at the forefront of medical breakthroughs is nothing new for Army researchers:

Fighting Malaria

Due to their ability to carry and spread diseases such as malaria, mosquitoes are one of the deadliest insects in the world, killing an average of 725,000 people a year, said. Army Col. (Dr.) Deydre Teyhen, commander of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. That surpasses the combined annual number of deaths from combat (475,000), deadly snakebites (50,000), crocodile attacks (1,000) and shark attacks (10).

To reduce deaths caused by mosquitoes, WRAIR has acted on several fronts, she said: providing proactive medical diplomacy, delivering vaccines and vector control, and leading the world in malaria drug and vaccine development.

Fighting Multidrug-Resistant Infections

An antibiotic drug developed by Army researchers several years ago is now available to treat service members who have life-threatening, multidrug-resistant, or MDR, bacterial infections.

Arbekacin is a new antibiotic treatment for MDR infections. Those types of infections may complicate wounds suffered by soldiers in combat, said Army Col. (Dr.) Michael Zapor, an infectious diseases physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

""Of all the bacterial species found on the planet, relatively few are intrinsically multidrug-resistant pathogens,"" Zapor said. ""In Iraq and Afghanistan, the bacterium known as acinetobacter is one such MDR bacterium that has caused problems in our patient population.""

cinetobacter is commonly found in the water and soil of regions such as Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. Although it's intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, it's not especially virulent and generally not problematic in humans unless their immune system has been severely compromised or the bacterium is inoculated deep into macerated tissue, as would occur with massive open wounds resulting from battle injuries.

Infections caused by the bacterium were prevalent during the Vietnam War, he said. But at the time, antibiotics were usually successful in eradicating acinetobacter infections. However, over time, resistance emerged and antibiotics became less effective against many pathogenic bacteria, including acinetobacter.

Fighting Yellow Fever

A lot of service members were taken out of the fight in 1898 during the Spanish-American War due to yellow fever.

The Army created the Yellow Fever Commission, led by Army Maj. (Dr.) Walter Reed, which determined that mosquitoes were the carriers of the disease. The commission developed effective control programs to eradicate the mosquitoes.

Fighting Adenovirus

Acute respiratory diseases were fairly common among service members in the early 1950s. Maurice Hilleman, a microbiologist with the Army Medical Center's Department of Respiratory Diseases, discovered that the adenovirus was the culprit.

WRAIR created an adenovirus vaccine in 1956, just three years after its discovery.

WASHINGTON – The Army has resumed shipping recruits to basic combat training following a two-week pause to enact necessary COVID-19 mitigation efforts. More than 950 future Soldiers will begin pouring into initial training centers this week.

“We’re not changing, we’re adjusting, and continually adapting in the environment no matter where we are, because we need to train, fight, and win,” said Gen. Paul Funk, the commanding general of Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, regarding new BCT policies.

As hundreds of new recruits begin pouring into training bases around the force, health and safety measures are in place, officials said. For example, BCT and One-Station Unit Training are implementing social-distancing practices and plan to train “at reduced capacity,” officials said.

This means smaller elements, Funk explained. “That way if we have a [coronavirus] breakout, we can control it and move the smallest elements forward and continue to progress people through the training pipeline.”

Several other protocols and procedures are in place from the time recruits leave their hometowns to the moment they step foot on training soil.

For two weeks prior to their ship date, future Soldiers are screened for symptoms of, and possible exposure to, COVID-19 by their recruiters and then by Military Entrance Processing Station personnel, Funk said. Also, during this time recruits will isolate themselves at home to limit exposure to the airborne virus.

Once recruits show up to their assigned training center, they are screened again, Funk said.

Then for the first two-weeks after arrival, recruits take part in a modified training curriculum and have their health gauged daily.

Much of this time is classroom-based, held outside when possible, and recruits remain six feet apart. After 14 days – and if they are healthy – for the additional eight weeks of the 10-week schedule, recruits “hit the ground running,” Funk said.

The controlled monitoring phase will be a series of classes, which is an introduction to Army techniques that are normally scheduled anyway, he said. Classes include customs and courtesies, recognizing military rank, and preventing sexual assault.

The Army is also cautious about where future Soldiers arrive. Individuals from “low-risk” areas will ship to initial training bases, but “those who are in high-risk areas will be rescheduled for future dates,” according to a news release.

All four Army training centers have implemented these procedures “and they perform their conditions on the established procedures so when the recruits come in, we're making sure that we can form the safety bubbles necessary to get us through the training,” Funk said.

“We owe that kind of due diligence and commitment to our Soldiers and their parents, who send those same Soldiers to us each year to wear the cloth of our great nation,” he added.

These BCT changes are an example of how the Army is “adapting to the current environment, and adjusting the way it operates,” Funk explained. “Every day to fight our nation's wars, one of our greatest strengths has always been our ability to learn and adapt.”

Travel restrictions made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Defense Department providing leave leniency for service members who accrue too much leave and might otherwise lose it.

Each year, active-duty service members are granted 30 days of leave, but at the end of each fiscal year, they normally lose any unused leave exceeding 60 days. With the leniency granted due to the pandemic travel restrictions, service members can now accrue a leave balance of up to 120 days until Sept. 30, 2023.

Matthew Donovan, undersecretary of personnel and readiness, signed the authorization for that change April 16.

DOD encourages service members to take leave whenever possible; however, it's not always possible due to deployments and operational commitments, Pentagon officials said, though some extensions have been granted due to long deployments.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit service members particularly hard because many are not allowed to travel to see friends and loved ones who live many miles away — a big incentive for taking leave, Donovan said. Therefore, he continued, the restriction on the leave balance ceiling was relaxed.

""The department's actions to stem the spread of COVID-19 have significantly limited the ability of service members to take leave during this national emergency, and we know that leave is vital to the health and welfare of our force,"" Donovan stated in his memorandum.

For DOD's civilian workforce, Office of Personnel Management policy already makes allowances for leave accrual under exigent circumstances, such as COVID-19. All restored annual leave must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year ending two years from the year the annual leave was earned after the termination of the current emergency. The normal leave balance service members may carry over each year is 240 hours. However, more hours may be carried over during the current emergency.

Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper signed a memorandum today restricting all DOD uniformed and civilian personnel and their families from traveling to, from or through places identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's travel health notices as Level 3 COVID locations.

The memo is in effect until June 30, though that could change because reviews are taking place every 15 days based on CDC guidance.

The travel restrictions include permanent changes of station and all other official travel, as well as personal leave. Also, flights to or from non-Level 3 countries cannot transit through Level 3 nations.

As of today, the CDC website listed Germany, Italy, Qatar, Afghanistan, South Korea and Japan — countries where large numbers of service members are stationed — as Level 3 locations. Many other countries also are at Level 3.

Numerous exceptions to the travel ban have been made on a case-by-case basis, Donovan said at an April 18 Pentagon news conference, citing exemptions for medical treatment, personal hardship, separation and retirement.

""The coronavirus disease continues to present significant risk to our forces as the DOD considers domestic and overseas personnel travel,"" Esper stated in his memorandum. ""These movements present the threat of spreading COVID-19 within our ranks and communities. My priorities remain protecting our service members, DOD civilians and families; safeguarding our national security capabilities; and supporting the whole-of-nation response.""

This is not the first time extensions have been granted, officials noted. Special leave accrual of up to 75 days was granted during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, due to long or multiple deployments.

319,Army Public Health Center experts offer tips for staying at home without feeling isolated,https://www.army.mil/article/234321/army_public_health_center_experts_offer_tips_for_staying_at_home_without_feeling_isolated,"Army Public Health Center experts recommend maintaining physical fitness levels while working from home as a strategy for maintaining good general health and managing stress. (Photo Credit: U.S. Army Public Health Center photo courtesy Getty Images) VIEW ORIGINAL

ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. – Following mandated stay-at-home and social distancing rules during the COVID-19 crisis is creating unique challenges for many individuals who are managing work, family and personal needs while still trying to stay healthy and not stress out or get too stir crazy. Health and nutrition experts at the Army Public Health Center have a number of recommendations to help keep you and your family on track.

Lt. Col. Leslie Roberson, a clinical psychologist and APHC behavioral health specialist, recognizes the challenges.

“Our family is spending more time together than usual due to COVID-19,” said Roberson. “Being together in close quarters can be challenging. Did I mention we are also sharing the internet with four teenagers and the internet is required for telework?”

Roberson recommends discussing daily work plans, especially when online meetings are occurring, so others in the household know when they need to be quiet.

“We have a freshman in the home and both my husband and I are teleworking,” said Sgt. 1st Class Sue Ellen Brown, the non-commissioned officer in charge of Pregnancy Postpartum Physical Training for Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. “A good strategy that has worked for us is to maintain a schedule and enforcing our timelines for workout, personal hygiene, lunch, break, and also balancing when our dog Elle wants attention and love.

Sgt. 1st Class Jonathan K. Settle, APHC Health Promotion and Wellness Directorate NCOIC, is adapting well to telework.

“Teleworking has made it possible to spend more time with the family. I am able to pause for short moments to regroup,” said Settle. “I still work the required hours but am able to space my time out through the day leading to a better quality of life.”

APHC experts say another strategy for maintaining good general health and managing stress while working from home is to maintain physical fitness levels. Personal physical training should include a balance of cardiorespiratory (endurance) exercise and resistance training. And you don’t need a gym to get it done. For example, the Army physical readiness training app also provides two weeks of PRT sessions that can be done with or without equipment. These resources can be found on the ACFT website at https://www.army.mil/acft/.

“Each morning before work begins, I try to incorporate walking the family dogs 15 minutes, and I also try and spend 15 minutes walking the dogs during lunch,” said Roberson. “I use a fitness tracker daily to monitor steps I've taken to make me be accountable. If I have less than 10,000 steps a day, I try not to go to bed until that goal has been met.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend that adults engage in 150 minutes per week of moderate activity (i.e. brisk walking, bike riding 10 to 12 mph) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week (jogging at 6 mph or biking at 14 to 16 mph) or a combination of both.

These workouts can also be conducted while following recommended social distancing guidelines, according to APHC experts. Cardiorespiratory training can be performed indoors on a treadmill, stationary bike, or stairs, or outside by going on a walk, run, or bike around the neighborhood. Large empty parking lots at a neighborhood school, church or shopping center may allow one to walk/run without any close contact with others. Make sure to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) at all times. If walking or running on trails, try to go during times when it is less crowded.

Brown also has a good workout routine.

“We are working out in the mornings with our teenagers; which relieves a lot of stress,” said Brown. “I also workout on Fridays with our P3T Soldiers via Facebook live, which has been a learning experience within itself.”

Another critical part of staying healthy is good nutrition, which is one leg of the Army Performance Triad of sleep, activity and nutrition. Staying healthy during “stay-at-home” requirements involve three key considerations: Eating a rainbow of eight servings of fruits and vegetables, eat a balanced plate, and hydrate with water throughout the day.

“We have made a conscious effort not to buy junk food and only keep healthy or semi-healthy food at the house,” said Brown. “We’re also cooking food at home to keep it healthy and attempting not to order out.”

The Army P3 nutrition webpage offers more ideas for creating the rainbow.

“The best thing to boost your immune system is to regularly eat a variety of foods with a focus on fruits and vegetables,” said Joanna Reagan, APHC registered dietitian. “Fruits and vegetables are extremely beneficial in disease prevention, making them nutritional powerhouses.”

Settle says he avoids stress eating by keeping healthy snacks around the house.

“We've never had many snacks in the house and when we do have snacks they usually consist of frozen grapes and chips,” said Settle. “When eating chips no one is allowed to eat out of the bag. All snacks are served in bowls to avoid eating the entire bag at one sitting.”

Eating a balanced plate is good for your immune system, said Reagan. She recommends focusing on nutrient rich foods while eating three balanced meals a day with healthy snacks. Key nutrients to help with immunity include Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, probiotic-rich foods, and omega 3-rich foods. Check out this P3 web page on supporting your immune system.

Staying hydrated throughout the day can also help boost immunity. This is also pretty easy to do when hydrating is as easy as a trip to the fridge.

“Set a reoccurring alarm on your phone to remind you to drink water at regular intervals,” said Reagan. “Add lemon or lime slices and fresh fruit to increase flavor.”

The last pillar of P3 is sleep. This can be especially challenging during this stressful time, but it’s important for a fit body and mind. Sleep experts recommend seven or more hours of sleep a night.

“Skimping on sleep could adversely affect your immune system, leaving you susceptible to illness, while sleeping longer may help you resist infections” said Dr. Sara Alger, a sleep research scientist in the Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. “Additionally, your brain and body require sleep to process what you have learned and experienced during the day and to aid post-workout muscle recovery. Also, getting a good night’s sleep helps with emotion regulation, which is important during this stressful time.”

Alger recommends setting a consistent bed and wake time and avoiding caffeine at least six hours before going to bed.

The final challenge of mandatory stay-at-home orders is in the name – social distancing. Plus, you’re stuck in your house alone, with family or maybe a roommate. How do you keep it fun and also stay connected with friends and family, whether across the country or a few miles away?

“I keep telling myself to stay in some type of shape mentally and physically because this will not last forever,” said Brown. “For my mental/spiritual state we are still attending church via Facebook Live, working out and keeping a routine at home. I also have personal time and family time.”

The internet makes it easier to stay connected, said Dr. Anna Courie, an APHC nurse and project officer.

“We maintain social connections by talking to friends on Facebook,” said Roberson. “We also make sure we call family and close friends weekly. For the upcoming Easter Holiday, we will FaceTime or Skype with family located in other states to wish them a happy holiday.”

Courie is also a big advocate for military families taking control of their needs and accessing those resources available in their communities.

“Army communities have a ton of resources available to support military families during difficult times,” said Courie. “You can access those resources via the Army Community Resource Guide.”

All Army families can download the CRG app via the iTunes/Google Play stores or access it at https://crg.amedd.army.mil.

Another resource promoting and sustaining healthy lifestyles during this time is the Army Wellness Center. AWCs offer a crucial link for health resources to the broader Army community. Local AWCs are providing a variety of services in an online format to continue their support of the health and wellbeing of active-duty service members, adult family members, retirees, and Department of the Army civilians. Services are free and this web page lists all AWC locations.

Settle says he likes doing puzzles with his daughter, playing card games, taking daily walks outside and listening to podcasts while doing mundane household chores.

“I lead a very boring and simple life but it makes me happy,” said Settle.

For more tips and strategies and maintaining your distance, but also your health, check out the Performance Triad Trending Topics page.

The Army Public Health Center focuses on promoting healthy people, communities, animals and workplaces through the prevention of disease, injury and disability of Soldiers, military retirees, their families, veterans, Army civilian employees, and animals through population-based monitoring, investigations, and technical consultations.

My mom and grandparents would be pleased with this honor of James,” said Richard Hanna, nephew of Ward. “We should all honor those who have served and are serving at home and abroad.”Ward was assigned to USS Oklahoma (BB 37) when it was sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor Dec. 7, 1941. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for remaining onboard and guiding his shipmates to safety with a flashlight.Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea, and other distinguished guests joined Ward’s family members at the Thursday ceremony.Franchetti presented Ward’s family with a replacement Medal of Honor medal, Medal of Honor Flag, and a copy of the citation prior to the ceremony.“On December 7th, 1941, our Sailors and Marines displayed unmatched resilience and heroism at Pearl Harbor,"" said Franchetti. ""Seaman 1st Class Ward is among these exceptional heroes and his actions that fateful Sunday morning are an inspiration to each of us. I am honored to see him properly laid to rest after these 82 years.”Ward was transported through the cemetery on a hearse-led caisson accompanied by the Old Guard and Navy Band. Four F/A-18 Super Hornets assigned to the “Gladiators” of Strike Fighter Squadron 106 performed a flyover at the beginning of the ceremony. The firing party conducted three volleys of fire and casket bearers folded the American flag as a Navy Band bugler concluded the service with the traditional song of “Taps.” Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe Jr., Director for Strategic Systems Programs, presented the flag to the Ward family.“We are grateful to the Navy and the persistence of all the numerous civilian and military personnel who were involved in the recovery and identification of James,” said Hanna. “Our family is honored to be able to finally bring James to Arlington National Cemetery, his deserved resting place. The attention to detail involved in his memorial from the first day we were notified, to the personnel assigned to our family’s needs, has been overwhelming.”A total of 16 service members, ranging in rank from Seaman to Rear Adm., were awarded Medals of Honor related to events at Pearl Harbor; 11 posthumously. Ward’s family was presented the Medal of Honor in March 1942, along with a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox. The Edsall-class destroyer escort ship USS. J. Richard Ward (DE 243) was named in his honor, commissioned July 5, 1943.In 2003 the USS Oklahoma Project set out to identify the Sailors' remains that were lost with the Nevada-class battleship. Of the 394 service members originally deemed unaccounted-for, 361 Sailors and Marines have since been individually identified. On Feb. 22, 2022, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) announced that it had positively identified Ward’s remains on Aug. 19, 2021. As a symbol that Ward had been accounted for, a rosette now adorns his name in the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.Over 400,000 Veterans are buried at Arlington National Cemetery, with over 8,000 being World War II Veterans and over 400 being Medal of Honor Recipients."
322,Wisconsin Man Sentenced to a Year in Prison for Violating the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wisconsin-man-sentenced-year-prison-violating-preventing-animal-cruelty-and-torture-act,"A Wisconsin man was sentenced yesterday to 12 months and one day in prison for violating the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act.

Kenneth J. Herrera, 40, of Soldiers Grove, had previously pleaded guilty for creating, selling and distributing an animal crushing video. Animal crushing includes burning, suffocating, impaling or causing the serious bodily injury of animals. The judge also sentenced Herrera to three years of supervised release and to pay a $5,000 fine.

In 2021, Herrera paid a videographer in Indonesia $100 for a video of a monkey being physically abused. Herrera sent specific instructions, which the videographer followed, asking that the monkey be picked up by the genitals using pliers and then hit on the head with a hammer. The videographer sent Herrera the video via an encrypted messaging application. The PACT Act makes it illegal to create or distribute depictions of animal crushing that will be sold or distributed internationally or between states.

“Animal crushing videos cruelly force animals into a cycle of fear, violence and death for personal gratification or profit,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “We are committed to aggressively pursuing and prosecuting anyone who engages in the creation or distribution of animal crush videos.”

“Video recordings of animal torture are cruel, inhumane and illegal,” said U.S. Attorney Timothy M. O’Shea for the Western District of Wisconsin. “Evidence shows that animal torture can be a precursor to other violent crimes. Our office will work with law enforcement, domestically and internationally, to investigate and prosecute all crimes of this nature.”

“The primary mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and our specific role in the Office of Law Enforcement, is to protect all wildlife from being unlawfully commercialized, in whatever form we find it,” said Assistant Director Edward Grace of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement. “The heinous crimes against wildlife that are centered in this investigation are an extreme example of that commitment. The success of this case is a direct result of our partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”

“The FBI stands resolute in our dedication to working with our federal and international partners to address animal cruelty violations,” said Special Agent in Charge Michael E. Hensle of the FBI Milwaukee Field Office. “We view the sentence handed down in this case under the Animal Crushing Statue not only as a measure of justice served, but also as a deterrent against future violations. We appreciate the opportunity to work with our partners at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Wisconsin on this investigation and will continue to rigorously enforce the laws designed to prevent such heinous acts.”

The FBI and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigated the case.

Trial Attorney Mark T. Romley of the Justice Department Environment and Natural Resources Division’s Environmental Crimes Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Chadwick Elgersma for the Western District of Wisconsin prosecuted the case."
323,Man Sentenced for Illegally Distributing Over $16M of Adulterated HIV Medication,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-sentenced-illegally-distributing-over-16m-adulterated-hiv-medication,"A Florida man was sentenced today to four years and three months in prison for his role in a nationwide scheme to illegally distribute at least $16.7 million of adulterated HIV drugs that were ultimately dispensed to unsuspecting patients throughout the country.

According to court documents, Armando Herrera, 43, of Miami, and his co-conspirators established companies in Florida, Texas, Washington, and California, which they used to sell and distribute adulterated prescription drugs, primarily HIV medications, to wholesale pharmaceutical suppliers. Herrera and his co-conspirators created false documentation to make it appear as though the drugs were acquired legitimately when, in fact, they were not. The pharmaceutical suppliers then sold the drugs to pharmacies, which dispensed the adulterated prescription drugs to unwitting patients. As part of the investigation, federal agents seized more than $1.5 million worth of adulterated prescription drugs from Herrera, including more than 16,000 tablets of adulterated and misbranded HIV medication.

Herrera pleaded guilty on Sept. 25 to one count of conspiracy to introduce adulterated and misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.

324,Connecticut Man Sentenced to 144 Months in Prison for Attempting to Travel to Fight for ISIS,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/connecticut-man-sentenced-144-months-prison-attempting-travel-fight-isis,"Kevin Iman McCormick, 30, of Hamden, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Kari A. Dooley in Bridgeport to 144 months of in prison followed by a lifetime of supervised release, for attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), a designated foreign terrorist organization.

According to court documents and statements made in court, between August and October 2019, McCormick made several statements to others expressing a desire to travel to Syria and to fight for ISIS. In August 2019, McCormick stated to members of a Muslim community center that “we should support ISIS” and “jihad is the way to go.” In another conversation in October 2019, McCormick stated, “I gotta fight bro, because those people, Abu Masa and ISIL, they fought for me bro, I know it, I can feel it, in my heart. So it’s my time to fight . . . It just is what it is bro, it’s just my – it’s just my time to go bro.” When McCormick was asked to elaborate on where he would like to travel, McCormick responded, “I don’t know, I don’t know bro – it’s gotta be like Syria. Where ISIL is at….whichever place is easiest, whatever place I can get there the fastest, the quickest, the easiest, and where I can have a rifle and I can have some people bro. That’s what I need, I need a rifle and I need some people, I need Islamic law, I need, that’s what I need, because if I have these things, it’s gonna to be very hard to kill me.”

On Oct. 12, 2019, McCormick attempted to board a flight from Connecticut to Jamaica but was prevented by the Department of Homeland Security. McCormick subsequently told an individual that he wanted to travel to Jamaica, and then onward to Syria to join ISIS. He also indicated that he wanted to acquire weapons.

On Oct. 19, 2019, McCormick made a video during which he pledged allegiance to ISIS and its then-leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. Also on that date, he purchased a plane ticket from Toronto, Canada, to Amman, Jordan. On Oct. 21, 2019, McCormick was arrested after he traveled to a small private airport in Connecticut where he expected to board a plane that would fly him to Canada.

McCormick has been detained since his arrest. On Jan. 12, he pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.

U.S. Attorney Vanessa Roberts Avery for the District of Connecticut, Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, and Special Agent in Charge Robert Fuller of the FBI New Haven Field Office made the announcement.

325,Former Swiss Executive Pleads Guilty to Tax Fraud Conspiracy,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-swiss-executive-pleads-guilty-tax-fraud-conspiracy,"A Swiss national pleaded guilty today to conspiring to defraud the United States for his role in a scheme to help high-net-worth U.S. taxpayers conceal their income and assets in offshore accounts.

According to court documents and statements made in court, Rolf Schnellmann was the former head of Allied Finance Trust AG, a Zurich-based financial services company and a subsidiary of the Allied Finance Group in Liechtenstein. From approximately 2008 to 2014, Schnellmann and his co-conspirators defrauded the IRS by concealing income and assets of high-net-worth U.S. taxpayer-clients in undeclared bank accounts at Privatbank IHAG Zurich AG (IHAG), a Swiss private bank.

Schnellmann and his co-conspirators devised and implemented a scheme dubbed the “Singapore Solution” to fraudulently conceal the bank accounts of the U.S. taxpayer-clients, their assets and their income from U.S. authorities. As part of the scheme, Schnellmann and his co-conspirators conspired to transfer more than $60 million from the U.S. taxpayer-clients’ undeclared IHAG bank accounts through a series of nominee accounts in Hong Kong and other locations before returning the funds to newly opened accounts at IHAG in the name of a Singapore-based asset-management firm that a co-conspirator helped establish. The U.S. taxpayer-clients paid large fees to IHAG and others to help them conceal their funds and assets and evade taxes.

Schnellmann was arrested in August in Italy and extradited to the United States. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 19, 2024, and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, as well as a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York and James C. Lee, Chief of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) made the announcement.

IRS-CI is investigating the case. Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Williams also thanked the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs, Interpol, Italian law enforcement authorities, the Prosecutor General’s Office of Trieste and the Italian Ministry of Justice for their assistance in the extradition of the defendant.

Senior Litigation Counsel Nannette Davis of the Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Olga I. Zverovich for the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case."
326,New Hampshire Man Indicted for Threatening to Kill Three Presidential Candidates,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-hampshire-man-indicted-threatening-kill-three-presidential-candidates,"A New Hampshire man has been indicted in connection with sending threatening text messages to three presidential candidates.

Tyler Anderson, 30, of Dover, was charged with three counts of transmitting in interstate commerce a threat to injure the person of another. Anderson was arrested on Dec. 9, and he made an initial appearance in federal court on Dec. 11. On Dec. 14, the court released him on conditions.

“We have seen an increase in threats of violence against public officials and those seeking public office across the country, and I have made clear that these types of illegal threats undermine the function of our democracy,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “We will not tolerate illegal threats of violence directed at public officials or those seeking public office.”

According to the charging documents, Anderson sent a series of threatening text messages to three separate presidential campaigns going back to November. On Nov. 22, Anderson threatened to “impale” and “disembowel” one candidate. On Dec. 6, Anderson threatened a second candidate in a series of text messages, including that he would “blow” the ""head off"" of the candidate and conduct a “mass shooting.” On Dec. 8, Anderson threatened via text message that he would “blow” the “brains out” of a third candidate and “kill everyone” who would attend a then-upcoming campaign event.

Anderson faces a maximum of five years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000 for each charge. A federal district court judge will determine a sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

The FBI led the investigation. Valuable assistance was provided by the Dover Police Department and the Portsmouth Police Departments.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Rombeau for the District of New Hampshire is prosecuting the case.

An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."
327,Nurse Practitioner Sentenced for $192M Medicare Fraud Scheme,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nurse-practitioner-sentenced-192m-medicare-fraud-scheme,"A Florida woman was sentenced today to 20 years in prison for her role in a scheme to defraud Medicare by submitting over $192 million in claims for genetic tests and durable medical equipment that patients did not need and telemedicine visits that never occurred.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Elizabeth Hernandez, 45, of Miami, signed thousands of orders for medically unnecessary orthotic braces and genetic testing for Medicare beneficiaries she never spoke to, examined, or treated. As part of the scheme, telemarketing companies would contact Medicare beneficiaries to convince them to accept orthotic braces and genetic tests and would then send pre-filled orders for these products to Hernandez, who signed them, attesting that she had examined or treated the patients. However, she had never spoken with many of the patients, and she often had others, including non-licensed individuals, sign her name to fraudulent orders. Hernandez also falsified information in the orders about beneficiaries’ symptoms and injuries.

During the period of the conspiracy, Hernandez ordered more cancer genetic tests for Medicare beneficiaries than any other provider in the nation. In 2020, when Medicare expanded its telemedicine coverage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hernandez also billed Medicare for thousands of telemedicine visits she never performed, routinely billing over 24 hours of telemedicine in a single day. Hernandez personally pocketed approximately $1.6 million in the scheme, which she used to purchase expensive cars, jewelry, home renovations, and travel.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Deputy Inspector General for Investigations Christian J. Schrank of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), and Assistant Director Michael Nordwall of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division made the announcement.

HHS-OIG and the FBI Miami Field Office investigated the case.

Assistant Chief Kate Payerle and Trial Attorney Andrea Savdie of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted the case.

The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s efforts to combat health care fraud through the Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program. Since March 2007, this program, currently comprised of nine strike forces operating in 27 federal districts, has charged more than 5,400 defendants who collectively have billed federal health care programs and private insurers more than $27 billion. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with HHS-OIG, are taking steps to hold providers accountable for their involvement in health care fraud schemes.

328,Pharmaceutical Company Ultragenyx Agrees to Pay $6 Million for Allegedly Paying Kickbacks to Induce Claims for Its Drug Crysvita,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/pharmaceutical-company-ultragenyx-agrees-pay-6-million-allegedly-paying-kickbacks-induce,"Pharmaceutical company Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Ultragenyx) has agreed to pay $6 million to resolve allegations that it caused the submission of false claims to Medicare and Medicaid, in violation of the False Claims Act, by paying for free genetic tests, plus a separate fee to receive test result information for marketing purposes, to collectively induce prescriptions of its drug Crysvita and referrals of health care providers (HCPs) to Ultragenyx for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of Crysvita.

Ultragenyx is a pharmaceutical manufacturer with a principal place of business in California that manufactures Crysvita. Crysvita is an FDA-approved drug to treat X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) in adult and pediatric patients six months of age and older. XLH is a rare inherited disorder characterized by low levels of phosphate in the blood, which can lead to weak bones and, in many instances, may require a genetic test to definitively diagnose.

Ultragenyx understood that, in some cases, a positive genetic test for a genetic mutation consistent with XLH would be required for an insurer (including Medicare or Medicaid) to pay for a patient’s prescription for Crysvita, or for a healthcare provider (HCP) to make a definitive diagnosis of XLH and prescribe Crysvita. Thus, Ultragenyx entered into an arrangement with a genetic testing laboratory (Laboratory), whereby Ultragenyx paid the Laboratory to conduct genetic tests — at no cost to HCPs or patients — and provide the results to the HCP. Ultragenyx referred to this program as its “sponsored” XLH testing program and Ultragenyx sales personnel discussed the XLH testing program with HCPs and delivered order forms for the tests to HCP offices.

Ultragenyx separately paid the Laboratory to provide the test results to Ultragenyx, including the name of the HCP who ordered the test, a de-identified patient ID number, the date the test was ordered and — once ready — the test result itself (collectively, Results Reports). Ultragenyx used the Results Reports, in part, for marketing purposes to find potential Crysvita patients and their HCPs. Until April 2022, Ultragenyx received Results Reports and disseminated this information to its sales force with instructions to make sales calls for Crysvita to HCPs who ordered a test or, in particular, who had a patient with a positive test result. Ultragenyx’s sales force followed up with HCPs regarding test results. The United States contends that, as a result of these actions, Ultragenyx caused the submission of false claims to Medicare and Medicaid by paying kickbacks 1) to beneficiaries in the form of free genetic tests to induce their purchase of Medicare or Medicaid-reimbursed Crysvita and 2) to the Laboratory for the Results Reports to induce the referral to Ultragenyx of HCPs to whom Ultragenyx could market Crysvita.

As part of the settlement, Ultragenyx admitted and accepted responsibility for certain facts providing the basis of the settlement.

“The department is committed to protecting the integrity of federal health care programs and the medical care received by their beneficiaries,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division. “A primary focus of this effort is the pursuit of kickback schemes that can allow third parties, such as pharmaceutical manufactures, to insert themselves into the doctor-patient relationship and potentially undermine the objectivity of treatment decisions by physicians and patients.

“Kickbacks, in whatever form, have no business in our federal healthcare system” said Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy for the District of Massachusetts. “We are always on the lookout for financial kickbacks that can improperly influence medical decisions, undermine patient care and cause waste to federal healthcare programs. As medical practices evolve, our office is committed to ferreting out improper financial kickbacks of any permutation.”

“Kickback arrangements designed to improperly influence medical decisions will always be an investigative priority for our agency,” said Special Agent in Charge Roberto Coviello of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “The goals of our continued enforcement in this area are to protect the integrity of taxpayer-funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and to curb schemes that can inappropriately manipulate the health care choices of patients and their doctors.”

“The FBI and its partners will not stand by when a pharmaceutical company illegally takes advantage of our health care system,” said Executive Assistant Director Timothy Langan of the FBI’s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. “Those who engage in activity that violates the False Claims Act must face the consequences of their actions. As we strive to protect the American people, we will not stop working to combat healthcare fraud.”

The allegations resolved by the settlement agreement were, in part, originally brought in a case filed under the whistleblower, or qui tam, provision of the False Claims Act. The case is captioned United States ex rel. Ruggiero v. Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Inc. (D. Mass.) (No. 1:21-cv-11176-ADB). The False Claims Act permits private parties to sue for fraud on behalf of the United States and to share in any recovery. The act also permits the government to intervene in such actions, as the government did, in part, in this case. Of the total $6 million recovery, approximately $5.8 million constitutes a recovery for Medicare and the federal share of Medicaid and approximately $200,000 constitutes a recovery for State Medicaid programs. The whistleblower will receive approximately $1.07 million from the federal portion of the recovery.

The government’s pursuit of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement can be reported to HHS at 800‑HHS‑TIPS (800-447-8477).

The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts, with investigative support from HHS-OIG and the FBI’s Boston Field Office.

This matter was handled by Senior Counsel for Health Care Fraud Augustine Ripa and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian LaMacchia and Diane Seol for the District of Massachusetts.

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability."
329,"Justice Department Secures Agreement with Tampa, Florida, to Resolve Discrimination Allegations Related to Its Parental Leave Policy",https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-tampa-florida-resolve-discrimination-allegations,"The Justice Department announced today that it secured a settlement agreement with the City of Tampa, Florida, to resolve the department’s lawsuit alleging that Tampa discriminated against its male employees who sought parental leave by denying them the same level of parental leave it offered to its female employees.

The alleged discrimination resulted in a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII is a federal statute that prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion and sex, including pregnancy policies, and prohibits retaliation against employees for opposing discriminatory employment practices.

“Providing paid parental leave to employees is a significant benefit that many families rely on so that they can take care of their children,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This agreement sends a clear message that in providing paid or unpaid parental leave, employers must guarantee that those benefits are provided without reliance on presumptions about which parent can be the primary caregiver. The Justice Department is steadfast in its commitment to enforce federal civil rights laws and ensure that employers provide all employees leave benefits without discrimination.”

“Employers must grant parental leave benefits regardless of sex,” said U.S. Attorney Roger Handberg for the Middle District of Florida. “The resolution achieved in this case is a demonstration of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s assurance to the community that employment discrimination based on a protected class, including sex, will not be tolerated.”

According to the complaint, the City of Tampa adopted a parental leave policy from February 2017 to December 2018 that in practice barred male employees from using up to 320 hours of parental leave available to female employees for the purpose of serving as “primary caregivers” of a new child. Instead, Tampa granted male employees only 80 hours of parental leave as “secondary caregivers,” even if they were actually the primary caregiver for the family’s new child. In the complaint, the Justice Department states that about 150 male employees were impacted by the parental leave policy and approved for secondary caregiver leave of up to 80 hours.

According to the complaint, at least 10 male employees formally requested primary caregiver leave and were denied the leave because of their sex, regardless of how much evidence they provided to Tampa to show that they were acting as the primary caregiver for the child, while others were discouraged from applying for primary caregiver leave by their supervisors or officials with the City’s Human Resources department. As the complaint states, men were consistently denied primary caregiver leave status, while Tampa regularly granted female caregivers the full 320 hours of primary caregiver leave.

Under the proposed consent decree, which is subject to court approval, Tampa will credit up to 240 hours of additional leave time to each of the male employees who would have taken primary caregiver parental leave if it had been available to them under the policy. Tampa will also pay the impacted employees collectively $300,000 in compensation. The consent decree also requires Tampa to adopt new policies and procedures, including a new parental leave policy that does not discriminate based on sex, and to provide its employees training on these new policies.

The United States’ complaint is based on a charge of discrimination filed with the Miami District Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) by one of Tampa’s employees impacted by the parental leave policy, Jeffrey Burger. The EEOC investigated and found reasonable cause to believe that Tampa violated Title VII. After unsuccessful conciliation efforts, the EEOC referred it to the Justice Department as an enforcement action.

“Parental leave policies should not reflect presumptions or stereotypes about gender roles,” said Director Tamra Schweiberger of the EEOC Tampa Field Office. “When it comes to providing leave for bonding with a new child or flexibility in returning to work from that leave, mothers and fathers should be treated equally.”

Trial Attorneys Jeffrey Morrison and Christine Dinan of the Civil Rights Division’s Employment Litigation Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Yohance A. Pettis for the Middle District of Florida handled this case.

The Justice Department’s lawsuit is part of a joint effort to enhance collaboration between the Department and the EEOC in the vigorous enforcement of Title VII. More information about the EEOC’s jurisdiction is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov. Additional information regarding caregiver discrimination is available in the EEOC technical assistance document found at EEOC Releases Information about Employment Discrimination Against Caregivers | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

The enforcement of Title VII and other federal employment discrimination laws is a top priority of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

330,Commerce Department Announces Industrial Base Survey of American Semiconductor Supply Chain,https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/12/commerce-department-announces-industrial-base-survey-american,"Commerce takes action to bolster the U.S. semiconductor supply chain and protect U.S. national security

Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it will launch a new survey in January 2024 that will serve as a foundation for continued analysis of the capabilities and challenges of the broader U.S. semiconductor supply chain and national defense industrial base. The intent of the survey is to identify how U.S. companies are sourcing current-generation and mature-node semiconductors, also known as legacy chips. This analysis will inform U.S. policy to bolster the semiconductor supply chain, promote a level playing field for legacy chip production, and reduce national security risks posed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

“Legacy chips are essential to supporting critical U.S. industries, like telecommunications, automotive and the defense industrial base. Addressing non-market actions by foreign governments that threaten the U.S. legacy chip supply chain is a matter of national security,” said Secretary Gina Raimondo. “Over the last few years, we’ve seen potential signs of concerning practices from the PRC to expand their firms’ legacy chip production and make it harder for U.S. companies to compete. To get ahead of these concerns, the Department of Commerce is taking proactive measures to assess the U.S. semiconductor supply chain by collecting data from U.S. companies on the sourcing of their legacy chips. Government alone cannot create and sustain a robust supply chain – we need industry at the table. This survey will empower the Department with the data we need to inform our next steps in building strong, diverse, and resilient semiconductor supply chains.”

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within Commerce will launch the survey, which focuses on the use and sourcing of PRC-manufactured legacy chips in the supply chains of critical U.S. industries. The survey is a response to findings in a Congressionally-mandated report also released this week, which assesses the capabilities of the U.S. microelectronics industrial base to support U.S. national defense. That report was prepared pursuant to Section 9904 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.

Companies headquartered in the U.S. account for approximately half of global semiconductor revenue but face intense competition supported by increasing subsidies from foreign governments. The 9904 report recommends that the United States promotes a level playing field for semiconductor manufacturing in the United States through support for domestic fabrication, assembly, test, and package capabilities, continued protection of U.S. technology through export controls, and further assessment of potential non-market behavior. BIS completed the data collection in May 2023 and developed the 9904 report and recommendations in coordination with the CHIPS Program Office. The full study directed under Section 9904 is available on BIS’s website."

Date of action: Dec. 8, 2023

Type of action: Order granting Department of Labor’s motion to intervene

Court: U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains, New York

Defendants: Berkshire Nursery & Supply Corp.

Rosa Contracting Inc.

Rosa Land Tech Design Inc.

Jesus Flores

Background: In October 2022, two employees sued their former employers in a private action for claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, as well as various state laws. The employers recently sought to depose the former employee plaintiffs. The department, which has its own pending litigation and investigation involving two of the private defendants, learned that the employers intended to interrogate the plaintiffs about their communications with the department. Because such inquiry could result in the identification of individuals who communicated or cooperated with department investigators, department counsel requested to attend the depositions and ultimately, filed a motion to intervene in the private suit to protect such privileged information. In particular, the government informant’s privilege protects the identities of individuals who communicate with the department.

Resolution: On Dec. 8, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the department’s motion to intervene in the private action so that the department could protect privileges such as the informant’s privilege. Since the court granted the motion to intervene, the department’s Regional Solicitor’s Office in New York has attended the depositions and objected to questions that may have elicited information that would reveal informants’ identities. The private litigation is ongoing.

Quote: “The U.S. Department of Labor protects the identities of workers who provide information to the department to the greatest extent possible,” said Regional Solicitor of Labor Jeffrey S. Rogoff in New York. “Our intervention in a private Fair Labor Standards Act action shows that we will take necessary steps to protect the confidentiality of those communications. We are pleased the court recognized the department’s interests.”

Significance: The procedural step of moving to intervene in a private FLSA action was taken to ensure that the identities of any informants who may have cooperated with the department during its investigation of Berkshire Nursery & Supply Corp. and Jesus Flores are not revealed, thereby protecting workers from unlawful retaliation. Notably, the court found that the department’s enforcement framework relies on its ability to protect the identities of informants, and that the department had a concrete interest in private proceedings where the identities of these informants could be revealed during the discovery process.

The department’s Wage and Hour Division’s White Plains office is currently investigating two of the defendants in the private suit: Berkshire Nursery & Supply Corp., a Patterson nursery and garden supply business, and its president, Jesus Flores. In January 2023, the department brought its own lawsuit against Berkshire Nursery and Supply Corp. and Jesus Flores, alleging that they had obstructed the department’s investigation and retaliated against employees, and successfully sought a temporary restraining order to immediately enjoin such conduct. Ultimately, the court entered a consent preliminary injunction, which is still in effect. Both the department’s investigation and its lawsuit are ongoing.

OSHA proposal seeks to update 1980s ‘Fire Brigades’ standard

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced that its Occupational Safety and Health Administration will publish a proposal in January 2024 to update an existing standard and expand safety and health protections for emergency responders, including firefighters, emergency medical service providers and technical search and rescue workers. President Biden is committed to protecting our emergency responders, the same way they protect us every day—and this proposed rule is a critical step to ensure their safety.

OSHA will issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to modernize the agency’s “Fire Brigades” standard — first published in 1980 — as its protections for a narrow set of industrial and private firefighters have become outdated.

Currently, OSHA regulations protect emergency responders’ safety and health in a patchwork of decades-old, hazard-specific standards. Not designed as comprehensive emergency response standards, they fail to address the full range of job hazards faced by today’s emergency responders. The newly named “Emergency Response” standard updates safety and health protections in line with national consensus standards for a broad range of workers exposed to hazards that arise during and after fires and other emergencies.

The proposal will include major changes for protective clothing and equipment and significant improvements in safety and health practices that the industry generally accepts as standard procedures.

“Emergency responders are critical workers in all of our communities, and they deserve protections that keep up with today’s industry practices,” said Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. “We are proposing much-needed updates that will expand protections for emergency workers and bring our standards closer to common industry procedures.”

The proposed rule requires employers to obtain baseline medical screening for all emergency responders and ensure continued medical surveillance for responders when they are exposed to the byproducts of fires and explosions more than 15 times annually. The proposal also includes a variety of other requirements to better protect both workers whose primary job is emergency response and those whose emergency response duties are in addition to their regular daily work duties.

333,"Department of Labor completed impact inspections at 14 mines with histories of repeated safety, health violations in November 2023",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20231221,"Department of Labor completed impact inspections at 14 mines with histories of repeated safety, health violations in November 2023

Inspections resulted in 52 significant, substantial and 6 unwarrantable failure findings

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor announced today that its Mine Safety and Health Administration completed impact inspections at 14 mines in 10 states in November 2023, issuing 184 violations and one safeguard.

The agency began impact inspections after an April 2010 explosion in West Virginia at the Upper Big Branch Mine killed 29 miners.

To date, MSHA’s impact inspections in 2023 have identified 2,491 violations, including 706 significant and substantial and 52 unwarrantable failure findings. An S&S violation is one that is reasonably likely to cause a reasonably serious injury or illness. Violations designated as unwarrantable failures occur when an inspector finds aggravated conduct that constitutes more than ordinary negligence.

The agency conducts impact inspections at mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to poor compliance history; previous accidents, injuries, and illnesses; and other compliance concerns. Of the 184 violations MSHA identified in November, 52 were evaluated as S&S and six had unwarrantable failure findings. The agency completed these inspections at mines in Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

“The November 2023 impact inspection results show yet again the value of these inspections in identifying violations of mandatory safety and health standards,” said Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health Chris Williamson. “But it is troubling that the findings of November’s impact inspections closely mirror those of others in 2023.”

“The Mine Act makes clear that the ultimate responsibility for the safety and health of miners lies with mine operators. MSHA will continue to publish the results of impact inspections and urges mine operators to take proactive steps to make certain they are protecting miners from injuries or fatalities. We are all troubled by the mining industry’s trend of increased fatalities this year. MSHA has worked to leverage all the tools Congress gave the agency – outreach, education and enforcement – to protect miners and will continue to look for ways to work together with the entire mining community in reversing this trend,” Williamson added.

The Hazen Mine in Hazen, North Dakota, was among the mines MSHA inspected in November. Selected given its enforcement history, the mine is operated by North Dakota Proppant. The inspection identified 30 violations, including 10 S&S and five unwarrantable failure findings. Specifically, MSHA inspectors found the following conditions existed at the Hazen mine:

Failure to provide and maintain guarding around moving machine parts. Overall, inspectors cited inadequate guarding most frequently during this inspection. The lack of appropriate protection from moving machine parts can contribute to fatal mine accidents and disabling injuries to miners.

Failure to provide safe access to working areas was the second-most frequently cited violation during this inspection. These conditions exposed miners to potential fall hazards. Earlier in 2023, MSHA issued a safety alert regarding the dangers associated with working at heights. The agency continues to remind operators and contractors of best practices for preventing falls, such as designing an effective fall prevention and protection program as well as providing task training.

Other serious violations including housekeeping violations, lack of berms around water, and equipment defects that were not corrected in a timely manner.

334,Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Action to Increase Naloxone Access in Federal Facilities Across the Nation,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/12/21/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-increase-naloxone-access-federal-facilities-across-nation.html,"Latest action advances President Biden’s Unity Agenda efforts to beat the overdose epidemic,
continuing commitment to a whole-of-society effort to prevent fatal overdoses, reduce
stigmatization associated with addiction, and save lives.
Washington, D.C. – Today, in support of President Biden’s Unity Agenda efforts to beat the overdose epidemic, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) announced new guidance recommending that all federal facilities across the nation include overdose reversal medications in their safety stations on site. The recommendation will make life-saving medications like naloxone more readily available in case of an emergency situation.
“Far too many lives are being lost to overdose. Fortunately, we know what it takes to save people. Safety stations save lives,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We must continue to do everything we can to make sure the necessary tools are quickly and easily available so anyone can respond to an emergency situation - anytime, anywhere. It's about empowering everyone to play a role in saving lives when it counts the most.”
“Today, we are taking the historic step to recommend that every federal facility across the nation has lifesaving overdose reversal medications like naloxone on site,” said White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Dr. Rahul Gupta. “Under President Biden’s leadership, we have worked to make overdose reversal medication more accessible and available than ever before. These lifesaving medications should be as readily available as fire extinguishers or defibrillators in all public spaces, from schools, to housing communities, to restaurants, retail, and other businesses.  And now, as the nation’s largest employer, we are leading by example. President Biden’s Unity Agenda calls for all Americans to come together to beat the overdose epidemic, and the private sector has a critical role to play in saving lives and ending this crisis.”
“Saving lives is at the very core of the HHS Overdose Prevention Strategy and that’s why it’s so important for federal facilities to have naloxone and other opioid overdose reversal medications readily available,"" said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. “Taking this step ensures these lifesaving medications are accessible, and protects the millions of Americans that work in and visit these facilities every year.”
The updated guidelines expand the concept of an automated external defibrillators (AED) program by introducing the “safety station,” which would enable anyone located within a federal facility to access the necessary tools quickly and easily to respond to an emergency situation. Under the new guidance, anywhere that an AED was previously located can and should be converted to a safety station. Each safety station is recommended to include an AED and supporting equipment at a minimum. It is now highly recommended that each station also includes either a bystander-empowered opioid reversal agent or hemorrhagic control component, or both.
Expanding access to overdose reversal medications is a key part of President Biden’s National Drug Control Strategy - PDF, and the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action over the past three years to deliver on this priority. The Biden-Harris Administration has invested historic amounts of funding in the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant program for states and Tribes to make overdose reversal medications available to their residents at no cost. HHS’s Overdose Prevention Strategy, which is designed to address the overdose crisis by increasing access to the full continuum of care and services for people who use substances that cause overdose, including increasing availability of overdose reversal medications. Using federal SOR grant dollars, states have purchased nearly 9 million naloxone kits and helped reverse more than 500,000 overdoses. Earlier this year, the FDA also approved certain naloxone nasal sprays for non-prescription, over-the-counter use in March and July. Now, for the first time ever, naloxone is available for over-the-counter purchase at grocery stores and pharmacies across the country. Other opioid overdose reversal medications are also available with a prescription and may be covered by health insurers.
Today’s announcement also delivers on President Biden’s Unity Agenda, which focuses on issues where all Americans can come together and make progress for the nation. During his first State of the Union Address, President Biden announced beating the overdose epidemic as one of the four pillars of his Unity Agenda. Since then, the Administration has worked to strengthen not only the whole-of-government response, but the whole-of-society response to address this public health and public safety crisis head-on. Earlier this month, ONDCP, HHS, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) called on public health departments and health care systems to partner with housing providers, community development organizations, and other housing agencies to help expand access to naloxone and other life-saving overdose reversal medications in the communities they serve, noting the critical role housing providers play in ensuring that all public spaces have lifesaving medications on hand and people are prepared to use it. Last month, ONDCP and the U.S. Department of Education called on schools and educators to have overdose reversal medications on site and ensure their students and faculty are prepared to use it in the event of a drug poisoning or overdose to save lives.
As naloxone became available for over-the-counter purchase for the first time ever earlier this summer, ONDCP Director Dr. Rahul Gupta joined HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and senior HHS leadership for a live naloxone demonstration event to educate HHS staff and the public on the importance of increasing awareness, reducing stigmatization, and expanding access to lifesaving overdose reversal medications.
Over the past three years, the Administration has taken historic action to increase access to this lifesaving tool, including:
Convening U.S. drug manufacturers who have FDA-approved overdose reversal medication products to discuss ways to increase access and affordability to save more lives;
Launching a campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl and the lifesaving effects of naloxone with the Ad Council;
Facilitating the availability of naloxone to harm reduction organizations directly from manufacturers and distributors to support expanded public access to this critical medicine.
Supporting states through enhanced technical assistance, policy academies, and convenings to ensure existing State Opioid Response funds are used to saturate hard-hit communities with naloxone;
Delivering funds directly to states so they can purchase opioid overdose reversal medications; and
Calling - PDF for an additional $100 million for harm reduction services like naloxone in the President’s FY24 budget request."

Washington, D.C.- Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announced the first updated guidelines for safety stations in federal facilities in the past 15 years. This expands the existing recommendation beyond automated external defibrillators (AED) to also include opioid reversal agents such as naloxone and hemorrhagic control such as Stop the Bleed® (STB).
Overdose reversal medications that can reverse an opioid-involved overdose, including a fentanyl-involved overdose, can be found in many schools, libraries, and other community institutions and should be readily available in and around federal buildings. Hemorrhagic control provides immediate post-injury care in the recognition and treatment of a bleeding emergency. Access to bleeding control equipment is beneficial to occupants of federal facilities.
“These updated guidelines are based on the best available science and represent a flexible and collective response as a federal family,” said HHS Assistant Secretary for Health ADM Rachel L. Levine. “An emergency can happen in any setting, including our workplaces. We all need to be prepared to save a life anytime, anywhere.”
“Today’s actions represent a federal partnership that not only provides the framework for expanding access to additional life-saving equipment in federal facilities, but also offers the acquisition resources to develop and maintain those safety stations,” said GSA Associate Administrator for Government-wide Policy Krystal Brumfield, the agency’s Chief Acquisition Officer. “These updated safety stations can make a critical difference, and help our workforce get home to their families if there is ever an emergency.”
The updated guidelines expand the concept of an AED program by introducing the “safety station,” which would enable anyone located within a federal facility to access the necessary tools quickly and easily to respond to an emergency situation. Under the new recommendation, anywhere that an AED was previously located can and should be converted to a safety station.
Each safety station is recommended to include an AED and supporting equipment at a minimum. It is now highly recommended that each station also includes either a bystander-empowered opioid reversal agent or hemorrhagic control component, or both.
The primary purpose of these guidelines is to provide a general framework for establishing a design process for safety station programs in Federal facilities. A secondary purpose is to familiarize federal agencies with the three modular bystander-empowered components and the essential elements associated with each component of such a program.
The design of a safety station program for any federal facility will be unique and depends on many factors, including the population demographics of the facility, the size and location of the facility and the surrounding area. These guidelines are intended to provide a foundation upon which individually tailored programs are established and maintained.
The safety station program is voluntary and not mandatory for federal facilities. The costs and expenses to establish and operate a safety station program are the responsibility of the federal agency or agencies sponsoring the program.

336,U.S. Department of Energy Top Clean Energy Accomplishments in 2023,https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-top-clean-energy-accomplishments-2023,"DOE Concludes 2023 by Celebrating Billions in Historic Clean Energy Investments, Successful Energy Cost Saving Programs, and Workforce Training Initiatives that will Boost our Clean Energy Economy 




WASHINGTON, D.C. — In 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) made monumental strides in advancing the clean energy goals of the Biden-Harris Administration. Through hundreds of funding announcements to make clean energy more accessible in every state, investments in scientific research, historic groundbreakings, and celebratory ribbon cuttings, DOE has been hard at work to combat the climate crisis, lower costs for American families, and pave a path for our clean energy future.Here are a few of our top accomplishments of 2023:  Launching America’s First Clean Hydrogen Hubs: In October, DOE announced $7 billion in investments to launch seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) across the nation and accelerate the commercial-scale deployment of low-cost, clean hydrogen—a valuable energy product that can be produced with zero or near-zero carbon emissions and is crucial to meeting the President’s climate and energy security goals. Funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the seven H2Hubs will kickstart a national network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers, and connective infrastructure while supporting the production, storage, delivery, and end-use of clean hydrogen. This transformative Federal investment will be matched by recipients to leverage a total of nearly $50 billion to strengthen local economies, create and maintain high-quality jobs—especially those that support worker organizing and collective bargaining—and slash harmful emissions that jeopardize public health and pollute local ecosystems. The states selected are West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, California, Texas, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and Montana.Making Historic Investments in the Grid: This year, DOE made the largest federal investment in the grid in history. Through more than $8 billion in grid investments including $3.5 billion to modernize and strengthen the grid through the Grid Resilience Innovation Partnership (GRIP) Program, $1.3 billion in transmission investments through the Transmission Facilitation Program that aims to add 3.5 GW of additional grid capacity and create more than 13,000 direct and indirect jobs, over $750 million in formula grants to states, tribes, and territories to boost grid resilience, and $37 million in hydropower incentives. These investments will help to ensure that the families can keep their lights on during and after extreme weather, wildfire, and natural disasters.Strengthening Commitment to Puerto Rico: From January through November, Secretary Granholm set out on a Community Engagement Tour, a series of town-hall style events coordinated with Hispanic Federation where residents and community members voiced the unique needs and priorities of their communities. During the Tour, Secretary Granholm visited nearly 20 communities in Puerto Rico, speaking to homeowners and community leaders about their clean energy needs. In July 2023, DOE announced the first funding opportunity under the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund for $450 million to support the installation of up to 40,000 residential solar and battery storage systems across Puerto Rico, with a focus on the most vulnerable households and communities. Building a Convenient and Reliable National EV Charging Network: In December, Ohio and New York marked the first states in the nation to open electric vehicle (EV) charging stations funded through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. These new charging stations will fill gaps in charging, add capacity, and boost the reliability of our nation’s fast charging network. Other new charging station launches will follow in 2024, with stations already under construction in Maine, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. In May, DOE, through the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, launched the National Charging Experience Consortium, a new effort led by DOE’s national laboratories works to rapidly develop solutions that ensure a reliable and frictionless charging experience for all Americans. The development and maintenance of a robust charging network will create jobs and stimulate economic growth in local communities, while public and private investments in EV charging infrastructure will catalyze technological innovation across multiple economic sectors.Lowering Costs for Americans:  The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program (EECBG)—designed to assist states, local governments, and Tribes in implementing strategies to reduce energy use, to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and to improve energy efficiency—made substantial progress through EECBG’s formula grant program, making $550 million available to more than 2,700 eligible states, local governments, territories, and Tribes. In addition, the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) Retrofit and Readiness team had a busy year in 2023, reviewing and approving over 160 State Plans and deploying $3.17 billion in WAP funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). In October 2023, DOE announced the launch of the Affordable Home Energy Shot™, a new initiative focused on the research, development, and demonstration of clean energy solutions to decarbonize and deliver energy and cost savings for affordable homes. The Shot will reduce the cost of energy-efficient retrofits in affordable homes by 50% and decrease residents’ energy costs by at least 20% within a decade.Prioritizing Environmental Justice: In October, DOE reached a significant milestone in its journey toward achieving a just and equitable energy economy—changing the name of the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity to the Office of Energy Justice and Equity to better reflect DOE’s commitment to energy justice and tackling the climate crisis through equity-centered solutions. This year, DOE, along with the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, launched the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program, which received more than 46,000 applications in its first month. This program, supported by the Inflation Reduction Act, addresses the need to expand access to cost-saving clean energy projects in underserved communities through a groundbreaking tax incentive for solar and wind projects across the country. DOE also invested over $75 million in Tribal communities across the nation, including Tribal Colleges and Universities, American Indian, and Alaska Native communities, to expand their access to clean energy technologies, reduce and stabilize energy costs, and improve Tribal energy sovereignty.Training the Next Generation of the Clean Energy Workforce: In June, DOE announced a $13.5 million investment, primarily funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, in 12 training partnerships to expand the solar energy workforce in underserved and underrepresented communities, as well as create career pathways with thousands of good-paying jobs. DOE also released $220 million for grants to support the training of a qualified and diverse clean energy workforce through programs including $150 million from the State- Based Home Energy Efficiency Contractor Training formula program prepares local and regional clean energy workforce professionals to decarbonize residential buildings through energy efficiency solutions and $40 million from the Energy Auditor Training Program which trains individuals to conduct energy audits of commercial and residential buildings to save customers money on their energy bills, and reduce pollution from building energy use. In conjunction with National Apprenticeship week, DOE also announced over $40 million for Industrial Assessment Centers and Building Training and Assessment Centers to expand training opportunities for in-demand, high-quality jobs while identifying opportunities for organizations to save energy, improve productivity, and reduce waste. Accelerating Domestic Manufacturing and Boosting Our Supply Chain: As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, DOE has been committed to supercharging domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. This year DOE made countless investments in our domestic supply chain including $5.5 billion to boost domestic production of advanced batteries, battery materials, and electrified vehicles; over $13 billion in Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program conditional commitments to support the advanced technology vehicles supply chain; $169 million to accelerate electric heat pump manufacturing at 15 sites across the country; and over $390 million to expand solar, wind, and vehicle technology domestic manufacturing.Leading in Scientific Advancements: As the world enters a new era of technology, DOE emerged as a key government player by launching a new departmental element, the Office of Critical and Emerging Technology (CET), to ensure U.S. investments in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, quantum computing, and semiconductors leverage the Department’s wide range of assets and expertise to accelerate progress in these critical sectors. DOE also enabled an AI non-production workspace known as the Discovery Zone. The Generative AI Discovery Zone is a sandbox environment to provide DOE AI researchers and developers a platform to experiment with Google’s Generative AI tools using public data. In November, DOE’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) team, led by researchers and computational scientists across eight DOE national laboratories, broke new barriers with The Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model Running on the Frontier Exascale System (SCREAM) which performed an unprecedented global climate model simulation on the world’s first exascale supercomputer, Frontier. This year the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Lab not only replicated but exceeded its groundbreaking fusion ignition of December 2022, when it produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it.Keeping DOE-Owned Lands Clean: In July, DOE announced the Cleanup to Clean Energy initiative, an innovative effort to repurpose parts of DOE-owned lands—portions of which were previously used in the nation’s nuclear weapons program—into the sites of clean-energy generation. Cleanup to Clean Energy will help achieve President Biden’s ambitious climate goals and the directive in Executive Order 14057 for agencies to use their properties for the development of new clean electricity generation.

337,Different faces but all suffering intimate partner violence,https://news.va.gov/126929/different-suffering-intimate-partner-violence/,"A preacher’s wife. A young mother. A soldier. These brave individuals joined a survivors’ panel to share their experiences and recovery stories during a Domestic Violence Awareness and Intimate Partner Violence Awareness summit sponsored by the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks.

According to recent studies, one-in-three women and one-in-four men in the general population report experiencing intimate partner violence. In addition, one in five women who experience intimate partner violence threaten, attempt or die by suicide. Related studies suggest Veterans of both sexes are up to twice as likely as non-Veterans to report experiencing intimate partner violence during their lifetimes.

“There were times I just wanted to give up and didn’t care anymore because I was so ashamed. I had guilt and felt so broken and betrayed by ones I loved,” said Tiffany, who was a victim of Military Sexual Trauma (MST) and intimate partner violence while serving in the military. “But I learned from my VA counselors not to judge myself by what someone else did to me. Trauma may happen to you, but it can never define you.”

“Relationships are at the core of everything.”

These distressing facts are why the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks and VA’s Suicide Prevention Office recently collaborated with several community partners on an initiative to educate and support both the survivors and perpetrators of this type of trauma.

“Relationships are at the core of everything,” said Andrea Predl, Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program coordinator. “Intimate partner violence can be different for different people. It can be verbal or psychological aggression, physical or sexual violence. It can also involve excessive control, coercion or stalking between former or current intimate partners.”

Pictured above, Predl (left) led a survivors’ panel sharing experiences and recovery stories during the Domestic Violence Awareness and Intimate Partner Violence Awareness summit.

Every VAMC has an Intimate Partner Violence Assistance program or coordinator

During Domestic Violence Awareness and Intimate Partner Violence Awareness Month, the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks held resource fairs, a White Ribbon commitment event and a summit in Fort Smith to bring awareness, education and resources to Veterans, family members and friends. During the summit, Mental health experts, community partners and survivors discussed warning signs, how to get help, available resources and recovery stories.

While intimate partner violence does not always lead to a mental health or substance use, studies have shown that those who experience it and other traumatic events are more likely to develop anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress, misuse substances and have thoughts of suicide.

“Every VA medical center has an Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program or coordinator who ensures that resources and services are available for Veterans and their partners who are impacted by IPV,” Predl said. “Many VA clinicians and staff have received specialized training related to IPV services and interventions, and are responsive and sensitive to Veteran-specific experiences that can negatively affect relationships.”

Finding support, tools and specialty care

A military combat engineer for 14 years, Tiffany contacted VA for health care and found the support, tools and specialty care she needed.

“VA care has drastically changed my life for the better. With programs like this and people on the other side helping you, I felt there was hope for me. For my fellow Veterans, I encourage you to be open-minded and want to change and heal. I am grateful and blessed because of VA. I am a survivor.”

If you are dealing with MST or intimate partner violence, talk to a VA social worker or health care provider, or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233 (SAFE) or TTY 1−800−787−3224.

338,Video: CPR training for caregivers,https://news.va.gov/126527/video-cpr-training-for-caregivers/,"The VA Caregiver Support Program (CSP) is on a mission to empower caregivers, equipping them with essential lifesaving skills in the form of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

In collaboration with the American Red Cross, CSP launched a Hands-Only CPR training video for caregivers, available on CSP’s national website.

“The Caregiver Support Program remains steadfast in preparing Veterans’ caregivers with CPR skills to act swiftly and effectively in the critical moments following a cardiac arrest,” said Colleen M. Richardson, executive director of CSP. “According to the American Heart Association, being trained to perform CPR can mean the difference between life and death, increasing the survival rate from around 10% to 40% or higher.”

To develop a network of caregivers who can respond effectively when every second counts, CSP is also collaborating with the Simulation Learning, Evaluation, Assessment and Research Network to train CSP staff in the American Heart Association’s Friends and Family CPR model. The pilot phase for this initiative is currently underway at four sites, with the overarching goal of nationwide implementation.

Why CPR training is important

The significance of CPR training cannot be overstated. The 2023 heart disease and stroke statistics show that among the over 356,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred, about 75% to 80% happened at home. When someone goes into cardiac arrest, every second counts. Caregivers trained in CPR can respond quickly and competently, increasing the chance of survival.

Learning CPR empowers us to take immediate action when a loved one’s life hangs in the balance. Proper training allows caregivers to administer those first critical breaths and chest compressions that can make all the difference.

Whether you prefer mastering life-saving CPR techniques through our comprehensive training video or find in-person sessions more effective, we have you covered. Contact your local CSP team to inquire about dates and times for our in-person CPR training sessions. Your journey to acquiring crucial life-saving skills starts here.

About CSP

CSP promotes the health and well-being of Veterans’ caregivers through education, resources, support and services. Every VA facility has a CSP team that provides valuable information about resources to help caregivers stay informed and supported as they support Veterans. More information can be found on CSP’s website and by contacting local CSP teams. To learn more, watch CSP’s SITREP podcast."
339,"VA proposes fee process changes that would allow Veterans, their attorneys, claims representatives to receive fees or benefits faster",https://news.va.gov/127407/va-proposes-fee-process-changes-that-would-allow-veterans-their-attorneys-claims-representatives-to-receive-fees-or-benefits-faster/,"Today, VA proposed updating its fee process in the Federal Register on proposed changes that would allow Veterans, attorneys and claims representatives to more quickly receive their earned fees or benefits.

Veterans and the public have 60 days from today to submit comments on the proposed rule. VA will consider and address the comments in a subsequent final rule that may make these proposed changes final.

Congress authorizes VA to review whether a fee charged to a Veteran or survivor by an attorney or claims representative in a VA benefits case is reasonable. This proposal would ensure the timely resolution of fee disputes by establishing default rules for fee allocation in cases where fees may be payable to two or more representatives or to a representative whose assistance ended before VA granted the claim.

If no one disputes the default allocation, VA will release the fee per the default allocation. If someone disagrees with the default allocation, VA’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) would review the matter and decide on a reasonable fee. OGC’s decision remains appealable to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.

Nevertheless, all a Veteran would need to do to obtain an OGC determination on a reasonable fee is to file a request electronically or by mail with OGC. Visit the Federal Register to read the proposed regulation."
340,FEMA Offers Workshop to Counteract the Effects of Climate Change,https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20231221/fema-offers-workshop-counteract-effects-climate-change,"Guaynabo, Puerto Rico – Landslides and coastal erosion were two of the most frequent impacts suffered by Puerto Rico's municipalities because of Hurricane María in 2017. These and other threats may worsen and increase as the effects of climate change continue to intensify across the Island.

To address this challenge, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), through its Community Assistance - Recovery Support Function (CA-RSF) unit, organized a workshop to advise municipal staff on new tools and strategies that can increase the resilience of their recovery projects by considering climate change variables in their jurisdictions. Emergency planners and managers, among other local officials from the municipalities of Bayamón, Cataño, Ciales, Dorado, Florida, Guaynabo, Manatí, Morovis, Orocovis, San Juan, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Vega Alta and Vega Baja participated in the event.

“Puerto Rico's recovery encompasses many complex and far-reaching issues. Being well educated about climate change will ensure that we are all informed and take timely action to prevent or reverse damage to the extent possible,” said FEMA Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator José G. Baquero.

The workshop brought together experts from the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez Campus (UPRM) Geology Department, the Caribbean Coastal Ocean Observing System (CARICOOS) office, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Adaptation Partnerships Program (CAP). Staff from FEMA's Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation programs provided information on opportunities available to fund projects that address current challenges.

Held in early December, this workshop is one of several that the federal agency organizes as part of the CA-RSF's Regional Recovery Focus Workshop, a recovery planning initiative that is carried out in all areas of the Bureau of Emergency Management and Disaster Administration (NMEAD) on the island. These workshops seek to provide information, answers and possible alternatives to specific problems identified by the municipalities in the event of a disaster. The workshop that took place recently in the municipality of Dorado addressed land use planning and management strategies to address landslides, coastal erosion and other threats associated with climate change.

Topics included how to update land use plans according to climate change and nature-based mitigation measures, an aspect that FEMA works on with applicant recovery projects.

Kenneth S. Hughes, a professor in the UPRM Department of Geology and coordinator of the Storm-induced Landslide Impact Dynamics on the Environment and Society (SLIDES-PR) project, said that “while most landslides are caused by gravity, they can also be caused by rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, groundwater pressure, erosion, destabilization of hillsides as a result of deforestation, cultivation, and construction, among others.” According to Hughes, this can be dangerous when they occur in areas where there are roads and even structures and residences, because of the speed and volume with which they occur.

“Hurricane María was an event that taught us what nature is capable of because all the areas in Puerto Rico that were already facing initial landslide problems became even more complicated. After that, around 70,000 landslides were recorded island wide. This opened a path to learn and prepare for future situations that are often unavoidable,” said the geology expert.

For Hughes, the first step to establish risk mitigation measures is to identify where the vulnerable points and areas are: to know the drainage at the site, the conditions of the infrastructure, where and how the road is built and the state of its drainage system, among other aspects. Mitigation measures will depend on the nature of the site or the construction of the structure or road.

He indicated that “in order to know in real time the possibility of a landslide occurring, the SLIDES project has so far installed 17 monitoring stations throughout the island to measure soil moisture, among other parameters that could help alert about imminent landslide conditions before the event occurs.”

For her part, Patricia Chardón Maldonado, deputy director and technical director of CARICOOS, pointed out that coastal erosion was already affecting the width of our beaches before the ravages left by Hurricane María in Puerto Rico. The hurricane's intense winds and strong waves caused what little sand there was on the beaches to be lost in deep water. Chardón, who is a civil engineer and expert in coastal erosion, explained that several scientific investigations on the island estimate that about one to three miles of beach width has been lost.

“This loss on our beaches is significant because our beaches are not very wide. However, there have been some that have recovered, but others have not because of the significant loss of sand, landslides, collapse of structures near the maritime-terrestrial area and poor planning in construction,” said the expert.

As for mitigation measures, Chardon said that it will depend on the area being worked on. More natural design measures can be used, such as coral barriers, dunes and measures to rehabilitate certain beaches through sand suction, among other options presented at the workshop.

“It is important to keep the economic aspect of the project in mind, but especially to keep the social aspect in mind when implementing any risk mitigation measures,” stressed the environmental expert.

Wanda Crespo, a climate adaptation specialist with NOAA's Regional Integrated Science and Assessment Program, urged local governments to incorporate climate change adaptation and mitigation measures when updating or revising existing plans, “to avoid the investment and time needed to develop new planning initiatives and thus shorten the implementation of recommended actions.” He indicated that it is better to plan “so as not to have to react later”.

At the conclusion of the event, invited directors and staff from the different units shared concerns and sought possible solutions to counteract the situation in their respective regions.

Some of the recovery challenges discussed in previous workshops include recommendations on how to manage deteriorated structures and encumbrances, bank erosion management through nature-based solutions, and storm runoff.

In 2024, FEMA's CA-RSF will continue to coordinate participatory mapping exercises and related efforts with those municipalities within NMEAD's Ceiba and Caguas Emergency Operational Zones.

Six years after Hurricane María, Puerto Rico has over $31.3 billion in FEMA allocations for nearly 10,900 projects that will help spur rebuilding.

344,EPA New England Provides Tips for a Healthier Heating Season,https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-new-england-provides-tips-healthier-heating-season-0,"""Now that winter is upon us, if your family is purchasing a new wood-burning heater, be sure to choose an efficient EPA-certified unit,"" said EPA New England Regional Administrator David W. Cash. ""Modern EPA-certified wood-burning appliances burn cleaner and produce less smoke inside and outside your home, meaning your family and neighbors have cleaner air to breathe. Further, efficient wood-burning appliances burn less wood, saving you both time and money.""Older or inefficient wood heaters emit greater amounts of fine particles and other pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), black carbon, and air toxics, such as benzene. If you smell smoke in your home or consistently see smoke coming out of your chimney, that's an indication that the heater is emitting harmful air pollutants. Exposure to fine particle pollution has been linked to asthma attacks, acute bronchitis, irregular heartbeat, heart attacks, and premature death. Indoor fine-particle pollution levels can affect both your lungs and heart. This may cause breathing problems and exacerbate pre-existing lung conditions. Communities already vulnerable and overburdened are particularly susceptible to indoor wood smoke pollution.Nationwide, there are about 14 million fireplaces, 12.5 million wood stoves, and 814,000 hydronic heaters (outdoor wood boilers) in use as primary or secondary heat sources. Many of these are older wood-fueled appliances that pollute more than newer units. Use of electric heat pumps is a more energy-efficient method to both heat and cool your home. Heat pump technology has improved in recent years and can perform well even in cold climates such as New England.The federal Clean Energy Tax CreditsExit EPA’s website for Consumers covers 30 percent of the cost of heat pumps, capped at $2,000 each year, but resets annually so it can be used for other projects.  In addition to new federal tax credits, the Inflation Reduction Act includes nearly $9 billion for states and tribes for consumer home energy rebate programsExit EPA’s website, including point of sale rebates focused on low and middle income consumers. Finally, check to see if your state offers rebates as there may be additional State incentives for switching to heat pumps. Through these programs, communities will be able to electrify home appliances and perform energy efficient retrofits, such as installation of heat pumps.EPA encourages the use of a heat pump as the primary source of heat. If there is a need for back up heating and you use a wood stove, EPA recommends using an EPA-certified woodstove. To upgrade an old wood stove, see the EPA-certified wood heaters listed at EPA's Burn Wise website. This database also contains information on pellet stoves that are typically the cleanest burning EPA-certified wood heaters and on hydronic heaters, which are generally much less efficient than EPA-certified wood stoves and may produce excessive amounts of smoke that can negatively impact local air quality in your community.Here are some tips from EPA for a healthier heating season:Outdoor fire pits and fireplaces are also popular during the fall and winter. While these fires are a source for cooking, warmth, and recreation, be aware that these are sources of air pollution that can affect the health of your family, neighbors, and community. Please check your local air quality at airnow.gov for steps to take to protect your health during air quality alert days.In addition to replacing older wood stoves with EPA-certified models or alternative heat sources such as heat pumps, EPA encourages the use of energy-efficiency incentives whenever possible.

347,Operation Lone Star Deploys Historic Strategies To Counter Biden’s Open Border Policies,https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/operation-lone-star-deploys-historic-strategies-to-counter-bidens-open-border-policies,"Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard continue to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity between ports of entry.

Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 491,100 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 37,800 criminal arrests, with more than 34,300 felony charges. In the fight against the fentanyl crisis, Texas law enforcement has seized over 450 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.

Texas has also bused:

Over 12,500 migrants to Washington, D.C. since April 2022

Over 31,200 migrants to New York City since August 2022

Over 25,300 migrants to Chicago since August 2022

Over 3,400 migrants to Philadelphia since November 2022

Over 11,800 migrants to Denver since May 18

Over 1,200 migrants to Los Angeles since June 14

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps created by the Biden Administration’s refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden’s open border policies.

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:

Governor Abbott Signs Historic Border Security Measures In Brownsville

On Monday, in front of the Texas border wall in Brownsville, Governor Abbott signed into law a transformative package of border security legislation passed during Special Session #3 and Special Session #4 of the 88th Texas Legislature.

""President Biden’s deliberate inaction has left Texas to fend for itself. Today, I will sign three laws to better protect Texas—and America—from President Biden’s border neglect,"" said Governor Abbott. ""These laws will help stop the tidal wave of illegal entry into Texas, add additional funding to build more border wall, and crackdown on human smuggling.""

WATCH: Texas Expands Migrant Border Strategy To Include Flights To Chicago

On Wednesday, Governor Abbott shared a video on social media announcing the expansion of Texas' border transportation operations to include flights to Chicago. Texas' first migrant flight departed El Paso on Tuesday, December 19 and arrived in Chicago that evening with over 120 migrants.

In April 2022, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to begin the voluntary transportation of migrants to sanctuary cities.

Governor Abbott: Texas Will Hold Biden Administration Accountable On Border

Earlier this week, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the Biden Administration to stop cutting Texas' razor wire, granting Texas’ injunction pending appeal.

Texas will continue to hold President Biden and Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas accountable until they do their jobs to secure the border.

WATCH: Lt. Olivarez Talks Biden's 'Extreme' Open Border Policies

DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez joined Neil Cavuto on Fox News this week where he responded to comments by the Biden Administration criticizing new measures signed into law by Governor Abbott that will enhance Texas' border security efforts.

""The only thing extreme right now are the failed border policies that continue to encourage illegal immigration between ports of entry, [putting] the lives of illegal immigrants in danger by crossing a dangerous river with children and also placing their lives in the hands of smugglers,"" said Lt. Olivarez. ""Right now, the federal government has no solution to this current situation. They refuse to acknowledge that there's a crisis at the border, and [Texas] is having to step in and take on that responsibility by taking historic action.""

WATCH: Lt. Olivarez Details New Border Surge In Eagle Pass

DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez spoke with Lawrence Jones on Fox & Friends to detail the harrowing effects of President Biden's open border policies, using this week's mass migrant surge in Eagle Pass as a recent example.

“""We haven't see this type of flow [of illegal immigration] since we had the Haitian situation back in 2021 in Del Rio,"" said Lt. Olivarez. ""This is not your ordinary border situation. We've moved beyond chaos—this situation has gotten much worse. This is deliberate inaction by the federal government to secure our border.""

WATCH: DPS Troopers Arrest Human Smuggler From Guatemala In Uvalde County

On December 15, DPS troopers stopped a Cadillac Escalade in Uvalde County and discovered seven illegal immigrants being smuggled inside the SUV. The driver, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, was arrested and charged for smuggling of persons. The seven illegal immigrants, two from Guatemala and five from Mexico, were referred to Border Patrol.

WATCH: Lt. Olivarez Highlights Texas' Efforts To Combat Ruthless Mexican Cartels

On Fox News this week, Lt. Olivarez described the dangerous reality of Mexican cartels operating on the Texas-Mexico border. Lt. Olivarez highlighted Texas' recent success to secure Fronton Island in the Rio Grande River to gain operational control and prevent cross-border criminal activity from Mexican cartels.

""In October, there was a piece of land in South Texas—a 170 acre piece of land—that was designated the most dangerous area along the southwest border,"" said Lt. Olivarez. ""We were constantly seeing cartel fire between rival cartels and the Mexican military, and we were finding explosives and cartel members who were actually on that island in the United States heavily armed with tactical gear, long rifles, and explosives. We took that piece of land over thanks to the leadership of Governor Abbott and [Texas General Land Office] Commissioner Dawn Buckingham who gave us complete access of that island.""

WATCH: Texas National Guard Installs Barriers To Stem Eagle Pass Surge

On Monday, the Texas National Guard began installing anti-climb barriers in the Eagle Pass region to deter and repel the recent mass migration encouraged to enter illegally because of President Biden’s open border policies. Cpl. Aaron Barrow, an engineer on Operation Lone Star, describes his experience installing barriers to stop the flow of illegal immigrants coming across the border.

""Today, we're starting to put [anti-climb barriers] up, and then a bunch of [migrants] were coming up behind us, so we did our best to prevent them from coming up,"" said Cpl. Aaron Barrow. ""I've been in three different [areas of operation], and by far this one has been the busiest."""
348,Governor Abbott Grants Clemency To Three Texans Recommended By Texas Board Of Pardons And Paroles,https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-grants-clemency-to-three-texans-recommended-by-texas-board-of-pardons-and-paroles,"Governor Greg Abbott today granted pardons and restoration of civil rights to the following three Texans recommended by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles:

Robert Phillip Marsh, 51, for theft in 1990 (Midland County). Marsh was sentenced to 2 years of deferred adjudication probation.

Heather Christine Sherman, 33, for possession of marijuana in 2010 (Collin County). Sherman was sentenced to three days of jail.

Jerry Lynn Smith, 64, for theft in 1978 (Harris County). Smith was sentenced to pay a $500 fine.



“Having served as a trial court judge, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Attorney General, I have the utmost respect for our legal system and the unique gubernatorial power to grant clemency to Texans looking for a fresh start,” said Governor Abbott. “These three Texans have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to reshape their lives and serve their communities. I thank the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their work to improve our criminal justice system and reduce recidivism in Texas.”

349,Attor­ney Gen­er­al Ken Pax­ton Urges SCO­TUS to Deny Polit­i­cal­ly Moti­vat­ed Peti­tion by Spe­cial Pros­e­cu­tor Jack Smith Against Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump,https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-urges-scotus-deny-politically-motivated-petition-special-prosecutor-jack,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton joined an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of the United States (“SCOTUS”) opposing Special Prosecutor Jack Smith’s petition that requested SCOTUS take up former President Donald Trump’s appeal for presidential immunity before a lower appeals court considers the issue.

Smith’s effort to circumvent the standard appellate process is extraordinarily unusual. To elevate the petition to SCOTUS before a lower court has considered the issue, the petitioner must show a clear public need for immediate action. Smith, representing the United States government, has not demonstrated the urgency he claims justifies this attempt to bypass the ordinary appellate process.

The brief explains: “The United States’ petition repeatedly proclaims—but never explains why—‘[i]t is of imperative public importance that respondent’s claims of immunity be resolved by this Court and that respondent’s trial proceed as promptly as possible if his claim of immunity is rejected.’ That silence is both telling and troubling, suggesting that the United States’ demand for extraordinary and immediate relief is driven by partisan interests, not the public interest.”

350,DPS Reminds Everyone to Make Safety a Priority this Holiday Season,https://www.dps.texas.gov/news/dps-reminds-everyone-make-safety-priority-holiday-season,"AUSTIN – The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) encourages everyone to put safety at the top of their list this holiday season. The Texas Highway Patrol (THP) will conduct its annual Christmas and New Year’s holiday traffic enforcement campaign beginning Dec. 22 and running through the rest of the year. Troopers will be out on the roads looking for people who are speeding, not wearing their seat belts, driving while intoxicated or committing other traffic violations.

“The holidays can be a dangerous time with so many people traveling to and from celebrations,” said DPS Director Steven McCraw. “It’s absolutely critical that drivers pay attention, stay at safe speeds, put their phones down and do not drink and drive. Let’s all do our part to close out the year on a happy and safe note.”

THP will increase enforcement as part Operation CARE (Crash Awareness and Reduction Effort), which runs nationwide from Dec. 22 through Jan. 1. During DPS’ 2022 Christmas and New Year’s enforcement efforts, there were more than 108,400 citations and warnings issued. This included over 9,000 speeding citations; 950 seat belt and child seat violations; 2,303 citations for driving without insurance; 731 felony and fugitive arrests; and 452 citations/warnings for Move Over, Slow Down violations.

DPS offers the following safety tips for the upcoming holiday season:

Don’t drink and drive . Make alternate plans if you are consuming alcohol.

Move Over or Slow Down for police, fire, EMS, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) vehicles and tow trucks stopped on the side of the road with emergency lights activated. Show the same courtesy to fellow drivers who are stopped on the side of the road.

Buckle up everyone in the vehicle — it’s the law.

Slow down , especially in bad weather, heavy traffic, unfamiliar areas or construction zones.

Eliminate distractions while driving, including the use of mobile devices. Texas law prohibits the use of portable wireless devices to read, write or send an electronic message unless the vehicle is stopped.

If you’re using a navigation device or app, have a passenger operate it , so you can keep your eyes on the road.

Keep the Texas Roadside Assistance number stored in your phone. Dial 1-800-525-5555 for any type of assistance. The number can also be found on the back of a Texas Driver License.

Drive defensively , as holiday travel can present additional challenges.

Don’t drive fatigued — allow plenty of time to reach your destination.

On multi-lane roads, use the left lane for passing only . Not only is it courteous and avoids impeding traffic, Texas law requires slower traffic to keep to the right and to use the left lane for passing only (when posted).

Don’t cut in front of large trucks and try not to brake quickly in front of them. They can’t maneuver as easily as passenger vehicles and pickup trucks.

If you can Steer It, Clear It : If you are involved in a non-injury crash and your vehicle can be moved, clear the traffic lanes to minimize traffic impact. Leaving vehicles in a traffic lane increases traffic congestion and leaves those involved with an increased risk of harm or a secondary wreck. On some highways, if you don’t move your vehicle when it’s safe to do so, it’s against the law.

Check your vehicle to make sure it’s properly maintained and always ensure your cargo is secure.

Report road hazards or anything suspicious to the nearest law enforcement agency.

Monitor weather and road conditions wherever you are traveling. For road conditions and closures in Texas, visit Drive Texas .

Additionally, DPS would like to remind Texans to report suspicious activity. The iWatchTexas program is a critical resource for this type of reporting in communities in order to help prevent dangerous attacks. Everyone is urged to download the free iOS or Android mobile app if you haven’t done so already. Tips can be reported via the website, the mobile app or by calling 844-643-2251. All reports are confidential. For information on how to use iWatchTexas, you can view this how-to video.

Remember, iWatchTexas is not for emergencies. If there is an emergency, call 911 immediately.

As you travel, the department also asks travelers to be on the lookout for possible human trafficking. An increase in people on the road and at airports means there is an increased opportunity for the community to spot potential human trafficking activities, report it to law enforcement and potentially save lives. If you are traveling, be observant of others around you and take note of the following possible indicators of human trafficking:

The person appears to be under control of another person either physically (someone else controls the person’s possessions i.e., ID, money, phone) or psychologically (little to no eye contact, unable to speak for themselves or unable to make simple decisions without approval).

The person has little to no awareness of their surroundings including where they are or where they are headed.

The person has untreated illness or infection, visible injuries, appears malnourished or sleep deprived.

The person’s clothing is inappropriate for the weather or environment. The person is dressed in a manner that does not appear age appropriate or makes them appear older.

The person is being transported to and from work by their employer.

The person lives where they work or works excessively long or unusual hours.

The person’s workplace has security measures that are unusual or excessive for the type of business (i.e., boarded or opaque windows, excessive security cameras).

The presence of an indicator does not confirm an occurrence of human trafficking; however, the combination and context of indicators may indicate human trafficking pending law enforcement investigation and you are encouraged to report it.

If you see signs of Human Trafficking while traveling for the holidays, call 911 immediately to report it and be ready to give as many details as possible. You can also make a report on iWatchTexas or call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or text “BeFree” to 233733.

Remember do not endanger yourself or others by intervening or confronting someone you suspect of engaging in human trafficking if it is not safe to do so.

351,How to Maximize Texas' Relationship with our No. 1 Trade Partner,https://www.txbiz.org/post/how-to-maximize-texas-relationship-with-our-no-1-trade-partner,"The global economy is a complex, dynamic and interconnected space, and if a nation or state wants to ensure a robust economy, the importance of healthy trade partnerships cannot be overstated. At the Texas Association of Business’ 2023 Policy Conference, a primary focus of discussion was the immense value Texas’ current trade partnership with Mexico holds.

Gerry Schwebel, the Executive Vice President of the International Bank of Commerce, shared insights on the unprecedented growth that has been occurring recently throughout the Lone Star State, particularly in Central Texas. His perspective highlighted the strategic significance of the I-35 corridor, stretching from Texas into Mexico, as a thriving trade bloc. He also emphasized the need to analyze the substantial investments pouring into the region and continue to utilize and expand the opportunities they offer.

“With that (growth) comes jobs, it comes tier one, tier two, tier three suppliers,” Schwebel said. “It just creates an environment that is enviable, and we have it. So, as we move forward as a State Chamber, I would like to make sure that every part of the state, particularly rural Texas, gets the opportunity to participate.”













Texas shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to attracting new businesses and experiencing diverse industry growth. Rolando Pablos, the former Texas Secretary of State, stressed the necessity of preparing for this surge through strategic investments and fortifying trade routes.

""We expect a tsunami of more business to come, and we have to get ready to get ready for that through infrastructure and a business-friendly climate and through trade routes,” he said. “You know, bilateral or state and Mexico level relationships.""

In the broader context, the significance of Texas and Mexico as trade partners cannot be overblown. The economic development fostered by this collaboration not only supercharges prosperity and security but also creates an environment of unparalleled potential. The partnership with Mexico is also a linchpin in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and has resulted in innumerable benefits for Texas, highlighting the interdependence and mutual success that such alliances can yield.

However, recent challenges, such as the temporary suspension of international rail crossings at Eagle Pass and El Paso, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of these connections. The closures, affecting a substantial portion of cross-border rail traffic, underline the urgent need to reopen these routes to safeguard commerce and prevent further damage to the economy."
352,A Bright Future for Semiconductors in Texas,https://www.txbiz.org/post/a-bright-future-for-semiconductors-in-texas,"In Texas, the growing semiconductor industry exists as a display of our state’s economic strength, technological innovation and commitment to national security. The Texas Association of Business’ 2023 Policy Conference brought to light the profound importance of continuing to bolster this industry, with key insights from influential speakers emphasizing the critical role semiconductors play in shaping Texas’ future.

Adriana Cruz, the Executive Director of Texas Economic Development & Tourism, affirmed the significance of the semiconductor industry, stating, ""Texas is truly the birthplace of the integrated circuit, and the semiconductor industry for our state is incredibly important… there are 15 semiconductor manufacturers in the state right now… 43,000 Texans are employed by the semiconductor industry.”













It is evident that this industry is a catalyst for job creation and overall economic prosperity. Strengthening this sector promises to further boost employment opportunities as Texas’ population continues to grow, which would lead to an even more successful economy.

Although our state is traditionally associated with industries such as oil and gas, investing in developing sectors, specifically semiconductors, would make Texas more resilient to economic fluctuations and global market shifts. Recent disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain as seen during the pandemic underscore the importance of strengthening Texas' semiconductor industry to ensure a resilient and robust supply chain, reducing dependency on foreign sources.













The speakers also underlined the national security implications intertwined with the semiconductor industry. This industry plays a pivotal role in various national defense systems, communication networks and critical infrastructure, further emphasizing the need for a reliable domestic supply. With an environment already primed for an increase in semiconductor manufacturing, Texas has an opportunity to take the stage as a national and global leader in an industry that is fully integrated and essential to citizens’ daily lives."
353,Businesses Urge CBP to Resume Rail Operations at Eagle Pass and El Paso,https://www.txbiz.org/post/businesses-urge-cbp-to-resume-rail-operations-at-eagle-pass-and-el-paso,"Austin, TX – The Texas Association of Business (TAB) President and CEO, Glenn Hamer, released the following statement in response to railway crossing closures issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection:





“This is a short-sighted, half-baked decision that will not make a dent in illegal migration but will cause economic harm to everyday Americans. On behalf of the business community, TAB urges CBP to reopen railway crossing operations at El Paso and Eagle Pass to resume the flow of legal, everyday goods to American citizens.”





TAB sent a letter to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the Texas delegation, recognizing the importance of a secure border and underscoring the economic case for resuming rail operations.





﻿ Eagle Pass and El Paso are the No. 2 and No. 3 rail gateways, moving roughly 450,000 rail shipments annually. Nearly 10,000 railcars in Mexico and the U.S. are being held from one day's closure alone. Eagle Pass and El Paso account for a total of $33.95 billion or 35.8% of all cross-border rail traffic to/from Mexico in the most recent 12 months of available US DOT transborder data. A wide diversity of industries such as food/beverage, finished vehicles and auto parts, agriculture, grain, consumer goods, and other industrial products will be heavily impacted.

TAB is the Texas State Chamber, representing companies of every size and industry. The Association's purpose is to champion the best business climate in the world, unleashing the power of free enterprise to enhance lives for generations. Follow TAB on Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn .

354,Governor Hochul Announces Guidance to Manage Climate Risk for New York State-Regulated Banking and Mortgage Institutions,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-guidance-manage-climate-risk-new-york-state-regulated-banking-and,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted guidance for New York State-regulated banking and mortgage institutions to help them manage their material financial and operational risks associated with climate change.

“Climate change is impacting every sector of New York's economy, including financial services,” Governor Hochul said. “As the financial capital of the world, I'm proud that we are proactively addressing climate-related financial risks so that New Yorkers can continue to have access to affordable financial services.”

DFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris said, “To protect New Yorkers from financial harm, regulated institutions must anticipate and respond to new and emerging risks. Today’s guidance provides these institutions with a balanced, data-driven approach to preserve safety and soundness and operational resiliency by addressing the risks posed by climate change.”

The guidance is designed to support Institutions’ efforts to identify, measure, monitor, and control their material climate-related financial and operational risks in a manner consistent with current risk management principles. It addresses key components of prudent risk management by Institutions — including corporate governance, internal control frameworks, risk management processes and data collection and analysis — so that Institutions will incorporate assessment of these risks into their existing risk frameworks, taking a strategic and forward-looking approach.

DFS has finalized the guidance with careful consideration of the valuable feedback received from regulated entities and other key stakeholders. In response to feedback, as part of today’s announcement, the Department has also published available resources to assist smaller organizations as they work to adopt measures that address their climate-related risk.

On January 11, 2024, at 11:30 a.m. EST, DFS will be hosting a webinar to provide an overview of the guidance.

358,Governor Hochul Signs Legislation to Establish Task Force on Missing BIPOC Women and Girls,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-establish-task-force-missing-bipoc-women-and-girls,"Governor Kathy Hochul today signed legislation S.4266-A/A.5088-A to establish a task force on missing women and girls who are Black, Indigenous and people of color. Statistics from the FBI's National Crime Information Center show that of the more than 271,000 missing women and girls reported in 2022, 43 percent were Black, Indigenous or people of color. This task force, which was funded through an appropriation included in the FY24 Enacted Budget, will consider policy changes to address this crisis.

“Public safety is my top priority, and I'm committed to doing everything in my power to protect all New Yorkers,"" Governor Hochul said. ""The statistics are alarming: thousands of women and girls who are Black, Indigenous or people of color go missing every year. We have a moral obligation to treat these cases with the care and seriousness they deserve, and this new Task Force will be a critical part of that effort.""

The Missing BIPOC Women and Girls Task Force will work to assess the epidemic of missing women and girls, address discrepancies in the care with which these cases are treated and develop policies to increase community education. The Task Force will have nine members, including representatives of the Office of Family and Children's Services, the Division of Criminal Justice Services, the New York State Police and members appointed by the Senate and Assembly. Hearings will be required, and the Task Force must submit a report of its findings and recommendations within two years.

State Senator Lea Webb said, “A staggering number of BIPOC Women and Girls go missing each year across the US and here in New York State the numbers keep rising. This legislation will establish a task force to address this gap in care and concern for BIPOC victims of abduction and human trafficking. This taskforce will focus on educating communities to prevent disappearances, identify the major hubs across New York where abductions occur, and implement other equitable policies and practices on this important issue. I thank my Assembly partner, Assemblywoman Karines Reyes for her efforts to pass this critical bill and our community advocates. By signing our BIPOC Task Force legislation, Governor Hochul is helping to take important steps toward a safer New York for all women and girls, addressing the epidemic of BIPOC missing and murdered women and girls.”

Assemblymember Karines Reyes said, “I applaud Governor Hochul for her leadership and courage in signing this bill into law today. Women and girls of color face a systemic disregard of their cases when they go missing, from law enforcement’s delayed response in addressing these cases and the media’s disinterest in promoting the fact that they are missing. This new law will establish a task force to fully understand the gaps that exist in our state’s response in these cases, allow us to understand best practices and ensure that more of these cases are resolved. If followed through, we can return more women and girls of color to their families and provide them with closure. I am thankful for the partnership of Senator Webb on getting this bill passed into law, former Senator Alessandra Biaggi for first entrusting me with this bill in the Assembly in 2021, and most importantly for the advocacy of Dawn Rowe and Girl Vow for highlighting this critically important issue. Together, we will bring back our girls.”

Girl Vow, Inc., President & CEO, Dawn Rowe said, “Today is a historic moment for BIPOC women and girls whose stories and lives have been pushed into the shadows. You are no longer silent. We speak for you with urgency to push past disparities and gendered racism until you find safety. This legislation to establish a task force on missing women and girls who are Black, Indigenous, and people of color seeks to remedy the structural harms we have faced for far too long. From this day forward, we work to shatter the barriers until you have visibility.”"

Good morning. What a wonderful, spectacular day this is. I know everybody looks really serious, but this is a great day. First of all, to our Acting Superintendent Chiumento, I want to thank you for accepting the role of leadership at a time when your skills and your talent and your experience are so desperately needed.

Very proud to be joined by New York's own Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado. Let's give him a round of applause.

Trooper Fryer, that was one of the most beautiful renditions of the National Anthem I've ever heard, so thank you for sharing that. And also, I do want to also recognize the class representative, Kevin Knightes, for obviously demonstrating leadership, the first among first, and I want to thank him for already displaying the kind of leadership we expect to see as his career unfolds.

Major Anthony Oliver, Director of Training. This is your first training class, sir? Yes? I think you did very well, don't you? Let's give him a round of applause.

And those who remind us of the presence of God in our lives, who we call on in our time of need, in our time of gratitude, and that's Pastor Traynham and Rabbi Heschel. I thank both of them for bringing the spiritual presence to us as well. Also, I want to recognize members of the State Legislature who've joined us today, many in spirit, but also those who are present here today, if they could stand up and take a bow to our, we recognize our members of the Assembly and the Senate who are here today.

Thank you. Thank you.

Before we get into the joyous occasion of this, it's also hard when I, as Governor, get the phone call, and the phone call that I received, not once, but twice in the last ten days or so, was the loss of two of our State Police officers, both who succumb to illnesses that they incurred when they were helping find lives, save people in the aftermath of 9/11.

And to their families that have watched the sadness of seeing this hero not taken away on that day like thousands, but also similarly losing their life in the pursuit of helping fellow Americans, I want to recognize them as well here today. So let's keep them in our prayers always.

And remember, as you celebrate this graduation, you stand on their shoulders. And the shoulders of thousands who came before you, who were brave and courageous, who sat in these very seats at one time. On that first day, not quite sure what would unfold in their lives, but they still showed up.

And you are the 213th class. Think about that. All the classes that went before you and your role as you think about your place in history and the history of this elite institution. This is what I hope you are having, calling to mind today.

And I also want to acknowledge the pride of all the people watching. The moms and dads, the partners, husbands, wives, sometimes children, brothers and sisters – you sacrificed a lot and you have that sense of anxiety. Is my loved one going into harm's way in this profession?

But as the Governor, I want to thank all of you for, at some point, influencing the people sitting before us, whether it's conversations at the dinner table, whether it's people who came before and wore the uniform. Whatever the influences were, you taught them to be good Americans, to be great New Yorkers, and also so selfless that they would become one of the elite few who put on a uniform go through the trials and tribulations and the sacrifice and the time away from families to be here today. So, let's all give a round of applause and I'm going to tell all of the recruits here and our new troopers to give your families a round of applause as well. So, let's recognize them. You're allowed to do that.

I think about the fact that 4,400 people applied for these positions. If you do the math, 1,000 were processed, but only 232 were selected. That's less than one percent. That is one of the many reasons you are in a very elite class of individuals, and don't forget that. You were called to this, but your experience and your dedication and your passion for service to others is why you are sitting here today.

And I also know that there's individuals who have inspired their own family members. In 2003, Kenneth Kellenbenz graduated from this very academy. He went on to serve with great courage and admiration from his colleagues for over 20 years. But somewhere along the way, his work, his passion, caught the attention of his children. And today, two of his sons, Daniel and Andrew, will graduate today as troopers, joining not just his father's work, but also the family of the state police. And I want to thank them as well for continuing that legacy of service to others.

Also, many of you have answered the call to service to our nation. Over 20 served in wars – Afghanistan, Iraq. 46 of you actually served in other police forces. I spent 14 years in local government. I was responsible for hiring police officers and our chief of police. I knew what I was looking for. So many of you have already served in your local communities and now you have a chance to serve them at even higher level.

But I want to talk today about my expectations on all of you as your Governor. I want to make sure that you never stop treating your fellow New Yorkers as human beings, people in need. They're going to call upon you in a way that you'll never even be able to think about today. Because some night you're driving on a dark road, and you see a vehicle off to the side with the flashers on. It's dark, it's scary, you don't know what you're entering into. Someone who could do you harm, or is it someone in need? But in that car could be a young mom, who ran into car trouble and has children crying in the back seat. When they roll down the window and see your face, and all of a sudden, they know they're going to be okay.

Extend that love and compassion to them. All of you have that within you. You don't check that at the door when you put on a uniform to serve a community. You keep that. You kindle that. Don't ever be disillusioned because you are the ones that are bringing hope to someone in need. And we saw that on display so many times this year.

Just since I spoke to the last graduating class in June. Our State Police responded and helped capture the Gilgo Beach murderer who traumatized the community for over a decade. People unsure whether they should let their children go out and play. Our State Police helped bring that person to justice.

Not long after, a bus full of students from Farmingdale High School, careened down a ravine, 50 feet down with students, a band heading off to Pennsylvania. Our State Police were there, and you can imagine putting themselves in danger, their own lives, as they had to go down that steep ravine and approach a bus that could have blown up in any second. My State Police, our State Police did that.

I think about a little girl, a nine-year-old that was kidnapped not far from here. Our State Police responded, and they were there. So, you never know the face of someone who's going to need you. But they're all over our State.

And I know that you've been through the rigors of the academy. You've had to learn so much. Learn all about the penal code. More than I learned in law school about all the rules. I know the grueling morning exercises, the PT. I'm with State Police every day of the week and I ask them about this, and I know how hard it was. But more than that was the separation from your family for all those months.

And to describe how on a Friday would roll around, it was like a birthday celebration, all excitement, because you're going home to your family. And on Sunday, that natural reluctance to kiss your loved ones and say goodbye but knowing that it was temporary. But this was an investment of time and your energy, and today it pays off.

It is true we are trying to bring more to the ranks, because this is a proud institution. I want to see more diversity, I want to see more women, but all of you are part of that journey to help us get there. By your example in your community, when people see what you are doing, you can be the inspiration to others who want to be in that same uniform someday. So, I'm calling on all of you to be ambassadors – wear that uniform proudly, go to other events in the community, interact with people, show the compassion.

I know it's hard, my friends. I know there's a time when those in law enforcement feel they're under siege and they're not respected. And sometimes communities just make them feel unwelcome. But you also have the ability to break down those barriers, show them your humanity. Let them know you care, help people have understanding. That's powerful. If every one of you can have that impact on just one other person, and help bridge the divide between communities and law enforcement, then we're on the road to healing in this State. That's the power that you have. There's a lot of mistrust of law enforcement.

But I want to tell you right now, as your Governor, I have your back. I've invested more than any Governor in the State of New York's history – in resources, and technology, and communication systems, and helping fight guns on the streets. And I made that one of my top priorities. So, where are these guns coming from? They're coming up from Pennsylvania and going over to Syracuse, or over to Brooklyn, or the Bronx. Someone has to stop them. So, we started working closely together across the State with other states, all driven by the State Police.

So I've identified new responsibilities. Monitoring social media. When we have a white supremacist who telegraphed on social media that he was going to go to my hometown of Buffalo and slaughter ten innocent people shopping in a grocery store. That was out there on social media, so I doubled the size of our capacity watching for credible threats.

You may be in that space someday and how important that is. My job is to make sure you have the tools you need. I've increased budgets over 27 percent when others are cutting and talking about defunding police. We're not defunding police. We are refunding the police. We're making sure they have all the resources they need, and you can count on that.

And one thing I'm really proud of because of our ramped-up efforts, there are now 3,300 fewer guns in the hands of criminals in the State of New York. That is what we're focused on, because my number one job, and your number one job, is to keep New Yorkers safe, full stop. And nothing, nothing, will ever get in the way of that mission.

Because that's what the people of our State are counting on all of us to do. So at the end of your time, you're not thinking that far down the road, but it's going to come at some point. I want you to remember this day. Remember the sense of awe and expectation and excitement and pride that you felt and “I finally got there, I achieved my dream” and you did it.

But it's not about today. It's about the end of your career. What will your legacy be? What will people say about you and your contributions and perhaps the lives you saved that you may never know? And those conflicts that you resolve without violence. All of those, all of that, is what I hope that you better look on in your life.

Because those are my expectations as your governor. They're high. There’s 4,400 people who thought they could do it, and I have 230 who are sitting here today. That is extraordinary. And finally, never forget the Bible. What was said in Matthew, “blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the earth.”

Today you go forth as New York's peacemakers. That is your responsibility. You'll see things you never saw before. You'll experience things that you never imagined. But again, before you leave this planet, you must be able to say, “I made a difference. I was a peacemaker.”

Congratulations to every single one of you, to your families, to your friends. This is a great day for all of you. It's a great day for us here in the State of New York to know that all of you will be out there serving all of us. And I want to say one last thing. May God bless you and keep you safe – keep you in his hands. And may God bless the great State of New York and may God bless America.

Thank you everyone."
360,Governor Hochul Announces $8 Million Awarded to New York State Under Inflation Reduction Act to Reduce Methane Emissions From Oil and Gas Wells,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-8-million-awarded-new-york-state-under-inflation-reduction-act,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy awarded New York State $8 million from the Methane Emissions Reduction Program. The funds, included in the Inflation Reduction Act, bolster New York's ongoing efforts to help reduce climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas infrastructure, as well as protect ground and surface waters.

“New Yorkers are feeling the impacts of climate change all across the State, and in response we are taking bold action and building a stronger, more resilient New York with the help of record State and Federal resources,” Governor Hochul said. “The Biden-Harris Administration and our federal partners are recognizing the importance of reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions through the Methane Emissions Reduction Program, and strengthening New York's commitment to confronting the existential threat of climate change head on.”

Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said, “Upstate New York, from the Southern Tier and Central New York to Western New York and the Finger Lakes, has long been plagued by orphaned oil and gas wells creating hidden hazards that pollute our backyards, drinking water sources, and worsen climate change. Now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act that I championed, New York will receive $8 million to reduce noxious methane pollution from these wells. I am proud to deliver this major federal investment to help fight climate change and ensure that municipalities do not have to take on the full financial burden to clean up the polluting remnants of the fossil fuel industry in Upstate NY.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Reducing methane emissions is vital to combating the impacts of climate change. This federal funding will help bolster New York State’s ongoing efforts to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector and protect water quality for countless New Yorkers. I am proud to see this federal funding going to create a cleaner environment for New Yorkers and will continue to fight to bring federal dollars home to combat climate change.”

U.S. Department of Energy Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management Brad Crabtree said, “New York State is a leader in the nationwide effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, states like New York can do even more to slash harmful pollution and take an important step in slowing the devastating impacts of climate change.”



U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2 Administrator Lisa F. Garcia said, “New York is leading the way in tackling climate change by reducing methane emissions from oil and gas wells. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest federal climate investment in history, this $8 million in funding demonstrates the commitment by EPA and New York State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect our essential water resources. By plugging oil and gas wells and preventing methane leaks, we are eliminating a major source of pollution and protecting the health and safety of all New Yorkers.”

The $8 million in federal funds will be used to further the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) efforts to monitor and mitigate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as the State works to plug wells with a focus on wells with individual landowners listed as operators. The funds are part of $350 million awarded to 14 states that will help measure and reduce methane emissions, one of the biggest drivers of climate change. The funding, which is made possible by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — the largest federal climate investment in history — will help New York and other states support industry efforts to cut methane emissions from active wells and support environmental restoration of well sites.

The Methane Emissions Reduction Program also provides a combination of technical and financial assistance to New York to help well owners and operators voluntarily identify and eliminate methane emissions from low-producing conventional oil and gas wells, also referred to as marginal conventional wells, with disproportionately high methane emissions.

Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “Under Governor Kathy Hochul’s leadership, and with the help of our federal partners, New York is advancing a just transition to clean energy that creates good jobs and supports a green economy for the future. Curbing methane from the oil and gas sector is critical to New York’s progress in implementing the Climate Act and reaching our emissions reduction milestones. DEC thanks President Biden, EPA Administrator Regan and Regional Administrator Garcia, and DOE Secretary Granholm for this significant $8 million investment in New York’s ongoing methane reduction initiatives.”

The federal funding announced today complements New York's many steps to reduce emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases. In 2022, Governor Hochul announced finalized regulations that require significant reductions in methane and other harmful emissions from any oil and natural gas infrastructure in New York State. The regulations marked a milestone in realizing the State's nation-leading clean energy and climate agenda by reducing methane emissions by more than 14,000 metric tons per year and volatile organic compound emissions by more than 2,000 tons per year. In addition, regulations in 2020 establish limits requiring that statewide emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases be reduced 40 percent by 2030, 85 percent by 2050, including emissions associated with imported electricity and fossil fuels.

Earlier this year, Governor Hochul announced the completion of the first gas well safely plugged with funding from a $25 million federal grant to New York State through the landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. New York State is working with landowners to plug aging and abandoned oil and natural gas wells to protect public safety, help reduce methane and other climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions.

New York State's Nation-Leading Climate Plan

New York State's nation-leading climate agenda calls for an orderly and just transition that creates family-sustaining jobs, continues to foster a green economy across all sectors and ensures that at least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities. Guided by some of the nation’s most aggressive climate and clean energy initiatives, New York is on a path to achieving a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century. A cornerstone of this transition is New York's unprecedented clean energy investments, including more than $52 billion in 118 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale up solar, nearly $3 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. These and other investments are supporting more than 165,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2021 and over 3,000 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, New York also adopted zero-emission vehicle regulations, including requiring all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in the State be zero emission by 2035. Partnerships are continuing to advance New York’s climate action with nearly 400 registered and more than 100 certified Climate Smart Communities, nearly 500 Clean Energy Communities, and the State’s largest community air monitoring initiative in 10 disadvantaged communities across the state to help target air pollution and combat climate change."

363,Governor Hochul Signs Legislation to Protect Low-Income New Yorkers from Fraud,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-protect-low-income-new-yorkers-fraud,"Governor Kathy Hochul today signed legislation S.6088/A.4023-A to protect low-income New Yorkers from fraud by requiring stores accepting electronic benefit transfer cards to warn of skimming. Skimming occurs when a scammer installs a device at a point-of-sale terminal that skims the holders’ card data and pin number, allowing the scammer to drain the victim’s benefits. By raising awareness about skimming, this legislation will help prevent New Yorkers from falling victim to this practice and losing their SNAP benefits or cash assistance.

“From baby formula to fresh food, New Yorkers use their EBT cards to cover the cost of essential products to ensure their families are fed and healthy,” Governor Hochul said. “We are taking action to protect New Yorkers from scammers who steal money out of their pockets by making sure customers are aware of skimming and ensuring they know how to protect themselves from falling victim.”

Many New Yorkers are unaware of skimming until it’s too late. Once skimmers steal an individual’s card data and pin number, they have the ability to drain the victim’s benefits. Legislation S.6088/A.4023-A helps protect consumers by requiring businesses who accept EBT cards to place a sign at the point of sale containing a notice to make customers aware of the practice. Additionally, the legislation requires the notice to include steps customers can take to protect themselves and other resources.

State Senator John C. Liu said, “EBT skimming is a rising problem across the state that must be addressed at the point of sale to best protect low-income New Yorkers who rely on this benefit to feed their families. Thank you to Governor Hochul for signing this important legislation into law and to Assemblywoman Rozic for championing this effort in the Assembly, and for making sure all New Yorkers can be appropriately armed with the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.”

Assemblymember Nily Rozic said, “Every day, more low-income New Yorkers are at risk of having their SNAP benefits stolen with no recourse. That’s why it’s so important to raise awareness and provide consumer protections for those who rely on their EBT cards to help put food on their table. I thank Senator Liu for tirelessly advocating for this issue, and Governor Hochul for signing this important bill into law.”

New Yorkers who have had their SNAP or Public Assistance benefits stolen electronically can fill out a simple application to have them replaced. All EBT card holders, however, should remain vigilant about these scams and take several basic precautions to protect themselves, including carefully inspecting point-of-sale devices, changing their PIN regularly, and reviewing their transaction history frequently.

Anyone who has their benefits stolen should immediately contact the EBT Customer Service Helpline to report their card stolen and request a replacement EBT card. New Yorkers can contact the helpline by:

Calling 1-888-328-6399;

Visiting ConnectEBT; or

Using the ConnectEBT mobile app.

After reporting their EBT card stolen and requesting a replacement card, New Yorkers can get information on applying for replacement benefits here. Eligible recipients will receive the lesser of either the amount stolen or twice the full monthly allotment received in the month before the benefits were stolen."

Release Date: December 21, 2023 NYSDOT Announces Start of Public Comment Period on Troy-Menands Bridge Study Comment Period Running through January 31 the Latest Step in Public Engagement Process Newly Released Project Report and Appendices Here The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) today announced the start of the public comment period for a high-level study identifying the best location for a new Troy-Menands Bridge. NYSDOT has released its Draft Project Scoping Report and Attachments 1-6, that cover items such as bridge corridor concepts, traffic and environmental background information on the Project. The Draft Scoping Report and appendices identify the project’s needs and challenges, and consider the project’s environmental, community and economic benefits. Comments will be accepted through January 31 The Purpose and Needs of the project include maintaining the connection between Menands and South Troy, rebuilding the bridge and approaches to current highway engineering standards to curtail recurring crashes along the bridge, addressing environmental justice concerns as well as improving pedestrian and bicycle facilities and connections to the Empire State Trail along the Hudson River. The structure, built in 1932/1933, carries State Route 378 over the Hudson River, connecting the Village of Menands and the Town of Colonie to the South Troy neighborhood in the City of Troy. The bridge has no load restrictions, is inspected regularly, and is considered safe, but is nearing the end of its life cycle with NYSDOT recognizing that the bridge will need to be replaced within the next decade. Community outreach and public input is paramount to this Project. The State Department of Transportation has met with public officials, state, and federal permitting agencies, presented at regional metropolitan planning meetings, hosted a neighborhood stakeholder meeting and three public meetings, with the final meeting held on October 26, 2023, when the Department presented the study findings and recommended concepts 1, 3 and 4B for further investigation and engineering in future project phases. Community members and interested stakeholders are invited to submit questions and comments via email by contacting the Project Manager, Susan Olsen at susan.olsen@dot.ny.gov.

365,Attorney General James Releases Footage from Investigation into the Death of Mamady Cisse,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-releases-footage-investigation-death-mamady-cisse,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today released police body-worn camera footage from a member of the New York Police Department (NYPD) that her office obtained as part of its ongoing investigation into the death of Mamady Cisse, who died on September 9, 2023 following an encounter with law enforcement in the Bronx.

The Office of Special Investigation (OSI) of the Attorney General’s Office released a video from a body-worn camera that a responding NYPD officer was equipped with during the incident. The release of this video follows Attorney General James’ directive that camera footage obtained by her office during an OSI investigation be released to the public in order to increase transparency and strengthen public trust in these matters.

Pursuant to New York State Executive Law Section 70-b, OSI assesses every incident reported to it where a police officer or a peace officer, including a corrections officer, may have caused the death of a person by an act or omission. Under the law, the officer may be on-duty or off-duty, and the decedent may be armed or unarmed. Also, the decedent may or may not be in custody or incarcerated. If OSI’s assessment indicates an officer may have caused the death, OSI proceeds to conduct a full investigation of the incident.

The release of this footage is not an expression of any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of any party in a criminal matter or any opinion as to how or whether any individual may be charged with a crime.

366,Attorney General James Urges Congress to Pass NCAA Accountability Act of 2023,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-urges-congress-pass-ncaa-accountability-act-2023,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today joined a bipartisan coalition of 18 attorneys general urging Congress to pass the NCAA Accountability Act of 2023. If signed into law, this legislation would ensure that the NCAA provides transparent due process in its investigations and create fairness for college athletes, coaches, and institutions.

“When powerful interests and institutions lack accountability, we know that those without power have little to no chance of standing up for their rights,” said Attorney General James. “The NCAA currently holds tremendous authority over thousands of New York college athletes, and many more throughout the nation. That is why I am proud to stand with my fellow attorneys general in urging Congress to pass the NCAA Accountability Act of 2023. I will always fight to ensure the rule of law is extended equally in New York, regardless of people’s or companies’ wealth or power.”

The NCAA uses lengthy, opaque, and arbitrary investigations, and this legislation would change that by increasing accountability and transparency. The NCAA’s current unchecked concentration of power is a problem that leaves college athletes vulnerable to mistreatment, distracts both students and universities from their educational priorities, and results in unequal treatment that can deprive athletes, coaches, and institutions of a fair process.

Given the economic powerhouse that college sports have become, such NCAA investigations can harm the level of competition in respective sports and also damage the financial well-being of higher institutions and the surrounding areas. Additionally, such investigations effectively deprive college athletes of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) opportunities, which allows college athletes the opportunity to monetize their brand.

Joining Attorney General James in sending this letter to Congress are the attorneys general of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, and the District of Columbia.

In addition to calling on Congress to pass the NCAA Accountability Act of 2023, Attorney General James has been an outspoken leader in the fight to protect college athletes. Earlier this month, Attorney General James and a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general sued the NCAA for its transfer eligibility rule, which prohibits student athletes from competing in games for a year if they transfer schools more than once. Attorney General James secured a temporary injunction, which was extended to become a preliminary injunction, against the NCAA for its transfer eligibility rule. Under the preliminary injunction, college athletes can now participate in games if they have transferred schools."
367,"Attorney General James Secures $10,000 for Dance Company Workers for Unpaid Wages and Harmful Labor Practices",https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-secures-10000-dance-company-workers-unpaid-wages-and,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today announced that her office secured $10,000 for nine former employees of H+, a Manhattan-based dance company, for failing to pay rightfully earned wages or properly address sexual harassment claims, in violation of New York’s labor and human rights laws. An investigation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) found that H+ charged for dance classes entirely staffed and run by purported volunteers while the company’s leaders pocketed the funds. The OAG also found that the company’s founder and artistic director, Safi Thomas, perpetuated a hostile work environment.

“Far too often, the physical labor and sacrifice of artistic workers like dancers are overlooked, but every New York worker deserves to be paid what they are rightfully owed,” said Attorney General James. “H+ built a stressful work environment and took advantage of hardworking artists just to pocket the profits for themselves. New Yorkers have my word: as your Attorney General, I am committed to ensuring that no one gets away with cheating hardworking people out of their fair pay or threatening their rights.”

The OAG opened an investigation after receiving a February 2021 complaint from Safe Horizon, the nation’s leading survivor assistance organization. The OAG found that H+ consistently misclassified workers as “members” or “apprentices” instead of employees so that they would not have to pay them for their labor. Profits earned from employees’ hard work directly funded the living expenses of H+’s so-called “artistic echelon,” a group comprised of Thomas and three other members of H+’s leadership team who lived together in an apartment entirely funded by the company. The investigation also revealed that Thomas fostered a hostile work environment, frequently subjecting women employees to unequal treatment and sexual harassment. Further, H+ lacked a formal process for employees to report cases of discrimination.

Under the settlement announced today, H+ will pay $10,000 in unpaid wages to nine former employees, and Thomas will undergo individual training regarding sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment prevention, and an employer’s obligations under the law. H+ will also, among other things:

Develop anti-discrimination and anti-sexual harassment training protocols and complaint processes for employees and managers, and submit written materials to OAG regarding these trainings.

Ensure new hires complete the training protocol within 30 days of the start of their employment.

Properly classify all persons who perform work for H+ and Thomas as employees and set wages appropriate for their labor in compliance with New York wage laws.

This matter was handled by Assistant Attorneys General Eric Eingold and Amy Schneider as well as former Assistant Attorney General Roya Aghanori of the Labor Bureau under the supervision of Civil Enforcement Section Chief Fiona Kaye of the Labor Bureau and Senior Counsel Sandra Pullman of the Civil Rights Bureau.

368,"Attorney General James Secures $656,000 from Unlicensed Nursing Home Operator for Years of Fraud and Neglect",https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-secures-656000-unlicensed-nursing-home-operator-years,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James and the United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York (USAO-NDNY) Carla Freedman today announced they have secured $656,000 in a settlement with Chaim “Mutty” Scheinbaum, an unlicensed operator of the Saratoga Center for Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Care (Saratoga Center) for years of fraud and resident neglect. From 2017 to 2021, Scheinbaum operated the nursing home without a license from the state, in violation of New York law. Under his control, conditions at Saratoga Center rapidly declined. The facility lacked hot water and clean linens, and residents suffered falls, pressure sores, and other significant lapses in care. Today’s settlement follows four prior settlements as part of a resolution in February 2023 with Saratoga Center’s owners, a second unlicensed operator, and the facility’s landlord, for over $7.1 million. As part of the settlement, Scheinbaum will return $656,000 to Medicaid, with $393,600 going to New York.

“Every resident of New York’s nursing homes deserves high-quality care and proper staffing to meet their needs,” said Attorney General James. “Rather than ensure vulnerable residents got the care they deserved, this individual mismanaged Saratoga Center’s finances and failed to adequately staff the facility, causing residents to suffer the consequences of neglect and unsanitary conditions. I want to thank United States Attorney Carla Freedman and our partners in law enforcement for their assistance in bringing this unacceptable situation to light and to justice. My office will continue to ensure nursing home residents are protected, and I encourage anyone who has witnessed alarming conditions, resident neglect, or abuse at a nursing home to contact my office.”

“Nursing homes should protect the health and well-being of every resident,” said U.S. Attorney Carla Freedman for the Northern District of New York. “That did not happen at Saratoga Center. An individual with no lawful authority controlled the finances and failed to pay vendors. This unlawful arrangement resulted in false claims to Medicaid for worthless services. We will continue to hold responsible people accountable when they receive federal funds while providing substandard care. Thank you to Attorney General James and her office for collaborating on this case.”

Saratoga Center operated as a 257-bed nursing home from 2015 until it closed in 2021. In 2017, the landlord pressured the owners to relinquish control of Saratoga Center to unlicensed operators, including Scheinbaum, but did not report the change to the Department of Health (DOH).

The conditions at Saratoga Center declined under the control of the new, unlicensed operators, leading to a breakdown in the quality of care provided to residents. From when they took over in 2017 to when Saratoga Center closed in 2021, Scheinbaum and the other unlicensed operator mismanaged the nursing home’s finances and failed to adequately staff the facility, causing residents to suffer the consequences.

The investigation revealed that residents at Saratoga Center experienced excessive and unnecessary falls and injuries, including the development of pressure sores that went untreated. Under the management of Scheinbaum, Saratoga Center also failed to:

Maintain consistent and reliable hot water throughout the facility;

Properly maintain the fire alarm system;

Keep a sufficient stock of clean bed linens for residents; and

Manage trash and waste removal in a timely fashion, subjecting residents to unsanitary and unhealthy conditions.

Scheinbaum and the other operators then billed New York’s Medicaid program for services provided to the residents. However, as the investigation revealed, these were claims for worthless services, and amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars of fraudulent claims.

Under New York law, owners of nursing homes have a “special obligation” to ensure the highest possible quality of life for residents, and to staff the facility at a level sufficient to provide adequate care. Nursing home operators are also prohibited from delegating key duties to other individuals who have not been approved as operators by DOH.

In 2018, both DOH and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) fined Saratoga Center for serious deficiencies and violations, and in 2019, CMS designated Saratoga Center a “Special Focus Facility,” signifying it was among the poorest performing nursing homes in the country.

The parties to the settlement announced today are Chaim Scheinbaum, Alliance NJ Care LLC, and Alliance HC II LLC, the entities through which Scheinbaum conducted business. Under the settlements, Scheinbaum will pay $656,000 to Medicaid, of which $393,600 will go directly to New York state. The remaining $262,400 will be paid to the federal government.

Attorney General James has been investigating nursing homes throughout New York based on concerns of resident neglect and other unacceptable conduct, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, Attorney General James released a report revealing that many nursing homes were ill-equipped and ill-prepared to deal with the pandemic crisis because of poor staffing levels, which resulted in a lack of compliance with infection control protocols and increased risk to residents. In November and December 2022 and June 2023, Attorney General James filed four special proceedings against skilled nursing facilities and their owners due to findings of repeated and persistent fraud, resident neglect, and false and misleading representations to DOH. These facilities include: The Villages of Orleans Health and Rehabilitation Center in Orleans County, Fulton Commons Care Center in Nassau County, Cold Spring Hills Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Nassau County, and four Centers Healthcare facilities throughout New York state.

Attorney General James encourages anyone with information or concerns about alarming nursing home conditions, or resident abuse or neglect, to file a confidential complaint online or call the Office of the Attorney General's (OAG) Toll-Free Tip Line 1-866-697-3444, option 1.

The investigation and settlements were the result of a coordinated effort among OAG, USAO-NDNY, the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG). Attorney General James thanks USAO-NDNY, DOJ, HHS-OIG, and DOH for their partnership and assistance.

The MFCU investigation was conducted by Detective Supervisor John Benshoff under the supervision of Deputy Chief, Commanding Officer William Falk, with Principal Auditor-Investigator Cheryl Abraham and Senior Auditor-Investigator Nathaniel J. Wood, both under the supervision of Regional Chief Auditor Sarah Finning, and with assistance from Medical Analyst Stephanie Keyser, R.N.

The settlements were handled for MFCU by Special Assistant Attorney General Emily Auletta of the Civil Enforcement Division, under the supervision of Deputy Chief of Civil Enforcement Konrad Payne. The MFCU Albany Regional Office is led by Albany Regional Director Kathleen Boland and the Civil Enforcement Division is led by Chief Alee N. Scott. MFCU is led by Director Amy Held and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Paul J. Mahoney. MFCU is a part of the Division for Criminal Justice, which is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General José Maldonado and overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.

New York MFCU’s total funding for federal fiscal year (FY) 2024 is $68,997,928. Of that total, 75 percent, or $51,748,448, is awarded under a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The remaining 25 percent, totaling $17,249,480 for FY 2024, is funded by New York state.

Through MFCU’s recoveries in law enforcement actions, it regularly returns more to the state than it receives in state funding."
369,Initial Findings Released From Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group On Emergency Response,https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/2023-Announcements/2023-12-21-Governor-Hochul-Announces-Results-of-Fire-Safety-Working-Group,"Available Analyses Find No Reported Injuries, No Harmful Levels of Toxins Detected at Sites of Battery Storage Fires

Governor Kathy Hochul today released initial findings from the Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group, which was convened following fires at battery energy storage systems at facilities in Jefferson, Orange and Suffolk Counties this summer. The Working Group has made significant progress in evaluating both preventive and reactive standards and practices for battery system fire safety, in addition to analyzing the impacts of the fires. Based on available analyses of air quality, soil, or water data collected in the days following the incidents, the Working Group concluded that there were no reported injuries and no harmful levels of toxins detected. Additionally, statewide battery system project assessments and fire code reviews are currently underway with draft recommendations expected to be released for public comment in the first quarter of 2024.

“New York State is grateful to the first responders who were on the scene at these fires, and we are taking this opportunity to ensure they can continue to do their jobs safely and effectively,” Governor Hochul said. “As we continue to advance New York’s clean energy transition, maintaining this safety is of the utmost importance. Thankfully, the Working Group’s analysis shows no notable lasting impacts on the health or safety of the first responders or the communities they serve.”

The Working Group includes representatives from the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) Office of Fire Prevention and Control (OFPC)New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), Department of Public Service (DPS), and the Department of State (DOS). The group was convened in August 2023 and has gathered data and worked diligently with project developers, equipment manufacturers, and government officials to learn as much as possible about the fires at the three battery system sites.

The data assembled and analyzed by the Working Group includes:

An air monitoring report from the OFPC, and soil and water sampling data received from DEC from the Chaumont site.

On-site air monitoring results collected from the Warwick sites and relayed to the Working Group by local officials.

On-site soil sampling results from the East Hampton site relayed to the Working Group by a project developer.

An independent third-party site inspection report consisting of air monitoring and surface sampling at school buildings in the vicinity of the June 27, 2023, fire at the Warwick site.

Based on the information available to date, there is no evidence of significant off-site migration of contaminants associated with the fires.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “NYSERDA remains committed to working with our state agency partners, project developers and local communities to ensure a responsible transition to a zero-emissions grid and making available the data and resources needed to facilitate that transition in a safe and responsible manner"".

New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said, “Battery energy storage sites are essential to securing our climate future. As these technologies continue to be implemented throughout the state, we will work closely with our partners to ensure they are operated safely.”

Department of Public Service CEO Rory M. Christian said, “The Department is pleased that the Working Group has made significant progress in evaluating both preventive and reactive standards and practices for battery system fire safety, in addition to analyzing the impacts of recent battery storage fires. Kudos to Governor Hochul for creating the working group. The Department will continue working to ensure safety comes first as more and more batteries come into service.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “DEC applauds Governor Hochul for prioritizing New Yorkers’ safety and taking the lead to ensure energy storage deployment projects continue to be protective of our communities and the environment. DEC experts assisted the Fire Safety Working Group by analyzing current practices, assisting in site testing, enhancing emergency response measures, and identifying improvements in operations at facilities with vital roles in building a safe and responsible clean energy future for our state. We look forward to working with our partner agencies in continuing to advance this important work.”

In addition to the air, soil, and water quality analysis described above, the Working Group has partnered with subject matter experts to inspect all operational battery systems above 300 kW in New York, which accounts for the majority of commercial battery systems in service across the state. Inspections are currently underway and are slated to be complete by the second quarter of 2024. The goal of these inspections is to revise the current evaluation checklists and best-practices available for use by NYSERDA and others prior to energizing the systems, and to incorporate lessons learned from the battery fires while enhancing emergency response measures.

Battery energy storage systems are a critical component to achieving a reliable, zero-emissions grid. New York is taking the lead in addressing the incidents head on by forming the inter-agency fire and safety working group. The conclusions and recommendations will improve the way energy storage projects are deployed in New York and across the country. New York's Working Group has drawn national attention from other states as the industry is strongly invested in improving energy storage deployment best practices on a broader scale.

The Working Group is concluding negotiations with the impacted facilities’ battery manufacturers and utility companies to secure Root Cause Analysis (RCA) reports for the Warwick, East Hampton, and Chaumont fires. Subject matter experts will review and analyze the reports once they are made available.

Additionally, the Working Group has been collaborating with national labs and other nation-leading subject matter experts to review all existing codes and testing procedures pertinent to the development and electrification of battery energy storage systems. The Working Group is actively assessing all relevant codes and standards and will make recommendations to ensure building and fire codes are adequate and appropriate. Draft recommendations will be available for public comment in the first quarter of 2024.

Following the fires, the OFPC has made a Lithium-Ion Battery Awareness training course available on the DHSES E-Learning Management System for all first responders. According to the OFPC over 2,000 participants have taken the course to date.



New York State's Nation-Leading Climate Plan

New York State's nation-leading climate agenda calls for an orderly and just transition that creates family-sustaining jobs, continues to foster a green economy across all sectors and ensures that at least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities. Guided by some of the nation’s most aggressive climate and clean energy initiatives, New York is on a path to achieving a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century. A cornerstone of this transition is New York's unprecedented clean energy investments, including more than $52 billion in 118 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale up solar, nearly $3 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. These and other investments are supporting more than 165,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2021 and over 3,000 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, New York also adopted zero-emission vehicle regulations, including requiring all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in the State be zero emission by 2035. Partnerships are continuing to advance New York’s climate action with nearly 400 registered and more than 100 certified Climate Smart Communities, nearly 500 Clean Energy Communities, and the State’s largest community air monitoring initiative in 10 disadvantaged communities across the state to help target air pollution and combat climate change."

374,What Maryland Leaders Are Saying: Governor Moore Announces Approval of Historic 30-Year Agreement To Keep the Baltimore Orioles At Camden Yards,https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/what-maryland-leaders-are-saying-governor-moore-announces-approval-of-historic-30year-agreement-to-keep-the-baltimore-oriol.aspx,"Page Content



###​



— On Monday, Governor Wes Moore announced that the Board of Public Works unanimously approved a long-term agreement between the Maryland Stadium Authority and the Baltimore Orioles. The agreement – which keeps the Orioles at Camden Yards for the next thirty years – represents the fruition of countless hours of work from the Moore-Miller Administration and the Maryland Stadium Authority to deliver a deal that benefits all Maryland taxpayers, keeps the Orioles in Baltimore well into the future, and spurs economic growth – through a lens of diversity and inclusion – in the entire City of Baltimore.“The Orioles are a team not just in Baltimore, but of Baltimore, and I could not be more thrilled that they’ll continue to call Oriole Park at Camden Yards their home,”. “In the ballpark that forever changed baseball, the Orioles will continue to make their mark on our city, while the city shows them our love right back. I want to extend my thanks and congratulations to Governor Moore, Maryland Stadium Authority Chair Craig Thompson, John Angelos and the entire Orioles organization, and everyone involved in getting this deal across the finish line under sometimes difficult circumstances and lots of attention. I said from the beginning that if I had 99 problems, the Orioles staying in Baltimore weren’t one — and, as a lifelong fan, I knew that faith was warranted. I look forward to working with all of our partners as we embrace this next era for the Orioles in Baltimore and take the next steps to modernize Camden Yards to ensure the park and the surrounding area remains a fixture of our downtown for generations to come.”“An agreement that provides a pathway for the Orioles to remain in Baltimore for years to come is incredible news for our region,”. “The Orioles are a significant source of pride for families throughout Baltimore County and we are excited to continue celebrating this historic team. We are grateful to Governor Moore and partners with the Orioles organization who recognize the potential of our region — understanding that a vibrant Baltimore creates economic opportunities for our residents, communities, and businesses across the state.”“Keeping the Orioles in Baltimore is an incredible win for the State of Maryland,”. Thank you to Governor Moore for getting this deal done right. I look forward to seeing many more years of playoff baseball here in Baltimore.”“I applaud the partnership and leadership of everyone involved in this process – from the Maryland Stadium Authority to the Baltimore Orioles to leaders in the Moore-Miller Administration and beyond,”. “This final deal puts Marylanders first and delivers for Baltimore.”“Our Baltimore Orioles are the pride and joy of Baltimore City, our region, and our state. This agreement will help unlock the full potential of our region – giving baseball fans a renewed sense of optimism and positivity that the best is yet to come,”. “I greatly appreciate the partnership of the Moore-Miller Administration, Treasurer Davis, Comptroller Lierman, and others in securing this critical deal. I look forward to our continued progress in creating economic opportunities that benefit every resident, business, and visitor across our great state.”“Keeping the Orioles in Baltimore is about more than baseball. This deal will leave an enduring legacy on the trajectory of downtown Baltimore and the communities that benefit from its economic vitality. Baltimore was just ranked one of the fastest growing economies in the nation and this deal will play a pivotal role in accelerating that progress,”. “This is a win for the ballpark, a win for the 46th District and the city, and a win for the state. I am thrilled to see playoff baseball at the Yard for many years to come.”“The new long-term lease agreement between the Baltimore Orioles and Maryland Stadium Authority is an exciting milestone in continuing this remarkable Baltimore legacy for generations to come. The new agreement holds immense potential to fuel a transformative wave of economic growth throughout the Downtown corridor, marking a significant moment for our entire region, with Downtown Baltimore at its heart,”. “We look forward to continuing to be a reliable partner to both our major league teams and commend Governor Wes Moore, the Maryland Stadium Authority, and our winning Baltimore Orioles for their dedication in advancing this promising new era and getting us all across home plate. Let's Go O's!”“The GBC celebrates the Moore Administration and the Orioles for reaching this momentous agreement, ensuring they’ll remain our hometown baseball team for up to 30 years. The Orioles are an important franchise in American sports, and there's no better place for the team than in the heart of our region. We take no long-term investment for granted and commend Governor Wes Moore and the many partners who worked to secure and deliver this milestone for our city, our region, and our state,”. “We look forward to GBC’s continued partnership with the Orioles to advance the Baltimore area and anchor the future of our downtown.”“It’s been a hard fought few months to get this point,”. “Just like the 1983 World Series, a talented and dedicated team of individual leaders came together to negotiate the new Camden Yards lease. This lease will move the City of Baltimore and State of Maryland forward under terms that are fair to Marylanders and the Orioles, sparking a renaissance for downtown Baltimore.”“State assets and resources must always be used in ways that maximize the benefit to Maryland taxpayers,”. “This new lease between the Orioles and the State ensures that the Stadium Authority and the Board of Public Works continue to have rigorous oversight over how state tax dollars are spent - and recourse if needed - while also prompting the Orioles to make their share of investments over the next 30 years. The certainty that comes from knowing fans will be able to enjoy Orioles baseball for decades to come will help bolster the confidence of local businesses and attract new investment to Downtown Baltimore which will help spur continued economic growth.”"
