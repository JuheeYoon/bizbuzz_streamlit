0,0.0,0.0,Secretary Antony J. Blinken At a Defense Cooperation Agreement Signing Ceremony With Danish Foreign Minister Lars Rasmussen,https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-defense-cooperation-agreement-signing-ceremony-with-danish-foreign-minister-lars-rasmussen/,"SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good afternoon, everyone. First, let me just say I’m so delighted to welcome Foreign Minister Rasmussen here to the State Department, to the United States, and for this, I think, very important occasion. We’ve had the opportunity, Lars and I, to spend a fair bit of quality time at NATO and other places, but it’s particularly good to have you here in Washington.

For nearly 75 years, the United States and Denmark have been close security partners and NATO Allies. Our forces are working to protect communities from terror in the Sahel. We’re upholding freedom of navigation in the Straits of Hormuz. We’re strengthening deterrence together in the Baltics.

Denmark continues to play a leading role in ensuring Putin’s war on Ukraine remains a strategic failure.

It was one of the first countries to commit to supplying F-16s to Ukraine and to train Ukrainian pilots to fly them. Earlier this month, Denmark pledged to provide $1 billion worth of tanks, drones, ammunition, and to jointly fund the donation of new Swedish armored personnel characters – carriers, excuse me – all of which will help Ukraine defend its territory and its democracy.

Our countries together are committed to enabling Ukraine to stand on its own, to stand on its own strongly – militarily, economically, democratically. That’s why President Biden’s supplemental budget request is so critical, and why we’ll continue to work with Congress to pass it.

The Defense Cooperation Agreement that we’re about to sign will further strengthen security collaboration between our two countries.

When it takes effect, our militaries will be able to coordinate more effectively, even more effectively than they already are. Our troops will train together more seamlessly and more often. We’ll enhance NATO’s interoperability, allowing our Alliance to better safeguard peace and stability for people all across the continent.

Today’s agreement builds on the work that we’ve done to deepen defense cooperation with allies across the Atlantic – from Northern to Southern Europe, from the Baltics to the Black Sea.

In 2021, we signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement with Norway. Earlier this month, we signed a similar accord with Sweden. Earlier this week, we signed one with Finland. Collectively, these agreements underscore the shared commitment by the United States and our European partners to bolster European and transatlantic security.

Denmark remains an essential partner in this effort. Lars and I will have a chance to sit down after we sign this agreement, to go through the many issues and the many areas where the United States and Denmark together are dealing with the challenges of our time. We could not be more grateful to have such a strong, such a valued, such an important partner. It gives me a great source of confidence as we head into the future, knowing that our two countries not only remain strongly allied but, after today, even stronger.

Lars, over to you.

FOREIGN MINISTER RASMUSSEN: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I am indeed honored and happy and glad that we could make this happen, and right before Christmas. I think that will complete my working year. I visited you here in January as one of my first international meetings, and this will probably – at least I hope so – will be the last international travel before Christmas Eve. (Laughter.)

SECRETARY BLINKEN: My wish as well.

FOREIGN MINISTER RASMUSSEN: Yeah. So, Tony, you and I are from the same generation. We are almost the same age. We have seen history unfold at the same time in our lives, and perhaps that is why we both firmly believe in the transatlantic bond and a close alliance between Europe and the United States.

Denmark and the United States are close friends and close allies, and now we are taking our security cooperation to the next level. The Defense Cooperation Agreement is an important agreement that will bolster our bilateral security and defense cooperation. It will also enhance our cooperation in NATO and in the Nordic region.

And as you just mentioned, you have made similar agreements with our Nordic friends, and we are looking very much forward to welcoming our close Nordic neighbor and country Sweden to NATO sooner rather than later. And this defense agreement is a stepping stone towards a more secure Nordic region. It is a part of a parcel we have made during the last couple of years – enhancing our defense budget, welcoming new members to the NATO Alliance, and now these bilateral agreements. It will strengthen European and transatlantic security at a defining moment in history where we need it the most.

Mr. Secretary, we are facing multiple crises. Russia is still waging a brutal war on the European continent; terror in Israel; a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. And we both know that peace and stability cannot be taken for granted. And in time like this, friends must stick together, and that is what we are doing with this agreement.

So again, thank you, Tony. As I just wrote in your guestbook, you can always count on us, and we will always count on you. And I look forward to our conversation. But first, let us sign this agreement.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.

MODERATOR: Good morning. Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Rasmussen are signing a Defense Cooperation Agreement between the United States and Denmark. The agreement sets forth the framework for enhanced defense and security cooperation and partnership between our countries. As an original NATO membership – NATO member, Denmark is a longstanding, essential ally and strategic partnership – partner. We look forward to deepening our already close cooperation.

(The agreement was signed.)

SECRETARY BLINKEN: All right. We’ll hold this one up.

FOREIGN MINISTER RASMUSSEN: Yes. Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you, everybody.",
1,1.0,1.0,On the Occasion of Shab-e Yalda,https://www.state.gov/on-the-occasion-of-shab-e-yalda/,"The Winter Solstice, or Shab-e Yalda as it is known to millions of people in Iran and the wider region, is an important night of celebration with friends and family on the longest night of the year. Tonight, the United States recognizes this rich and festive tradition, which dates back millennia.

Shab-e Yalda should be a joyful time. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime seeks to erase the Iranian people’s vibrant history by renaming Yalda and other ancient traditions. Meanwhile, the people of Iran continue to persevere in the face of human rights abuses and economic hardship brought on by the regime’s failed leadership. Yalda is a time for hope and a commemoration of the triumph of light over darkness. It is a reminder that despite these hardships, brighter days are ahead. The United States continues to stand with the people of Iran as they seek freedom, prosperity, and respect for their human rights.",
2,2.0,2.0,New Listings Under the Section 353 Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors Report,https://www.state.gov/new-listings-under-the-section-353-corrupt-and-undemocratic-actors-report/,"The United States today announced new listings of four Nicaraguan, four Guatemalan, three Honduran, and three Salvadoran individuals under the Section 353 Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors report.

This report, published in the Federal Register, identifies individuals who have knowingly undermined democratic processes or institutions, engaged in significant corruption, or obstructed investigations into such acts of corruption in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Consistent with Section 353 of the United States–Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act, as amended, persons on the list are generally ineligible for visas and admission to the United States.

Promoting strong democratic governance in the region is a priority under the Administration’s Root Causes Strategy. Corruption and other practices that undermine democracy in Central America lead to instability and drive irregular migration. In El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, we work to promote, preserve, and restore democratic norms to build a more resilient, equitable, and prosperous hemisphere. We do this by tapping into a diverse set of accountability tools.

We call on all government leaders, civil society, journalists, the private sector, and the international community to join us in strengthening democratic governance and ending corruption.",
3,3.0,3.0,Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder Holds a Press Briefing,https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3624974/pentagon-press-secretary-maj-gen-pat-ryder-holds-a-press-briefing/,"MAJOR GENERAL PAT RYDER:  Hey good afternoon, everyone.  Thanks for your patience.  We've got quite a bit to cover at the top today so bear with me here.Secretary Austin returned to the United States last night after a successful trip to the Middle East where he had the chance to meet with leaders from Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and Israel.  During his discussions, the secretary emphasized the strong and enduring partnership between the United States and these key partner nations towards furthering our shared goals of security and stability throughout the Middle East region.Among the topics discussed during the trip was the importance of freedom of navigation in international waterways and the recent threat of Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea.  Upwards of 10 to 15 percent of global shipping transits these straits and these attacks are impacting global trade and commerce, negatively impacting the economies of nations around the world, and costing commercial shipping firms billions of dollars.To help address this challenge, while Secretary Austin was in Bahrain, he announced the stand-up of Operation Prosperity Guardian, an important new multinational security operation under the umbrella of the Combined Maritime Forces and the leadership of its Task Force 153, which focuses on security in the Red Sea.The secretary also convened a virtual ministerial from the NAVCENT headquarters in Bahrain with ministers, chiefs of defense, senior representatives from over 40 countries, as well as the European Union and NATO to discuss the increased threat to maritime security in the Red Sea.Secretary Austin underscored how the attacks from the Houthi rebels in Yemen had already impacted the global economy and will continue to threaten commercial shipping if the international community did not come together to address this issue collectively, emphasizing that this is an international problem that requires an international response.In the days ahead, the United States will continue to consult closely with our allies and partners who share the fundamental principle of freedom of navigation, and we expect to see the coalition continue to grow.Switching gears, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General CQ Brown Jr. spoke today by video teleconference with People's Liberation Army of China Chief of the Joint Staff Department General Liu Zhenli.  This is the first time the two leaders have spoken since General Brown became the Chairman.During the teleconference, General Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain an open and direct line of communication.  For more information about the call, I'd refer you to the Joint Staff and their corresponding readout.Also today, the Department of Defense is releasing the DoD Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response, which establishes the department's enduring policies, responsibilities, and procedures for mitigating and responding to civilian harm.As you may recall, in January of 2022, Secretary Austin directed the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy to develop a Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan.  This plan, which was released in August, outlines steps the department will take and the resources required to implement appropriate recommendations from recently completed studies of civilian harm.The plan also called for the publication of a DoD Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response, which is what we're publishing today.  The release of the DoD Instruction continues the process of improving the department's approach to mitigating and responding to civilian harm.In addition to the instruction, we are also launching a public-facing website which will include our current civilian harm mitigation and response policies, congressional reports, and other related documents.  The website also provides a link to the previously published web page with guidance for reporting civilian casualties.  For more information on the Civilian Mitigation and Response DoD Instruction, you'll find these on the Defense.gov website under Releases.In other news, earlier today, a ramp ceremony was conducted at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for a dignified transfer of remains of three Army Special Operations aviation soldiers who will return home to the U.S.These soldiers and American heroes perished in a helicopter mishap in the Mediterranean on November 10th.  The incident claimed the lives of five American soldiers, two of whom were recovered immediately after the mishap.The team at Dover will work now to confirm the identities of our three recovered soldiers before a dignified transfer to return them to their families, who were present for their repatriation.  The department is proud of the tireless efforts of all involved to bring our service members home, and our thoughts and prayers continue to remain with the families and friends of our fallen teammates.And finally, as you all know, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, defends our North American airspace each and every day.  However, on Christmas Eve, NORAD has one additional special mission -- tracking Santa as he makes his way across the globe.This is NORAD's 68th year conducting this important mission, and children and families worldwide will be able to call to ask NORAD's live operators about Santa's location on the 24th, starting at 6 am Eastern Standard Time.The phone number to call is 1-877-HINORAD, ""Hi Norad,"" or 877-446-6723.  You will also be able to track St. Nick's annual journey on the NORAD Track Santa website, Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube.  And last year alone, NORAD answered over 73,000 calls just on December 24th alone and the program generated more than two million social media followers.Every year, more than 1,000 American and Canadian members of NORAD volunteer, and a variety of corporate contributors are proud to continue the tradition of tracking Santa.And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.  We'll start with AP, who's on the phone.  Lita Baldor?Q:  Thank you, Pat.  Two things.  One, the Secretary met in Israel with his counterpart, Minister Gallant.  Can you say in any context or detail what Israel's reaction was to the Secretary and the Chairman's urgings for a more limited campaign in the war, sort of a scaled back campaign?  Can you just give us any context on what their reaction may have been, what we can expect?And then just secondly on the maritime program that's ongoing, can you say exactly how many countries are actively participating right now?  Should we expect to see the U.S. and other ships there all the time?  Are they going to take turns?  Can you just give us a better grasp of how these countries -- I think you said that -- had said 10 -- there were about 10 initially.  How are they going to sort of take part in this?  How will that work?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, thanks, Lita.  On your first question, again, I'm not going to speak for Minister Gallant.  If you had the chance to catch the press conference in Tel Aviv with the Secretary and the Minister, Secretary Austin made a few things very clear.First of all, he was not there to dictate timelines.  This is Israel's campaign.  But during their meetings, they did have the opportunity to talk about the status of the campaign, they had the opportunity to talk about milestones and the phasing of the campaign, to include transitioning from higher-intensity operations to lower-intensity operations, which, oh by the way, are part of any military campaign and does not necessarily indicate that a campaign has ended.So they were very productive conversations, and again, I think Minister Gallant spoke to where the Israeli military is at this moment.  And so I'd refer you back to those comments.As far as Operation Prosperity Guardian, we've had over 20 nations now sign on to participate.  The nations that have agreed to publicly discuss their participation, we've put those out there.  Since the announcement on Tuesday, Australia and Greece have also highlighted their participation in this operation.  But again, we'll allow other countries and defer to them to talk about their participation.The key point here is that this -- as I mentioned at the top, this is a international problem and it requires an international response.  And so we'll continue to work with this coalition of the willing and all countries will be able to contribute what they feel that they can.  In some cases, that will include vessels.  In other cases, it could include staff or other types of support.And so again, we'll continue to work together to safeguard the shipping lanes through the Red Sea.  Thank you.Let me go to Liz here.Q:  A follow-up on that -- is the U.S. sending more vessels into the Red Sea to accompany these commercial vessels?GEN. RYDER:  So I don't have anything to announce, Liz, in terms of additional vessels.  Clearly, we already have some ships that are in the region.  And again, we'll work with our partners and our allies, in terms of what other ships will come in.I will say that there has been a, as you know, an increase in the number of U.S. ships that are in that region.  You've got the Mason, the -- and the Carney and others that have been there to support vessels -- or to support commercial shipping.  So, nothing to announce right now.  But obviously, something we'll continue to keep you updated on.Q:  Separate topic, to follow-up on General Brown's phone call with his Chinese counterpart this morning, are there any plans to reactivate the military-to-military hotline with China?GEN. RYDER:  So, I don't -- I don't have anything to announce on that front.  You know, as I highlighted, we think it's very important to keep the lines of communication open, so that's something that we'll continue to actively do.The last follow-up.Q:  (Inaudible).  Did China agree to continue to regularly communicate with the U.S. military?GEN. RYDER:  I'm not going to speak for China.  Clearly, you know our position and we're going to continue to do everything we can do to keep those lines of communication open.Let me go over here to Will.Q:  Just regarding the Red Sea coalition, can you talk a little bit more about what specific steps the coalition's going to take to protect shipping?  Are we talking, you know, escorting ships?  Reflagging potentially?  Carrying out strikes on launch sites?  Or just what is this going to entail?GEN. RYDER:  Yes.  Thanks, Will.  So, bear with me here, because I'm -- I kind of want to lean into this a little bit and just provide some additional context here.So, you know, it's very important to understand that the Houthis aren't attacking just one country.  They're really attacking the international community.  They are attacking the economic wellbeing and prosperity of nations around the world.  So, in effect, they've really become bandits along the international highway that is the Red Sea.  And so, the forces assigned to Operation Prosperity Guardian will serve as a highway patrol of sorts.  Patrolling the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden to respond to and assist as necessary, commercial vessels that are transiting this vital international waterway.It's a defensive coalition meant to reassure global shipping in mariners that the international community is there to help with safe passage.  And so, in terms of the specifics, in terms of tactics, I'm not going to get into ROE and what that entails.  But the way to think of this is a highway patrol along the highway that are there to cover the zone.As it's been described to me, the distance we're talking here -- about here from the Suez Canal down to the Gulf of Aden is about the distance from Boston to Washington, D.C.  So, you're talking about a pretty extensive stretch of water that the international community will be covering.Last thing I'd say on this is that the Houthis need to stop these attacks.  They need to stop them now.  You know, that's clear and simple.  And they really need to ask themselves if they've bitten off more than they can chew when it comes to taking on the entire international community and negatively impacting billions and billions of dollars in global trade, economic prosperity and international law.  Thank you.Q:  One additional one.  On the call between the chairman and his Chinese counterpart, let's talk a little bit about the significance of presumption of talks on that level.  I know that this is something that the U.S. has pushed for.  So, how significant is this, that it's happening now, I guess?GEN. RYDER:  Well, I think it's a positive development.  You know, we're clearly working here to implement what was announced by President Biden and Chairman Xi in November.  But we've said all along that, when you have two large militaries it's imperative that we keep lines of communication open in order to prevent miscalculation and the potential that that carries with it as far as risks of operating in certain areas.So again, we're going to continue to press on that.  Thank you.Tom?Q:  Just a follow-up on Will's question.  Since the task force Operation Prosperity Guardian stood up on Tuesday, I believe, have there been any strikes or has there been any kinetic action that you can update us on like the last few days?GEN. RYDER:  By the United States?Q:  Yes.  Or by the coalition as a whole?GEN. RYDER:  I'm not tracking any.  Again, this is a defensive coalition that is there to help reassure global shipping and mariners as they transit the straits.Q:  The fact that you haven't seen anything, would you read into that, that it's having a deterrent effect?GEN. RYDER:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I misunderstood your question.  Attacks by the Houthis against shipping?Q:  Yes, so my first question I was asking -- sorry if it's -- if there has been any kind of any action from the U.S. against the Houthis in retaliation for any strikes (inaudible)?GEN. RYDER:  We have not conducted any strikes against the Houthis.Q:  And the fact that you haven't seen any, you say you haven't seen any, is that -- would you say that the task force is having a deterrent effect?GEN. RYDER:  The fact that the U.S. has not conducted any strikes?  The fact that they haven't conducted any strikes.You know, I hope so.  But, you know, again, what we're going to do is we're going to continue to work with the international community to safeguard those vessels that are transiting those waterways.  And I would hope that the Houthis would understand, you know, the pressure that they are going to bring onto themselves if they don't stop these attacks.  But again, we'll continue to monitor closely.Let me go Chris and then I'll go to the phone here.Q:  Thanks, Pat.  Two questions on Operation Prosperity Guardian.  Is this coalition of the willing under any certain unified command for these nations?  How are you -- how is that being coordinated?GEN. RYDER:  So, this is under combined maritime forces, which is already an existing coalition of the willing of 39 different nations, okay?  So, that is a coalition that has been around for a while that brings nations together to address regional security and stability when comes to maritime operations.  A subset of the coalition maritime forces is Task Force 153, which has been in existence for about 18 months, which provides the leadership, command and control for Red Sea security operations.Now, the question that -- you know -- that we've gotten the question, well if you already had this why do you need Prosperity Guardian.  It's an important question and a good question.  By virtue of the fact that we already have a standing structure, a framework upon which to build, Prosperity Guardian is an operation that is underneath 153.  Task Force 153 can do other things, but it's an operation nested underneath Task Force 153.And by virtue of it being a coalition of the willing, that means that countries can provide what they feel they can contribute based on their national priorities and national domestic decisions.  So, as certain requirements start to present themselves, in this case, addressing the threat that Houthis are, you know, providing or, you know, doing here in the Red Sea, nations have a framework now upon which to pull together and address these together.Q:  And the same question on that.  Are any U.S. air assets part of Operation Prosperity Guardian or is this purely surface vessels that include the MEU or carrier strike groups, for example?  And if you don't have all those details, could you take that back?GEN. RYDER:  Yes, and so I'm not -- I'm not going to go into the specifics in terms of which capabilities or which assets, per se, but yes, air will be a part of this. You know, when -- especially when it comes to maritime domain awareness, air power is always a significant contributor to that.  So, let me go to the phones here.  Let me go to Jeff Schogol, ""Task and Purpose.""Q:  Thank you.  The -- the United States recently launched a -- a drone strike in Somalia, targeting a -- an Al-Shabab leader.  Can you say who is that leader?  And who exactly was killed in the strike?GEN. RYDER:  Thanks -- thanks, Jeff.  So you saw AFRICOM's -- you know, what they've put on -- on this strike.  I don't have any additional details to provide at this time.  If and when we do, we'll certainly put that out.Let me go to Howard Altman, War Zone.Q:  Hey, thanks, Pat.  A couple of -- couple questions.  Does the -- any concerns about the Navy having enough vessels to adequately staff Operation Prosperity Guardian?And today, the Houthis -- the Houthi leader came out and -- and directly threatened the U.S., should there be an attack.  Does that raise the stakes here?  And are you developing any kind of strike packages against the Houthis in Yemen?GEN. RYDER:  Thank -- thanks, Howard.  So on your latter question, you know, as you know, longstanding policy, I'm not going to telegraph, forecast, or speculate on any type of kinetic action.And as far as, you know, the U.S. Navy and its ability to provide the capabilities that we need, I mean, this is one of the significant aspects about the U.S. military, is that we have the ability to surge capabilities to where we need them to address situations around the globe, and the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility is no different.And so as we require capabilities, we have a very longstanding process in place by which to determine requirements, make decisions, and then surge forces into the theater.  And so this will be no different in that sense of the word.Let me come back to the room.  Fadi?Q:  Thank you.  I have two questions on -- on (inaudible).  So -- so you're talking about an international coalition to address the attacks by Houthis in the Red Sea.  Are you able to say whether any country on the Red Sea is -- is part of this coalition?  And why none of the major Arab states announced their participation in -- in the coalition?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, again, we will defer to individual countries within their level of comfort to talk about their participation in this coalition.  So beyond the countries that we've already highlighted, I don't have any new countries to flag for you here today.Q:  And then again on the warning by the (inaudible) leader of the Houthis in Yemen, he warned the U.S. not to take any military actions inside Yemen.  I'm not asking about future operations, but within the framework of the Prosperity Guardian, do nations have any type of authority or mission to attack Houthi targets inside Yemen, in response to attacking commercial vessels, or is it mainly defensive against any projectiles that might be, you know, going in the direction of U.S. Navy or French or whoever is there?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, this is a defensive coalition.  Again, think of it as the Highway Patrol to help safeguard maritime, you know, vessels going through the Strait.  Thank you.Janne?Q:  Thank you, General.  Regarding North Korea's long-range ICBM launches, what is final result of the United States and allies of North Korea's long-range ICBM launches?GEN. RYDER:  Janne, you know we've highlighted the fact that we condemn this launch and any destabilizing actions by North Korea, but I'm not going to get into any intelligence.Q:  In response to North Korea's ICBMs, a joint air exercise between U.S. and South Korea, Japan, is being conducted in South Korea with the B-1B strategic bombers.  Can we say that the -- our allies' ultimate goal towards North Korea is to behead Kim Jong-un?GEN. RYDER:  Look, Janne, we remain committed to a diplomatic approach and continue to call on the DPRK to engage in dialogue.  We harbor no hostile intent to North Korea and we've made that very clear.  What we're focused on is regional security and stability and working closely with our ROK and Japanese allies, as well as other allies and partners in the region, to ensure that everyone in that region can live peacefully and safely, and that's what we'll continue to stay focused on.Let me go -- yes, sir?Q:  Thank you, General.  Two questions if you don't mind.  Has there been any new attacks on your forces in Iraq and Syria?GEN. RYDER:  I don't have anything right in front of me, so I'd refer you to our press desk and we can get you those details.Q:  Do you have any information that Iranian drones used by these groups in Iraq and Syria against your forces?GEN. RYDER:  I'm sorry, say that again?Q:  I mean, do you have any information that Iranian-made drones used by, like, militant groups in Iraq and Syria, even by Houthis, against your forces?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, I mean, we know that Iranian proxies are trained, resourced, equipped by Iranian forces obviously.  That's why they're Iranian proxies.  And so again, you know, all roads lead to Iran when it comes to sponsoring these attacks.  Thank you very much.Let me go over here.  Yes, sir?Q:  Thank you, Pat. You describe the mission of the task force as being defensive and the forces are patrolling the region, but are they going to prevent these kind of attacks only limited with this force tasked or in case of continuation of these threats?  Are there any other possibilities that the Pentagon is considering to avoid the increasing threat that's -- it -- since it's of -- putting a big pressure on the international trade and markets as well?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, so again, I'm not going to speculate or talk about, you know, any potential future operations.  The point I'm trying to make here is that as the Houthis conduct these attacks, they need to realize they're attacking the international community, they are negatively affecting the economic prosperity of millions of people, billions of people worldwide, and that has got to stop.So we will continue to work with our allies and partners.  The purpose of Prosperity Guardian is to help reassure commercial shipping and mariners as they transit the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and we'll continue to stay focused on that.All right ...Q:  ... question about Gaza.  Just will -- the number of the civilian casualties, according to the local authorities, is over 2,000 casualties among civilians only ...Q:  20,000, sorry.  So just at the eve of the Christmas, is Gaza going to enter a new year with the same bombardment and operation causing threat for the civilians?  Is the Secretary -- did the Secretary actually make contact with his Israeli counterparts to avoid this threat within the upcoming days?GEN. RYDER:  Yeah, well, first of all, I mean, you know, again, we think it is tragic when any innocent civilian is killed, whether that's Palestinian, Israeli, and you know no one wants to see that. So, we will continue to communicate with our Israeli partners on the importance of taking civilian safety into account in their operations. As for timelines, again, that’s really something I’d refer you to the Israelis to talk about and as I highlighted, the Secretary did have a conversation with his counterpart on phasing of operations – thinking through transitions of operations, but really, I’d have to refer you to the IDF for that. Thank you. Yes sir?Q:  Yes, so with new Ukraine aid package not coming any time soon, and the last of your (inaudible) running out, do you have an assessment of what the impact will be for Ukraine, especially on the battlefield?GEN. RYDER:  Yes, thanks for the question.  As our comptroller recently said in his letter to Congress, we will be obligating the remaining $1 billion in replacement funds by the end of this month.  And once those funds are obligated, we will have exhausted the funding available for us to provide security assistance to Ukraine.So it really does underscore the importance of congressional support for Ukraine.  We would, again, continue to urge the passage of the supplemental that we've submitted.  As you look at the situation that Ukraine finds itself in, we will obviously continue to support them.  But it is imperative that we have the funds needed to ensure that they get the most urgent battlefield capabilities that they require.Q:  You don't know what it will look good on the battlefield, you know, if Congress doesn't pass any time soon?GEN. RYDER:  I'm not going to speculate.  Clearly Ukraine has been able to develop a very capable military.  But, you know, the war continues to be difficult, continues to be a very challenging fight, and to be able to maintain and sustain that force going into the future against an enemy that has said its objective is to eliminate Ukraine, we feel that it's very important to be able to have the resources necessary to enable them to continue engaging in the fight.  Thanks very much.Sir.Q:  Thank you.  Japan government (inaudible) on Friday, meaning tomorrow, (inaudible) for Patriot missile shipment to U.S.  So in terms of this issue, what is the Pentagon's reaction and how does the Pentagon assist Japan -- Japan's decision?GEN. RYDER:  Yes, I've seen the press reporting on that.  You know, look, Japan is one of our strongest allies.  We discuss a wide range of issues in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.  When it comes to things like Patriots, that’s really something I'd refer you to the government of Japan to talk about.  The only other thing I'd say on this is, you know, we continue to see our alliance grow.  And it's stronger than it's ever been.  Thank you.Ma'am.Q:  Thank you.  And I'd like to ask about Ospreys in Japan.  And can you give us an update on the Osprey stand-down and like how long would it last?  And is there any update on the investigation about the crash itself?GEN. RYDER:  Sure.  I don't have any updates to provide in terms of the investigation, the ongoing investigation.  Certainly, at the appropriate time the Air Force will release more information on that.  As we've talked about before, we do continue to stay in close communication with the government of Japan and are committed to being as transparent as we can in terms of that investigation.As far as the status of this individual service stand-downs and the Ospreys, I'd refer to those services to talk about that.Let me go to the phone and then I'll come to Mike here.Heather from USNI.Let me go to Meghann, Military Times.Q:  I was going to ask for an Iraq and Syria update, but I will send an email instead.GEN. RYDER:  Okay, thanks Meghann.  Appreciate it.  Mike.Q:  Yes, I want to change the subject a little bit, 2023 was the worse recruiting year for the military since the end of the All -- or since the start of the All-Volunteer Force, as you -- as you well know.  Is the Pentagon -- as we move into the new year, it's going -- the Pentagon's going to have the smallest military since pre-World War II levels.Does the Defense Department, is it -- is it concerned that these numbers are going to continue trending down in 2024?  Or are you at all optimistic -- are there any signs for optimism that maybe you'll see, you know, the light at the end of the tunnel kind of?GEN. RYDER:  Well, Mike, I'm an eternal optimist.  So, I'm going to say we're optimistic.  But, you know, we know that this continues to be a challenge for a multitude of reasons.  You know, COVID did not help in the sense of our efforts to recruit and, you know, obviously, now that we're past that we're starting to see our recruiters be able to do the face-to-face kind of communication that is absolutely essential to recruiting efforts.You're seeing the services look at many different types of ways to get out and engage with today's youth, as far as highlighting the opportunities that military service and the benefits that it can provide.  And there's a wide range of things, you know, to include the Army's efforts to, you know, help young people get physically fit and at the same time explore the opportunities about the military and the Air Force side aviation camps where young people can get to experience aviation, et cetera, et cetera.So, the services continue to be very active and creative in looking at how we can communicate with the public that we serve.  And so, you know, Secretary Austin has said we didn't get into this problem overnight and it's not going to be solved overnight.  But we are confident that we will continue to see those numbers increase and it's something that we'll, obviously, continue to work very hard at.At the end of the day, you know, the U.S. military provides something that very few employers can, which is the opportunity to have amazing benefits, amazing experience and training, whether you want to stay in the military for a short term or do it for a career.  But it also enables you to be a part of something that's bigger than yourself and contribute to something important.And so, you know, a lot of young people when they talk about the kinds of things they want to do, they want to do something impactful, they want to be a part of something bigger than themselves, the military is a place where you can do that.And so, we'll continue to try to get that message out.  And we'll see where 2024 takes us.(Liz ?)?Q:  (Inaudible) Ukraine funding for U.S. stockpiles at all?GEN. RYDER:  So again, you know, when it comes to the budget and the NDAA, you know, certainly we'll be looking for our ability to replenish our own stockpiles and we'll continue to do that.  The Ukraine supplemental, of course, would help us replenish those -- fund those stockpiles.  But we'll continue to do what we need to do to make sure our own readiness levels stay at where they need to be.  Thank you.Sir?  Time for a few moreQ:  Thank you very much.  General, regarding to these developments in the Red Sea, does the DOD still, in its position which is they are not in a war with the Houthis, and do you have a concern that maybe the conflict there getting escalation -- or more escalated because of what's going on there?  I mean, for the Maritimes on, you know, Prosperity Guardian aren't with the Houthis (inaudible)?  Thank you.GEN. RYDER:  So, just to make sure I understand you question correctly, are we concerned about this escalating into a broader conflict?  Well, that's exactly what we're trying to prevent.  You know, look, we don't want to see these types of reckless, dangerous and illegal activities affecting freedom of navigation through the Red Sea.And so, you know, we would obviously call on the Houthis, as I did earlier, to cease this activity and to safeguard innocent lives.  And the economic prosperity of nations around the world, to include nations in the Middle East region that rely on the trade and economic impact that these straits provide.  Thank you.Last question, we'll go to Jim.Q:  General, just like to jump on Mike's question a little bit.  One of the problems with recruiting is that the veteran's population is also the smallest in memory.  And there are a lot of Americans who don't understand the benefits of joining the military.  Is there going to be any kind of an outreach to the general American public by the department to, perhaps, educate them on what the military does?  And perhaps get these influencers to talk to their children to enlist (inaudible)?GEN. RYDER:  Yes, Jim, well that's happening every day.  I mean, whether it's the Department of Defense proper here out of the Pentagon, as you know, we have a strategic engagement division that does a multitude of community activities that are meant to communicate and inform many different influential groups like veteran's organizations or military service organizations.But importantly, the individual services also do those things, both from a macro and a micro level, from the headquarters level down to the unit level.  You know, in my own experiences working at a base, conducting things like base tours or going out to local schools.  Or when you have airshows or parades or sporting events, I mean, there are many different ways for people to learn about the military.Now, you know, the analysis has shown that at the end of the day it's a conversation with someone versus just a -- you know -- it's important websites and billboards and advertisements are important, but at the end of the day it's the conversation about - tell me more about it.  What does this mean?  What does this look like?  Breaking down some of the stereotypes in terms of what military life actually is versus what the perception is based on, you know, popular programming or TV.And so, by the ability to have those conversations and this is where having recruiters being able to go back to schools and engage with people face-to-face becomes critical.  And so, we don't take anything for granted.  Look, at the end of the day, one of the strengths of the U.S. military is the fact that is an all-volunteer military.And that each of us here takes the oath of office and the oath to protect and defend the Constitution by choice.  No one's making us do this.  And it makes us more resilient.  It makes us a more powerful military because we are defending the people from which we come.So, we're going to continue to stay after that, because at the end of the day we have a very important mission, and the American public expects us to do that.  But what I would tell any prospective recruit is the United States military provides an opportunity unlike any you will ever get to experience.  It's an amazing place to develop and really, again, be a part of something bigger than yourself.And on that note, before we conclude, I just have a couple other things I'd like to say.  I would like to highlight that this will be the last press briefing from the podium before the end of the year.  Our next briefing in here will be on January 4.  And on behalf of Secretary Austin and the Department of Defense, I'd like to recognize all of our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, Guardians, Coast Guardsmen, and DOD civilians who are serving around the world, many of them under austere and dangerous conditions, protecting our nation and safeguarding the freedoms we enjoy.We also want to thank the families of our service members for their service and sacrifice in support of our military and our nation.  As I mentioned to Jim, today's U.S. Armed Forces, they really comprise the most lethal, combat-capable military the world has ever known thanks to our service members and the families who support them, and we're grateful for all that they do every day for our nation.I would also like to thank you, the members of the Pentagon Press Corps, for what you do to keep the American public and the international community informed about our Department of Defense.  Our republic is well-served thanks to your efforts as a free and independent press to report on critical defense issues, promote transparency, and ensure that the American people have a good understanding of what its military is doing every day around the world in support of our nation and our interests.I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and I look forward to seeing you on January 4.  Please don't call me before then.  Thank you.(Laughter.)",

Gen. Pat Ryder at a Pentagon news conference today.The press secretary detailed how Operation Prosperity Guardian will work and called on the Houthis, an Iranian proxy group, to cease targeting international commerce.Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III announced the operation during a trip to the Middle East that ended last night. The secretary met with leaders in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Israel during the trip. ""The secretary emphasized the strong and enduring partnership between the United States and his key partner nations towards furthering our shared goals of security and stability throughout the Middle East region,"" Ryder said.Austin discussed the importance of freedom of navigation in international waterways and the threat the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea pose to world commerce. Between 10 and 15 percent of global shipping flows through the Red Sea, ""and these attacks are impacting global trade and commerce, negatively impacting the economies of nations around the world and costing commercial shipping firms billions of dollars,"" Ryder said.In Bahrain, Austin announced Operation Prosperity Guardian. The operation is a new multinational security operation under the umbrella the Combined Maritime Forces and the leadership of Task Force 153, which focuses on security in the Red Sea.Austin further convened a virtual ministerial from Bahrain with ministers, chiefs of defense and senior representatives from more than 40 countries as well as representatives from the European Union and NATO to discuss the increased threat to maritime security in the Red Sea.Austin used the forum to highlight the effects of the Houthi attacks and called on the representatives to act collectively. The nations must come together ""to address this issue collectively, emphasizing that this is an international problem that requires an international response,"" Ryder said.There have been solid results: To date more than 20 nations have signed on to participate, Ryder said. ""In the days ahead, the United States will continue to consult closely with our allies and partners who share the fundamental principle of freedom of navigation, and we expect to see the coalition continue to grow,"" he said.The operation is a global answer to an international issue and the United States will continue to ""work with this coalition of the willing where countries will be able to contribute what they feel that they can,"" Ryder said. Some of these contributions are military assets like ships and aircraft and other contributions include staff and other types of support.""It's very important to understand that the Houthis aren't attacking just one country, they're really attacking the international community,"" Ryder said. ""They are attacking the economic well-being and prosperity of nations around the world. So in effect, they really become bandits along the international highway that is the Red Sea.""To further this analogy, the forces assigned to Operation Prosperity Guardian, will serve the highway patrol in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden ""to respond to and assist as necessary commercial vessels that are transiting this vital international waterway,"" the general said. ""It's a defensive coalition meant to reassure global shipping and mariners that the international community is there to help with safe passage.""The area is large, roughly the distance between Boston and Washington, D.C., and the operation will work to assure safe passage all along the way.""Last thing I'd say on this is that the Houthis need to stop these attacks, and they need to stop them now,"" Ryder said. ""That's clear and simple. They really need to ask themselves if they've bitten off more than they can chew, when it comes to taking on the entire international community and negatively impacting billions and billions, billions of dollars in global trade, economic prosperity and international law.""",

8,8.0,8.0,DOD Announces Release of Department of Defense Instruction and Website on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response,https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3624661/dod-announces-release-of-department-of-defense-instruction-and-website-on-civil/,"Today, the Department of Defense released the DOD Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response, which establishes the Department’s enduring policies, responsibilities, and procedures for mitigating and responding to civilian harm.In a Jan. 2022 memorandum, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III directed the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy to develop a Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan (CHMR-AP) to outline steps the Department will take and the resources required to implement appropriate recommendations from recently completed studies of civilian harm, and to complete and present to him for signature a DOD Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response. On August 25, 2022, the Department of Defense released the CHMR-AP, which laid out a comprehensive approach, reinforcing that the Department of Defense’s efforts to protect civilians are the responsibility of all leaders throughout the Department.This DOD Instruction is a milestone in the implementation of the CHMR-AP. The issuance of this policy continues the process of improving the Department’s approach to mitigating and responding to civilian harm, including by formalizing DOD policies, responsibilities, and procedures related to CHMR and by creating a reinforcing framework of processes and institutions which will improve strategic outcomes and optimize military operations.The DOD Instruction further ensures operational commanders are supported with institutional resources, tools, and capabilities to effectively implement law of war protections of civilians, and to enable further steps to protect civilians and to respond appropriately when civilian harm occurs.In addition to the issuance of the DOD Instruction, the Department has created the Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response website in accordance with the CHMR-AP, which will serve as a repository for DOD policies, reports and other information related to civilian harm mitigation. The website also provides a link to the previously published webpage with guidance for reporting civilian casualties.The DOD Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response can be found here.The link to the Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response website can be found here.",
9,9.0,9.0,"DOD Issues Civilian Harm Mitigation, Response Instruction",https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3624268/dod-issues-civilian-harm-mitigation-response-instruction/,"Defense Department officials have completed work on a DOD instruction that incorporates the direction of the department's civilian harm mitigation and response action plan.Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder made the announcement during a news conference today.The department has long recognized that causing civilian casualties produces a moral dilemma for service members and the protection of civilian populations just makes strategic sense.When then-Army Gen. Stan McCrystal took command in Afghanistan in 2009, he looked at the situation in the country and concluded that protection of civilian populations in the country was a paramount objective. ""We will not win based on the number of Taliban killed, but instead on our ability to separate insurgents from the center of gravity — the people,"" he wrote at the time. ""That means we must respect and protect the population from coercion and violence — and operate in a manner which will win their support.""Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III recognized this priority and in January 2022 he directed the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl to develop a Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan to outline steps the department will take, and the resources needed to put the recommendations in place. From this effort would come the DOD instruction, officials said.The new instruction formally establishes DOD's enduring policies, responsibilities and procedures regarding preventing and mitigating civilian harm. The U.S. military has long had these concerns, but this places them all under one instruction and re-emphasizes the importance of the concept.The instruction establishes U.S. policy on pre- and post-strike measures to address civilian casualties in U.S. operations involving the use of force, officials said. It also directs the appointment of a senior DOD civilian official ""to develop, coordinate and oversee compliance.""The instruction demonstrates the importance DOD places on protecting civilian populations and the department's commitment to the responsible use of military force, officials said.Moreover, the instruction also spells out that the department understands that better strategic outcomes are achieved by improving civilian harm mitigation and response.The instruction is the action plan for commanders up and down the chain to follow. It also serves as a standard for all service members to meet and demonstrates DOD's transparency in this matter.Overall, the instruction will facilitate establishing doctrine, policies, tactics and operational processes related to civilian harm military response. It also will help develop capabilities and processes that enhance battlespace awareness of the presence of civilians and civilian objects.The instruction will also emphasize military capability improvements that could reduce risks to civilians.The instruction will also cover assessments of civilian harm that may have resulted from U.S. military operations and investigations of incidents of alleged civilian harm.Finally, the instruction will seek to incorporate the policy and practices in multinational operations and operations with non-state armed groups, and the integration of these efforts into DOD security cooperation and security assistance.The new instruction will not magically stop all civilian casualties. The fog of war is still dense and mistakes happen. It will not answer all questions because each incident or situation is different. How does a unit behave when an enemy is purposely using the civilian population as shields? Are civilian casualties ever justified? Who makes those decisions? Is there any difference between civilian casualties of a nation state and those associated with terror groups?The instruction calls for continued research and discussion of all aspects of civilian harm mitigation and response.",

12,12.0,12.0,Television and Movie Star Brian Keith Was Also a Marine,https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/Story/Article/3624417/television-and-movie-star-brian-keith-was-also-a-marine/,"Actor Brian Keith has been the judge on the television series ""Hardcastle and McCormick,"" the uncle in ""Family Affair,"" Teddy Roosevelt in the movie ""The Wind and the Lion,"" and the father in ""The Parent Trap.""He also starred in movies including ""Death Before Dishonor,"" ""Young Guns,"" ""Sharky's Machine,"" and many others.Keith was also in the Marine Corps during World War II and saw plenty of action in the South Pacific.Keith was the sort of kid recruiters dream about enlisting. He simply walked in and signed up without requiring the usual sales pitch. Unlike most World War II Marines, he joined the Corps before Pearl Harbor and unlike many Marines, he wasn't influenced to join by a recruiter, friend or family member with a seabag full of tales.""When I was nine or 10, during the early Great Depression years, I sold 'Liberty' magazines,"" he said. ""I used to enjoy reading the 'War Dog' section of the paper, featuring stories of Marines at Belleau Wood, in China and other places. I also read John W. Thomason books like 'Fix Bayonets!' I longed to play a part in those exotic adventures.""In the summer of 1941, Keith enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve and went to work in the Grumman Aircraft factory near his hometown of East Rockaway, Long Island, New York.Then the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Dec. 7, 1941.""Within a month of Pearl Harbor, I was on a train to Parris Island for eight weeks of boot camp,"" he said, referring to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in South Carolina.""I can still remember the names of my three drill instructors. They were actually pretty nice guys — really. Well, one of them wasn't too friendly,"" he remembered.""I fired expert on the rifle and pistol ranges and was selected to become a marksmanship instructor at Officers Candidate School in Quantico, Virginia. I recall my rifle range staff noncommissioned officer at Quantico, an old gunnery sergeant with a wooden hand. He'd lost it fighting in Nicaragua, but still fired the rifle and pistol with it. He always wore a black glove over that hand.""As the summer of 1942 approached, Marines took the offensive and landed on Guadalcanal. That summer, he was ordered to San Diego, arriving by train. From there, he boarded a ship to Hawaii, then to Midway — where the decisive battle had been fought June 4, 1942 — then back to Hawaii and then to Bougainville in the Solomon Islands.""Talk about a roundabout way to go to war,"" he said.""I was assigned to VMSB-244, where I became a gunner on the SBD Douglas Dauntless dive bomber, flying bombing missions to Rabaul through the 'Valley of Death,'"" he said. VMSB-244 is a Marine scout bombing squadron.""A gunner's job is straightforward, or in my case 'straight backward',"" he noted. ""While the pilot released his bombs looking forward, I sat behind him looking backward, firing twin .30-caliber guns at Zeroes — also known as Zekes — which were tailgating us.""The pilot doesn't merely drop his I00- and 500-pound bombs while flying leisurely over targets. He dives. These dives are vertical and sometimes our angle of dive is steeper than 90 degrees,"" he said. ""We start at I0,000 to 15,000 feet and level out near the ground. The pilot fires twin .50-caliber tracers to vector his bombs on target, firing at Zeroes behind us and to the side. The enemy on the ground is firing up at us. What a ride!""We were lucky,"" he continued. ""Our airplane took a lot of hits, including a three-foot-long hole in the wing. One time my earphones were shot off. Many of my buddies weren't so lucky.""Keith recalled a close call when two Zeroes were tailing them. ""My gun overheated from firing, and they were still coming. In desperation, I shot double red flares at them. Help arrived just in time when a Navy pilot shot one of them down.""It required a team effort for Keith's pilots, two of whom were sergeants, to drop their bombs on target, he said. Army Air Corps P38 Lockheed Lightnings and PS I Mustangs provided three layers of air cover from 20,000 to 30,000 feet.Flying at about 15,000 feet were the Marine F4U Corsairs, including Marine Corps Maj. Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington's Black Sheep Squadron.Low cover — I0,000 feet and below — was provided by New Zealanders flying P40 Kittyhawks, called Curtiss Warhawks, by the U.S. Army Air Corps.""Pappy's squadron flew cover for us every other day,"" he said. ""His squadron was different from other Corsair squadrons in the novel way they flew.""Once Keith made it safely back to the Bougainville airfield, there was very little rest and respite.Japanese guerrillas intermittently attacked them from jungle hide-outs. ""We got peppered with mortars and machine-gun fire,"" he said. ""The Japanese mortarmen got to be quite proficient at dropping them in at the right place.""A 16-year-old mechanic once spent 24 hours working on a plane. No sooner had he finished the job, then a mortar landed squarely on it, blowing it to smithereens,"" Keith said.""The lad, who had until then been admiring his work from a distance, became so infuriated that he grabbed a Browning Automatic Rifle, an E-tool shovel and a bag of grenades and singlehandedly stomped off into the jungle in pursuit of the Japanese who had destroyed his work,"" Keith related.""He found them in a pillbox, where he jumped in and clobbered them with his E-tool,"" he said.""Once when I was playing cards with my buddies in our tent, I stepped outside to get a breath of air. I saw some Japanese approaching and ran back inside the tent to warn the others. 'Nah, you're seeing things,' they said. 'The Japanese couldn't possibly have infiltrated this far inside the wire.'""Just then a row of neatly spaced bullet holes appeared through the tent. I was the first one into the fighting hole, with the others diving in on top of me.""The Japanese were fanatical,"" said Keith. ""I've seen them charge at us — outgunned and wearing only baseball caps — across the wide-open fields of our perimeter.""Keith spent the next two years as a gunner flying missions to Rabaul from Bougainville and several other small islands nearby. Marines from other units bypassed Rabaul, sailing westward to Guam, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and other islands.Rabaul, however, was never taken by the Americans. It wasn't of vital strategic importance and many Americans would have been needlessly killed. The island was neutralized with the help of men like Keith and Boyington so that the Japanese were never able to mount a major rear area offensive from it.The Navy awarded Keith the coveted Air Medal for his efforts.Keith's medal was signed by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal and Navy Vice Adm. William ""Bull"" Halsey, commander, South Pacific.Boyington was awarded a Medal of Honor and a Navy Cross.Finally, Keith was given a 30-day pass to go home to New York for Christmas in I944. After taking leave, Keith was ordered to Oak Grove, North Carolina, to fly as a gunner for new pilots, training on SB2C Curtiss-Wright Helldivers.""I was more scared of those pilots than I was of the Japanese,"" he admitted. ""My buddy crashed and wound up with a permanently wrecked back. I longed to return to my unit, which was now fighting in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.""Unfortunately, Keith's glorious career ended on an ignominious note. ""The day after V-J Day, we were celebrating in a Miami club. I didn't see it coming,"" he said, referring to a punch he received, ""but I then got in a good one.""Keith's punch sent an unfortunate sailor flying across the room, right past a group of Navy officers. Keith was offered a choice of 90 days in the brig or a reduction from sergeant to corporal.He chose the latter because ""I was getting out of the Corps anyway."" Keith said he has no regrets about joining the Corps and is proud to claim the title of Marine. The success he earned in Hollywood is legendary. However, the greatest chronicles of this famous star are found in the jungles and skies of the Solomon Islands. It was men like him who carried America to victory.At curtain call after Keith's second week of filming on the ""Major Dad"" show in September 1992, actor Gerald McRaney, who played Marine Corps Major John D. MacGillis, told the studio audience that ever since he got into acting, one of the people that he had an admiration for and wanted to work with was Brian Keith.""We play Marines, but you're the real thing,"" said McRaney, who continued, ""It was our privilege to work with you.""I interviewed Keith between takes in late September 1992 at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, where he was making a guest appearance on a ""Major Dad"" TV episode. I was a Marine Corps gunnery sergeant at the time.Keith died June 24, 1997, in Malibu, California. He was 75.",

FORT BELVOIR, Va. – Cancer is a silent killer. Often difficult to diagnose and truly insidious, the disease touches many. It leaves in its wake suffering, pain and often death. Cancer was the last thing on U.S. Army Reserve Sergeant Francisco Marti Gonzalez’s mind as he prepared to welcome a daughter with his wife Taisha in 2018.

We often think of cancer as a disease that afflicts those in middle age or the elderly. This was not the case for Marti, as he received a diagnosis as a 24-year-old sergeant. Pain in his lower back and groin area prompted him to get checked. The human resources noncommissioned officer from Utuado, Puerto Rico, was serving his first Active Guard Reserve program tour, in Georgia.

“After I was told I had a mass, I understood that could be testicular cancer. My first worry was if I’d live long enough to see my daughter born and grown up.” Follow up tests confirmed the diagnosis. It was testicular cancer. While Marti had answers, he also faced uncertainty. “I didn’t know what’s next in my life.”

Marti was immediately scheduled for surgery. Doctors removed his right testicle under general anesthesia in November 2018. He would start and complete multiple rounds of chemotherapy.

“Going through cancer treatment was the worst time of my life.”

Less than a year later, Marti was told that the cancer had spread to other parts of his body. “They told me I had testicular cancer that had went to the lymph nodes in my back – and my lungs.”

In May 2019 surgeons removed one nodule from his left lung.

This time – finally – good news. Tumor pathology showed that the cancer had died. It was confirmation that the cancer in his body was gone.

The road to recovery continued though. Marti had to train his lungs and used a machine he would breathe into as part of his resistance training. His lung had far less capacity than before.

“The psychological shock of losing almost 30 pounds and losing a bunch of strength really affected me. I wasn’t even half as strong as I was before starting treatment.” Aside from losing strength, Marti experienced a plethora of other adverse effects. “At some point my skin turned yellow.”

During this time, Marti welcomed his child – a daughter, Isabella. His family provided him with purpose and added to his will to survive. “My plan was to be a survivor and live on. To always do the right things in life. To be able to see my kids grow up. To be a father and a husband.”

And survive he has. Marti is now almost five years into remission. While that chapter of his life is behind him, his drive to excel and push himself physically remains paramount. “I scored a 579 on my last ACFT. I work on it just to prove to myself I can do it.”

Now assigned to the Military Intelligence Readiness Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Staff Sgt. Marti, was recently recognized by the region’s hometown NFL team – the Washington Commanders.

The Washington Commanders organization honored Marti and other cancer survivors with military ties during a home game October 5, 2023, at FedEx Field in North Englewood, Maryland.

More of a baseball fan, Marti had never been to an American Football game before. “When I saw the structure and size of the football stadium, I was impressed. You see it on TV and have an idea of the size, but it’s really something to see it in person.”

The team brought the invited cancer survivors out during half time. The large stadium screen displayed pictures of them during their cancer journeys as they walked down the field. Survivors were divided by types of cancer – lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, pediatric cancers, urological cancers, breast cancer, and others.

The large group of survivors moved in unison wearing colored shirts. Everyone was linked inextricably by their experiences with cancer. The pain, diagnosis, battles, and victories.

Elderly and middle-aged cancer survivors were well represented. What struck Marti the hardest though, were the young.

“There were some children that had survived cancer too. I cried seeing them. When urology told me I had testicular cancer I knew what I was facing – I was an adult. A little kid has to fight this terrible sickness without really knowing what’s going on. It’s really sad that they have this happen to them at such a young age. I saw their innocence.”

While those on the field tasted a sense of victory, the Washington Commanders would lose to the Chicago Bears 20 – 40.

Marti remembers that day fondly. “The game was really fun. There was such energy. The fans were really part of the game. In baseball its more quiet, this football game was a huge deal. It’s definitely the most energetic sports experience I’ve ever been part of.”

When asked what he wishes more knew about cancer, he said this - “Always pay attention to your body. Young males – examine yourself. This can affect you starting as young as 16.”

“If you ever find yourself in the situation where you’re diagnosed with cancer or any other serious disease, stay positive. I always prayed and asked God to allow me to have a second chance.” And a second chance he did receive. Marti continues to be there for Isabella, Taisha and son Daniel – born in 2022.",

CHARLESTON, W. Va. - Soldiers with the West Virginia Army National Guard’s 156th Military Police Law and Order Detachment landed at Fort Bliss following a 10-month overseas deployment supporting the U.S. Army Central’s Area Support Group–Jordan.

Brig. Gen. Gene Holt, assistant adjutant general – Army, and Command Sgt. Maj. Chadwick Moneypenny, state command sergeant major, met the Soldiers Dec. 15 as they stepped off the plane in Texas. This is the last stop for the troops before reuniting with Family and friends for the first time since deploying in February.

“These Soldiers performed super well and were highly appreciated,” said Capt. John Ivester, 156th MP commander. “The ASG command was sad to see everybody go because they really hit that level of optimal proficiency.”

“The Soldiers in the 156th brought great credit to themselves and the West Virginia National Guard while deployed,” said Maj. Gen. Bill Crane, adjutant general. ”ASG-J provides the support structure for USARCENT facilities and DoD personnel in and around Jordan, which goes to show how adept our troops are at operating on a global stage. I’m very proud of them and their work and ... especially happy they get to be home in time to celebrate the holidays with their families.”

The 156th MP Detachment, 77th Troop Command Battalion, 111th Engineer Brigade, deployed from their home station of Holden, West Virginia, under the command of Ivester and Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Hatfield. While deployed, they conducted investigations, law enforcement operations, personal security services and force protection at five installations in Jordan and across six countries.

During the mobilization, several 156th MP Soldiers also assisted host nation partners by participating in a Jordanian Armed Forces Language Institute engagement, teaching English.

“They displayed true professionalism and continued to do the job day in and day out with no issues at all,” Ivester said.

After demobilization procedures, the Soldiers depart Fort Bliss to their homes. Often, larger units are flown back to West Virginia and given a formal homecoming ceremony, but thanks to the unit’s smaller size, the desire to get the families reunited as soon as possible means the Soldiers can travel straight home.

The detachment last deployed in 2018, operating at two of Afghanistan's largest bases, Bagram Airfield and Kandahar Airfield, and supported smaller outlying bases.

NUTLEY, N.J. - New Jersey Army National Guard Pvt. Anthony Del Tufo was recognized by the Nutley School Board of Education Dec. 11 for assisting residents of a home threatened by fire.

Del Tufo credited the military principles of civil service he embodied early in his military career.

""I didn't think it was a big deal,"" Del Tufo said. ""I was just doing what was right.""

His recruiter, U.S. Army Sgt. Miguel Valoy, expressed surprise at this response.

""I informed him how significant this is,"" Valoy said. ""He probably saved their lives.""

In what seemed like an unremarkable afternoon in Nutley, Del Tufo noticed a concerning sight — a burning car in a garage. Instead of calling 911, he rushed to the house and rang the doorbell repeatedly until someone answered.

Once the homeowner appeared, Del Tufo ensured they were aware of the danger and prevented the owner from risking their safety by attempting to retrieve sentimental items as the fire intensified.

The Nutley Fire Department arrived promptly and extinguished the fire. Their assessment revealed that had they been called any later, the fire would have spread, likely destroying the house.

After the fire was extinguished, Del Tufo remained overnight to ensure the occupants were safe.

His selfless act earned immense gratitude from those involved.

""He could have left us alone when the firefighters came,"" said the homeowner. ""He chose to stay because he cared for our safety. His selfless nature is rare, and we felt the mayor and township needed to know of his actions.""

Awareness of his actions spread among the citizens of Nutley. Ultimately, members of the New Jersey Army National Guard’s Recruit Sustainment Program learned of his heroic deeds.

Following an intense weekend drill at the National Guard Training Center in Seagirt, Del Tufo was awarded the Army Achievement Medal for his actions.

""He did what many didn't do — he acted,"" said Valoy. ""He helped and made a difference like all good Soldiers should.""

SEOUL – Members of the 403rd Army Field Support Brigade participated in the 2023 Korea-U.S. Security Alliance Forum Vietnam Veterans Recognition Ceremony at the National Assembly Library Auditorium in Seoul, South Korea, Dec. 11.

The ceremony, cosponsored by the 403rd AFSB and Korea Chapter 1507 of the Non Commissioned Officers Association, was held in conjunction with a litany of other events taking place this year throughout South Korea marking the 70th anniversary of the Ironclad Commitment between the United States and the Republic of Korea.

“This season, as we hold dear the values of peace and goodwill, we are reminded of the brave sacrifices that solidified our alliance. It is a fitting moment to reflect on our journey together as we commemorate the 70th year of the ROK-US alliance, an alliance that has stood the test of time and challenges,” said Col. Henry Brown, commander, 403rd AFSB who was the featured speaker at the event.

“Seventy years ago, our nations stood together in a conflict that tested our resolve, courage, and commitment to the ideals of freedom and peace. During the Korean War, thousands of Korean Soldiers and U.S. military personnel fought valiantly for the liberty we cherish,” Brown said. “This war resulted in a significant loss of life and left many wounded – sacrifices we solemnly remember and honor, especially in this season of remembrance and gratitude.”

The event featured traditional and modern music performances and remarks from distinguished individuals including members of the National Assembly.

Col. Brown placed medals provided by the NCOA around the necks of 50 Korean Vietnam War veterans in recognition of their sacrifice and service to the effort in Vietnam. Honorees were also presented with certificates commemorating their service.

Among those honored was Charles Choi, program analyst, S-8 (Resource Management), 403rd AFSB, who is a Vietnam-era veteran of both the Republic of Korea Army and the U.S. Army.

“It was a great moment to be recognized like this, especially since it is the 70th year of the U.S. and Korea alliance,” Choi said. “It was a big surprise to be included so I was honored to receive the medal.”

From Sept. 1964 to March 1973, more than 320,000 South Korean troops served in Vietnam. More than 5,000 South Korean’s died with more than 10,000 injured.

“Our alliance, forged in the fires of the Korean War, continued to demonstrate its strength and resilience in the Vietnam War. The Republic of Korea stood with the United States in a profound act of solidarity and commitment. Around 320,000 South Korean soldiers served in Vietnam, exemplifying dedication, and bravery. Their contributions played a vital role in our joint efforts, highlighting the strength and depth of our alliance,” Brown said. “Today, we recognize and honor 50 brave individuals who represent the thousands of South Korean Soldiers who contributed to this cause. Their sacrifice underscores the strength and endurance of the ROK-US alliance. These Soldiers, embodying the spirit of courage and dedication, reflect the enduring bond and shared sacrifices between our countries.”

Members of Army Field Support Battalion-Korea joined participants from Brigade Headquarters at the event.

“It was our privilege to attend the tribute to Korean Vietnam veterans event and witness the well-deserved honor and recognition bestowed upon them,” said Thomas Gloss, deputy to the commander, AFSBn-Korea. “[It was] a poignant tribute to their valor and sacrifices that left a lasting impression on all those in attendance.”

Joseph Kim, chief, Future Operations, S-3 (Operations), 403rd AFSB, was co-emcee of the event with Park, Jiseul, a well-known television reporter and news anchor.

The ceremony was covered by the Korean Broadcasting System and several other Korean media outlets.

The Korea-U.S. Security Alliance Forum fosters relationships between Korean and American public and private entities to further their goal of strong cooperation between the two countries.

ZAMA, Japan – The U.S. Army Japan Band gave the final performances of their annual holiday concert Dec. 15 and 16 at Zama Harmony Hall here, ending the run of the popular show that began in 2013.

Titled “The Lights of Winter,” this year’s concert was the last for the USARJ Band since the unit will be stood down and deactivated in 2024.

Chief Warrant Officer 3 Matthew David, USARJ Band commander and a first-time participant in the concert, said it was an honor to be part of the final performance and to know it will leave a lasting legacy in the local community after its decade-long run.

“We love performing the music for them,” David said. “Japanese audiences have a deep appreciation for the art of music.”

David called his bandmates excellent human beings, great musicians and great Soldiers, and hoped those qualities came through to the audience during their performance. The commander said the concert was also special to the band because it was a joint event.

“This was a great opportunity for the USARJ Band members to interact and perform with our counterparts in the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Eastern Army Band,” David said. “It brings the concert to the next level by being able to collaborate with such high-caliber musicians.”

One of the main roles of the USARJ Band is to be a prominent public face for the U.S. Army in Japan. Events like the holiday concert and the other public performances the band gives throughout the country allow them to positively represent America and the Army as unofficial ambassadors.

“Although the holiday concert is coming to an end, there are so many other events that still connect the Camp Zama community and Zama City,” David said. “It will be sad that the band won’t be there, but that’s not going to stop Soldiers from trying to continuously build a good relationship with the neighboring cities here.”

Zama City Mayor Mito Sato attended this year’s concert, which she said had a record 5,000-plus people entering a lottery in hopes of securing the limited number of tickets offered for the performance. She described the concert as amazing, saying “the venue was united as one in excitement.”

“The holiday concert became a tradition in Zama City; it was a signature event of the city,” Sato said. “Many of our citizens looked forward to this every year.”

The mayor said she has already heard from people that they are going to miss having the band perform in their city. Though she is sad that this year’s concert was the final one, Sato said there are still many more bilateral engagements between their city and the U.S. Army that will continually help to deepen their relationship.

Kunio Takizawa attended the concert with his wife and said they both looked forward to the event every year because to them, “the holiday season doesn’t officially start until we come to see the USARJ Band.” He thanked the USARJ Band for the invaluable experiences they gave Zama citizens over the years.

“The Army band’s music brought us the joy of the holiday spirit,” Takizawa said. “Nothing can replace this wonderful concert.”",

JOINT MULTINATIONAL READINESS CENTER, Germany – The Hohenfels Veterans of Foreign Wars, Post 10557, collected toys and delivered them Dec. 21, 2023 to a day and residential child care center in Parsberg, Germany.

Days before Christmas, members of the VFW unloaded carloads of toys to das Pädagogisches Zentrum St. Josef Parsberg (the St. Joseph Pedagogical Center in Parsberg), where administrators and children thanked the group for their generosity.

In one of the day rooms, the members dropped off boxes of race car sets, field sport balls, miniature race car tracks, plush animals, dolls, brick-building sets and much more.

“We didn’t expect so much,” said Anna Wagner, an administrative assistant at the center. “Mostly when we get something it’s [just] one of these boxes.”

Michael Simon, the education manager for the center, called the delivery of toys an “enormous Christmas surprise.”

“I am so overwhelmed by this generosity and large-heartedness from you,” he said upon receiving the goods.

“We want to make this a tradition every year to pick up toys,” Edwin Quinones, an officer-trustee with the VFW.

Besides for reaching out to help the children of the center, Quinones had in mind letting the community know what VFW does.

“This is one of the many things we do,” said Quinones. “We also give out grants for people going to college. We also help veterans, but not only veterans, active-duty personnel, with advice.”

To gather toys, the VFW set up a donation spot in the lobby of the Post Exchange. Many community members, upon learning of the toy drive, bought toys to donate.

The Directorate of Emergency Services donated several toys as soon as they learned of the drive.

The Hohenfels Thrift Shop also coordinated with the VFW to mobilize the Hohenfels military community into help out. When community members donated to the shop, the shop matched the contribution, thus gathering even more boxes of toys.

In appreciation of their efforts, the pedagogical center administrators gifted the VFW and the other contributors homemade painted and glazed ceramic hearts.",

ANSBACH, Germany (December 21, 2023) – The U.S. Army Garrison (USAG) Ansbach Religious Support Office kicked off the Awana program after more than a five-year pause for the garrison earlier this year on Katterbach Kaserne.

Awana is a worldwide, non-profit program that involves children and accompanying them on their path to faith. This program goes hand-in-hand with teaching children wisdom and spiritual lessons in a playful way.

At the time of publication, approximately 73 garrison children are enrolled in the program and new requests to join are coming in every week. Awana is open to anyone; it is irrelevant which religion you belong to, everybody is welcome to participate.

To ensure that Awana reaches every child in an age-appropriate way, there are different groups and curriculums within the program. The garrison chapel offers the Puggles, Cubbies, Sparks and Truth & Training (T&T) groups for children ages 3 to 11 to experience Awana's mission through gospel and other spiritually activities.

This program mainly relies on volunteers, which is crucial for its success. Currently, the garrison chapel has over 20 volunteers as well as the Awana Commander, Chaplain Hollis Young and Co-Commander April Acevedo, who are passionate about teaching the Awana principles to the children.

“I expressed interest in bringing Awana to USAG Ansbach in the early summer this year. By the grace of God, support from Steve Davids (the Awana missionary for Germany) and CH (Lt. Col.) Ivan Arreguin, USAG Ansbach Chaplain, and approval from the Garrison Commander, Col. Aaron Dixon, Awana came to life on September 27, 2023,” said Young.

When working with children, learning needs to be active and exciting. Therefore, there are different segments within the program to make this possible. The usual process for the children is to initiate the opening ceremony by saying what they are thankful for. This leads right into the Large Group Time with gospels and prayers.

Shortly after, they divide into their individual groups, also known as the Small Group Time, where the volunteers lead the children in age-appropriate activities. Depending on which group you belong to, your evening might start with a fun game, such as one-legged soccer. Other groups, especially those with younger children, begin their program with a puppet show, snacks and crafts. The older kids, which are in the T&T group, will work on their workbooks or the Bible as well as discussing the topic of the day and conclude their evening with fun activities.

Last but not least, there is the closing ceremony, at which the children can recite the Bible verses they have learned by heart and studied diligently that evening in front of their parents and teachers on a small podium, which is also a great highlight for young and old alike.

“The vision and prayer of Awana is that all children and youth throughout the world will come to know, love, and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. That is, therefore, our vision for all children and youth across this garrison. As Awana leaders, our conviction is that the Bible is the Word of God, and we heavily emphasize scripture memorization as part of the Awana program. To see children across this garrison studying and memorizing the word of God, and then coming in excited to share those memorized Bible verses is, for me, the most gratifying part of Awana,” stated Young.

Tracing its roots back, Awana was founded in 1941 as a children’s program at the North Side Gospel Center in Chicago, Illinois, in cooperation with the church’s youth director. This partnership made it possible to create new ways and opportunities to bring children and young people closer to religion. Overall, Awana follows the 3B discipleship philosophy in their program – Belong, Believe and Become.

“During my time at the chapel, I have ministered to the families by teaching children church. Awana is another way to demonstrate to children the Love that God has for them. They learn scriptures through memorization, as they study and meditate on the scriptures, the Love for God grows in them. I thank God for the garrison allowing Awana to be a part of our community,” added Acevedo.

FORT MEADE, Md. – In a significant departure from the last three years’ drive-thru format, the Joint Service Exceptional Family Member Program Holiday Party at McGill Training Center here marked a return to in-person celebrations.

As a first effort to return to in-person events it was important to bring people together in a place with adequate space for those practicing social distancing to attend, as well as the families who still opted to use the drive-up option, said Liesa Jacobs, family support EFMP coordinator.

“Several families commented on the location being ideal for the event,” she said.

Perhaps more important than the location was the welcoming and inclusive nature of the event for all participants – those in close proximity, socially distanced, or participating as part of the drive-up crowd.

“Often, our families express feelings of being judged when out in public . . .,” said Jacobs. “Seeing the staff being so festive and greeting them warmly, families expressed gratitude for the all-inclusive event dedicated to their special needs family.”

“Having a night dedicated to just them means a lot,” she said.

The children at the party were able to decorate wooden Christmas ornaments, construct Christmas tree photo frames and take part in Christmas sticker activity crafts. Facepainting was available for young children and the young at heart while a photobooth – with props – was available to get the perfect selfie regardless of age.

Refreshments of snow cones, cupcakes, cookies, crackers, clementines, as well as, fruit snacks, water and juice boxes were provided by the American Legion, United Services Organization and EFMP staff.

Organizations specifically geared toward exceptional family members, such as the Autism Society of Maryland, were intermingled with booths and activities from the Severn Library, Military OneSource, Corvias Housing, the American Legion and others at the event to expose families to resources available in the area.

Of course, the highlight of the evening was a visit from Santa Claus (Louis “Lou” Randle, Army Housing).

Santa managed to hand out toys donated by United States Marine Corps Reserve’s Toys for Tots campaign. Those toys were wrapped and decorated by EFMP staff, ACS and Military Family Readiness Center volunteers, and each of the EFMP enrolled children who attended received a gift.

The Joint Service EFMP Holiday Party exemplifies the dedication to inclusivity and support for families with exceptional needs that exist across all the military services.

DJIBOUTI CITY, Djibouti - For nearly 50 years, French soldiers stationed in Djibouti have made their way to the Arta Mountains for the grueling, five-day French Desert Commando Course to test their physical, emotional and mental limits. This year, 40 U.S. service members signed up for the challenge, including U.S. Army Sgt. Liliana Munday.

Growing up, Munday, a Soldier with the 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, South Carolina National Guard, gravitated to outdoor physical activities. She was immediately interested in the French Desert Commando Course, but concerned about the physical demands.

“I didn’t think I was ready for it,” she said. “But Staff Sgt. (Samuel) Perez kept pushing me to try out because he saw that I wanted to do it and he had faith in me that I could do it.”

In the pre-assessment phase of the course, service members meet the basic physical requirements and train to earn a spot in the commando phase. In the second phase, they head out to the field for night obstacle, rope and swimming courses and combative and desert survival skills.

Munday’s training regimen began in September and included rucks and runs around the installation before dawn, weightlifting and dynamic, high-intensity exercises nearly every day. At the peak of her training, she fit in three workouts each day while balancing her regular work schedule.

After three months of training, Munday remembers the nerves she felt on the drive out to Arta Mountains where her hard work was put to the test immediately.

“I almost had an aneurysm, I was so scared,” she said. “On the way out there I kept thinking, 'Am I ready? Am I gonna do this? These guys are gonna smoke me, I’m just gonna be out here stranded and be sent home on Day 1.’”

Day 1 consisted of a 5-kilometer ruck run with a full kit, followed by a fitness test and rope climbs.

“I was nervous because rope climbs are very hard for me and in training I could only do one,” she recalled.

Her training partner, Perez, was there to support and encourage her as she steadily made her way to the top.

“I could see she was nervous because we saw the other competitors struggling with this climb,” Perez said. “I was there telling her she could do it; I knew she could. She got up there and when she came back down she had a big smile beaming from her face she was so excited and she ran over and gave me a big hug.”

With the first big hurdle behind her, Munday moved forward in the course with a newfound confidence.

“For some reason, after completing that first day I was good. I started to feel like I could do this thing and I proved to my squad that I was here to work and I deserved to be here,” she said.

Each day and night Munday and her squad faced a new obstacle. She said the mountain obstacle course was the most difficult.

Participants 200 meters above the ground were required to jump across five platforms spaced several meters apart, jump and grab onto a steel pole and slide down to the ground.

“When you’re doing that mountain obstacle course you don’t realize how far each platform is from one another and there are points when you’re not clipped in,” she explained. “I thought, if I missed even a little bit, I’m going down.”

On Day 3, after pushing herself through numerous challenges and rucking nonstop from one training location to another, she thought she had reached her breaking point and seriously considered quitting.

“Your joints just start to scream. It’s painful,” she confessed. “I kept thinking, ’I cannot take this pain anymore. I’m almost done but I cannot do it anymore.’”

Through the dirt, mud, sweat and pain, Munday’s spirit and drive helped her push through. That spirit and drive, she said, comes from two of the strongest people she knows.

“My mom and my grandma — they’re such strong women and they never let me quit when I was younger. They have strong personalities and it’s within me,” she said. “It was very nice to tell them that I did this. They were like, ‘No way, that’s awesome!’”

At graduation, she received the French Desert Commando pin. The black and gold pin features a scorpion resting on the outline of the country of Djibouti. Along the rim are the words ”Aguerrissement Zone Desertique,” which translates to ""Desert Zone Hardening.”

“I’m now able to look back and say, I did that. We did that,” she said with a smile. “Completing something and not giving up even though you may want to … it sticks with you forever. I use this as fuel to my fire when I feel like I can’t do something. I think to myself, ‘You can, because you have already.’”

Beyond the support she received from her family and teammates, Munday’s success is a testament to the adage, ”Preparation is the key to success.” It’s a message she’s shared with her fellow Soldiers since completing the course.

“Someone I work with said he wanted to do the FDCC but he didn’t think he was ready,” she said. “I said, ‘Sir, you’re never going to be ready.’ I didn’t think I was ready. But I got ready. So if you truly think or know that you want to do something no matter the current status that you’re in, if you want to pursue it you’re just gonna have to train and do what it takes to get to that point. There is no other way.”

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – The renaming of the headquarters building, a record turnout of interns, and open-post events that saw tens of thousands of attendees were among the stories that impacted U.S. Army Garrison Japan this past year.

Below is a roundup of some of the most notable stories in the community:

Local employees honored for decades of service

More than 180 local employees with 10, 20, 30 and 40 years of service were celebrated for their dedication to U.S. Forces Japan during a ceremony in late October at nearby Zama Harmony Hall.

Maj. Gen. Dave Womack, commander of U.S. Army Japan, said it was an honor to recognize the employees, many of whom are garrison employees, for their collective service that represented thousands of years of commitment.

“There have been many changes in both of our countries, but the one thing that remains consistent is the people,” he said, “so I want to make sure that I thank every single one of you for your incredible service.”

One of the employees, Naoko Koh, the administrative officer at the Directorate of Public Works, said her 40 years of service, which included various personnel-related positions on Camp Zama, seemed to have flown by.

While Koh sometimes thinks about retiring, she still appreciates the sense of purpose her job provides her and how it continues to motivate her to serve others.

“I feel that many people count on me,” she said. “That’s the reason I stayed here.”

Community ambassadors

Camp Zama personnel proved yet again to be good neighbors while volunteering countless hours to beautify the local community.

The garrison jointly held a four-party event to strengthen community partnerships in late October by helping clean the Sagamihara City Shindo Sports Park.

More than 100 volunteers participated in the cleanup, which was the fourth such event in two years to be organized alongside partners in the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force and Sagamihara and Zama cities.

In early September, U.S. Army in Japan personnel also joined about 1,300 volunteers for the annual Sagami River cleanup. The massive effort gathered 3.5 tons of trash from the area near Camp Zama.

About a month later, volunteers helped sow canola seeds in the fields near the Sagami River, where sunflowers will be planted next year for Zama City’s annual sunflower festival held in late summer.

The rotational canola crops prepare the fields for the sunflowers and will bloom next spring in conjunction with the cherry blossoms, making for a colorful spring.

Internship program sees record year

An unprecedented 34 students from 26 universities throughout Japan joined the garrison’s monthlong summer internship program — the most participation since it began in 2013.

There were so many applicants, in fact, that an interview process had to be held to determine who would be chosen for the program’s limited slots.

Organized by the USAG Japan Public Affairs, the program was developed to give Japanese college students the chance to gain professional experience in a joint work environment while developing their English-language skills.

Using experience gleaned from their time in the program, some former interns have also recently landed positions at DPW, USARJ’s G-4 Transportation Division and U.S. Army Medical Activity–Japan.

Headquarters building renamed after former commander

The USAG Japan headquarters building was officially renamed in early April as a tribute to a former commander.

The building, commonly referred to as Building 102 or the garrison building for the past 70 years, is now named the Col. David B. Hannum Jr. Garrison Headquarters Building.

Hannum, who died in 2010, served as garrison commander from 1975 to 1976 when it was called USAG Honshu, and went on to help others through volunteering following his 31-year Army career.

Members of Hannum’s family watched the ceremony virtually as Col. Christopher L. Tomlinson, then-garrison commander, and Command Sgt. Maj. David A. Rio, the garrison’s senior enlisted leader, unveiled a plaque in memory of Hannum inside the foyer of the headquarters building.

Garrison welcomes new commander

The garrison community welcomed Col. Marcus Hunter as its new commander while bidding farewell to Tomlinson during a change-of-command ceremony in early July.

In the ceremony, Hunter, who previously served as commander of the 1st Battalion, 5th Security Force Assistance Brigade, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, said he was a temporary tenant at Camp Zama last year while on a six-month deployment with his unit.

He said his visit turned into an opportunity for a “site survey” that provided him a closer look at the work and accomplishments of the garrison.

“It gave me an appreciation for this incredible team and the breadth of the missions with which this team is charged,” he said.

Hunter then said he was grateful for the privilege to join the garrison team and to help carry out its missions.

“We share the Japanese values and ideals of a free and open Pacific,” he said, “and I look forward to the many ways in which we will cultivate relationships of trust, respect and true friendship.”

Open-post festivities

USAG Japan held several open-post events to bring tens of thousands of visitors onto its installations.

Throughout the year, these large events had every garrison directorate involved to handle numerous moving pieces, including close coordination with Japanese partners.

In April, the first Hawaiian Festival since the pandemic took place at Sagami General Depot, drawing more than 15,000 attendees who enjoyed live music, dance performances and children’s games.

Camp Zama then hosted an Independence Day celebration for more than 14,000 guests, capping the night off with a fireworks display. A month later, about 20,000 people attended the Bon Odori festival here as many wore traditional “yukatas” and performed folk dances before watching more fireworks.

The Yokohama North Dock Running Festival also returned for the first time in four years in early November as nearly 1,000 runners competed in its 5K, 10K and half-marathon races.

Leaders focus on quality housing

Garrison leadership continued to share housing updates and answer questions from residents during town halls this year.

In the latest meeting in September, leaders revealed the tenant satisfaction rating stood at about 87% in fiscal 2023, similar to the previous year’s rating in which USAG Japan ranked fifth out of 23 garrisons with family housing owned or leased by the Army.

Hunter admitted that while the housing here can be considered old, it is still in very good condition.

He said that during a recent visit from a top Department of Defense housing official, who toured some of the garrison’s oldest and least-renovated homes and barracks, she was still impressed with the state of housing here.

The colonel said that DPW does a great job in maintaining homes but acknowledged that more can be done to enhance the living conditions.

Hunter also spoke on the possibility of having pets inside the two high-rise apartment-style complexes on Camp Zama after receiving feedback from the community.

The Housing Office is now looking to form a committee to gather resident input on a new pet policy, slated to be published in the spring, that may help ease the transition for incoming pet owners.

Sports clinic strengthens partnership

About 150 American and Japanese children participated in a football and cheerleading clinic at Sagamihara Family Housing Area in early November to enhance their cultural understanding.

The clinic marked the first event jointly hosted by USAG Japan and Zama Junior Chamber International.

Children from first through sixth grades at Arnn Elementary School and local Japanese schools were invited to the event, which had professional football players from the Ebina Minerva run drills for the children.

The garrison also bolstered partnerships with other JCI chapters in the surrounding communities by hosting a mission brief and installation tour of Camp Zama in late August.

More than 30 members from eight chapters saw various historical sites and installation facilities, and also met with the garrison commander during their visit.

The purpose of the visit was not only to strengthen existing relationships, but also to establish new ones with other chapters while communicating the role and importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance.

ILLESHEIM, Germany (Dec 20, 2023) - Storck Barracks in Illesheim, Germany, is home to the only helicopter flight simulator operated by the U.S. Army in Europe. The facility, located within the United States Army Garrison (USAG) Ansbach footprint, is well known and appreciated by pilots from NATO partners and allied countries and provides critical training to helicopter pilots of the U.S. Army and other nations.

The simulator complex opened in 1985 and has undergone numerous renovations and retrofits as Army aviation has evolved. Today, it is a state-of-the-art training facility operated by U.S. Army Europe and Africa (USAREUR-AF) and in high demand by helicopter pilots throughout the theater.

The U.S. Army’s 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, located on nearby Katterbach Kaserne, and pilots from regionally aligned forces regularly deployed to Storck Barracks, commonly referring to the complex as the Storck “Flight Sims.” All current helicopter platforms used by the U.S. Army are supported in this facility.

“We have the Apache Longbow crew trainer (LCT), the UH-60L/M Black Hawk aircrew trainer (BAT), the CH-47F Chinook Transportable Flight Proficiency Simulator (TFPS) and the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT),” says Dexter Chun, Facility Manager, Illesheim Flight Simulator Complex (IFSC).

Ignacio Gutierrez de Rubalcava, stationed in Madrid, Spain, with the Spanish Batallon de Helicopteros de Transporte, recently trained at the IFSC and praised the facility highly.

“I am assigned to the only battalion with Chinooks in the Spanish military,” said Rubalcava. “We started transitioning from the Delta model to the F-model of Chinooks and this is the closest training facility to train emergency procedures that you do not want to try on the actual aircraft.”

As a frequent visitor, he raved about the facility: “Early 2022 was the first time we came. Emergency training is the focus. We train with the U.S. Army often and we have been deployed with them to different theaters, so we are used to training with the U.S. Army. We are comfortable with them and the facility is very good. We do have a basic trainer back at our home station, but for more advanced training, we need this.“

Also training at the IFSC during our visit was Slovakian Col. Stefan Okos with the 51st Wing “Presov.” Col. Okos, a UH-60 Blackhawk pilot, has visited Storck several times and greatly appreciates the training opportunity.

“The Slovak Army does not have a simulator for the UH-60 Blackhawk platform. This is the closest training facility for us,” explained Okos. “It is only a 10-to-12-hour drive from home. We are usually here for one week, which gives us 40 hours of training for the team of five pilots and one instructor.”

The IFSC has an excellent reputation within the Slovak Army aviation unit. According to Okos, the alternative to getting the required simulator training would be traveling to a facility in the U.S., where the initial training of the Slovak pilots takes place.

Okos also praised the simulator: “The facility is great. The staff is very helpful. Every time we need something, they are here all day. I cannot say anything negative about the facility or the staff.”

“The pilots are very happy with this type of simulator. When they train for a half hour, they are so immersed in the training, and the simulated situation, they almost forget it’s only a simulator. It is a very good experience for them,” explained Okos.

During their week-long training, the pilots only have a little free time. After the day in the simulator, they conduct briefings every night in preparation for the next day.

“We discuss the following day’s training each night. Going through the check lists, for example. It’s easier for me to teach them on the ground first. I can explain all the procedures in detail before flying. The emergency procedures are discussed in the pre-brief to the simulator training, saving us time while we are in the simulator,” Okos continued.

“The week is a demanding training week. But it is very beneficial. You can watch the progress and the results of the training as the week advances. At the beginning they are struggling with some procedures and at the end of the week they are like professionals. You see the results after five days. The pilots become much more confident as they are training intense emergency procedures in the simulator.”

As an Army Power Projection Platform in Europe, USAG Ansbach is proud to be home to this integral training tool for pilots from our U.S. and NATO partners.

WIESBADEN, Germany - Community members living and working at the Mainz-Kastel Storage Station will soon have a new breakfast and lunch option.

While currently operating a food truck outside the former location of the District Breakfast and Lunch, a new Wiesbaden Family and MWR contractor has been busy renovating Building 4019 in preparation for the opening of Cristobal in late December.

“Our goal was to not leave the Soldiers without any food or drinks during the renovations,” said Cristobal Manager Khaled Ezzedine. “We’re currently providing that service with our food truck while renovating the building. We’re offering different hot and cold sandwiches, sweet things such as doughnuts and muffins, and different hot and cold beverages.”

The Cristobal manager said that once the renovations are completed, the Food Truck will be removed.

“We hope to have the main café room open shortly after Christmas featuring the same offerings and more,” he said, adding, “We’ll use the holidays to finish the whole place.”

With the theme: “Because You Serve, You Deserve,” Ezzedine said he intends to make the dining experience a positive one for patrons. “The Soldier deserves to expect more. I want to show the customers that the moment they set their feet in the doorway – they are appreciated and will be treated well.”

“His pledge to serve the Soldiers is an important point,” said Mark Smith, Wiesbaden Family and MWR Business Operations Division Chief.

“We gave him notice and I was impressed with how quickly he could make it happen,” said Smith, adding that Ezzedine brings years of experience to the project.

The former commercial pilot and restaurant troubleshooter managed several restaurants before opening the Backhaus in Mainz-Kastel. Now he said he is looking forward to the next challenge of serving patrons at the Mainz-Kastel installation.

“We’ll be offering everything from chicken wings and burgers to daily dishes that will change, including seasonal dishes,” said the 53-year-old entrepreneur. A look at the proposed menu includes scrambled eggs, omelettes, various salads, kebab sandwiches, Schnitzels and more.

“What’s important for MWR is to offer patrons a rich variety. Khaled is going to bring that with various hot and cold sandwiches and lunch options,” Smith said. “Our goal is to serve Soldiers locally so that they don’t have to go off base to spend too much money and time away from their duty.”

The Cristobal Food Truck (and eventually the new facility) is open Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. It is closed weekends, Federal and Training Holidays.",

WASHINGTON — In the cold and wet autumn woods of southern Finland, Sgt. Nick L. Piazza, a cavalry scout with the 1st Cavalry Division, and his fellow Soldiers slept in tents and built fires every night during Operation Hammer 2022.

In the mornings, he woke up and hopped into his Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a medium-sized armored vehicle that allows Soldiers to perform reconnaissance and engage enemy forces.

Being the gunner on the team, he checked the M242 25-millimeter cannon and the machine gun before making sure the ammunition was properly linked. Then he checked the vehicle’s communication system.

Once everything was good to go, he and his team would head out to engage their Finnish partners in battle operations, learning and growing with them. It was a demanding two-week exercise and another event in Piazza’s life that pushed him to be stronger.

“[Being a cavalry scout] is a very tough job,” he said. “There are tough days and long days but there is so much reward that comes with it.”

Hard work in the outdoors was nothing new to Piazza. He grew up on a large piece of property in Trenton, Tennessee, where he and his brother spent most of their time hunting, fishing and enjoying nature.

When they weren’t playing, their father, a former Navy explosive ordnance disposal technician, had them outside doing yard work. They would cut down trees, chop firewood, dig pits and even help the neighbors with their yard work. These arduous tasks instilled in them a strong work ethic and a standard for them to strive for.

“It set a tone and it set an example of the man that I wanted to be, the kind of example I wanted to emulate through life,” Piazza said recalling the time spent with his father.

Looking to push himself, he joined the Marine Corps after finishing high school.

He spent the next four years as an expeditionary airfield systems technician, designing airfields and maintaining their systems.

Near the end of his enlistment, he contacted an Army recruiter because he wanted more of an opportunity to travel and see the world. He joined in January 2021 as a cavalry scout.

""They are the eyes and ears in the very tip of the spear, painting that picture for the commander and sending up that information, letting them know what’s going on in the battlefield,"" he said.

With his prior military experience, he came in as a specialist and was inserted into a unit entering advanced individual training. He was pushed into leadership positions early on.

He navigated leading his junior Soldiers while trying to learn the different terminology of the Army. This was on top of learning his new job. He started relying on those around him by constantly asking questions while he put in extra time studying.

“It’s not something you master during [initial training],” he said. “That just opens your eyes to what you’ll be learning on the job.”

He soaked up as much knowledge as he could and got more hands-on experience when he got to the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.

Then, last fall, he went on a rotation with the 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team where they trained in the woods of Finland during Operation Hammer 2022.

The two-week exercise allowed more than 4,000 combined Finnish and U.S. service members to train together in the cold and wet environment of Niinisalo, Finland.

“Being a part of that was the most memorable exercise of my military career,” he said. “Getting to fight with [the Finish military], fight against them, and see their tactics … it was definitely eye-opening and a very fun experience.”

The good times also came with hard work, something Piazza has relished since an early age, and his military career has continued to strengthen.

The Army has given me structure, organization and helped me build an even stronger work ethic, he said. It’s also given me leadership skills.

Those skills are being put to the test after Piazza was promoted to sergeant this summer. Now, he gets to guide his Soldiers to be better and eventually take his job.

“It’s very rewarding whenever you see your guys branch out and start to be free thinkers,” he said. “When I see them start to push past their rank and their assignment, it makes me really proud as a leader.”

When he’s not leading his Soldiers, Piazza is in his Bradley Fighting Vehicle being a cavalry scout gunner.

“It’s an extremely rewarding job, and I have no regrets with the path I’ve chosen,” he explained. “I absolutely love being a scout. Any time I get in my Brad and go somewhere, I usually have a smile on my face.”

Piazza will tart college soon while pursuing a degree in psychology. In the future, he wants to become a therapist and help Soldiers with their mental health issues.

CHIEVRES, Belgium – U.S. Army Garrison Benelux held a relinquishment of responsibility ceremony Dec. 19 in Hangar 2 at Chièvres Air Base.

Command Sgt. Major Gary Yurgans, who served more than two years as the senior enlisted advisor for USAG Benelux, bid farewell to the garrison and spoke about his nearly 30 years of Army service and pending retirement.

Col. Lindsay Matthews, USAG Benelux commander, accepted the unit colors from Yurgans to symbolize his relinquishment of the duties and responsibilities of the garrison command sergeant major and commended Yurgans for his leadership and contributions to the Benelux.

“Command Sgt. Major Yurgans, you truly made a positive difference in USAG Benelux and IMCOM-Europe,” said Matthews. “You helped us change the way we see USAG Benelux’s role in this organization, how we support the NATO and USAREUR-AF mission and significantly improved our customer service and Soldier talent management.”

The Non-Commissioned Officer Corps is the backbone of the Army, and their responsibility is to teach, coach and mentor the future of our fighting force, said Matthews. “Yurgans is a man who will bend over backwards to spend time with his team … to get to know them, to help them in their struggles, and celebrate their achievements.”

For Yurgans, who spent most of his career as an Army musician, the chance to serve as a command sergeant major at a garrison in Europe was a unique opportunity that became the crowning jewel of his military career.

“I truly believe our paths were brought together here for a reason,” said Yurgans. “I feel I was placed here to do the best that I can for this organization.”

“With a combined vision and leader emphasis we were able to accomplish some significant achievements. Amongst those were USAG Benelux being selected as the Best Garrison for IMCOM-E, 2021,” Yurgans said.

Yurgans, the first Army musician to serve as command sergeant major, said his time in the Benelux opened his eyes to all of the challenges involved in working at the garrison level, especially for an organization that spans three nations.

“It took me 28 years to get to Europe, but finally I'm here and am so appreciative for this experience and for the friendships I have made,” said Yurgans. “One thing I learned right from the start with this organization, you can’t do it alone, without the professional, dedicated, committed Soldiers, civilians, host nation and mission partners that are the driving force needed to succeed.”

One of the things Yurgans found most endearing about his time living and working in the Benelux was the opportunity to participate in several World War II memorials, such as the commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne, Belgium.

“Visiting Bastogne was truly an eye-opening experience that serves as a powerful reminder of the individual Soldier experience and sacrifices endured to ensure freedom,” said Yurgans. “The love for the American Soldier was never made more apparent than on this day, talking with local folks and seeing the veterans that were present. This made me realize the importance for every Soldier who serves in the military, to serve a tour in Europe and visit places like Bastogne.”

Bolesławiec, Poland - U.S. Army Soldiers from the Georgia-based 3rd Infantry Division attended the ‘Star of Kindness’ event which took place in the Bolesławiec market square December 15-17. In Polish custom, the little star on the night of Christmas Eve is called ‘Gwiazda zyczliwosci’ meaning ‘Star of Kindness.’ During the event, members of the community shared greetings and well wishes as they celebrated the holidays.

“The ‘Star of Kindness’ represents the first star that appears in the sky on December 24th and it’s a Polish tradition,” said U.S. Army Capt. Richard Lee Macleod, the garrison officer in charge of Forward Operating Site Bolesławiec. “They have dinner and then open presents on Christmas Eve, and it starts off the Christmas season in the square.”

The weekend’s scheduled festivities included vendors selling a variety of meals and wares as well as children’s plays and puppet shows. A Christmas fair along with a carousel was included with live musical performances from the 3rd Infantry Division Band. Additionally, 3rd ID Soldiers shared in the holiday spirit while on deployment in Bolesławiec by giving gifts to the Polish children in attendance.

DÜLMEN TOWER BARRACKS, Germany – In my five years at U.S. Army Garrison Benelux, this will be my fourth time visiting Bastogne, Belgium for Battle of the Bulge commemorative events and I can say without a doubt that every visit is better than the last.

To have the opportunity to be a part of the celebration and parade of the anniversary of the Battle of Bulge is by far one of my favorite things to do in Europe. Each year I have had the honor of participating as a member of the color guard marching through the great city of Bastogne.

Having family who fought on both Allied and Axis sides I find myself having a lot of respect for the people who fought and died in Bastogne. To be a part of both cultures who not so long ago were at war with one another is a powerful reminder of the complexity of history and the resilience of human connections.

This year, our weekend visit to Bastogne extended over the course of two days, affording us the opportunity to explore the sites of battle and learn the history of the area.

Our first day started early at the 101st (Easy Company) foxholes; visiting this site provided us with a small glimpse of what it was like so many years ago. Today though, I imagine it is nowhere near as harrowing as how it was 79 years ago. It was an honor as it is every year to come and experience a small glimpse of history in such a sacred place.

Our next stop on the list took us to the Bastogne War Museum. With so much to see there we started it off with learning a bit more about the Soldiers who fought in Bastogne as well as the civilians who lived in and around Bastogne.

Being able to see what life was like for the civilians who lived there really showed me why even people nowadays are so proud of this region. The sense of unity between the local community and service members even today is still as strong as ever.

To end the first day in Bastogne a few Soldiers and I had the amazing opportunity to meet and talk to a few of the classes at Ecole Communale de Mageret, Mageret elementary school in English. It was a privilege to be able to answer the many questions that the children had about life in the U.S. Army and what I do in the military.

On Saturday, Dec. 16, USAG Benelux Soldiers took part in the annual Bastogne Historic Perimeter Walk which spans around the perimeter of Bastogne and where the heaviest parts of the Battle of the Bulge took place. This is a great experience every year to immerse ourselves with the culture and camaraderie of Bastogne and the many different militaries and civilians who join this event.

The official portion of the day was the parade, a significant moment where I had the responsibility of leading the color guard through town. This experience, being my first in such a role, was an honor.

The response from the Bastogne community was particularly striking. Their show of support and appreciation was not only inspiring but also highlighted the strong bond between the visitors and the locals. This interaction was a highlight of the visit, fostering a sense of connection and hope for similar opportunities in the future.

As our visit to Bastogne concluded, I reflected on our appreciation for the sacrifices of Soldiers during the siege and the significance of preserving this history. Those of us from USAG Benelux deeply value our time here, honoring Bastogne's historical legacy.

STUTTGART, Germany — From Oct. 30 to Nov. 17, a group of Army Civilian Professionals (ACPs) and Local National (LNs) employees attended the Civilian Education System (CES) Intermediate Course. This program, a key component of the Army's Lines of Effort to maintain a skilled and ready workforce, illustrates the Army's commitment to nurturing its leaders.

The CES, a progressive and sequential leader development program, stands as a testament to the Army's dedication to multi-skilled, agile leadership.

The Army Management Staff College (AMSC) describes CES as ""The premier leader development experience, igniting the leadership potential of every Army Civilian.”

The U.S. Army Garrison (USAG) Stuttgart command team brought the Intermediate Course to the garrison for the first time thanks to their effort and their dedication to developing ACPs.

The class witnessed a diverse group of ACPs and LNs ranging between GS-10 to GS-12 grades. They engaged in a curriculum designed to foster adaptability, innovation, self-awareness, and effective management.

Robert Gwinner, deputy to the garrison commander at USAG Stuttgart, emphasized the importance of recruitment and retention in his remarks.

""Good people want to work for organizations that are always trying to improve and that offer them opportunities to do the same,"" he said. “Positioning ourselves as an organization that supports its employees’ professional growth helps attract the type of people we’re looking for. USAG Stuttgart has an incredibly important mission and we’re always looking to sustain excellence.”

Instructors Jean Ritter and Nash Carleton tailored the course content to the evolving needs of ACPs. Ritter focused on empowerment through shared experiences and networking, while Carleton emphasized the importance of applying students' experiences to the course's doctrinal knowledge.

Balmina Sehra, a public affairs specialist, reflected on her experience as a student.

“CES helped me realize that the path to leadership does not look the same for everyone. It helped me find the confidence within myself to know that I can pursue a leadership role at some point in the future. I did not feel like that prior to taking the class, which is why these three weeks were so important and eye-opening to me,” she said.

Dr. David Quisenberry, Director of the Department of Organizational Leadership at AMSC, outlined the adaptive nature of CES over the years.

“We offer a synchronous virtual course for those who cannot come to Fort Leavenworth for personal or professional constraints. We conduct Mobile Education Team Courses at Army installations around the world. This year we will conduct courses in 24 locations,” Quisenberry said.

Today’s Army demands trained and ready units with proficient leaders, which highlights the importance of ACPs, and their role in the Army’s workforce.

“Army Civilian Professionals are part of the competitive advantage the Army possesses that neither technology nor advanced weaponry and platforms can replace. Developing leaders is a complex and complicated undertaking because it is primarily a human endeavor—requiring constant involvement,” Quisenberry said.

Tommy Mize, Director of Installation Management Command-Europe, reaffirmed this commitment during a special guest visit to the CES Intermediate course where he delivered remarks and answered students’ questions.

""You should never be told, ‘No – you cannot go to a school in the CES,’"" he asserted. “Everybody in IMCOM-Europe has the opportunity to go to school and attend the CES courses. You need to do that, as it’s an important component of professional development.”

As the CES Intermediate Course concluded, the participants left with more than just enhanced skills; they carried with them a renewed sense of purpose and responsibility.

“The Army, through initiatives like CES, is not just investing in individuals; it is fortifying its future, ensuring that its leaders are equipped to face the challenges of tomorrow with confidence and competence. In the words of these leaders and educators, the message is clear: In the U.S. Army, people matter, and their development is paramount to the Army's success,” said Mize.

IMCOM-Europe will be hosting the CES Intermediate Course at USAG Wiesbaden from Jul. 8-26, 2024, and the CES Advanced Course from Jul. 22-Aug. 16, 2024, at USAG Stuttgart. For a full course calendar on upcoming CES classes visit the AMSC website.",

CHIÈVRES AIR BASE, Belgium – The team from Logistics Readiness Center Benelux celebrated the grand opening of their new paint booth with a ribbon cutting ceremony Dec. 18, and the command team from U.S. Army Garrison Benelux was present to help cut the ceremonial ribbon and congratulate the team.

Army Col. Lindsay Matthews and Command Sgt. Maj. Gary Yurgans joined the former LRC Benelux director, DJ Jackson; the interim director, Diana Ioane; the LRC Benelux maintenance chief, Patrick Brown; and the LRC Benelux paint and body shop team to commemorate the completion of the project.

“It was a long process,” said Brown. “We worked with the host nation to make sure we were in compliance with everything and up to code. We also worked with the garrison environmental office, the garrison safety office and the garrison fire department. All these regulations and certifications had to be met before we were finally able to paint. We had a lot of people involved, and we did it.”

In addition to the newly opened paint booth, LRC Benelux also has a newly upgraded paint room. Brown said the paint and body shop team will use the room for preparation and as an area to do small touch-up jobs.

“Once were done prepping, the equipment piece or vehicle will go straight into the new paint booth where we can shoot it, get it done, and get it ready and back to mission,” Brown said.

It’s estimated that having a new paint booth and an upgraded paint room at the LRC Benelux paint and body shop will increase painting production by 100 percent.

In support of Army Field Support Battalion-Benelux, LRC Benelux is now capable of painting four desert tan Humvees olive drab green every week, plus four to six trailers, said Brown. That’s a big increase from what the painters were capable of doing previously, which was two Humvees and two trailers a week.

“We’re looking at increasing our output by 100 percent,” Brown said. “In addition to that, we’ve received a new requirement from AFSBn-Benelux to paint 47 desert tan M107 Tank Rack Modules olive drab green.” A Tank Rack Module is a 2,500-gallon fuel pod.

Plus, LRC Benelux will continue to support USAG Benelux with installation baseline services, and if other 405th AFSB Army Prepositioned Stocks-2 worksites in Europe need LRC Benelux’s paint support “we can assist them, as well,” Brown said.

The new paint booth, which is part of LRC Benelux’s maintenance division, is the only one of its kind in the U.S. Army Europe and Africa area of operations. The cost of the paint booth is about $123,000. In addition, LRC Benelux purchased a new air compressor, a 6-stage air filtration system, and new pneumatic air respirators.

The maintenance division at LRC Benelux provides installation baseline services to the USAG Benelux area of responsibility. This includes maintenance, repairs, services, and paint and body shop support across the garrison’s footprint, to include multiple installations in Belgium and the Netherlands as well as Dülmen, Germany.

LRC Benelux is one of eight LRCs under the command and control of the 405th Army Field Support Brigade. LRCs execute installation logistics support and services to include supply, maintenance, and transportation as well as clothing issue facility operations, hazardous material management, personal property and household goods, passenger travel, non-tactical vehicle and garrison equipment management, and property book operations. When it comes to providing day-to-day installation baseline services, LRC Benelux directs, manages and coordinates a variety of operations and activities in support of USAG Benelux.

LRC Benelux reports to the 405th AFSB, which is assigned to U.S. Army Sustainment Command and under the operational control of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The brigade is headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany, and provides materiel enterprise support to U.S. Forces throughout Europe and Africa – providing theater sustainment logistics; synchronizing acquisition, logistics and technology; and leveraging U.S. Army Materiel Command’s materiel enterprise to support joint forces.

BROOKLYN, N.Y. – The National Guard is the nation’s oldest military organization, tracing its roots back to 1636, and Air Force Lt. Gen. Marc Sasseville educated the Guard’s newest enlistees about its storied history on its birthday.

“For 387 years, we've had men and women answering the call to serve the nation,” the vice chief of the National Guard Bureau said. “Job No. 1 is to fight the nation's wars. Job No. 2 is to serve our communities and citizens here at home.

“The Guard is more relevant than ever,” he said. “It's great to be part of this fantastic, historic organization.”

As part of a larger itinerary to visit Guardsmen across the city, Sasseville administered the enlistment oath to New York Guard recruits at the Fort Hamilton Military Enlistment Processing Station.

He also met with recruiters and their leaders to hear their perspectives on what many have called the most challenging recruiting environment since the establishment of the all-volunteer force in 1973.

The New York Army National Guard’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion has been particularly successful in navigating issues that range from a strong job market to a decline in qualified applicants to fill the ranks. Earlier this year, the New York Army Guard was named the top recruiting organization across the Guard for the third straight year.

The New York Army Guard recorded 118% in the number of enlisted Soldiers, new officers and warrant officers who joined from October 2022 to September 2023, and the number of Soldiers who reenlisted as a percentage of each state’s total Army Guard strength.

A score of 100% means the state met its recruiting goals. Scores above 100% indicate a state exceeded those recruiting goals.

This success is based on an organizational strategy to invest in and emphasize recruiting, said Army Command Sgt. Maj. Anthony Abbate, the New York Army Guard’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion senior enlisted advisor. A quarter of the New York Army Guard’s active force is dedicated to recruiting.

“It’s not just one thing,” Abbate said. “It’s the senior NCO leadership across the state. It’s our ability to hire passionate, patriotic Soldiers who volunteer for recruiting duty. They believe in this. They know that we have a lot of responsibility to provide the units here in New York state with a lot of talented men and women.”

Abbate said he has not seen a decline in the number of people who want to serve. The reasons for their desires to serve vary.

“We’re doing well in high schools and college markets, and with legal permanent residents,” he said. “These are people who are not yet Americans, but they want to be. One of the ways they’re doing that is getting their expedited U.S. citizenship through the New York National Guard.”

Abbate said the Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course has been a game changer for recruiting in all Army components, specifically in helping applicants pass the aptitude test required for entry.

This program was established in 2022 and provides education and training to help American youth overcome academic and physical fitness barriers to military service.

“It's amazing what happens when you take a cell phone out of somebody’s hand to put them in a situation where they're getting paid to learn,” he said.

Sasseville said the Guard offers an unparalleled value proposition to the nation, and to the 430,000 or so service members who fill its formations.

“The Guard is set apart because of who we are and what we do,” he said. “Our Guardsmen come in on chunks of time, big and small, to either go downrange and fight our nation's wars, or they come on duty serving their states to get a wide range of missions done.”

The vice chief said the Guard offers its members pride in service to country and community; hands-on high-tech training; education benefits and a retirement pension.

Most Guardsmen serve part time and draw their primary source of income from civilian professions, often in different vocations than their military jobs. This broad scope of skills is what makes Guardsmen so valuable to America, he said.

Abbate said the New York Guard is a juggernaut that offers current and prospective members many opportunities.

“We’ve done a lot since 9/11,” he said. “All the deployments, COVID response, and everything in between.”

Sasseville — accompanied by Army Maj. Gen. Raymond Shields, New York’s adjutant general, and Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau Tony Whitehead — also visited New York Guardsmen on station securing transportation hubs in the city as part of Joint Task Force Empire Shield.

Empire Shield is the state’s standing military organization that plans and prepares for defense support to civil authority missions throughout the New York City area. The unit is commanded by a lieutenant colonel and jointly staffed with Army and Air National Guard personnel along with members of the New York Guard State Volunteer Force and New York Naval Militia.

This unit was established on Sept. 11, 2001, and is state-resourced and sustained from the New York National Guard to support state and city emergency management and law enforcement officials with a rapid response force of National Guard members for homeland security missions.

About 500 Army and Air National Guard members serve on the task force.

Sasseville also stopped at the Jamaica Armory in Jamaica, Queens, to view the progress of a major renovation project of the historic 190,000-square-foot building.

This armory is home to the New York Army Guard’s 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery, and the 442nd Military Police Company. Once renovations are complete, the space will accommodate 600 Soldiers and serve as a modernized hub for New York Guard response to emergencies in New York City.

At the Military Enlistment Processing Station, Sasseville and Whitehead invited the new recruits to join them in the ceremonial cutting of the National Guard’s 387th birthday cake.

“What better way to spend the Guard’s birthday than welcoming our newest Citizen-Soldiers and -Airmen into our great force?” Whitehead said. “Congratulations to each of you, and welcome to the National Guard.”

BOISE, Idaho — Brig. Gen. Ryan Robinson returned to the Idaho State Capitol Dec. 15 to administer the commissioning oath to the Idaho Army National Guard’s newest officer: his son, 2nd Lt. Benjamin Robinson.

Like his father, the lieutenant will begin his career in the Idaho Army National Guard after graduating from Boise State University's ROTC program and commissioning inside the state capitol. While in college, both Soldiers served as the Bronco Battalion's cadet commander.

“It means a lot,” the general said. “It’s great to see the next generation come up into the Guard family. I’m proud of Ben’s accomplishments, dedication and willingness to serve.”

Second Lt. Robinson’s dad wasn’t the only familiar face at his commissioning ceremony. After completing the oath, he accepted his first salute from his grandfather, Air Force veteran Thomas Robinson, who also gave Ryan his first salute in 1996 upon his own graduation and commissioning.

Second Lt. Robinson will serve as a quartermaster officer for G Company, 145th Brigade Support Battalion, 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team. He has drilled with the unit since November as a member of the Simultaneous Membership Program, which allows National Guard members to drill with a unit while completing ROTC.

Robinson said his decision to join the Idaho Army National Guard was based on more than just following in his dad’s footsteps.

“I wanted to serve but also pursue a career in mechanical engineering and stay in Idaho,” he said.

Robinson will put his mechanical engineering degree to good use at a Boise-based drone company.

“I’m honored to accept my commission from the Army and to begin my career, both on the Army side and on the civilian side,” he said.

Since commissioning himself, Brig. Gen. Robinson has successfully managed dual careers. He serves as the Idaho National Guard’s director of the joint staff and as a corporate finance officer in his civilian job. He deployed twice to Iraq in support of combat operations and has held commands at multiple echelons.

Dustin Wilson has made a major contribution as Central Issue Facility manager and accountable officer at Logistics Readiness Center-Daegu since his arrival in June 2022. He has reduced excess/outdated stock by 45 percent, scored “commendable” on all inspections and set up a highly effective ICE feedback system which nets in excess of 10 comments a month (all positive). He brings significant energy, creativity, customer service and efficiency to LRC-Daegu CIF making it one of the best in the Army.

Hometown:

Surprise, AZ

How long have you been working for the U.S. Army?

I started civilian service in 2017 working for the 402nd AFSB LRC-Wainwright Central Issue Facility as a supply technician. With the knowledge I gained there I was able to move to 405th AFSB LRC-Benelux in 2019 as the accountable officer for the CIF Main in Chievres, Belgium, and CIF Annex in Brunssum, Netherlands. I started my current position the CIF accountable officer for the Camp Carroll CIF under 403rd AFSB LRC-Daegu in 2022.

What other positions have you held with the U.S. Military?

Army active duty from 2013-2017 in 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment stationed at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, as MOS 15J, OH-58D Kiowa helicopter armament, electrical, and avionics systems maintenance. Completed one 9-month rotation to Camp Humphreys ending February 2015. As the Kiowa began to be phased out, I was detailed to CIF as a material handler assistant in April 2015, preparing issues and turn-ins of Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE). This was really the start of my career at CIF as I became knowledgeable in OCIE and CIF procedures.

Tell us about your job and what you do:

As a CIF accountable officer, I am responsible for ensuring the accountability of OCIE and Chemical Individual Protective Equipment issued, received, and stored at CIF. CIFs mission is all about readiness, providing protective and load carrying equipment to our assigned service members to ensure they are always fully capable and ready to complete their missions. We support thousands of service members in Area IV with issues and turn-ins of authorized equipment, handling 282,380 pieces of equipment with a value of $28.1m in the past year.

What motivates you?

I love working as part of the CIF team and supporting the service member. CIF is a place I know I can make a positive impact for service members. As the CIF accountable officer, Soldiers often come to me for questions and concerns regarding their equipment and records. While I can’t immediately solve every problem, taking a moment to hear what the individual has to say and understanding their issue makes a difference. I can provide accurate guidance and options for the service member to pursue, ensuring the individual has a way forward and positive experience even in stressful situations.

What other duties are you responsible for?

Alternate Billing Official

What are some of your accomplishments while at LRC-Daegu?

Camp Carroll CIF has achieved a Best-In-Class rating in the ICE Comment system for FY22 and FY23 with a 100 percent satisfaction rating. Our team provides outstanding customer service and ensures every service member is treated with respect and understanding, guaranteeing a positive experience for all.

What is the best thing about working at LRC-Daegu?

Camp Carroll CIF has an amazing team of Korean local national employees, several of whom have worked there over 20 years. I love working with them, sharing CIF knowledge, and learning from their experiences over the years. They made a positive difference in my life and have been very helpful in the transition to living in Korea. I am truly grateful to have them on my team.

What do you like to do in your free time?

My family and I love the simple things like walking along the Sincheon River and visiting the local markets in Daegu, enjoying the amazing cuisine and culture of Korea.

Do you have anything else you would like to share?

After starting my Army career as an enlisted aviation Soldier, I would have never thought my time detailed at CIF would lead me into the career I have today as a CIF accountable officer. I am thankful for the great leaders, colleagues and friends who personally educated and supported me, providing opportunities to grow professionally and further my career.",

BASTOGNE, Belgium — Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) helped commemorate the 79th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne, Belgium, Dec. 16, 2023 with a parade through the city center. The 101st Soldiers were joined by WWII veterans, a local Belgian band, members of the Belgian military, Soldiers from Benelux, Belgian school children, and members of the community.

The Battle of the Bulge occurred in the winter of 1944 as elements of the 101st looked to secure and defend the city of Bastogne, surrounded by the German Army. The airborne Soldiers were able to repel the attacks of the Germans and outlast the barrage of German artillery until Lt. Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army was able to break through the German line to aid the 101st Soldiers. Both Lt. Gen. Patton and Brig. Gen. Anthony McAuliffe, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, are seen as heroes that saved the town of Bastogne from destruction.

That legacy of service and sacrifice has not been forgotten by those serving in the 101st today. Col. Trevor Voelkel, commander of the 1st Brigade Combat Team (Bastogne), 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) has not forgotten the importance of what his unit's namesake is.

""It's an absolute privilege and honor to represent the great Soldiers of the Bastogne brigade,"" said Voelkel. ""To see the WWII veterans, to hear their stories and to understand their sacrifice and how that relates to the sacrifice that our Soldiers and families have today is truly a wonderful opportunity and amazing experience.""

""It is a community within a community in Bastogne,"" said Voelkel, ""and what I think you'll find is that they have not forgotten and it's a part of the fabric of society here. They still remember through their relatives and their stories, the liberation of Belgium when the Americans and Allies came to liberate them after years under the Nazis. It's important that we all remember what the world went through, so that it never happens again.""",

FORT WALKER, Va. – From December 7-10, five Service Members from the Soldier Recovery Unit at Fort Belvoir, Va., were hosted at Fort Walker for a weekend white-tailed deer hunting excursion put on by Fort Walker staff and tenant volunteers.

For the first time since the COVID pandemic, Fort Walker was able to restart the program and bring SRU participants to stay in The Lodge, the largest and most historic cabin on post. All hunting excursions were led by a guide from the Garrison or Tenant Staffs. The guides, if needed, would assist the hunter to the site, remain present for the duration of the hunt, and retrieve any game upon a successful hunt.

“When I arrived at Fort Walker in 2022, the Wounded Warrior Hunt was the most requested event to bring back after the COVID pandemic, and I can now see why. The employees here love supporting our nation's Wounded Warriors, and I'd like to thank all of our volunteers who supported the event, as well as the participants who have sacrificed so much in support of our country,” said Lt. Col. Jason Duffy, garrison commander. Fort Walker personnel are eager to expand the hunt next year to even more participants.",

KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany – One of the joys of the holidays is gift giving, and the team at the Remote Maintenance and Distribution Center-Ukraine in Poland experienced this recently when they received care packages and gift boxes from a group of kind-hearted people on the other side of the world.

“Thank you to everyone who helped lift the holiday spirits within our formation,” said Lt. Col. Michael Liles, the RDC-U commander. “Your act of kindness goes a long way for all of the troops here.”

Army Maj. Janet Williams, who also works at the RDC-U, said she wanted to personally express her gratitude to everyone who continues to keep her and her fellow Soldiers in mind while they’re deployed abroad.

“We could not do what we do without the love and support from people like you. Thank you, and may God continue to bless you,” Williams said.

The team of Soldiers and civilians who work at the RDC-U received multiple holiday care packages and gift boxes in the mail from a group of very giving people back in the states. The boxes included snacks and goodies and things that deployed Soldiers overseas find useful.

“The entire team at our restaurant, along with our fine patrons, are grateful for what you do,” said Nick Mikus, the founder of Nick’s Ristorante in Huntsville, Alabama, and the person who organized the care packages. “We appreciate your sacrifices and your patriotism as you keep all of us here at home protected with the freedoms we enjoy, and we look forward to your safe return home very soon.”

Master Sgt. George Barker, the senior enlisted advisor at the RDC-U and Army Field Support Battalion-Mannheim, responded to Mikus, a retired Soldier himself, with much gratitude in return.

“My sincere gratitude and appreciation to you and your team,” Barker said to Mikus in an email. “Thank you for taking the time to send us these care packages. Your consideration for others during this holiday season is truly what Christmas is all about.”

“It came as a total surprise and was the highlight of my day,” added Sgt. 1st Class Tyson Glover. “I'm grateful for your support and wish you and your families a wonderful Christmas.”

The RDC-U, which was stood up by the 405th Army Field Support Brigade shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, is a model of cooperation and U.S. Army Materiel Command enterprise-level support. Organizations supporting the mission include the 405th AFSB, Security Assistance Group-Ukraine, U.S. Army Europe and Africa, U.S. Army Sustainment Command and multiple AMC Life Cycle Management Commands such as U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command and more.

The 405th AFSB is assigned to ASC and under the operational control of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The brigade is headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany, and provides materiel enterprise support to U.S. Forces throughout Europe and Africa – providing theater sustainment logistics; synchronizing acquisition, logistics and technology; and leveraging AMC’s materiel enterprise to support joint forces.

WASHINGTON – In a strategic move to bolster the nation's defense capabilities and address emerging security challenges, the District of Columbia Army National Guard officially activated Delta Company, 223rd Military Intelligence Battalion (LING), during a ceremony at the D.C. Armory Dec. 9.

Maj. Gen. John Andonie, commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, underscored the day's significance, saying, “Events like this do not happen every day. It is a rare occasion when a state, territory, or district activates a unit.”

This new addition under the 74th Troop Command, which is synonymous with high-visibility missions, including the COVID-19 mission, First Amendment demonstrations and Presidential Inaugurations, will contribute to national security by providing intelligence and linguistic support to all Army echelons. The activation comes amid a rapidly changing threat landscape, marked by technological advancements and requiring a more agile and adaptable intelligence response.

“The mission of the battalion has evolved to address the dynamic environment we now find ourselves in,” said 1st Lt John Ibrahim, D Co, 223rd Military Intelligence Battalion commander. “While our company mission of providing intelligence and linguist support remains the same, we've shifted focus to emphasize integrated technological advancements and large-scale combat operations.”

Delta Company comprises highly trained and skilled personnel, enhancing the D.C. Guard’s multi-domain capabilities by providing intelligence and language proficiencies not found in standard U.S. Army units. The unique skillsets and robust training requirements are critical for supporting Army operations.

“Linguists are very hard to find in some places of our country, but not in D.C.,” said Andonie. “We are in one of the most diverse cities in the U.S., if not the world. It is that diversity that will allow us to find the individuals to serve in this unit and provide the Army with the capability it needs for the wartime mission.”

Recruiting additional Soldiers for the unit will involve traditional and digital channels while leveraging existing networks within the intelligence community in D.C., engaging in local community outreach events, and collaborating with educational institutions. Prospective recruits can pursue a role as human intelligence collectors and linguists. The unit also has career opportunities for Officers and Warrant Officers. The activation provides a unique pathway for individuals interested in contributing to national security through diverse intelligence roles, broadening the appeal and scope of the D.C. National Guard's recruitment efforts.

While this element is new to the D.C. Guard, it brings a wealth of expertise. The unit was previously part of the Massachusetts Army National Guard and earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for efforts in Operation Iraqi Freedom leading to the capture of Saddam Hussein. During their deployment to Kosovo, the unit was responsible for multiple multinational intelligence collection teams.

“What fills me with the most pride is the unwavering dedication demonstrated by my Soldiers towards this organization,” Ibrahim said. “The transition from Massachusetts to D.C. presented unexpected challenges for many, yet their resilience and commitment to the unit have truly showcased the exceptional character of these individuals.”

By integrating these capabilities, the D.C. National Guard can better protect the nation and its residents, ensuring a comprehensive and adaptable approach to safeguarding national security.

BARLING, Arkansas – Thirty-three, two-person teams of military snipers from around the world competed in the 53rd Winston P. Wilson (WPW) Sniper Championship (National Guard) and the 33rd Armed Forces Skill at Arms Meeting (Inter-Service) December 1-8 at Fort Chaffee Joint Maneuver Training Center. These championships allow service members to test sniper skills and weapon systems in a battle-focused environment.

This year’s sniper championships, included international competitors from Colombia, Denmark, and the Netherlands.

The guest of honor at the awards ceremony, marking the triumphant conclusion of the highly competitive event, was Maj. Gen. Jonathan Stubbs, Arkansas’ adjutant general. His presence added honor to the celebration, recognizing outstanding achievements in marksmanship.

“Marksmanship is not just about hitting a target. It’s about discipline, focus, and precision. These are the same qualities that make our National Guard Soldiers the best in the world,” said Maj. Gen. Stubbs.

“The Winston P. Wilson Championship and the National Guard Marksmanship Training Center are integral to the success of our Soldiers in maintaining their marksmanship proficiency,” Stubbs said. “Through these institutions, our Soldiers are equipped with the necessary skills to protect our communities and defend our nation. A strong marksmanship program is essential for the safety and security of our country, and the National Guard is proud to lead the way.”

The WPW sniper competition began in 1971 and has been held annually to determine the best shooters in the United States National Guard. This year’s 53rd WPW Sniper Champion is Utah National Guard. Shooters are awarded the prestigious Chiefs 50 Marksmanship Badge on behalf of the Chief, National Guard Bureau. The Chief’s 50 Marksmanship Badge was established to provide evidence and public recognition of outstanding marksmanship abilities demonstrated at the National Guard Championships.

In addition to earning the Chief’s 50 Badge and the Overall Championship Team Trophy, the Utah National Guard received the Chief David R. Logan Sniper Team Trophy. The 2nd place winner is the Iowa Sniper Team. Iowa shooters are also recipients of the Chief’s 50 Badge.

The Armed Forces Skills at Arms Meeting (AFSAM), established in 1991, is a multi-national competition created to promote marksmanship training and competition between United States military forces and allied nations. This year’s 33rd AFSAM Sniper Championship winner is the 2nd Special Warfare Training Group. The AFSAM championship ran concurrently with the WPW championship and incorporated the same fire courses.

This competition is designed as a training tool for US and Allied armed forces, immersing them into situations they could encounter in the real world. Attendees learn to maneuver and shoot in a carefully orchestrated chaos that mimics a battle-like environment. This allows participating teams to hone their current skills and develop new ones.

FORT WAINRIGHT, Alaska – Two members of Fort Wainwright’s Department of Public Works staff have been selected for top garrison honors for the year. Katrina Hughes, a contract performance evaluator and the mold program manager, has been selected as employee of the year, and Graham Wichman, the Engineering Division chief, as supervisor of the year.

Mold is one of the most significant problems for military barracks, housing, and other facilities across the Department of Defense, and Hughes’s work is critical to the health and comfort of Fort Wainwright’s soldiers, families, and employees.

Hughes’s supervisor, David Zrna, chief of Contract Management Branch, said that Hughes drafted the garrison’s mold response and mitigation standard operating procedures document.

“She coordinates with various directorates and emphasizes the importance of recognizing and remediating mold on Fort Wainwright,” Zrna said. “Katrina has been doing a stellar job along with her regular daily duties. She cares for the health and welfare of the soldiers and civilians on Fort Wainwright, and it reflects with a job well done.”

Mold management is not her only responsibility, however, and Hughes said she “oversees contracts to ensure contractors are meeting their contractual agreements in a timely manner, with adequate materials and in a safe way.”

Hughes has only worked at Fort Wainwright since October 2022, though she has accomplished much in her time here.

When asked what was one of the most notable projects she has been involved in, she replied, “For me, seeing the airfield painting project come to completion was up there for me. The airfield had been waiting years to have this done and being a part of the team to see this through was rewarding. Our team worked through nights, weekends, you name it to ensure the project was successful.”

Like Hughes, Wichman has also only been in his current position at Fort Wainwright for a little over a year but has worked at the installation since 2005 in a variety of positions.

When asked why he nominated Wichman for the award, Tim Sponseller, the Public Works director, said, “I nominated Graham for the supervisor of the year award mainly due to his outstanding efforts in effectively managing an enormous program load—larger than we have seen at USAG Alaska in at least the past 15 years, with over $400M contracted compared to a typical amount of $85M.”

Many of the programs that Wichman is overseeing are construction projects that are being tracked by the highest levels of the Army, Department of Defense, and Congress. They include the new Child Development Center, barracks, Community Activity Center, Aquatics Center, and enhanced main gate infrastructure, among others. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. James McConville, Senior Enlisted Leader to the Chairman Sgt. Maj. Ramon Colon-Lopez, and other dignitaries have visited Fort Wainwright and toured those sites.

Other significant projects Wichman has overseen have included new snow-making equipment for the Birch Hill ski area, renovations and new equipment for the post fitness facilities, and a new motorcycle safety course.

However, “the most significant single program that Graham established and managed was the Greenhouse Gas program,” Sponseller said. “Graham quickly established a vision and execution plan for the program. He and his team coordinated closely with customers, contracting agencies, and Headquarters Installation Management Command to establish project teams and complete detailed scopes of work and estimates on 12 projects that were awarded for over $108M of the $110M available, all prior to the 30 September deadline.”

According to Wichman, the work was truly a team effort.

“I need to emphasize that without the effort of my highly experienced team, we would have had to turn away this opportunity, based on the short timeline,” he said.

Wichman supervises approximately 45 employees in the Engineering Division. He has been dedicated to their professional development and has initiated continuing education opportunities, including their ability to attend relevant professional training in the local area. Local training saves the employees time and keeps them near their families while also saving the Army thousands of dollars in travel expenses for more distant training sessions.

Having worked at Fort Wainwright for 18 years, Wichman has an in-depth understanding of the needs of the installation.

“I fully understand the struggles with our extreme environment and old infrastructure,” Wichman said, “which makes me appreciate every win we get and every improvement we are part of to make this installation a welcome, safe, and comfortable place to work and live for our soldiers, families, and civilians.”",

“It gives the U.S. Soldiers pride in what they do, it broadens their perspective and gives them more insight into Korean culture,” said 1st Lt. Hannah Taylor, a 194th DSSB U.S. volunteer. “Being able to help the local community shows who we are as an organization to the people of the country (Republic of Korea) we are here to protect.”

The Good Neighbor Program is a USFK community relations program initiated in 2003, aimed at actively engaging the local community, government, media, business, education, and military through cultural and educational exchanges to promote mutual understanding of one another's cultures, customs, and lifestyles.

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — For many, the holiday season means putting up the tree and decorating it with care.

Trees for Troops helped to ensure those traditions continue with more than 600 fresh Christmas trees donated to Fort Cavazos and given out to Soldiers and DOD ID card holders Dec. 8 and 9 at the Phantom Warrior Stadium here.

The annual event is sponsored by the Christmas Spirit Foundation, which provides free farm-grown trees to service members in all branches of the U.S. military and their families, and FedEx, which delivered the trees to the Great Place.

Summer Inwood, chief of sports, fitness and aquatics with Fort Cavazos Directorate of Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation, explained why lower enlisted Soldiers had first pick of the trees.

“We just do it because we know they don’t make a lot,” she said. “Their sacrifices are just the same as the officers and the upper enlisted, they just don’t get the same paycheck. And so, we want to make sure that they get the Christmas decorations, and their families get to experience what really the holidays are all about.”

Festive aromas pierced the air and helped usher in the celebratory season as lower enlisted Soldiers and family members were ushered in, 10 at a time, to select the perfect tree.

Though the growers couldn’t greet each recipient personally, they sent their well wishes in personalized messages attached to many of the trees for the new owners to enjoy.

Size and appearance factored heavily into the decision to take trees home, but more importantly, it was about the grandeur of the gesture.

Spc. William Workman, 1st Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, his wife Beth and daughter Emilee have participated in the event twice previously and this year, the family was set on a tall tree with full foliage.

But Workman conveyed the true reason he was grateful for the holiday tradition.

“It means a lot to know that folks go through and take their time to donate all these trees, so all of these other Soldiers have the opportunity to have a tree,” he said.

Spc. Karina Machado, 553 Division Sustainment Support Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade, also had her eye on a tall, green, fluffy and full tree to take home to her husband and two children.

She explained that this time of year can be expensive, and the free tree is appreciated.

“Sometimes during the holidays, someone can’t afford one and it’s a really great gesture for you guys to help E-4 and below,” she said referring to the Trees for Troops program.

Spc. Haku Thomson, 553 Div. Sustainment Support Bn., 1st Cav. Div. Sustainment Bde., shared that this was his first time having a live tree for his wife and daughter, and that the gesture made him feel special.

“It’s amazing because I’m from the islands so we don’t get these trees in the islands, so to get this for the first time, my first Christmas, it’s really nice,” he said. “I think it’s really good for us E-4 and below.”

Soldiers and their families enjoyed some assistance from the Fort Cavazos Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers program. Thirty BOSS volunteers donned in Santa hats helped patrons select and load their trees.

“There’s nothing better than the Soldiers being able to come to Phantom Warrior Stadium and get help getting a Christmas tree from our BOSS representatives,” said BOSS President Cpl. Kandice Pritchard-Harmon. “I’m very proud that we are out here today being able to help our fellow battle buddies and their families.”",

SEMBACH KASERNE, Germany – Testing the capabilities of Soldiers guarding prisoners at Europe’s only correctional facility as well as strengthening military and host-nation cooperation came into play during an exercise here in vicinity of the Sembach Correctional Facility.

The Missing Prisoner Emergency Action Plan Exercise tested U.S. Army Correctional Activity-Europe’s ability to trace, capture and return Soldiers to the facility. This is the first full-size exercise conducted at this facility to test the readiness of the facility’s military and partner organizations.

The exercise involves multiple units from the local area including U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz’s Directorate of Emergency Services, Combined Military Working Dog Detachment-Europe and the Kaiserslautern Polizei.

During the exercise, correctional-facility cadre monitored three Soldiers who were simulating prisoners conducting area beautification outside of the facility’s containment area. During this time a Soldier fled custody of the cadre to attempt escape.

The facility’s operations chief said the ability to react to scenarios like these is key to a ensuring the security of the prisoners and the outside community.

“Our team is ready to react and has plans in place in the very unlikely event a prisoner was to escape our cadres custody,” said Sgt. 1st Class Davon Watkins, correctional facility operations chief. “We immediately lockdown the facility, establish an emergency operations center, deploy a search party and coordinate with local partners for help.”

Once the emergency action plan is activated, the cadre and senior leaders in the facility begin contacting multiple community organizations to assist in catching the missing prisoners. Watkins said the cooperation between all units is essential.

“Events of this scope require that we are able to seamlessly work with multiple military organizations and our host-nation Polizei partners,” said Watkins. “We all must be able to work within the systems each party has in place, and this exercise allows everyone involved to learn how each organization operates so in the event there is an emergency we are familiar with all systems and policies.”

In the end, the combined team of Soldiers, a military working dog, DES officers and Polizei caught the fleeing prisoners and returned them to the facility. While there were adjustments and challenges, Watkins called the exercise a success.

“This exercise was a resounding success and met and exceeded every expectation we had,” he said. “Any challenges we faced we overcame quickly and adjusted well. In the end this was a great learning tool for us that we will take back to our teammates and will do even better next time.”

The missing prisoner exercise allows the correctional facility to coordinate emergency measures with local partners within minutes of an emerging event occurring and is important since all organizations have different law enforcement roles throughout the community.

“It is important to emphasize that the responsibility for security in the West Palatinate is not only the duty of the police alone but is a shared task that we carry together,” said Bernhard Christian Erfort, Kaiserslautern Polizei police spokesman. “The U.S. armed forces and their members have proven themselves not only as defenders of our freedom, but also as committed members of our community.”

U.S. Army Correctional Activity-Europe exercises command and control of all U.S. military service members in Europe and Africa awaiting trial or serving time for crimes committed. The facility falls under the 21st TSC’s area of responsibility under the 18th MP Brigade.

This scope of this exercise created buzz from media throughout Germany with a slew of media outlets interested in the facility’s crucial mission of the U.S. Army’s only correctional facility in Europe.

“The media attending events like this not only shows what our units are doing but allows the local community to see firsthand the scope of work the Army does with our host nation partners,” said Maj. Vonnie Wright, 21st Theater Sustainment Command public affairs officer. “We want to be able to highlight the work of the 18th Military Police Brigade, the correctional facility, our German Allies and the 21st TSC any time we have the opportunity.”

Noting the exercise’s success and praising his team’s readiness, U.S. Army Correctional Activity-Europe senior enlisted leader Sgt. Major Marcus Mitchell said his team should take pride in the results and the partnership they have built with their host-nation colleagues.

""This exercise is a win for the facility, the 18th MP Brigade, the 21st TSC and the Army Corrections Command,” he said. ""Our team here at the United States Army Correctional Activity Europe performs their duties at the facility in Sembach 24 hours a day 7 days a week. It is critical and mandated that we exercise scenarios like this internally and with our local German and American partners who would participate and assist with this type of event. I am extremely proud of their efforts and the teamwork they showed throughout the exercise to get the job done.""",

VICENZA, Italy – With Christmas just around the corner, Maija Winesberry shared some advice to avoid getting in debt, with couples from the community during a recent Love and Money Matter workshop.

Christmas is not about giving gifts, or spending money on gifts, Winesberry said. She posed a question, could she even recall a gift given to her from five years ago.

“I like to think about remembering an experience five years ago, some memory of a great time during the holiday season” said Winesberry, who explained how experiences are the best gifts. “Creating memories along the way and increasing your education is completely priceless.”

Sometimes a gift can be writing a nice note or offering something your partner will cherish and keep forever, Winesberry said. Meanwhile, revising your money situation and having a spending plan – for this year and next, she said. Now is the time to start automated savings for next years’ gifts – a way to keep yourself from debt.

Three couples took part in the Nov. 17 training offered by Army Community Service. Nicky Wolf Sumner, ACS’s Family Advocacy Program Prevention Education Coordinator, created the workshop to emphasize how love and money are correlated.

How do these two subjects become one? The Garrison Outlook asked Wolf Sumner, whose job is to educate people about preventing domestic violence and child abuse.

She knows from experience that couples often have problems communicating and she wanted to create something similar to a marriage workshop. She also learned recently how problems with love and money can lead to suicide.

Suicide statistics show that 42 percent of suicides in the military involves relationship issues, Wolf Sumner said. Ten percent are because of financial issues and the rest was because they were not able to find meaning in life, she said. Wolf Sumner partnered with the garrison’s Religious Support Office’s “Spiritual Life Center” to also offer a faith-based approach. While overseas, military families often move to a single income household due to employment issues. Couples need to plan for this to not have financial issues that can also cause relationship problems.

“Oftentimes people struggle with money overseas,” Wolf Sumner said. “I see many families struggling with financial resources and that’s why I decided to combine the different aspects together to make it in a non-invasive way, providing an interactive class, a more fun way to talk about communication, to talk about financial stuff.”

The workshop took different approaches.

Chaplain (Lt. Col.) John Hubbs spoke about the five love languages. Amber Morris taught couples yoga, focusing on healing touches. Winesberry talked about maintaining smart goals, making future purchases and how to maintain finances. Wolf Sumner talked about communication, how to overcome obstacles, how to build a foundation, how to tackle stress when it comes around and how to work together in a marriage or a relationship.

By the conclusion, the couples were able to learn from each other, Wolf Sumner said, because we’re all different and work in different dynamics.

The ACS financial readiness program exists to support readiness, Winesberry said. The next quarterly workshop is in the Spring. ACS has details.

“The workshop was to provide a space for couples to come and chat about their goals, their future as a couple and their finances,” Winesberry said. “I believe that there was an increase of interest after the workshop was finished”.",

WIESBADEN, Germany – A local national fire fighter was honored for 38 years of service in an intimate retirement ceremony at the U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden Directorate of Emergency Services fire house on Clay Kaserne, Nov. 22.

In the Army, selfless service can be defined, in part, as doing your duty loyally without thought of recognition or gain. For USAG Wiesbaden firefighter and crew chief Captain Thomas Graef, volunteerism and selfless service began as a boyhood dream that came to fruition over nearly four decades as a professional and 50 years as a volunteer firefighter.

Rauenthal beginnings

Public service is often referred to as a calling, however 38 years of public service is more than just a calling.

“Firefighting comes from the bottom of your heart,” explained Graef’s supervisor, USAG Wiesbaden Fire Department Chief Daniel Corzelius.

For Graef, selfless service and fighting fires was more than a passion – it was tradition.

Graef’s journey to becoming a professional firefighter began in 1972 when he joined the local volunteer fire department managed and led by his grandfather, in his hometown of Rauenthal, Germany.

However, achieving his boyhood dream of working in a German firehouse would be stymied by German regulation. But his drive to be a professional firefighter would find a different path through opportunities with the U.S. Army.

Clear path ahead

Two regulations stood in the way of Graef fulfilling his dream of becoming a professional firefighter – one he could overcome, the other proved more challenging.

Graef knew that according to German regulation, firefighters must have a handyman’s trade. He knew going back to school and learning a trade was his first step, therefore he decided to become an electrician and eventually found work repairing helicopters on the Clay Kaserne Airfield.

The second regulation would pose more of an obstacle.

“In Germany, I could not be a professional fire fighter because I wore glasses,” said Graef.

Though a daunting hurdle to overcome, he would not let it stop his desire to join the professional firefighting corps.

Firefighting was in his blood but serving as a volunteer fighting fire was not enough.

He knew that the German “no-glasses restriction” did not apply to U.S. firefighters, therefore working with the U.S. Army firefighting service could be the solution to his problem.

Graef was officially hired as a member of the USAG Wiesbaden fire department back on June 1, 1985 – leaving the airfield and his electrician duties behind him.

Starting his career handling fire hoses as a rookie firefighter, Graef rose to become a shift leader and ultimately became an assistant chief, responsible for incident response and management.

A proven leader throughout his career, Graef applied his firefighting expertise towards training countless numbers of fighters throughout the years, from rookies to battalion chiefs.

Evolving fire presence

The U.S. Army has had a firefighting presence on Clay Kaserne for 77 years. Graef has been a part of that history for almost four decades.

In that time, he has seen the garrison fire department expand, adding more equipment and personnel over the years.

“(…) As Clay Kaserne grew, so did the responsibilities to respond to the needs of the growing community,” said Graef.

The fire department grew over the years, but the building remained the same size.

“When I started there were only two trucks and now – we have so many they will not fit in the firehouse.”

Building special bonds

Serving as a member of the USAG Wiesbaden Fire Department can be a tough and dangerous profession that offers long hours of shift work – often during the holidays – that can mean a lot of time away from family and loved ones.

“Being a fire fighter is a calling and it takes a lot of time away from the family,” said USAG Wiesbaden DES Director Cody Ferguson.

Spending a lot of time together in close quarters during difficult situations can bring people closer.

The closeness between Chief Graef and his crews is evident. To many of his men, Graef is known as “Opa,” German for grandfather.

“Why Opa? I am the oldest…all my guys are younger than me,” added Graef with a slight smile.

Recognizing their support and sacrifices throughout Capt. Graef’s long and distinguished career, his family present – Gaby Graef and Johannes Graef, were presented with a bouquet of flowers and a gift basket.

“Nobody can be a success for 38 years, without strong family support – thank you for supporting Thomas,” said Corzelius.

Next steps

Though the ceremony marked a major milestone for Chief Graef, he won’t be riding an engine truck into the sunset of retirement, just yet.

In what can be referred to as coming full circle, and though his 38-year career as a professional firefighter has come to an end, Graef will continue to be a fixture in the USAG Wiesbaden fire department as a volunteer.

When he finally decides to hang up his firefighting boots Graef and his wife have plans to do spend more time hiking.

Local national employment

Local nationals have consistently been a part of the workforce, working side-by-side with U.S. armed forces and civilian personnel, on overseas installations for decades.

The garrison workforce in Wiesbaden is comprised of more than 475 personnel of which 370 are local national hires – more than 75%.

Finding qualified applicants who want to apply and fill the void is a constant recruitment effort for Garrison’s Workforce Development team.

“We are short local national hires…especially in the blue collar, engineer, technician and administration career fields,” said USAG Wiesbaden Workforce Development Program Manager Thomas Schulze.

Despite the many employment opportunities that are available, many local nationals do not know that the U.S. military is such a large employer, right here in their back yard.

SEMBACH, Germany – The U.S. Army NATO G4 section used a novel approach for training Soldiers assigned to the unit’s headquarters company about the Army’s Command Supply Discipline Program.

The format for the training was based on the popular game show, Jeopardy!, where contestants respond to clues with answers in the form of a question.

Approximately 20 Soldiers participated in the training Nov. 30 at the U.S. Army NATO headquarters in Sembach, Germany.

The U.S. Army NATO Headquarters and Headquarter Company, led by Capt. Ana Hill and 1st Sgt. Cory Jones, organize weekly training opportunities to “accomplish the brigade commander’s training guidance,” said Jones. “We identify gaps and develop solutions to close the gap. This training was identified to reinforce our core competencies.”

“We receive the Army’s training requirements and the brigade’s training requirements, and we nest them together which requires we do training on a weekly basis,” said Jones. “These weekly training requirements are the bedrock for ensuring our ability to fight and win or Nation’s wars, and more specifically to fulfill our commitment to provide trained and ready Soldiers in support of the NATO mission.”

Sgt. 1st Class Jean Ady and Staff Sgt. Desiree Bruton, both from U.S. Army NATO G4, provided instruction for the training.

“The purpose of our Supply Jeopardy! training was to teach the Soldiers about Command Supply Discipline responsibilities and procedures,” said Ady.

“This was mandatory training,” said Ady, “but we wanted to make it fun. This format was much more interactive and encouraged everyone to greater participation especially because the Soldiers are so competitive.”

“Everyone knew a lot more than I expected,” he said. “For example, they already knew what a FLIPL (Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss) was, but they did not know all the details. In the Jeopardy! format, we were able to provide them those extra details while keeping the training fun.”

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — A dozen American flags, along with one United States Army flag, waved in the crisp breeze Saturday as Chaplain (Maj.) Matt Burden, 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade, welcomed visitors to Bethel Cemetery.

“What an honor to be among you, to get a chance to lead us in this (service) and just to memorialize the heroism of a great man, a great Soldier,” he shared.

Bethel Cemetery, located in the northern training area of Fort Cavazos, was opened to finally lay Staff Sgt. Robert G. Rudd to rest next to his parents after 78 years.

Rudd, who served with 2nd Infantry Division, was killed in action on Jan. 30, 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge.

“I never dreamed that something like this would happen,” Jane Olivier, Rudd’s niece, shared after the service, “but I’m so thankful that the Army was so insistent and diligent in taking care of this and bringing (him) back to us and having this today.”

More than a dozen veterans and supporters were in attendance for the service, along with five surviving family members of Rudd, including Olivier. Other surviving family members were unable to attend, yet they passed along their joy of Rudd finally returning home.

“My grandma is one of the surviving nieces, and she named her youngest son after him,” Stacy Baldwin, a great, great niece of Rudd, said.

This prompted the memory of Olivier.

“Actually, (Stacy’s) grandmother used to write to (Rudd) when he was in the Army,” Olivier shared. “She would write to him until one day, she got the letter back.”

Baldwin became emotional at the thought of representing her grandmother that day, who was unable to attend.

“My grandmother was very, very happy to hear that he had been found,” she stated.

Military service, tragic loss

During World War II, Rudd deferred the draft order he received because he was the primary caregiver of his mother. When she passed however, he voluntarily entered the U.S. Army, joining April 12, 1942, in Dallas. He served with Company C, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Inf. Div., during World War II.

In 1944, American troops were amassed along Germany’s western borders resting and refitting. On Dec. 16, 1944, the German army launched its final counterattack along the western front. The ensuing battle, known now as the Battle of the Bulge, lasted from Dec. 16, 1944, to Jan. 25, 1945, with remnants lasting through February, costing more than 19,000 American lives, according to historical reports from the Army.

During this counterattack, the 2nd Inf. Div. became concentrated with the 99th Infantry Division around Elsenborn, Belgium; they dug in and held a defensive line, repulsing several increasingly desperate assaults by German troops. They finally began to push out of their positions in January 1945 and recapture the wooded areas east of Elsenborn, known as the Elsenbüchel Forest.

Toward the end of January 1945, Rudd’s battalion received orders to attack several new towns.

According to Rudd’s funeral service program, “it was by bright moonlight that troops began the attack, through chest high snowdrifts and mined areas the battalions secured ground around Wirtzfeld within several hours.” Moving on to the towns of Rocherath-Krinkelt, known as the “twin towns,” they found themselves in fierce fighting by late morning even though the regimental artillery had laid a huge barrage on the towns. It was sometime during the fighting Jan. 30, 1945, at Rocherath that Rudd was killed.

Due to intense fighting and fierce artillery shelling, and major restrictions in the area, Rudd’s body was unrecoverable, and the War Department submitted a Report of Death on Feb. 20, 1945, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, also known as DPAA.

It was in 1946 that the American Graves Registration Command was charged with recovering and identifying remains in the European Theatre. Those that could not be immediately identified, which numbered in the thousands, were brought to the nearest American Military Cemetery in the area and named with an X followed by a number.

Throughout the years, several requests were made to compare the remains of an unknown to that of Rudd. However, no matches could be found.

In 1950, a board of officers determined that Rudd’s status was that his remains “were disposed of by the enemy at an unknown location” and further approved his status as “non-recoverable.”

The process

DPAA announced Oct. 23 that Rudd was accounted for on June 20, 2022.

“After reviewing information provided by Belgian and American researchers in 2017, DPAA historians analyzed evidence related to several sets of remains initially recovered by Belgian locals in the Elsenbuchel Forest that had been interred at what is now the Ardennes American Cemetery in 1949, including unknown remains X-3144 Neuville,” according to DPAA.

Researchers suggested to DPAA that “X-3144” might be associated with an unaccounted for member of the 99th Infantry Division, and that the remains should be disinterred, and the list expanded for possible candidates beyond the 99th Infantry Division to include Soldiers, like Rudd, from the 2nd Inf. Div.

This list included 18 individuals whose regiments had operated north of Wirtzfeld. It was this area where the 38th Inf. Regt., 2nd Inf. Div., had operated when Rudd had disappeared, according to DPAA. Historians noted that given his regiment’s location, it was quite possible he perished in or very near the Elsenbüchel Forest.

Following an interdisciplinary analysis by DPAA historical and scientific staff, the X-3144 remains were disinterred from Ardennes American Cemetery on June 23, 2021, and transferred to DPAA Laboratory at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, for comparison.

To identify Rudd’s remains, scientists from DPAA used anthropological analysis and dental records. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA, Y chromosome DNA and autosomal DNA analysis.

It was then determined that Rudd had been located and identified based on location and history of Rudd’s reported loss location and date of death, circumstances of loss and historians’ comprehensive research of the Battle of the Bulge, according to Rudd’s obituary.

Because of the dedicated long-term research and field investigations by Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, along with input from private historians in both the U.S. and Belgium, nearly a dozen formerly unaccounted for Soldiers have been identified from remains located. Rudd was identified by the work these teams accomplished, more specifically, benefiting from 30 years of analysis and the work of two Belgian researchers and an American historian, who are focused on locating the missing members of the 99th Infantry Division from the Battle of Bulge.

Rudd’s name is recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Netherlands American Cemetery, an American Battle Monuments Commission site in Margraten, Netherlands, along with others still missing from WWII. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.

Awards, recognition earned

Rudd’s medals included a Bronze Star with the medal “V” device and one bronze oak leaf cluster, a Purple Heart, Good Conduct medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign medal with four Bronze Service Stars, World War II Victory Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, Combat Infantryman Badge, Honorable Service Lapel Button - World War II and the Belgian Fourragere.

After his death, his family was presented the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for his heroism.

Following the funeral, Rudd’s family members took a moment to reflect on what they had learned about their relative and on the service.

“It was a very moving day for us as we watched everybody participate and just knowing that he’s home, and that it took so long but the diligence and persistence was very moving,” Cindy Williford, a great niece of Rudd, said. “Jane and I were at the airport when they brought him in last night and to watch as Austin-Bergstorm Airport came to a standstill with lights and water, it was the most surreal moment as you watched this plane taxi to the gate. I will never forget that. …

“This is something that I never thought would happen and I’m thankful for everyone who was involved in bringing him home. …,” she shared. “It makes you proud to be an American.”",

WASHINGTON - On the National Guard’s 387th birthday, another milestone anniversary represents the impact the Guard has in more than 2,600 communities across the country.

Twenty years ago, on the Guard’s 367th birthday, a group of Oregon National Guard members answered an urgent call from Oregon Emergency Management — risking their lives to perform an over-water rescue on Oregon’s Sandy River.

The pilot in command that dark, snowy evening was then-Lt. Col. Dan Hokanson, who now serves as the 29th chief of the National Guard Bureau. While he’s proud of his part in the mission, his pride stems from the actions of his crew.

“Like many Guard service members, they represent the spirit, patriotism, and selfless service to our communities and nation … and our pledge to be ‘Always Ready, Always There,’” Hokanson said.

Below is an account of the rescue mission extracted from official correspondence documenting the mission.

On Dec. 13, 2003, the Oregon Emergency Management Agency alerted Lt. Col. Dan Hokanson, project officer for Oregon Army National Guard's Military Air Rescue Team, about a rescue mission on the Sandy River. The call was received at 5:30 p.m. and the mission involved rescuing two kayakers who were holding on to a sandbar that was slowly submerging due to rising storm rains.

A ground rescue team could not reach the kayakers, even after shooting a rope across the river, because the kayakers were so cold from 38-degree river water they could not hold onto the rope. A boat rescue was determined to be the last resort (after a helicopter) due to the rising, swift water at the scene and 20- to 30-foot trees floating downstream. The kayakers had been in the water for over three hours and were bordering on hypothermia.

Hokanson alerted Capt. Brian Houston, UH-60 Black Hawk pilot, Flight Medic Staff Sgt. Travis Davidson, and crew chiefs Staff Sgt. Mark Braeme and Sgt. Rob Armstrong en route to the airfield via cell phone. The crew assembled at the airfield, then prepared the aircraft, briefed and departed on the mission under night vision goggles at 6:30 p.m. aboard Black Hawk 669.

The worst forecast weather for the mission was a 1,500-foot broken cloud layer with 3 miles of visibility due to heavy rain. There was no moon illumination and the outside air temperature was 36 degrees when the crew headed to the rescue site about 45 miles away.

Shortly after takeoff, the crew encountered weather much worse than forecast. Cloud ceilings varied from 500 to 900 feet above ground level and visibility varied from one-half to 3 miles due to storm cells in the area. The crew reduced speed on the aircraft to 100 knots to navigate around as many rain cells as possible.

Twenty-five miles out from the incident site the weather deteriorated to 500-foot ceilings and visibility down to one-half mile. The crew reduced speed and altitude and had to deviate from a direct route due to accumulating ground fog and reduced visibility. Five miles from the scene, the aircraft encountered heavy snow and ceilings came down as low as 300 feet, but visibility remained at one-half mile.

The crew was already using anti-ice equipment, but the aircraft began to accumulate snow and ice on its exterior. The crew contacted the ground rescue teams and was advised of an estimated 200- to 300-foot ceiling with heavy snowfall at the scene. At about a mile out, Houston began to lose sight of the ground. Hokanson took the controls and sighted the rescue vehicles' emergency lights through the fog. The emergency vehicle lights silhouetted the high-tension wires just upstream from the kayakers. Hokanson maneuvered the aircraft into the river valley and climbed into the bottom of the cloud ceilings to cross the powerlines. The crew then maneuvered over the water to a position 120 feet above the kayakers, which they determined to be the safest altitude to stabilize the aircraft without the rotor wash affecting the kayakers. Armstrong and Braeme cleared the aircraft and prepared Powell for hoist extraction of the two kayakers.

Powell was lowered by hoist to the first kayaker and, as he reached for him, his foot hit the river current and he was momentarily submerged in the frigid waters. Powell then reached the first kayaker, secured him to his Jungle Penetrator and was then hoisted back to the aircraft.

After securing the first kayaker in the aircraft, Powell prepared to go down again. Armstrong lost feeling in his thumb (which was used to operate the hoist) due to the freezing temperatures and Braeme came over to assist. Powell was then lowered to the river where he once again entered the water momentarily before grabbing the second kayaker. Armstrong hoisted him up immediately as he and the victim began to drift into the river's current, which required Powell to grab the female kayaker and hold on to her up to the aircraft.

At the aircraft, both Braeme and Powell had to help bring the kayaker into the aircraft as the cold was affecting everyone's coordination and ability to hold anything. As the hoist operations were conducted, the pilots maintained the aircraft at a hover with lateral visibility obstructed by ice and snow accumulation on the aircraft doors. The cloud ceiling and fog also continued to come down to just above the helicopter's rotor system and the pilots' visibility was reduced to the point they could not see beyond the shoreline of the river.

Once Powell and the two kayakers were on board, the crew determined the cloud ceiling was 200 feet above the ground and visibility was less than one-quarter mile. Hokanson hovered the aircraft over to the bank of the river and attempted to follow a road, but he began losing sight of the ground. At this time, both victims were close to hypothermic and Powell began throwing up the river water he had ingested. With deteriorating weather, Hokanson elected to land the aircraft in a maintenance yard where the crew still had sight of the ground.

Ground crews moved equipment by hand to clear a spot for the helicopter, with the rotor blades clearing nearby concrete structures by just 2 to 3 feet. Once the helicopter was on the ground, an ambulance met the aircraft and both kayakers and Powell were treated for exposure and hypothermia. The kayakers fully recovered, no personnel were injured during the rescue and the crew of Black Hawk 669 was credited with two saves.

The National Guard serves as the combat reserve of the Army and the Air Force, and being manned, trained and equipped to fight and win the nation’s wars, helps communities across the country in their greatest times of need, Hokanson said.

While Armstrong and Powell have since retired from military service, Houston and Braeme continue their service in the ranks of colonel and chief warrant officer 5, respectively.

LATHAM, New York--A 60-year old helicopter pilot from Rochester, and a 17-year old from Castleton-on-Hudson who wants to be a mechanic, represented the past and future of the National Guard during the annual Guard Birthday observance on Wednesday, Dec. 13 at New York National Guard headquarters in Latham.

Chief Warrant Officer 5 Michael Zanghi, who has served over 42 years in the Army, joined Pvt. Sean McCauley, a Castleton resident, who enlisted in July to serve as a wheeled vehicle mechanic.

Traditionally the youngest service member present joins the oldest in cutting the birthday cake. The oldest service member represents the history and traditions of the National Guard, while the youngest represents the future of the Guard.

The National Guard claims Dec. 13, 1636, the date the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s legislature established formal militia companies in the colony.

In his remarks, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Mark Shumway, the New York Army Guard’s command chief warrant officer who presided over the ceremony emphasized that the National Guard fights the nation’s wars and serves at home during times of emergency.

Currently there are hundreds of New York National Guard Soldiers and Airmen deployed overseas. Meanwhile more than 2000 members of the Army an Air Guard and Naval Militia are currently serving to help the state cope with the ongoing migrant crisis, Shumway said.

Zanghi, the New York Army National Guard Aviation Office safety officer, has served in the Army Guard since 1981 in a variety of aviation positions.

He started out flying the venerable UH-1 “Huey helicopter and most recently flew the CH-47F heavy lift helicopter in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

He is due to retire in February and hopes to continue working in the aviation safety field as a civilian.

Representing the traditions of the National Guard is “humbling”, but he’s also proud to do so, he said.

“The doors that were available to me, the doors that were open for me, the opportunities have been immense,” he said.

“It’s not been a job. It’s always been something that’s been really fun, and that is why I am still here,” he said.

McCauley, a senior at Maple Hill Sr. High School in Schodack, said he enlisted in the Army National Guard because he wanted to be a mechanic and this would be the best way to do so.

He was originally thinking of joining the Marine Corps, but the Army National Guard would seem to be the better option, McCauley said.

When he completes his training, he will serve in detachment of the 224th Security and Support Aviation Regiment which operates the C-12 fixed wing transport at Albany International Airport in Latham.

Representing the future of the National Guard is a “big responsibility and I’m willing to take it,” he said.

Along with the cake-cutting ceremony, the event included a symbolic oath affirmation ceremony for McCauley and six other new Army and Air Guard recruits administered by Zanghi.

Recognized were:

--Private Ethan Bernard, age 17, from Ballston Spa, who enlisted in September to serve as a combat medic with the 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment in Utica.

--Private 1st Class Glenn Bryant, age 17 from Kingston, who enlisted in June of this year as a military police Soldier in the 206th Military Police Company here in Latham.

--Airman Elaine Emery, age 19, from Greenfield City, who enlisted October 21 to serve as an Aerospace Medical Service Technician with the 109th Airlift Wing in Scotia.

--Airman Jamisen Hotujec, age 20, from Glenmont, who enlisted in mid-November to serve as a Heavy Aircraft Integrated Avionics Technician with the 109th Airlift Wing.

--Airman Nasiru Kotey, age 22, from Albany, who enlisted last Thursday, December 7, to serve in the 109th Airlift Wing as a Heavy Aircraft Integrated Avionics Technician.

-Private Joshuah McGahan, age 18, from Kingston, who enlisted in July to serve as a combat medic with the 466th Area Support Medical Company in Queensbury.

The National Guard, which is composed of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, traces its official birthday to December 13, 1636.

That day the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the colony’s legislature, passed a law establishing formal militia companies in the colony.

These companies were made up of all adult males older than 16 and were expected to meet and train in military skills regularly.

In New York, the first citizen-soldiers were members of the Burgher Guard, organized by the Dutch East Indian Company in 1640 in what is now New York City, to help protect New Amsterdam from their English neighbors in Massachusetts and Virginia or from hostile natives.

After New Amsterdam became the English colony of New York in 1665, a militia modeled on the system used in Massachusetts and other English colonies was put in place.

Citizen Soldiers of the militia and National Guard have fought in all of America's wars from King Philips War against Native Americans in the New England Colonies in 1675 to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Today there are 11,000 members of the New York Army National Guard and 5,800 members of the New York Air National Guard.

Some notes from New York National Guard history include:

--New York gave the country the term National Guard for its militia forces when the 2nd Battalion, 11th Regiment of the New York Militia renamed themselves the National Guard to honor the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolutionary War who had commanded a force called the ""Guard de National"" in the early days of the French Revolution.

--The 1st Battalion, 69th Infantry Regiment was portrayed in the 1940 movie ""The Fighting 69th"" starring Jimmy Cagney and Pat O'Brien. The movie was based on the historic unit's service in World War I.

--The New York Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division was given its nickname ""The Rainbow Division"" during World War I by General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur, then a colonel, was charged with organizing a division of National Guard troops from across the country to deploy to France in 1917. He described the division as reaching across the country ""like a rainbow.""

--The band of the New York National Guard's 369th Infantry Regiment, an African-American unit originally formed as the 15th New York, is credited with introducing jazz music to Europe during World War I. The 369th became known as the Harlem Hell Fighters.

--The oldest Air National Guard unit in the nation is part of the New York Air National Guard. The 102nd Rescue Squadron of the 106th Rescue Wing traces its history back to the 1st Aero Company organized in the New York National Guard in 1908 as a balloon unit.

--The Soldiers of the New York National Guard's 105th Infantry Regiment faced the largest Japanese ""Banzai"" attack of the Second World War on 7 July 1944 on the Island of Saipan. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 105th Infantry had 650 men killed and wounded but killed more than 4,300 Japanese Soldiers. Three regimental Soldiers earned the Medal of Honor posthumously in that battle that day.

-The New York Air National Guard's 138th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, based at Syracuse, was one two Air National Guard units assigned to provide aircraft for the defense of the United States on March 1, 1953. Today the unit operates the MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft.

-The New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing flies the largest ski-equipped aircraft in the world, able to land on snow at the South Pole Station.

-The New York National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division headquarters and support units served in Iraq in 2005 and was the first National Guard division headquarters to deploy to a combat zone since the Korean War in 1953.",

FORT STEWART, Ga. – The Savannah-based 1st Battalion, 118th Field Artillery Regiment “cased” their unit colors in Fort Stewart Dec. 12 in a symbolic ceremony before mobilizing overseas.

The 1-118th FAR’s upcoming planned deployment will support operations in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.

“We are incredibly proud of the Soldiers who have volunteered to tackle this challenging mission,” said Lt. Col Russell Dasher, 1-118th FAR battalion commander. “We are honored to serve with them all.”

The unit has prepared and developed leaders for this challenging mission for several years through individual weapon systems qualification and large-scale training exercises domestically and abroad. The learning curve will increase as Soldiers of the unit now work to become proficient with air defense artillery weapon systems.

“Over the coming 12 months, the 1-118th FAR will conduct in-depth training in counter rocket artillery mortar and counter unmanned aircraft systems,” said Sgt. Maj. Christopher Poole, 1-118th FAR battalion command sergeant major.

The Soldiers’ families and employers have supported them throughout the battery of training requirements and preparations.

“We thank our family, friends and employers for the overwhelming support we have received as we go forward to complete our mission,” said Poole.

Members of the 1-118th Field Artillery Regiment have answered the call to service as far as the late 1700s. They have activated in response to World War I, World War II and, in recent decades, multiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan.

FORT WAINWRIGHT, Alaska – Soldiers assigned to the Downed Aircraft Recovery Team within Delta Company, 1-52 General Support Aviation Battalion, recently assisted in the effort to recover a Coast Guard helicopter that crashed in a remote area.

The Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crashed on Read Island in southeastern Alaska during a search and rescue mission Nov. 13. The four crew members aboard were treated at a Seattle hospital and have since been released.

“Following the crash, the Coast Guard made a formal request for recovery assistance,” said Maj. Bryant Knef, operations officer for 1-52 GSAB. “The intent of the request was for the DART to provide a team to help develop a plan for the salvage of CG 6016 and assist with the disassembling and packaging of the aircraft for transport in a safe and efficient manner.”

A three-person Army team conducted a site survey Nov. 24-26 as the first step in the recovery operation. During the site survey, the Army team, in conjunction with the Coast Guard, determined the logistical feasibility and potential risks and hazards and developed a plan for recovering the aircraft.

Potential challenges for the recovery effort included tide level, weather, dense foliage, the aircraft condition, and the distant location of the crash site. The remoteness of the site—an uninhabited island approximately 21 nautical miles north of the port town of Petersburg and 80 miles east of Sitka—necessitated the involvement of numerous organizations. In addition to the Coast Guard and Army, the U.S. Forest Service, National Weather Service, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Petersburg Fire and Rescue, and independent contractors also contributed to the recovery effort.

After surveying the location of the crash, the Army team traveled to Coast Guard Air Station Sitka to analyze a fully mission capable MH-60T Jayhawk to help determine the difference between it and the UH-60L/M Blackhawks the Soldiers primarily work with.

“The site survey determined that the main fuselage of CG 6016 needed to be reoriented upright to load it onto the recovery vessel. It also confirmed the size of the team that was needed to conduct the recovery operation,” Knef said.

The recovery mission took place Dec. 3-9, with the bulk of the party consisting of nine DART personnel, led by 1st Lt. Caleb Kifer, DART officer in charge, and five Coast Guard personnel, led by Lt. Cmdr. Justin Neal, salvage officer.

Daily travel to and from the island consisted of a 1.5-hour boat ride each way via a contracted ferry service. The initial site preparation required the team set up a shelter for tools, equipment, and a dry space for the team to rest in and to clear the remaining brush and logs from the trees felled by the U.S. Forest Service to enable removal of the helicopter.

That dry space was critical for the team, given the prevailing weather conditions in the region.

“It was about 33 F and rained the whole time,” said Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Anderson, DART noncommissioned officer in charge.

After the site was prepared, it was necessary to disconnect the tail of the Jayhawk from the main fuselage. The team then shifted the aircraft upright using ratchet straps, chains, tow straps, and come-alongs.

In one of his daily reports to the 1-52 leadership, Kifer noted, “While rolling the fuselage, it was determined that a second tree had speared through the fuselage and was pinning it to the ground. That tree was cut, allowing the fuselage to be rolled upright.”

A contracted excavator was then brought to the island to lift the main fuselage and tail section onto a recovery vessel. Once the two primary sections were removed, the recovery team collected all remaining debris by hand and loaded it onto the vessel before departing the island mid-morning Dec. 8.

“Partnering with Delta Company, 1-52 GSAB’s Downed Aircraft Recovery Team for the salvage and recovery of our helicopter was a game-changer,” said Neal. “Their specialized skills, professionalism, and expertise turned what seemed like a daunting salvage operation into a well-executed success.”

According to Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Mike Salerno, the helicopter is en route to Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where investigators will further examine the airframe as part of their investigation of the incident.",

WIESBADEN, Germany – After nearly a year working together, nine professionals from across Installation Management Command Europe celebrated their graduation from the region’s first Executive Leadership Development Program, also known as ELDP.

Delivering remarks at the ceremony, U.S. Army Garrison Italy’s Amy Cates, who served as the team leader, described when the group came together almost a year ago, “with wild dreams and imagination of what this ELDP program would bring,” adding, “It did not disappoint.

“I can’t recall a time in my life when I felt so supported in my career by people who were genuinely interested in me, and I know my peers feel the same,” Cates said.

The program comprised a wide variety of exercises and activities, including formal training, leadership development, activities, assignments, seminars, leader shadowing, exposure and inclusion in enterprise-wide events, such as briefings about Installation Status Reports and the Facility Investment Plan, said Tommy R. Mize, director, IMCOM-Europe.

“Ultimately, we wanted to make sure we’re developing a cadre of highly skilled employees that are ready for additional positions, and I’m talking at IMCOM – not just IMCOM-Europe but at IMCOM. My assessment is that we have done just that,” he said.

“You have exceeded all of our expectations,” Mize said to the group, while also recognizing and thanking so many of the graduates’ family members for traveling to attend. “When we decided to do this program in 2023 realizing we were at about a 70-75 percent solution, we came to the realization that the cohort will help us figure it out. And, boy have you all, in spades.”

Speaking for the group, Cates recalled professional highlights that included one-on-one sessions with deputy garrison commanders and IMCOM-Europe leadership; briefing Lt. Gen. Omar Jones, IMCOM commanding general; and being welcomed to participate in two Garrison Leader Working Groups.

Mize recognized and thanked three leaders of his staff who led the creation, launch and oversight of the first cohort: Wes Leisinger, chief of staff; Dr. Allen Cannon, workforce development specialist; and Chris Collins, assistant chief of staff, G-4, who named four things the cohort taught the IMCOM-Europe team.

“Look to the most unexpected places for inspiration … don’t be afraid to lean on each other … celebrate that unexpected learning opportunity … and always smile and look like you’re having fun,” Collins said.

The second cohort of the ELDP is scheduled to begin in early 2024, and the effectiveness and success of the first cohort has led to garrison commanders already preparing projects for the group to work on throughout the whole region, according to Mize.",

Sgt. 1st Class Terysa King takes one for the team, as she answers questions from a specialist with a video camera. King, who is 21st Theater Sustainment Command’s Public Affairs operations noncommissioned officer, is infinitely more comfortable behind the camera than in front of it. But she agreed to the interview because it was a good training opportunity for her junior soldier, and her most recent mission made international headlines.

Describing how she ended up sharing pea soup and conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was a good plug for the profession she loves—U.S. Army public affairs.

King, who hails from Norfolk, Virginia, has bachelor’s degree in journalism and is currently working on a master’s degree in marketing. She began her Army career 15 years ago to pursue education and gain real-world experience.

“I originally joined the Army to pay for college,” said King. Growing up as a self-described “Navy brat” nurtured a passion for adventure, and she believed a career in the Army would also help her see the world. She has not been disappointed.

In addition to being stationed in various U.S. states, including Georgia, North Carolina and Maryland, King was deployed to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Her overseas assignments include Italy, Korea and Germany, and missions have taken her to Kenya, Botswana, Tanzania and multiple countries in Europe including Romania, Slovenia, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands.

She is currently stationed at 21st TSC headquarters in Kaiserslautern, Germany where she works with public affairs professionals from ally and partner countries, coordinating and supporting media events and coverage of joint exercises and missions. In October 2023, she worked with the German Bundeswehr to support an all-day capabilities demonstration highlighting interoperability between German and U.S. Soldiers for Scholz and German media. When it was time for lunch, the Bundeswehr asked King to “take a picture” with Scholz.

“I was not expecting to be asked to sit next to him,” said King. “Because as public affairs I'm working behind the scenes. I'm used to being behind the camera. So, when they told me, ‘You are going to have lunch with the German chancellor and take pictures,’ I was like, ‘Cool’.

“Then I sit down, and he comes around, and sits right next to me. And then I look up and there's all these cameras in front of me.”

King said the Chancellor sensed her surprise and put her at ease right away.

“In order to break the tension, he said, ’Just pretend they're not there’. That made everybody a little bit more comfortable. I can honestly say that it was one of the coolest things I've experienced so far being here and probably in my entire military career, because how often do you get the chance to sit with someone of that importance? To literally break bread with him and eat a traditional German meal with him. I can't think of many other vocations where you get that opportunity,” said King.

King’s softspoken nature is an asset in her work, putting interview subjects at ease and allowing her to document missions with minimum notice—ensuring Soldiers are focused on their mission and not distracted by her presence.

According to King, her mission, as a public affairs specialist, is to tell the Army story by showcasing her fellow Soldiers.

“It helps the world see the bigger picture of what we do,” said King. “And it's also a morale boost. When I take pictures of other Soldiers, and they're interacting with each other and our allies and our partners, I see them light up and it makes all the hard work that we do worth it. It is great seeing the interoperability between the U.S. Army and our partners.”

King said her decision to join the Army was the best decision she has ever made. She would tell anyone who is interested in joining the Army or pursuing a public affairs career to prepare to be challenged.

“You’ll be pushed out of your comfort zone,” said King. “But it’s definitely worth it.”

Making international headlines and being the subject of a Soldier spotlight was definitely out of King’s comfort zone. But consistent with her humble nature, she did what had to be done to tell this Army story.",

WIESBADEN, Germany - They say the best things in life are free – and that was certainly true at the Wiesbaden Entertainment Center on Dec. 12.

Soldiers from units throughout U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden enjoyed a free pizza lunch, cake and bowling as part of the Family and MWR Soldier Appreciation Meal Sponsored by Serving Heroes.

“It’s a really great program,” said Holly Strout, Wiesbaden Family and MWR Commercial Sponsorship and Advertising Manager. “The Gary Sinise Foundation provides complete sponsorship of the Soldier Appreciation Meal.”

“It’s a great morale building event,” Strout said, adding that through the generous support of the Gary Sinise Foundation, they can serve up to 300 Soldiers each meal.

“If the need is ever greater, we can look into that,” she said.

“We learned about it through word of mouth,” said Pfc. Jaxon Gastiaburo, 228th Brigade Support Company, 2nd Multi Domain Task Force. “It’s very expensive out here and when you can get a free meal it’s like ‘Wow.’”

“I think it’s a cool program,” said Spc. Elyssa Edwards, 66th Military Intelligence Brigade, explaining that she became aware of it through email notification from her Command Sergeant Major and other channels.

“I heard about it from my BOSS representative. I came here because I heard there was free food,” said Cpl. Kniel Rivera, 66th MI Bde.

“The bowling is nice too,” said Pvt. 2 Jeniel Leslie, 228th BSC, 2nd MDTF.

Explaining that she would spread the word among her fellow service members, Spc. Celyness DeJesus, 2nd MDTF added, “We’re going to come here together next month. Next time we’ll definitely volunteer to help.”

“Holly brought the idea to us (BOSS) and said ‘I have this awesome idea for an event,’” said Spc. Kevin Alanis, BOSS President.

“I did it at Tyndall Air Force Base and then when I got to Korea,” said Strout, explaining that representatives from the Gary Sinise Foundation did everything possible to make the program a success.

Actor Gary Sinise has been a staunch supporter of Soldiers and their Families through his foundation, the Lt. Dan Band and other projects.

The next Family and MWR Soldier Appreciation Meal Sponsored by Serving Heroes will be featured at the Wiesbaden Entertainment Center on Jan. 9, 2024.

FORT LIBERTY, N.C. – Airborne Soldiers here executed low-velocity airdrop tests of a new remote controlled equipment transport system.

The Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate conducted various testing on the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport, to include a Simulated Airdrop Impact Test to ensure the system could withstand impact forces of hitting the ground after the low-velocity airdrops.

“The S-MET provides small, dismounted units the capability to generate power for organic electronic systems,” said Mr. Jacob Boll, an operations research systems analysist with Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate.

Upon successful completion of the Simulated Airdrop Impact Test, the S-MET underwent rigging procedures to prepare for low-velocity airdrop.

“S-MET reduces physical burdens while operating as a dispersed and decentralized force in austere environments for long periods. Testing targeted the evaluation of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the S-MET for low-velocity airdrop operations,” Boll said.

S-MET supports mobility requirements of Infantry Brigade Combat Teams and supports the Army’s vision to implement Robotic and Autonomous Systems capabilities with urgency to lessen risk to Soldiers during combat.

Multiple successful low-velocity airdrop iterations were completed and after each, an operational exercise consisting of various maneuver drills was conducted.

According to Data Collector Mr. Glen Nino at Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, test data and feedback collected inform Army leaders of the S-MET low-velocity airdrop operations so production decisions can be made.

Before airdrop operations took place, Soldiers were trained on the S-MET, which included overview of the vehicle's instrumentation and controls, as well as instruction on the tactical operation of the S-MET; a vehicle demonstration of its basic instrumentation, controls, and performance of various crew drills.

“The Soldiers were able to witness the S-MET’s capability to negotiate operationally relevant terrain profiles,” said Mr. James Cochran, a military test plans analyst with Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate.

“Any time Soldiers and their leaders get involved in operational testing,” said Shonda Strother, chief editor of Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, ”they have the opportunity to use, work with, and offer up their own suggestions on pieces of equipment that can impact development of systems that future Soldiers will use in combat.”

""Operational testing is the U.S. Army Operational Test Command’s opportunity to contribute to readiness; anything less compromises the Army's ability to provide for the forces that fight and win the Nation's wars,"" said Lt. Col. Derek Johnson, Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate test division chief.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Four former U.S. Army Soldiers recently received the Bronze Star Medal with “V” device, or BSM(V), for their valorous actions in Panama 34 years ago.

Previously awarded the Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM) following Operation Just Cause — a campaign to overthrow Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and restore the democratically elected government of Guillermo Endara in 1989 — the prior service military police officers received upgraded awards at the U.S. Army South holiday ball, Dec. 8, 2023.

“Tonight was just amazing,” exclaimed Kimberly Brodbeck, a former Army captain and one of the four BSM(V) recipients. “Originally, when Mike Russell and Robert Mackey reached out to me, I didn't want to pursue this at all. In my mind, it was done, and it was a long time ago. Then, [Army South] Command Sgt. Maj. [Ronald] Graves called me and told me about the upgrade, and I was in tears. It felt really good [to receive this award] tonight.”

She led her platoon to repulse coordinated enemy attacks over four days leading to numerous personnel, vehicles and equipment being neutralized and preventing the retreat and escape of several senior members of the enemy government.

Brodbeck, then 1st Lt. Kimberly Thompson and platoon leader with the 988th Military Police Company, was honored alongside her former company commander, Capt. Linda Bray and retired Lieutenant Colonels Mikel Russell and Robert Mackey, who led the 108th Military Police Company during the invasion.

Collectively, their actions ranged from attacking Panamanian Defense Forces’ (PDF) positions, defending crucial checkpoints, clearing fortified buildings, dodging sniper fire, being pinned down by enemy fire for days, and fighting enemy forces in close combat.

Russell’s display of heroism began when PDF combatants fired on his Soldiers' positions. He acted quickly and with disregard for personal safety to run across the street, alone and only armed with a pistol, to neutralize the threat. When he tried to return to the defended perimeter, an enemy in a multi-story building began firing on his position.

Russell, the former company commander of the 108th Military Police Company, received the upgraded award for his heroic actions during Operation Just Cause in 1989. Russell was tasked with securing key government buildings of the enemy when his company came under intense sniper and light machine gun fire from surrounding residential buildings filled with both combatants and noncombatants. With little regard for personal safety and only armed with a pistol, Russell neutralized an enemy manning a machine gun, shot out a streetlight to incapacitate enemy visibility and returned to the defended perimeter under gunfire.

Since it was nighttime, Russell’s first sergeant yelled at him to shoot out the streetlight above him. He did so, eliminating the enemy’s ability to see him as he ran back across the street under enemy fire.

“I did it because I was mad that they were shooting at my Soldiers,” said Russell. “There was no time to be scared; it was just about protecting my guys.”

Russell said he wrote a letter to a U.S. senator to reconsider the ARCOM he and his fellow Soldiers received. Award recommendations are processed through the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, and the award upgrades were approved in November 2023.

The BSM, instituted on February 4, 1944, is presented to individuals who, while serving in any capacity within or alongside the United States Army after December 7, 1941, have demonstrated exceptional heroism or meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against an armed enemy or an opposing armed force.

The ""V"" device is affixed to decorations as a symbol of valor, representing acts of heroism beyond the ordinary during direct combat with an enemy of the United States. Such actions involve exposure to enemy hostilities and personal risk, showcasing extraordinary courage and dedication.

The BSM(V)s were not the only awards presented that night.

After all awards were distributed, something was missing, according to several of the BSM recipients. While grateful to be recognized, Russell shared that there are other fellow service members who also deserve to be honored.

“There are three Soldiers out there that we need to find so we can get their awards upgraded because they deserve BSMs for their actions,” he said. “My hope is that the Army publicizes this, these three Soldiers read this, and we find them to upgrade their awards. For me, that would be the greatest reward.”",

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Camp Zama’s Army team defeated the Navy team from Naval Air Facility Atsugi 28-13 in their annual flag football game Saturday at Zama Middle High School’s Trojan Field here.

Their victory came on the same day — Eastern Standard Time — that Army defeated Navy for the second straight year in the longstanding college rivalry match-up, held this year in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

The Camp Zama players formed a circle on the field to receive the winner’s trophy from Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan, who congratulated both teams on the good, friendly competition.

Lenworth Lennon, co-captain of the Army team, said the game was fun and that their neighboring Navy rivals made for some formidable opposition.

“It was a hard-fought battle,” said Lennon, assigned to the 311th Military Intelligence Battalion. “Those guys played a tough game.”

The Army team came together just as the installation’s intramural flag football tournament was wrapping up. Assembled from players from many different units, the team did not have the chance to practice as a group before Saturday’s game. Lennon thought this factor might have made cohesion a challenge, but the team was able to come together quickly — a feat he and the other players compared to the fast camaraderie Soldiers forge in basic training.

Christopher Dilidili, also assigned to 311th, attributed the Army win to the fact that they started strong in the first half and kept that momentum going, and because each player was well-suited for his or her position.

“We definitely had good preparation today before the game,” Dilidili said. “We did a god job with talent management.”

Like his teammates, Dilidili said the Navy players’ athleticism made for a challenging game. Beyond the competition it provides, the annual match-up also allows the communities of both services the chance to come together.

“It’s awesome to have a friendly match [like this] every year because it helps the Army engage with the Navy and remind both of us that we have a sister branch close by,” Dilidili said. “And the game also brings family, friends and the community together.”",

Kaiserslautern, Germany - The 6966th Transportation Truck Terminal held an award and farewell ceremony on Dec. 11, 2023, at the Clock Tower Cafe, Kleber Kaserne. During the ceremony, 13 local national employees were presented with Length of Service certificates representing over 420 years of dedicated and professional service to the U.S. Army. Two drivers were also recognized for accident-free driving, one being recognized for 500,000 miles and one for 750,000 miles.

Operational since 1953, the 6966th TTT, part of the Theater Logistics Support Center - Europe and Africa, employs 265 personnel and has been working seamlessly with the U.S. Army to transport and deliver any of the Army’s needs. The unit is responsible for transporting mail, general cargo, HAZMAT, heavy equipment, and handle tow missions. Their missions take them throughout most of Europe and to locations as far as Africa.

According to Helmut Kraemer, 6966th TTT superintendent, it’s important for their workforce to be recognized for their dedicated service to the U.S. Army. “We’re proud to have these guys in my unit,” said Kramer.

As head of the overall operations, Kraemer takes pride in his employees’ success and outstanding safety record. Their civilian support group has the lowest accident rate in the Army, with an accident rate of 0.29 percent per 1 million miles driven.

“It’s very important to recognize their efforts on every mission, whether it is a local run or long distances that take them cross-border, especially during high OPTEMPO, and we have to publicly appreciate them for their effort to the unit and the mission.” said Kraemer.

Of 265 employees, approximately 165 are professional and cross-trained drivers who have a combined average of 3.7 million miles during the past three years. Their mission is to support military exercises, deployment operations, and humanitarian aid support with a tailored vehicle fleet ranging from small cargo vans and 40-ton trucks to heavy equipment transporters.

“The everyday performance of a vehicle operator is not an easy task considering the traffic density in Europe,” said Eckhart Rank, motor transportation supervisor. “Recognizing the work of a vehicle operator is essential for their motivation and the unit's reputation.”

Recognizing the professionalism and skills of the 6966th's members is important for the unit's morale and the younger employees’ plans for the future, knowing that they will also receive recognition for jobs well done.

""Every human being needs some recognition, right,” said Stefan Keller, motor vehicle operator. “I’m glad we started to celebrate the anniversaries again. It allows us to get some recognition from our supervisors and previously it had been lost in the past a bit, so I'm very glad it’s started again.”

As general manager of Theater Logistics Support Center - Europe and Africa, Helmut Haufe is honored to recognize his employees for their hard work and dedication. “It makes me extremely proud to see my employees being recognized for excellence over a span of five up to 45 years of service,” said Haufe. “It says a lot about the organization and the U.S. Army as an employer. It obviously is an indication that it works for both sides, otherwise, it would not have lasted as long as it has.”",

VALENCIA, Spain – Portuguese Army Maj. Gen. Joao Boga Ribeiro received the U.S. Legion of Merit medal from U.S. Army Col. Romeo Macalintal during a ceremony at NATO Rapid Deployable Corps – Spain headquarters here Nov. 17.

Boga Ribeiro received the award from the United States for his service as the deputy commanding general of NRDC-Spain from February 2021 to August 2023.

The award was signed by the U.S. secretary of defense on behalf of the U.S. president and awarded by Macalintal as the United States’ senior national representative at the corps headquarters, one of nine multinational Army corps in the NATO force structure.

“General Boga Ribeiro's superb leadership and visionary military acumen led to the certification of NRDC-Spain as the Standby Warfighting Corps headquarters for NATO in 2022,” said Macalintal. “He ensured the critical interoperability of the NATO allies and had a profoundly positive influence in achieving significant collective objectives.”

“His sage advice to the commander and mentorship of the staff greatly contributed to the training and readiness of NRDC­-Spain to counter threats to regional security, leading to a successful Combat Readiness Evaluation in December 2021,” said Macalintal. “General Boga Ribeiro also led the observations and lessons learned project to identify key tactical, operational, and strategic developments observed during the current war of aggression on NATO’s eastern flank.”

NRDC-Spain is the international part of the Spanish High Readiness Land Military Staff and represents Spain’s primary commitment to the NATO Force Structure.

Currently about 400 military personnel from Czechia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain work at the NRDC-Spain headquarters.

Col. Jerzy Zubr, the former U.S. senior national representative at NRDC-Spain, recommended Boga Ribeiro for the award and was available to attend the ceremony.

After the ceremony, Zubr said “maintaining close relationships with our NATO allies is a cornerstone of our national security strategy and helps deter potential adversaries and assure allies of the United States' commitment to NATO's collective defense.”

PRESIDIO OF MONTEREY, Calif. (Dec. 12, 2023) — The Presidio of Monterey bid farewell to Command Sgt. Maj. Joseph W. Traylor during a retirement ceremony at the Weckerling Center today. In front of Traylor’s family, friends and a garrison workforce that filled the Weckerling Center ballroom, the ceremony marked the culmination of a distinguished 31-year career.

Presiding over the ceremony was U.S. Army, Presidio of Monterey Garrison Commander, Col. Sam Kline. Kline offered his admiration and recounted how Traylor’s three decades of service spanned five states, five countries and included 69 awards and decorations.

“A lifetime of service cannot be simply described by numbers, but better illustrated by the impact on those brothers and sisters with whom he has served. Reflecting on your career, we acknowledge the sacrifices made and the challenges faced,” Kline said.

During the ceremony, Kline awarded Traylor the Legion of Merit, his Certificate of Retirement and other prestigious honors and tokens of appreciation celebrating his dedicated service.

In addition, Kline honored Traylor’s mother, Mrs. Daylinda Pace, with a Certificate of Appreciation and thanked her for her enduring support. All told, Pace’s three sons have served a combined 68 years of military service to include eight combat deployments and seven operational deployments.

“Not only have you played an important role in Joe’s journey, but in supporting the defense of our nation with all three of your Army sons through the last three decades of peace and war. Your strength and sacrifices have undoubtedly shaped the character of the individual we honor today.”

A native of East Alton and Wood River, Illinois, Traylor began his Army career in 1992, joining the Illinois Army National Guard as a Motor Transport Operator before transitioning to the regular Army as a Ground Surveillance Systems Operator in 1994. In 2005, Traylor found his calling in the Army as an Intelligence Analyst, the career field where he spent most of his career. His path through the ranks included a variety of roles from overseeing intelligence operations to the mentoring of Iraqi Army personnel. His assignments took him all over the world to include Korea, Italy, Germany, Afghanistan and Iraq.

In his final speech as an active-duty soldier, Traylor offered his deep gratitude to all those who have supported him.

“As I stand here on the cusp of retirement, I am filled with a myriad of emotions — joy, a sense of pride and accomplishment, nostalgia and a touch of apprehension for the unknowns that lie ahead,” said Traylor, before offering the audience some parting advice.

“The days can be long, but the years are unbelievably short. Every one of us can make a positive and lasting impact in other people’s lives if we care. Help others around you when you can, smile often and be thankful.”

The ceremony concluded with a reading by Chaplain (Capt.) Joseph McCall of the traditional poem “The Watch,” followed by the playing of “The Army Song” and “Old Soldiers Never Die.” A full Weckerling Center ballroom stood in celebration of Traylor and his honorable career.

Traylor will retire to Tampa Bay, Florida where he intends to continue working in the private industry and serving as a volunteer helping veterans in need.",

CHICAGO – National Hockey League’s Chicago Blackhawks honored U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Maribel Meraz, assigned to the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, during a home game versus the St. Louis Blues at the United Center, December 9, 2023.

Meraz received the honor before the National Anthem and again during the second period of the game, recognizing her 16 years of service in the U.S. Army Reserve.

Meraz, a Chicago native, who grew up in in the communities of Hermosa and Humboldt Park, was given a standing ovation from thousands of spectators during her recognition at the stadium.

“It was my first Blackhawk game! To hear Blackhawk fans cheer and clap was a tremendous experience!” exclaimed Meraz.

She enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve at the age of 17 in January 2008. She then completed Advanced Individual Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, becoming qualified as a Human Resources Specialist.

In 2011, Meraz served on a 10-month deployment with the 847th Postal Detachment, to Forward Operating Base Kalsu, Iraq, 20 miles south of Baghdad in support of Operation New Dawn. Meraz’ responsibilities included postal operations and managing civilian contractors working with them.

She deployed again in 2013 to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Meraz was assigned to the Joint Military Mail Terminal, where she inspected suspicious packages and searched for contraband. Shortly after, she was reassigned to Qatar, to assist with postal activities at Al-Udeid Air Base and As Sayliyah Army Base.

Following the recognition, Meraz further reflected on her service to the Nation.

“Being a Soldier in the Army Reserve has allowed me to travel to different states and countries. I have had the opportunity to meet all kinds of people. When I was deployed to Iraq, the Ugandan Army was also there. When I would go into the chow hall, they would teach me phrases in Swahili,” said Meraz. “Serving in the Army Reserve has allowed me to grow as a person and develop many skills, most of all patience.”

Meraz’ awards include two Army Commendation Medals, and the Iraq Campaign Medal with campaign star, among other awards throughout her years of service.

The Chicago Blackhawks additionally recognized U.S. Army retired Sgt. Maj. Laurence “Larry” Kagan from Park Ridge, Illinois.

Kagan, a Veteran of Operation Desert Storm, and Operation Iraqi Freedom served from 1981-2010.

“Tonight, I was the lucky one who represented all the men and women Veterans who have served our great country. They are the real heroes,” said Kagan.",

ARLINGTON, Va. – Anticipation ran high as Soldiers assigned to the National Guard’s Professional Education Center eagerly awaited the results of the National Guard Bureau’s 2023 Innovation Competition, held at the Army National Guard Readiness Center on Dec. 6, 2023.

“Being able to present our ideas in front of National Guard leaders was the highlight of this experience,” said Sgt. 1st Class Victor Marquez, an instructor and leader at PEC's Sustainment, Installations and Environmental Battalion. “My team and I demonstrated exceptional effort to reach this stage.”

Out of 32 total submissions from across the nation, the team got third place. They see this as an opportunity to refine their product and pitch for a second competition scheduled later this year, said Maj. Jeremy Bouillion, an instructor assigned to the Strategy and Leader Development Institute at PEC.

The journey to the finals involved collaborative efforts from several organizations at PEC. The process commenced with the first round open to all 54 states and territories. Participants submitted an information paper and video showcasing how their proposed innovation could address a specific organizational challenge.

After the first round of submissions, a panel narrowed down the entries to 16 teams, advancing them to the semi-final round. In the semi-finals, teams were required to enhance their information paper and video.

Ultimately, four teams were chosen to progress to the final round, where they had to present their submission with a five-minute pitch. Following the pitch, teams had to face a panel of three judges led by Gen. Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau.

“Reaching the finals presented a significant challenge,” said Bouillion. “Our major task was to identify and engage the right stakeholders who could provide the expertise needed to ensure a robust product presentation.”

PEC, located at Camp Robinson, in North Little Rock, Arkansas, serves as the premier learning institute for the National Guard. Its mission is to enhance the readiness of the National Guard’s full-time staff, with a crucial focus on providing innovative teaching methods. The future of education at PEC lies in virtual reality, according to the team.

“Virtual reality offers students immersive learning experiences, enhancing comprehension and retention of complex concepts,” explained Marquez. “It provides interactive simulations for practical training that is relevant to the operational environment.”

Bouillion led as the project manager and carefully selected subject matter experts for the competition. Colin Trachte, a software developer, took the lead in developing the VR software showcased to the judges, while Ricky Veal, the chief of training development, demonstrated the adaptability of VR across various classes on the PEC campus.

Marquez and Sgt. 1st Class Bryant Laning, an ordnance training developer, spearheaded the vision of the future integration of this technology into one of their existing courses and illustrated its potential through a storyboard for the video submission. With support from the PEC public affairs and visual information offices, the team's ideas came to life in a three-minute video.

The Shark Tank-style pitch left the team nervous, but their confidence in their groundbreaking idea drove them to dedicate countless days to rehearsing for this moment. After the team's pitch, the final decision was in the hands of the judges. The PEC team secured a commendable third place in the finals.

“We consider this a team achievement,” said Bouillion. “We successfully ignited an innovative culture within our organization. Maintaining this momentum is crucial as we strive to accomplish our organizational goals for the future.”",

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Central Arkansas families are smiling a little brighter this holiday season after more than 350 Arkansas National Guardsmen returned Dec. 9 from a nine-month deployment to Southwest Asia.

The Guardsmen, assigned to 2-153 Infantry Battalion, 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, were deployed to support Operation Spartan Shield, an operation that builds partner capacity in the region to promote regional self-reliance and increase security among partner nations.

“We’re excited to have these Guardsmen back home in time for the holidays,” said Maj. Gen. Jonathan Stubbs, Arkansas adjutant general. “They’ve been away from their families and employers doing our nation’s vital business of helping keep the region secure and safe. I’m immensely proud of their service and sacrifice for our state and nation, and I know Arkansans are, too.”

The Guardsmen departed Arkansas Feb. 5 for their mobilization station at Fort Bliss, Texas. From there, they deployed to Southwest Asia, where they served as a security force by providing convoy and base security of U.S. elements and assets friendly to the United States. Including their train-up period, the Guardsmen were away from their families for nearly one year.

On their return trip home, the Guardsmen arrived at their demobilization station at Fort Bliss Nov. 28. They departed El Paso, Texas, and landed in Little Rock, to be reunited with their loved ones.

Families filled half an aircraft hangar at Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport as they waited for their service members to return home. After a short wait, the hangar doors opened and in marched their loved ones as families cheered. As soon as the Soldiers were dismissed from the formation, families and Guardsmen sought out their loved ones.

Joyann Bearden of Searcy said she kept in touch with her husband, Capt. Samuel Bearden, via “phone, texting, video chatting and calling as often as possible.”

To help keep their three children engaged she built a deployment wall in their home.

“We had a deployment wall where we showed a map for the kids to keep up with where their daddy was. We put pictures up and any pictures Sam could send me,” she said.

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – U.S. Army Garrison Japan leaders announced plans for a new workforce action team and answered questions during a town hall at Kizuna Hall here Dec. 6.

The garrison’s new Quality of Life Action Team will include representatives chosen from each directorate who will meet to help drive continuous workplace improvement for the garrison team.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of USAG Japan, said the initiative will benefit the entire organization.

“There are good ideas and good solutions all across the team,” he said of the garrison. “And I want to know and understand and make sure we are using the best ideas from everyone’s different perspectives.”

Hunter, who was joined by Command Sgt. Maj. David A. Rio, the garrison senior enlisted leader, and Jenifer L. Peterson, the deputy garrison commander, said garrison employees work diligently year-round to support the community.

“Thank you for doing that for our community,” he said, “and thank you for what you will do for our own team inside the garrison to help us get stronger and get better in everything that we do.”

Ernestine Robinson, Equal Employment Opportunity manager and adviser for the garrison’s Climate Action Team, briefed recent garrison accomplishments in the past two years, including the creation of leadership training videos for supervisors and employees, several brown bag lunches with the commander, and a reasonable accommodation workshop for supervisors and managers.

A commander’s box was also placed on the second floor of Building 102 to allow anyone to leave comments for leadership.

Hunter said he checks the box just about every time he walks by it.

At least five comments have been left in the box since it was installed in the summer and based on the issue that is brought up, the colonel will directly address the comment.

“I appreciate everyone’s use of that,” he said, “and we would love to receive additional feedback.”

Hunter answered another question on if or when another garrison organizational day will take place. After taking a quick poll from the audience, who were mostly agreeable to it, he asked his staff to look at holding one.

“It’s an opportunity for us to gather as a team,” he said. “We’re all doing so many different things, so here we can get together and celebrate the organization in a unique and slightly different way.”

Hunter also highlighted U.S. Army Installation Management Command’s Service Culture Campaign, saying that dignity and respect are part of the foundation of the garrison’s culture.

“Our workforce is one that is built off of diversity coming from many different perspectives and understanding and experience,” he said, “but is drawn together through the inclusion of our entire team.”

Among the tenets in the culture campaign, Hunter touched on developing every employee to be a leader as a way to strengthen the entire workforce.

“Leader development and talent management is not based off of an individual person as a leader for a position as a leader,” he said. “And the reason I say that is because leaders come from all levels, and you all have a role at some point in time in which [you] may be in a position to lead an activity or an organization.”

He encouraged employees to complete an individual development plan and participate in civilian education programs, developmental assignments, career program training that focuses on technical competencies, and command training that may provide clarity on organizational activities.

“My challenge to all of our supervisors” he said, “is to think about some of those opportunities and then ask yourself within your directorate or your section how you can take advantage of those and how you can develop the talent of each of your individual employees.”

In closing, Hunter expressed gratitude for the valuable input he has already received from the workforce on how to improve the organization.

“What I’m committed to and excited about is, as a team, finding ways in which we think we want to change and develop,” he said. “But that’s something that we’re going to do as a team … [to] constantly strengthen and build ourselves.”

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – More than 160 local community leaders and Camp Zama personnel came together for U.S. Army Garrison Japan’s holiday reception here Friday evening.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of USAG Japan, and the rest of the command team greeted guests as they arrived inside the Camp Zama Community Club ballroom for the annual event.

“There is nothing better than to be able to meet together face-to-face and to share in one another’s friendships,” he later told the crowd. “And truly, that is one of my deepest hopes is that we can all build friendships and have a wonderful partnership.”

Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members as well as local government and academic officials joined Soldiers, Army civilians and family members for the festive occasion.

The reception, which had a dinner, group photos with Santa Claus and music by the U.S. Army Japan band, highlighted the many connections between the installation and its surrounding community.

Throughout the evening, a photo slideshow and several poster boards in the ballroom displayed various community engagement activities in which USAG Japan personnel participated with their Japanese counterparts.

Those events included office calls, cleanups, local festivals, professional military engagements and open-post events, such as the Bon Odori and Independence Day celebrations that drew tens of thousands of people to Camp Zama.

“These partnerships and these friendships mean so very much and are an important representation of our deep Japan-America alliance, which is even more important now than ever,” Hunter said.

The colonel also encouraged the attendees to reflect on the year and to continue to build on past efforts to make the alliance even stronger.

“I look forward to this new year and all the friendships and the good memories that we will make,” he said, “and I wish you all a Happy New Year in 2024.”

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Nearly 50 U.S. and Japanese high school students participated together in an event here meant to foster communication and promote the exchange of ideas among the two communities.

Known as the Student Educational Exchange and Dialogue, or SEED, the event brought together students from Zama Middle High School those from the neighboring cities of Zama and Sagamihara Dec. 2 and 3 at the ZMHS campus.

Sonya Gates, community superintendent for the DoDEA Pacific East District, said SEED is a cultural exchange meant to enhance the development of the U.S. and Japanese students in a variety of ways.

“I hope [this event allows] the students to have a lot of fun, make some friends they can cherish, and gain a better sense of understanding and appreciation for each other’s cultures and beliefs,” Gates said.

The host students at ZMHS provided their Japanese guests with a tour of their campus. Elsewhere during the two-day event, the students formed teams for games and activities such as collaborating to create a mascot character.

Logan Jackson, a junior at ZMHS and a first-time participant in SEED, said the team-building activities with their Japanese guests taught him a lot about the differences and similarities between their two cultures and led to him forming friendships with them. He recommended students who have never participated to join the event next year.

“It was a great way to interact with the Japanese students and get involved a little bit more in their culture,” Jackson said. “I hope we can have [this] event at a Japanese school sometime.”

Asaki Noda, a second-year high school student from Sagamihara City, had so much fun at the event last year that she jumped at the chance to participate again. This year she said she learned the importance of being proactive with her ideas and input when doing a group project.

“By interacting with others my age, I got to know more about the American students’ way of thinking and learn things I didn’t know before,” Noda said. “I felt like I was able to expand my worldview through my participation in this program.”

Feedback like that from Noda and other students reinforced that the SEED event met its intent, said Natasha Anderson, assistant principal at ZMHS. Most of the students expressed their hope to learn more about Japanese culture, and that their guests would likewise gain a better understanding of the academic and social life of American teens.

“[The students] want to basically show that they can work all together regardless of their nationality, which speaks volumes,” Anderson said. “This is an opportunity for students of different cultures to interact socially and understand [those] differences and similarities while building communication and team-building skills.”",

VICENZA, Italy – Command Sgt. Maj. Jonathan Dyon looked back on his time with U.S. Army Garrison Italy on Dec. 7, following a ceremony where he relinquished responsibility.

Dozens of community members gathered at the event, held in the gym at Caserma Ederle, to bid Dyon farewell. Dyon was among the leaders who helped the community through COVID-19. During an interview with The Garrison Outlook Dyon pondered on how far things have come since the pandemic.

“Coming out of Covid, it was just really great to see all the things that (the pandemic) forced us to do in the virtual space to enhance our services that we provide for this community,” Dyon said.

Garrison CSM Jonathan Dyon gave remarks at his Relinquishment of Responsibility ceremony on Thursday, December 7, 2023.

He’s a Ranger and Mountain Warfare School graduate, who’s undergone many military educational courses. Dyon will be moving forward to Task Force Sinai in Egypt as the USAG-Italy community awaits the arrival of his successor.

During his remarks, Col. Scott Horrigan, commander of USAG Italy, said that Dyon was invaluable to him over the last several months.

“He has offered forthright advice and valuable insights, helping to provide me with a better understanding of the environment and the challenges we face,” Horrigan said.

PANZER-KASERNE, Germany - The 21st Theater Sustainment Command conducted the Unit Safety Officer Course at Panzer Kaserne for the first time this past November 14-16, 2023, allowing 16 Team 21 USOs to meet all regulatory requirements without having to spend time and expense traveling to receive instruction. In the past, the command has had to send students to the 7th Army Training Command in Vilseck to ensure compliance.

In accordance with AR 385-10, the Unit Safety Officer is a spokesperson who cooperates with leaders and supervisors at all levels within the organization to assist the commander in executing the Army Safety and Occupational Health Program.

“Safety is our top priority, and its essential that we reinforce its significance throughout the formation process,” said Stefanie Diaz, command tactical safety manager, 21st TSC. ""The USOC [Unit Safety Officer Course] training plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. As a part of our commitment to safety, we must acknowledge that each one of us, from the highest levels of leadership down to the newest team members, has a role to play.”

The primary objective of the Unit Safety Officer and the Army Safety Program is to effectively accomplish the mission while avoiding losses that negatively impact readiness. USOs advise the commander and participate in the planning, preparation, execution, and after-action reviews of missions. This ensures that hazards are identified, assessed, and controls are placed and addressed by the commander.

“From a Leader’s perspective, it’s imperative that we lead by example,” said Col. Ernest Lane, chief of staff, 21st TSC. “By completing this training and actively promoting its value, we demonstrate our unwavering dedication to safety and the importance of each one of us as a member of Team 21.”

Lane added that safety is not only a leader’s responsibility, but a shared responsibility for all members.

In fiscal year 2023, the 21st TSC Safety Office invested in certifying a member of its team to be able to instruct the USO course locally or travel to remote locations to complete required training for all 21st TSC and subordinate command members to meet regulatory requirements.

With the addition of a safety officer certified to conduct the USOC training, the 21st TSC and all subordinate units can receive the training without the constraints of having to send students to Vilseck in order to meet mission requirements.",

SETUBAL, Portugal - The 21st Theater Sustainment Command supported the first-ever U.S. Army operation at the Port of Setubal, Portugal on December 7, 2023. The port operation was a collaboration between the 21st TSC, 598th Transportation Brigade (Surface Deployment and Distribution Command), U.S. Mission to Portugal, and the Portuguese military and port authority.

“The strategic importance behind getting this port in Portugal is, it is the furthest west that we’ve ever operated coming in or out of Europe,” said Col. Robert Kellam, commander, 598th Transportation Brigade. “We were able to effectively connect the furthest point in eastern Estonia to the furthest west port in Portugal and connect all the transportation nodes from here to there. So strategically, this is a momentous occasion for the 21st TSC and I think for EUCOM [United States European Command] as well.”

The mission was a year-long project and a “proof of concept” that enhances the capabilities of the 21st TSC, United States Army Europe and Africa, and Army Sustainment as a whole, across the European Theater.

“We have a long-standing relationship in many areas, the military-to-military relationship being one of the most important,” said Doug Koneff, deputy chief of mission, U.S. Mission to Portugal. “We want to continue working together, as we have been for a long time, to improve our interoperability and improve our capabilities, and this exercise that’s going on right now is such a great example of that.”

The United States and Portugal have a long-standing partnership rooted in shared history. Both countries were a part of the 12 founding signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and have continued to build upon that partnership.

“We have a very strong defense cooperation relationship that spans decades and decades, so exercises like this go very far to really prove what we already knew,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Jennifer Whetstone, Defense Attaché, U.S. Mission to Portugal. “We already know that we have a strong relationship, but we are continually striving to improve our interoperability and strengthen the alliance as a whole.”

The mission validated the port through the redeployment of equipment belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team “Bastogne”, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). Approximately 500 pieces of equipment were craned onto the vessel Ocean Grand to be shipped back to their home station of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

“We initially moved all of our equipment into Poland with the help of the 21st TSC and then eventually on to Estonia, and now we’re standing in Portugal, having moved our equipment from Estonia to Portugal,” said Maj. Christopher Cummings, executive officer, 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). “So, it's a lot of long, difficult, and complex movements and is a fairly historic opportunity for us to test out a new port, similar to what our brigade has done on its first return to Europe since World War II.”

With the success of the initial mission, the intent is to continue to build and strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and Portugal.

“Honestly, it's like we’ve done this many, many times,” said Kellam. “The coordination and relationships that we’ve established here, I think is going to be lasting and it’s been really amazing and very impressive.”

SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Soldiers from 2nd Cavalry Regiment, with support from other U.S. units and the host nation’s military, achieved rapid deployment to the training area and conducted live-fire scenarios with Stryker armored vehicles Dec. 1-10, 2023, at Krivolak Training Area, North Macedonia.

The Army of the Republic of North Macedonia hosted Brave Partner, while U.S. Army Europe and Africa led the “short notice action planning” exercise to reinforce military readiness and interoperability in a realistic training environment and to ensure U.S. forces are ready to respond quickly to support stability in the Balkans.

“The most important thing is the demonstration of the relationship between the United States and North Macedonia,” said Angela Aggeler, U.S. Ambassador to North Macedonia. “Exercises like this one, bringing in beautiful equipment like this — state of the art — really demonstrates to both of our countries, and frankly to the world and our NATO allies, how strong this relationship is, and we are there to support each other.”

The ambassador visited KTA, meeting with the Minister of Defense of the Republic of North Macedonia, Slavjanka Petrovska, and general officers from both nations’ armies to observe Brave Partner live-fire training on Dec. 7.

However, before live-fire training could take place, 2nd Squadron had to successfully complete expeditionary deployment training. Maj. Luke King, the 2nd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment operations officer, explained how important it was to exercise the processes of getting the soldiers and equipment to the mission, and then to set the conditions for day and night squad live-fire.

“Exercising those systems and validating those processes to make sure that we can deliver combat-ready troops to the training area, or to whatever mission we have, that was the first part,” said King. “They’ve gone through squad blank iterations and then squad live-fire iterations both day and night. And the goodness there is that it gives Soldiers confidence in their weapons systems.”

He explained that the exercise gave company and squad leaders the ability to synchronize fire and maneuver with all their available weapons systems. He then explained the Stryker’s advantages, to include weapons systems that can be mounted to the vehicle.

The Stryker has several configurations, including an infantry carrier vehicle with a mounted remotely controlled weapons station capable of mounting a .50 caliber machine gun or a MK19 grenade launcher. They can fire 120 mm mortars from the back of the vehicle instead of setting up mortars from the ground, which King explained is a unique and awesome capability. Soldiers can fire those weapons and search and traverse from inside the vehicle with a screen that provides imagery.

“Then, the Dragoon has the 30 mm cannon, which we all love, and then a 7.62 coax as well, so you’re not just limited to that one weapons system,” said King. “Also, all fired from inside the vehicle, protecting the gunner.”

In addition to weapons used with the Strykers, each squad had a variety of weapons they fired while dismounted from their vehicles, including the M240 machine gun and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. They used their designated marksman to provide precision fire from a distance with the M110 A1 rifle, and they provided indirect fire with the M320 grenade launchers.

King said that 2CR gained in readiness and lethality due to Brave Partner. They’d conducted expeditionary deployments two previous times within the last several months, so they were confident and quick moving into North Macedonia.

""I can’t emphasize enough how awesome of a training area Krivolak is,” said King. “It was just powerful to feel the full might of every headquarters at echelons above us all the way up to USAREUR-AF align the stars for us to get here so quickly. Whatever we asked for, we got. And we got it in a very rapid fashion, and it’s exactly what we wanted. So, it built a lot of our confidence.”

Sgt. Joshua Briggs, a 2CR infantryman and squad leader, adamantly agreed with King’s praise of KTA and the diverse terrain.

“The terrain out here is very difficult to traverse,” said Briggs. “It’s hilly and rocky. It allows for more intense and realistic training, like where these soldiers might operate in the future.”

Briggs said wet and muddy conditions give Soldiers a chance to train while it’s more difficult to keep steady footing, or to avoid the weapons’ exposure to the elements. The training value is higher because they can still effectively prepare and solve objectives in such conditions, simulating actual combat.

Another 2CR soldier, Pfc. Alexander Dudzenski, said Brave Partner was his first live-fire exercise. He enjoyed training despite the harsh environment and weather, learning something new with every range iteration and seeing the host nation soldiers build a working relationship with U.S. Soldiers.

“I never thought in my life that I’d be able to come and see these countries,” said Dudzenski. “I think it’s cooler to do it somewhere I’ve never been before, and seeing people from different militaries watching us, I find fascinating.”

Briggs agreed, saying it’s always a privilege to work with NATO partners, especially when it’s the first time for him in a country, where his squad can share new ideas to refine and improve their craft.

“Host nation soldiers have been extremely polite and helpful,” Briggs said. “They’ll ask us questions. It allows us to explain our profession as well as our craft and take pride in our work and see how other people see it.”

King agreed that 2CR learned much from working with the host nation.

“The Army of the Republic of North Macedonia has been very accommodating,” said King. “Understanding how they conduct training and telling them how we conduct our own training in preparation for their army to receive their Strykers has been very useful because we also learn from them. Some of the questions they ask force us to be a bit more introspective. We’re not only helping them, but we’re helping ourselves too.”",

GRAFENWOEHR, Germany – U.S. soldiers and NATO partners participated in the European Best Medic Competition (EBMC) here Dec. 4 to 8, 2023.

The European Best Medic Competition tests competencies, skills, and readiness of European theater medics so they can respond more effectively and efficiently, and the highest winners of U.S. forces are selected to represent the European region at the Army Best Medic Competition in Fort Liberty, North Carolina.

EBMC featured multiple exercises such as: Tactical Combat Casualty Care, Polish Marksmanship Badge, night land navigation, 18-mile Norwegian Ruck March and stress shoot. Each exercise simulated a combat environment, both physically and mentally preparing competitors to react and perform in stressful surroundings.

EBMC exercises consisted of not only medical tasks but also basic soldier capabilities, like returning fire, securing casualties and providing tactical field care. A mystery event is practiced annually to keep competitors on their toes. This year the mystery event was a K9 casualty dog event, where competitors had to provide tactical field care to a TacMed Simulation Canine Medical Trainer within a time limit.

“The candidates did an 18-mile ruck march that led into a stress shoot, wearing them down and seeing if they were still able to complete their range qualification,” said U.S. Army Sgt. Jacob Rodriguez, assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade. “They’re cold, they're tired, and they're hungry then immediately come over here and then do a range qualification. It's just more of a mental game at that point, keeping them pushing forward.”

Competitors worked individually and as teams to test their capabilities and readiness to complete tasks.

EBMC allowed the competitors to learn and train on different skill sets that will significantly improve them on individual and team-based tasks, crucial qualities for military medics working in dynamic and high-pressure situations.

“The challenge does not stop here, today or even with the Army Best Medic Competition. As you return to your home station and back to your soldiers and train them to sustain lethality during Large Scale Combat Operation,” said Sgt. Maj. Christinean Johnson with the Army Medical Center of Excellence. “Think about what you endured, the challenges you faced and the mental toughness that it took to execute your tasks in that environment. Build the training and sustainment that produces the best medic for the team.”

U.S. soldiers were participating in the competition alongside NATO partners, promoting interoperability and readiness that is crucial for multinational military operations. Recognizing and learning the differences in medical practices among different nations' combat medics can enhance the overall capabilities of the combined forces.

“With the other NATO forces, they bring a different expertise because we have people that are like combat medics with 10 years of experience and a surgeon, he gave a different insight and input to the medics,” said Spc. George Rivera, assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division. “I think it's really good, and it brings the morale up, communicating with the other soldiers.”

The EBMC prepared army medics and served as a crucible for promoting collaboration, interoperability, and continuous improvement within the military medical community, highlighting the importance of readiness and having highly capable medical personnel to support the world's most potent and lethal army.

“The world's most powerful and lethal army must have the world's best medical instrument of power supporting them and that medical instrument of power is army medicine,” said Brig. Gen. Roger Giraud, assigned to the Medical Readiness Command, Europe.",

ARLINGTON, Va. - The 2023 National Guard Bureau Innovation Challenge showcased the inventive prowess of Guard members nationwide Dec. 7 at the Herbert R. Temple Jr. Army National Guard Readiness Center. Among the concepts featured: a virtual reality application by the Arkansas National Guard, a South Carolina Army National Guard initiative for robotic automation of personnel data, and a Michigan National Guard medical system revolutionizing casualty care in austere environments.

“This is an opportunity for you to show us how we can become a better organization,” said Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, who hosted the event. “As I looked through the topics that each of you are presenting today, many of them are unique to the Guard but can also have applicability to the entire Joint Force.”

Ultimately, the Arizona Army National Guard clinched top honors at the competition with its pioneering idea — an exportable live-fire range.

“We’re pleasantly surprised and very honored,” said Army Lt. Col. Loong Lee, the state training officer for the Arizona National Guard’s Joint Force Headquarters.

The team bested the three other finalists — all with solutions that support one of Hokanson’s key priorities: modernization, which the 2022 National Defense Strategy stresses as crucial in building “enduring advantages across the defense ecosystem” and sharpening “the Joint Force’s technological edge.”

The competitors submitted their proposals at the state level, followed by elimination rounds conducted in four regions and then semifinal rounds. The finalists created visual products showcasing their ideas, followed by a presentation to Hokanson and three other senior leader judges.

The competitors were chosen based on their ability to identify a challenge, develop a unique solution and explain the overarching benefit, said Keith E. Buchholz, the NGB’s programs and resources comptroller, who coordinated and organized this year’s challenge.

“By virtue of the fact you are here today as finalists, you have already shown your initiative to seek answers to the questions of how we will do things better, faster, cheaper in the Guard,” Buchholz said.

For Lee, the training officer for the Arizona Guard, this meant identifying challenges in meeting live-fire and training requirements while complying with environmental and safety regulations.

That kind of training at major installations hundreds of miles away from a home station, he said, also “results in loss of time, increased costs, and potential unresolvable conflicts for resources against other units.”

“A solution to these problems is increased utilization of short-range training ammunition as well as a combination of battery-powered simulation devices and training scenarios” that follow Army guidance, said Lee in his team’s presentation.

This provided the means to produce what amounted to a mobile range.

“Through these tools, we can create an exportable maneuver live-fire range that can be safely established in existing training areas that are traditionally too restrictive for standard ammunition,” Lee said.

While minimal transportation can cut costs, the “time savings” could propel units forward, said John Ralph, an Army budget analyst for the Arizona Army Guard’s operations and training directorate.

“In a Guard environment, where you typically get one weekend a month and two weeks to train, every minute is precious,” he said. “And we can give back that time to those commanders to let them get after [the mission].”

Many Guard members who hold relevant civilian jobs helped bring the team's proposal to fruition, said Sgt. 1st Class John McCrory, a transportation management coordinator with an Arizona Guard training center.

“With one of my technicians, if he was just brought up as a Soldier in the active-duty Army, I don’t think he would have the civilian experience with electronics” needed to “adapt to whatever situation we were in,” said McCrory, who also headed the team’s “proof of concept” efforts for the proposal.

Ralph said Soldiers and Airmen should always consider themselves part of the innovation ecosystem and always push ideas — however big or small they may be.

“Don’t be afraid to say something if you see something that needs to be done better because we can always do anything better,” he said.

The National Guard Bureau will further explore each team’s presentation to determine the feasibility of advancing ideas from concept to reality, according to senior leaders. The factors they will consider include funding, scope and impact on the Guard force.

Hokanson closed out the event by emphasizing innovation is imperative and that more competition is on the horizon.

“The four teams that got here did remarkable work, and we were fascinated by the level of innovation going on in our organization,” he said. “And that just inspires us just to continue to do this.”

The NGB plans to conduct innovation competitions biannually through December 2025. Guard members are encouraged to work with their designated innovation lead specialist, typically positioned at a state’s headquarters element, to advance their ideas.

WASHINGTON — Last week, Sgt. 1st Class Tatiana Johnson, an Army recruiter at the Waldorf Recruiting Center in Maryland, decided to try the new Go Recruit mobile application, specifically made for Army recruiters.

She grabbed her phone and walked across the street from her recruiting center to a movie theater to do some prospecting. After talking to a few interested people, she uploaded their information into the recruiting database in seconds just by using the app.

“It’s so much easier to get [contact information],” she said. “[The app] isn’t something we were asking for, but it’s something that we needed.”

Development for the mobile app and web browser version started in March. A team from the Army Software Factory worked with a team from the Army Analytics Group to create an application that gives recruiters access to information on the go.

The team’s design experienced numerous versions and countless recruiter feedback during the six-month process.

The final product is similar to what recruiters in the private sector use for applicant tracking. The application rolled out to recruiters Nov. 20 and is compatible with iOS and Android phones.

The software lets recruiters call, text, and email candidates without logging into the recruiting system. It also allows recruiters to scan drivers’ licenses, pulling in the associated information.

The height and weight data alerts recruiters to which candidates are within Army standards and which are options for the Future Soldier Preparatory Course.

These features eliminate the need for recruiters to head into the office to upload information from a computer.

“This app has reduced the time it takes to become proficient as a recruiter when it comes to prospecting,” Johnson said.

Reducing commuting time has allowed Johnson to double her face-to-face interactions with candidates. In her first week using the app, she’s had 40 meetings. This is something she said would’ve been impossible before.

Go Recruit mobile also reduces search time for recruiters. They can filter information in the database on targeted demographics depending on what they’re looking for.

It also reduces time when recruiters are making house calls. They can click on a candidate's address and have that come up in a corresponding GPS application.

Johnson said this streamlined process helped her recruiting station increase prospect numbers by around 150%.

“My commander is overwhelmed with the number of contacts we have now,” she said.

In just one week, Johnson said this tool dramatically changed how her station recruits on the go.

“This app is definitely amazing, and every recruiter should have it on their phone,” she said. “It’s a game changer.”

Army recruiters can only download the application on their government phones through the DOD Mobile Apps Gallery.

TOKYO – The day before Thanksgiving, Jim McGee was, fittingly, spending his evening giving his time to help feed children and families in need.

McGee, the chief of U.S. Army Garrison Japan’s Visual Information Division at Camp Zama, Japan, was at the Manbow Children’s Cafeteria in Setagaya with other volunteers to help prepare and serve food to the patrons there.

McGee, a navy veteran, first came to Japan in 1988 when he was stationed at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, and said he immediately fell in love with the country’s people and culture. He has worked at Camp Zama on and off for 15 years since 2005.

In return for the hospitality the Japanese people have shown him in his many years here, McGee said he is always looking for opportunities to give back to them. A few months ago, he learned about Manbow and its mission from a friend who co-founded the organization.

Manbow opened about a year ago to offer help the local community — not just with providing free food to children in need, but with providing support and care to young parents. The cafeteria opens twice a month for dinner.

McGee asked his friend if he could be involved, and his offer was accepted right away. The cafeteria relies heavily on volunteers to help with food preparation, cooking and serving. His first opportunity to help was, coincidentally, Nov. 22 — the day before Thanksgiving.

“I thought, ‘What a great opportunity to help provide food to a bunch of people,’ because Thanksgiving is all about sharing food with friends and strangers, and it’s America’s greatest holiday,” McGee said.

After arriving at the cafeteria, he was immediately put to work stuffing small shells of dough to make Japanese dumplings, known as “gyoza.” He quickly got the hang of it and together with the team of volunteers, they stuffed and pan-friend between 600 and 700 of the dumplings.

Once everything was prepared, it came time for what McGee said was the most rewarding part of the evening: serving the food to the children and their parents.

“I could have done that all day long because the children were so cute and polite,” McGee said. “Everyone was so genuinely grateful and came back to say ‘Thank you’ and ask why I was there and how I got involved.”

Yumiko Yoshimi, president of the Manbow cafeteria, opened the facility because she said she had begun to see a widening disparity in the economic classes in her community. Children from lower class families in particular tend to face a variety of complex issues, Yoshimi said, so she wanted to do something for those members of the community she has been living in for most of her life.

“I think the role of our cafeteria is to fill the stomachs and the hearts of those who come here and to put smiles on their faces,” she said.

Yoshimi named the cafeteria “Manbow,” which is Japanese for “sunfish.” In many cultures, the fish is associated with happiness.

“When people think of a place like this, they probably imagine a dimly lit, quiet place where everyone is looking down,” Yoshimi said. “But our cafeteria is different. Everyone here is excited, and some people are even visibly energized. For them, this place is just like their home.”

Yoshimi said volunteers like McGee are always welcome because their contributions help to raise awareness of what Manbow is doing to help the community in Setagaya.

“This is a great opportunity for both local and foreign volunteers to realize that there are children in Japan who need help,” she said.

McGee said his first opportunity to volunteer at Manbow was serendipitous because Thanksgiving is his favorite holiday. He said the day truly has no agenda other than welcoming family, friends and even strangers to share a meal together.

“This event gave me that experience on a grand scale,” he said. “It will be a Thanksgiving that I’ll remember for the rest of my life.”",

WIESBADEN, Germany – More than 100 students from DoDEA high schools across Europe gathered in Wiesbaden for the annual STEMposium event where they were grouped into teams to develop projects and solutions to real-world scenarios based on climate change and impacts to population centers.

“Students representing our 21 DoDEA Europe high schools are presented with a different real-world scenario in which they are required to formulate actionable solutions in order to be successful,” said DoDEA Europe Student Activities Coordinator Rob Smith about the event. “Our students are getting hands-on, real-world experience dealing with cutting edge tools, technologies, and techniques that can lead to success later in life.”

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District was one of a handful of organizations that supported the STEMposium, participating in career fair and providing mentoring and answered questions of students as they worked on their projects.

In a first for the annual STEMposium, this year’s event incorporated a STEM-focused career fair where representatives from different organizations, including Europe District and several others.

“It was great talking to the students during the career fair,” said Europe District Engineering Branch Chief Nathan Fox. “They were all very engaging and curious about the range of jobs available for engineers and in other STEM fields.”

As part of the event, the students were broken into teams and assigned different areas of expertise including biotechnology, civil engineering, data engineering, environmental engineering, robotics and using CAD programs for 3D printing.

“STEMinar” sessions were scheduled for each of these areas where students worked through their projects with real-world subject matter experts that could answer questions and mentor the students.

“I worked with the students focused on environmental engineering tasks in their groups; they were a bright group of young people who asked a lot of good questions,” said Europe District Environmental Branch Northern Section Chief Patricia Jackson. “They were tasked with providing clean drinking water following a disaster scenario, so we talked about water filtration methods, specifically those that would be climate-neutral. Some solutions we covered were lagoons with plants for filtration, as these filtering plants also absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. We also covered ways to minimize pump power usage, such as through gravity filtration when possible.”

Smith noted that the annual event was again a success and that it is part of DoDEA Europe’s dedication to providing unique and impactful opportunities for the children of DoD personnel stationed overseas.

“This event represents DoDEA's unwavering commitment to providing educational experiences that are not just on par, but often exceed what's available stateside,” Smith said. “It's an immersive journey into the world of STEM, where students engage in hands-on activities, gaining a deeper understanding of science and its real-world applications. More than just an academic exercise, STEMposium is a launchpad for future careers in STEM, nurturing essential skills like critical thinking and teamwork.”",

FRANKFORT, Ky. — There are many leadership schools that service members can attend but few are more challenging than the U.S. Army Ranger School. There, perfection is the standard, and nothing less is accepted.

This criterion was set upon Kentucky Army National Guard 2nd Lt. Dustin McKie-Miller when he decided to go to Ranger School. He aced every challenge on his first attempt and finished the course in 62 days, the shortest time possible for training, crediting both luck and skill.

A Ranger is a part of the Army’s premier infantry force. They specialize in conducting raids and infiltration missions deep inside enemy territory. To become a Ranger is no easy task. One must undergo grueling training to ensure they have the mental toughness, physical fitness, moral character and motivation to endure the challenges they may face in combat.

“At graduation, we’re told that only somewhere between 10 and 20% of Ranger students complete the course straight through,” he said. “The vast majority of those who complete the training have recycled at least one phase at some point.”

McKie-Miller decided to go to the training after several of the friends he had made from across the Army commissioned and began their military careers as infantry officers.

“I got to watch them go through the Infantry Basic Officer Leader Course, then to Ranger School, get their tab, and then see everything that they brought to their organization because of the Ranger program,” said McKie-Miller. “I had the idea in my mind of, ‘OK, well that's what the standard looks like.’”

McKie-Miller's goals fell into place. All he needed was a clear path to seize an opportunity.

“For National Guard Soldiers, there is an additional requirement of completing the two-week long, Ranger Training Assessment Course run by the Warrior Training Center at Fort Moore prior to attending Ranger School,” he said. “I was fortunate that the Guard had a slot available for me to attend RTAC immediately following IBOLC graduation.”

For McKie-Miller, the biggest challenge he faced with Ranger School was the mental hurdle of starting the course.

“I think my greatest challenge was just overcoming the reputation of Ranger School beforehand, of all the horror stories I heard about how I’m not going to eat, I’m not going to sleep, and I truly don’t know when it will end,” said McKie-Miller. “I imagined that it would be a 62-day field training exercise — or, at least hopefully only 62 days — across impossible terrain, and I’d just be broken down to the core throughout it. And, although in the end there is some truth to those stories, the hardest part for me was simply getting out of the car on Day Zero.”

After that, he said, “My mindset shifted to, ’I'm here now, and I'm going to give everything I have for as long as it takes. And so is everyone alongside me.’”

McKie-Miller said Ranger School isn’t looking for perfect genetic specimens, just that you do things correctly.

“What the Ranger instructors expect are 49 perfect pushups, 59 perfect sit-ups, not a second over 40 minutes on the run, and to cap it off, six perfect chin-ups,"" he said. ""They're not looking for someone to go out and do 100 pushups, they just want 49 to standard. When the Ranger instructor counts your 49th, 59th and 6th they tell you to stand up and move to the next station because you've met the standard. But they demand that to perfection.”

McKie-Miller enlisted in the Kentucky Guard in 2018 as a motor transport operator while he was still a student at the University of Kentucky and was assigned to the 2123rd Transportation Company, 75th Troop Command. After a year with the 2123rd, he was encouraged to attend Officer Candidate School in Greenville, earning his commission in 2020. He is now a platoon leader with Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 149th Infantry Regiment out of Middlesboro.

He lives in Clarksville, Tennessee, where he works as a software architect with General Electric Aerospace.

His advice for Soldiers eyeing Ranger School: “It is a difficult course, it does challenge you, and at times it does push you to your limit,"" he said. “But at the end of the day, it's very much achievable.”

Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany - Military and government leaders from the across the globe came together for Silent Warrior 23, Dec. 4 – 7, 2023 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.

The multi-day conference, hosted by Special Operations Command Africa, aimed to facilitate forums for senior military leaders to discuss shared concerns and identify collaborative solutions to the strategic, operational, and tactical issues in Africa. Many leaders in attendance were also from their respective countries’ special operations forces.

The annual conference, now in its 12th year, had 55 nations in attendance – 22 African countries and 33 international partners. This year, the conference placed a heavy emphasis on violent extremist organizations (VEOs) and the unique challenges they pose across the African continent.

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Ron Foy, SOCAFRICA’s commander, stated during opening remarks for the conference that the best way to combat the aforementioned VEOs was through sustained partnerships.

“We recognize the strong potential Africa brings not only to the continent but to the globe as a whole,” said Foy. “A stable and prosperous Africa continues to and always will be in the world’s best interest.”

Also in attendance was the U.S. Africa Command team, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael Langley, AFRICOM commander, and U.S. Marine Corps Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Woods, AFRICOM senior enlisted leader. Langley provided opening remarks for the conference.

“Sessions such as Silent Warrior 23, give me the opportunity to listen,” said Langley. “Listen to your viewpoints. Listen to some of the challenges but moreover, listen to the opportunities across the continent of Africa.”

“Whether it be the enduring fight against al-Shabaab or against violent extremist organizations across the Sahel,” said Langley. “I am listening to you and your ideas collectively.”

Senior officials from SOCAFRICA’s African partner nations were some of the guest speakers for the event. On theme with the conference, Brig. Gen. John Njeru, Kenya Defence Force, organized an in-depth discussion on al-Shabaab, a VEO that has posed a significant security threat in Njeru’s home country of Kenya and other nations throughout east Africa.

Njeru spoke about the increasing capabilities of al-Shabaab, such as the spread of disinformation, large scale recruitment and the increasing use of drones and how those challenges can be addressed through partnerships and collective efforts.

The conference also afforded leadership the opportunity to have small-group discussions on various topics. One breakout session focused on enlisted development within not only U.S. forces, but SOCAFRICA’s international and African partners as well.

Command Sgt. Maj. Garrick Banfield, the senior enlisted leader for SOCAFRICA, stressed the importance of enlisted service members and the benefits they bring to multilateral planning and operations.

“Enlisted leaders provide a unique perspective and a vantage point,” said Banfield. “These vantage points illuminate a situation which can then enable enlisted leaders to provide advice and counsel to their officers.”

Multiple agencies came together to ensure the success of the conference. SOCAFRICA staff took on a heavy load with the logistics and planning efforts of the conference. Airmen from the Language Enabled Airman Program ensured the practices shared were translated to French, Arabic and Portuguese-speaking countries.

“In conferences like Silent Warrior, we facilitate clear and accurate communication across languages and cultures,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Scott Guthrie, LEAP interpreter and 52nd Health Care Operations Squadron physician. “This not only enhances mutual understanding and cooperation but also respects and acknowledges the cultural diversity of the participants – leading to more effective international collaborations.”

Foy thanked those in attendance for battling the elements to participate in the discussions, briefs, and breakout sessions. He also stressed the importance of SOCAFRICA’s enduring partnerships with their African partners.

“Partnerships serve as the backbone for our resolve to defeat violent extremism”, said Foy. “And I can say without reservation no VEO can match our collective strength. None. We’re much stronger together.”",

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White delighted UFC fans during a meet and greet event Nov. 30 at the Fort Cavazos Main Exchange here.

White was in the Central Texas area for the UFC Lightweight bout Dec. 2 at Moody Center in Austin, Texas, and stopped by Fort Cavazos to visit with Soldiers before he made his way south.

The crew from Fort Cavazos’ Great Big Podcast sat down with White to talk about his steadfast dedication to the armed forces and his philosophy on life and success.

White began with a declaration of his support for the military that would echo throughout the remainder of the podcast.

“I’m a huge military and law enforcement guy so anytime that I can ever do anything, no matter what it is, I’m all in,” he expressed. “The level of respect that I have for military personnel, it’s unexplainable. I’ll probably say it 30 times during this podcast, I love the military. I have so much respect for people who defend this country.”

When asked how it felt to be at Fort Cavazos, White replied, “To meet the people who actually are here, doing it and willing to defend our country, there’s no place that I would rather be than here today meeting them and shaking their hands.

“These are the people that are the real heroes and the real superheroes,” he continued. “When you are willing to dedicate a massive portion of your life, and sometimes your entire life, to protecting others and protecting your country, it’s one of the things that I respect the most in a human being.”

White recounted the early days of trying to establish the UFC and the mantra that inspired him then and still pushes him to achieve great things today.

“People thought it was crazy, what I wanted to do. The idea of going head-to-head with boxing. Boxing was massive and was sort of cemented in over a hundred years of history in the United States, and when you say that you want to start what I wanted to start and do what I wanted to do, it seemed impossible and could never be done. Nothing is impossible and everything can be done,” he declared.

“People out there who have an idea and it seems too big and it seems too crazy and other people think you’re nuts, none of that’s true,” he continued. “Anything is possible and anything can be done.”

White talked about his work with the Fisher House and his immense respect for the organization and its efforts to support the military.

“We’re huge supporters and I don’t know if anybody’s done more than the Fisher family for the military,” he said.

Before wrapping up the podcast, White reiterated his support for service members.

“I would literally do anything,” he asserted. “I met a couple of guys here today and I gave them my cell phone number already, I’ve been here 10 minutes … you know if you ever need anything from me or the UFC, whether it’s fundraising, people showing up to bases or any type of support that we could possibly give, I’m your guy, I’m all in.”

Spc. David Briseno, 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment, was one of a group of Soldiers who met White and took photos with him before the meet and greet.

Briseno recounted memories of watching UFC bouts on television with his father and seeing White ringside. He said he never imagined meeting him and described the encounter as, “truly a once in a lifetime experience for me.”

“These big people in Hollywood, they care about guys and girls like us,” he said. “That truly makes us feel special and makes us really want to keep working and doing our best to protect this country.”

Spc. Falecia Long, 1st Bn., 9th Cav. Regt., agreed.

“It makes you feel special,” she expressed. “I think it’s cool that he supports everything that we do. There’s a lot of people that support the military, but it was nice to have someone that’s super big to be like, ‘You guys are doing great stuff.’ It made me feel important.”

Dressed in a black t-shirt with green letters that read “ARMY,” White’s appreciation of the armed forces and his humble and friendly demeanor were on full display as he posed for photos and laughed and talked with Fort Cavazos leadership, Soldiers, Main Exchange staff and VIP guests before greeting throngs of fans awaiting his entrance.

“I was just outside and there’s a line probably a hundred yards long of Soldiers in uniform, out of uniform, waiting patiently to come see him,” said Col. Kevin Brown, command engineer, Army and Air Force Exchange Service.

Brown explained that White’s visit embodied AAFES’ long-standing slogan.

“AAFES, we go where you go, and this is one time he came where we are,” he said. “For Mr. White to come here and meet our Soldiers and family members in our main store, is awesome.”

Brown added that the event was a great way to usher in the holidays for Soldiers and their families.

“This is a really good morale boost for the beginning of the holiday season,” he conveyed. “They have something here to kind of break up the monotony, to give them something to look forward to and have fun.”",

Update: Dec. 14, 2023

WASHINGTON — The Army announced it is crediting service time for Soldiers who commissioned through the active-duty option of the Green to Gold program from 2006 to September 2023.

The decision comes following a review of the Army Military Human Resource Records that revealed those Soldiers did not have a valid contract in place to be enrolled as a Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps member.

""We are pleased to have reached a resolution that takes care of Soldiers and retirees, said Brig. Gen. Hope C. Rampy, Director, Military Personnel Management Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff. ""The Army is profoundly committed to taking care of Soldiers and their families; it's a responsibility we do not take lightly.""

The Army initiated the records review after a U.S. Army Cadet Command Inspector General notice in September stated that some Soldiers may not have known the period they spent as cadets did not count toward their time in service for retirement.

""It's my business to take care of Soldiers, and I don't want to rush to the wrong conclusion,"" Rampy said during an interview earlier this month. ""I want to go through a deliberate process and confirm what's in their file. I want to come up with options that best takes care of the Soldier and their families.""

Federal law, Title 10 section 2106, prohibits the Army from counting a Soldier’s time in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps toward time in service. The records review found that the previously commissioned officers from the G2GADO program did not have a valid contract.

The Army chose the option to credit current active-duty Soldiers commissioned through the program and retired service members during their participation in the G2GADO program in computing length of service for any purpose, including pay and retirement.

WASHINGTON ­­— In 2023, the Army expanded the scale of training both domestically and abroad. The service continued to support humanitarian missions, both within the U.S. and overseas, while maintaining partnerships through agreements like the National Guard State Partnership Program.

The exercises strengthened the Army’s ability to fight alongside allies and partner nations across the globe, as the service looks to increase interoperability among partner nations while building the Army of 2030.

The Best Squad Competition, which finished in October, challenged Soldiers to be all they could be focusing on teamwork and pushing each other to their limits.

Stateside Exercises

BEST SQUAD COMPETITION: This year the service provided more incentives to Soldiers competing for the title of U.S. Army Best Squad. Participants had the opportunity to earn special skills badges for different military occupational specialties. Soldiers could earn the Expert Soldier Badge, the Expert Infantry Badge or the Expert Medical Field Badge.

The 75th Ranger Regiment team from U.S. Army Special Operations Command won first place during the competition followed by a squad from Army Medical Command in second place. Soldiers tested their mettle on 20,000 acres of land at Fort Stewart, Georgia. Soldiers competed in ruck marches and land navigation exercises there, while operating on limited amounts of sleep.

NORTHERN STRIKE: The Army Reserve’s large-scale, deployment exercise added a new element this year: in-theater medical training. Participants simulated a medical evacuation flight during the Midwest-based training exercise from a site in Michigan to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, for additional treatment.

The Michigan National Guard has hosted the exercise since 2012 and expanded Northern Strike into a joint, multinational program based at the National All-Domain Warfighting Center at Camp Grayling, Michigan. More than 7,000 participants from across the U.S. and four nations took part in the annual exercise, where participants simulated joint integrated fires, command and control, and sustainment.

The training, which takes place across Michigan’s lower peninsula, including the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center in Alpena County, the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, and Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport in Iosco County.

Disaster Response

The National Guard deployed 134 troops to support the relief and response efforts following the devastating wind-driven wildfires in Hawaii in August. The Guard provided two CH-47 Chinook helicopters to aid search and recovery efforts, primarily over the island of Maui. National Guard Soldiers supported Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and local law enforcement as liaisons.

In a single day, Guard members dropped about 10,000 gallons of water during a five-hour period. Cartographers and geographers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers used geographic information systems to provide relevant data to help government organizations develop and execute relief plans.

In August and September, about 5,000 members of the Florida National Guard and others activated to assist with disaster response efforts during Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall on Florida’s west coast.

Making a Difference Worldwide

NATIONAL GUARD STATE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM: In 2023, the international program that aligns guard units with foreign partners celebrated three decades of cooperation and providing aid. The Army celebrated the program’s 30th anniversary in July at the National Harbor in Fort Washington, Maryland.

An already established partnership between U.S. forces and Ukraine helped aid the eventual Ukrainian war effort against Russia. Ukraine has held a partnership with the California National Guard since 1993, with Guard members training Ukrainian forces in capabilities such as firing FIM-92 Stingers, a mobile defense platform, and the FGM-148 Javelin, a portable shoulder-launched anti-tank system.

U.S. forces have also influenced Ukrainians on the battlefield, adopting a tactical model inspired by the Army’s non-commissioned officer corps.

U.S. European Command sought to establish a contact team in the Baltic region. The partnership program started with seven former Soviet nations and now includes more than 88 partnerships with more than 100 partner nations across all corners of the world

The program encourages personal ties at the state level among partner nations. Not only does the program support defense security, but also societal relationships that span into other areas of government and economy.

EXERCISE JUSTIFIED ACCORD: The Kenya-based multi-national exercise helped U.S. forces provide humanitarian assistance, engage in peacekeeping missions and crisis response.

Led by U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa , more than 20 countries participated in Justified Accord, the largest exercise in East Africa. Last February, Soldiers learned to perform humanitarian missions and took part in a multinational, live-fire training event. Planners also incorporated cyber-related simulations for the first time.

OPERATION TALISMAN SABRE: During this multinational, large scale exercise, U.S. and Australian forces sought to build a more persistent, secure network among the “Five Eyes” alliance of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

The new network will be synchronized across the partner nations’ systems and save setup times by having network availability already in place. The network will help raise readiness levels and bring the service closer to the Army of 2030.

The development of the new network showcased one of the methods by which the Army and host Australia improved its network capabilities and interoperability among nations during Talisman Sabre. During the annual exercise, Hawaii and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, U.S. forces learned to operate in enemy and austere environments with challenging constraints and longer distances in the Indo Pacific.

The series of experiments, in accordance with the Army’s Data Strategy, allowed the U.S. and its allies to continually test network capabilities in a dozen different exercises.

JOINT EMERGENCY EXERCISE 23: Members of Special Forces and other experts from across the force trained Army physicians and medical personnel in realistic combat casualty care scenarios during Joint Emergency Exercise. During the exercises, Soldiers learned to integrate medical care into combat operations during simulated scenarios.

Hosted by the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, at Fort Cavazos, Texas, the exercise helped increase combat readiness and joint interoperability for more than 2,000 participants from the Army, Air Force, National Guard and Army Reserve. Service members representing 60 combat career specialties took part in the exercises.

U.S. ARMY EUROPE AND AFRICA EXERCISES: U.S. Army Europe and Africa command provides combat-ready, land forces ready to defend the region.

EXERCISE SABER JUNCTION: During this annual exercise in September, the Army, NATO and allied forces gathered in Germany to learn to operate as one.

Exercises centered around the Joint Multinational Readiness Center near Hohenfels, Germany, where 4,000 participants from 16 countries widened the scale of operations and learned to overcome linguistics, logistics and communications challenges. Soldiers also simulated using different weapons and systems and the treatment and evacuation of injured troops.

U.S. Soldiers and their NATO counterparts spent time learning how each other operates on the battlefield and the nuances in their strategies.

USAREUR-AF, comprised of about 41,000 troops on two continents, takes part in 18 major exercises including U.S. Africa Command’s largest multinational exercise, African Lion. This year, African Lion 23 took place across Ghana, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia in May and June 2023. The exercise included combined arms live fires, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear response training and three humanitarian assistance events.

In coordination with U.S. Army Futures Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa hosted Arctic Forge, a series of cold-weather exercises based in Scandinavia.

During Arctic Forge 23 last February, Soldiers from the 11th Airborne Division, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, the 10th Mountain Division in Fort Drum, New York, and the Virginia Army National Guard trained with the Finnish military.

U.S. Soldiers also took part in Defense Exercise North, where they drew from the Finnish troops’ frigid weather experience. The Soldiers operated in three feet of snow under subzero temperatures and learned how to operate in arctic conditions, including techniques used on skis to traverse across challenging terrain.

Allied Spirit began in 2011 and has grown from six nations in 2015 to 21 NATO countries and allies in 2023. Unlike other training center exercises, Allied Spirit features an allied unit comprised of partner nations as the primary training audience instead of a U.S. brigade combat team.

From strengthening ties with allied partners to saving lives during humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, the Army made a difference in forging relationships across the globe, and allowing Soldiers to be all that they can be.

WASHINGTON ­— The Army continued to deliver the most advanced weapons systems and equipment into the hands of Soldiers in 2023.

The service broke new ground in shipping the first Directed Energy, Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense or DE M-SHORAD prototype systems to Soldiers and the Army also received the latest model of the Integrated Visual Augmentation Systems, or IVAS.

After the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System reached full-rate production status in April, the service followed that feat by demonstrating the first successful launch of a Tomahawk missile from its prototype Mid-Range Capability system.

Finally, the Army honored the service of two Soldiers from two major campaigns in naming its newest infantry assault vehicle. The upgrades bring the Army closer to building the Army of 2030 by investing in its top priority, its people and its Soldiers.

DE M-SHORAD system: In September, the successful delivery of the Directed Energy, MSHORAD system to the newly-reactivated Delta Battery of 4th Battalion, 60th Air Defense Artillery Regiment at Fort Sill, made Delta Battery the first tactical, directed-energy capable unit.

The laser weapons system will not only be a deterrent against enemy forces but can counter against relevant threats with air defense protection. The service classified the DE M-SHORAD system as an urgent acquisition program that provides commanders with greater freedom to maneuver.

Members of the battery underwent extensive training in the fall of 2022 to prepare to operate the prototype. Soldiers simulated an attack using a vehicle with the same weight and power of the prototype.

IVAS: The Army reached a new milestone in July when Soldiers received 20 of the latest model of IVAS, the 1.2 variant. The system features an all-weather headset and next-generation, situational awareness tools with a mixed reality display. IVAS provides Soldiers with high resolution simulations, giving Soldiers enhanced capabilities in both in day and night conditions.

The development of the IVAS will result in fielding several years ahead of standard acquisition programs.

Using augmented reality, the headset enhances a Soldier’s ability to navigate in hostile environments. When dismounting, the IVAS’s low-light sensors help the user identify targets and surrounding vehicles.

The IVAS system also has a built-in Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer, which teaches Soldiers to use the headset to solve objective-based dilemmas and battle scenarios.

Tribute to veterans: The Army announced that it named its newest combat vehicle, the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle, after Medal of Honor recipient Robert Booker, a World War II veteran, and Staff Sgt. Stevon Booker, a Distinguished Service Cross recipient from Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The service announced it awarded the $257.6 million production contract to Michigan-based General Dynamics Land Systems in July. Designers built the armored vehicle to be highly maneuverable and mobile, resembling a light tank.

Army leaders commemorated the renaming during a ceremony at the National Museum of the United States Army in June as part of the service’s 248th birthday celebration. In addition, the Army selected Alabama’s Anniston Army Depot as the repair depot for the vehicle.

Mid-Range firepower: The Army fired intermediate range, subsonic Tomahawk missiles from a prototype system at an undisclosed location on June 27.

Soldiers from the 1st Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington carried out the test with assistance from the Navy. The test marks an important step to strengthening the Army’s top modernization priority: long-range precision fires. The MRC system will support the joint, multi-domain mission.

Soldiers contributed to the testing and development of the MRC, according to the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.

Major milestone: The Army announced in April that its Integrated Battle Command System, or IBCS, had reached full rate production.

The Army Acquisition Support Center describes the IBCS as a fire control and operational center, providing accurate targeting and a wider battlespace. Using sensors and effectors in one command and control system, IBCS lets Soldiers see the battlefield more effectively.

IBCS will replace older command and control systems which in turn will improve coordinated engagements and positive control of sensors and weapons.

Network testing with NATO allies: Soldiers in Hohenfels, Germany tested the Army’s Integrated Tactical Network during Exercise Dragoon Ready 23. The ITN provides voice and data communication capabilities to units in the field.

About 2,500 U.S. Soldiers in field artillery, fire control, operations, and signal support systems participated, along with troops from NATO allies Italy and the United Kingdom. The Soldiers simulated operating in austere environments while learning unified land operations with partner nations.

WASHINGTON — People remain the Army’s number one priority and the service implemented various quality of life changes throughout 2023 to help service members and their families.

These efforts included enhancing career opportunities for spouses, child care access, family housing, and mental health support.

Spouse Employment

The Army worked on several plans to increase employment for the 431,000 spouses across all three components. The service expanded its noncompetitive hiring authority with the DOD Military Spouse Employment Partnership, connecting spouses to 610 employers. So far, more than 258,000 spouses have been hired.

The Army continues to work with the Defense State Liaison Office as they work with states on implementing the recently passed Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act.

This legislation is designed to assist spouses in transferring occupation licenses between states more effortlessly.

The Army has streamlined the process for spousal reimbursement for license and certification cost up to $1,000 during a permanent change of station move.

Family member employment has been difficult in Italy, and on 30 August 2023, the U.S. and Italy came to an agreement that allows U.S. dependents with a mission visa stationed there to telework to jobs with U.S. employers, which was not an option for spouses previously.

“Army spouses play an important role in Soldier and family readiness and Soldier retention,” said Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth. “Leveraging both Army and DOD programs, and partnerships with other federal and non-governmental organizations, we remain committed to improving spouse employment and career opportunities.”

Streamlined Moving Process

This September, the Department of Defense began phase one of transitioning to a single contracting company, Houston-based company HomeSafe Alliance, LLC, for the pickup and delivery of household goods in the continental U.S.

Phase two will include overseas moves and is scheduled to begin September 2024. Army leadership said the change is expected to bring greater efficiencies and accountability for service members and their families.

“This is an opportunity to raise the standard for our families, attract quality capacity to the program, and introduce a level of accountability absent today,” said Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost, commander, U.S. Transportation Command. “Once implemented, this contract will positively impact thousands of service members, civilian employees and their families each year.”

Child Care

The Army tackled child care costs and availability as well. The service built six new child development centers and has at least five more on the way.

The Army also increased staff at the CDCs by raising entry-level salaries and offering staff retention bonuses as well as child care discounts. More than 70% of its total CDC workforce is now staffed.

In August, the Army announced a new child care pilot program that grants Army Reserve Soldiers and their families access to a childcare matching service and in some areas offering free childcare during battle assembly weekends. The program works with local government support and is being piloted in West Liberty, Iowa, and Clay County, Missouri.

“The Army recognizes the impact that child care has on the lives of our Soldiers and their families,” said Lt. Gen. Kevin Vereen, deputy chief of staff for installations (G-9). “Through increased initiatives to identify and secure accessible and affordable child care options, we enable our military parents to fulfill their responsibilities without sacrificing the well-being of their children.”

The DOD announced the creation of the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account, a financial benefit for eligible service members that allows them to place as much as $5,000 pre-taxed dollars from their paycheck into the account for dependent care services.

Active-component Soldiers, along with Active Guard Reserve Soldiers on Title 10 orders, are eligible. The benefit is scheduled to be available Jan. 1, 2024. Those interested can sign up for the account during the annual Federal Benefits Open Season, which runs now through mid-December.

Parental Leave

To support parents and caregivers, the Army refined its parental leave guidance in January. The new guidance increased paid parental leave from 21 days for non-birth parents to 12 weeks of paid paternal leave for birth parents, non-birth parents and Soldiers adopting a child or accepting a child for long-term foster care.

The expanded policy allows for greater flexibility for Soldiers and their families. It authorizes Soldiers to delay parental leave to attend military education, to take regular leave in between parental leave, and to take leave in increments.

Soldiers can request parental leave through the Integrated Personnel and Pay System–Army and the Department of the Army Form 31.

Economic Stability

Soldiers received positive news with Basic Allowance for Housing rates increasing an average of 12.1% this year. Service members in 291 of 300 military housing areas received an increase.

For low-income military families, a new Basic Needs Allowance became available this year. The supplemental allowance is for active-duty service members with dependents whose household income falls below federal poverty guidelines for their duty location. The new program promotes economic security for Soldiers and their families facing financial challenges.

Additionally, the Army increased retention bonuses this year, giving more money to Soldiers in critical military occupational specialties. The service met its retention goal for the fourth year in a row.

Housing

The Army remains committed to improving its infrastructure; and, in 2023, made significant investments in housing.

Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth pledged to invest $1.5 billion in Army-owned housing and another $3.1 billion in privatized housing. Through the Army’s financial investment plan, the service awarded 45 barracks projects in fiscal year 2023 totaling $1.07 billion.

Barracks projects will continue to see an increased emphasis, said Jordan Matthews, Army Material Command facilities division chief. “These investments directly affect the quality of life of Soldiers and families on Army installations and reflect our commitment to people – the Army’s top priority.”

Army leadership is working to provide 100% sustainment funding for barracks and to spend more on renovation and construction.

Health

As part of the Army’s ongoing efforts to eliminate the stigma associated with seeking mental health support, the Army approved its Brandon Act policy in September.

The new directive allows Soldiers to confidentially seek help through their leaders in the rank of staff sergeant and above, and charges leadership to connect Soldiers with resources quickly.

Soldiers are not required to provide a reason or basis to request a referral. The policy applies to Soldiers in the regular Army, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve who are on active duty for over 30 days.

Guidance for Army National Guard and Army Reserve Soldiers not on active duty is under development.

For Soldiers’ physical health, the Army rolled out its new Body Composition Program in June to assess a Soldier’s body fat more accurately. The policy replaces the older two-measurement test with a one-site tape test across the belly button.

And in March the Army released a directive exempting all Soldiers scoring 540 points or more on the Army Combat Fitness Test from the body fat assessment, regardless of their height and weight. Soldiers must score 80 points or more in each event.

WASHINGTON — In 2023 the service pushed forward with several initiatives to help Americans discover their passions, pursue their purpose, and build lifelong communities while serving.

Brand Relaunch

The Army returned to its classic slogan of “Be All You Can Be” with a brand relaunch in March. The campaign is designed to spotlight the countless opportunities the service offers.

""At a time when political, economic and social factors are changing how young Americans view the world, the new Army brand illustrates how service in the Army is grounded in passion and purpose,"" said Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth. ""Serving our nation is a calling and one that is fundamentally hopeful. We want a new generation of Americans to see the Army as a pathway to the lives and careers they want to achieve.""

The brand transformation was a multiyear process designed to reflect today’s Army while addressing the needs of a new generation. The brand’s new look and feel consists of a re-engineered five-point star logo coupled with the return of the popular tagline, which was initially used from 1980-2001.

Future Soldier Preparatory Course Anniversary

The Army celebrated the first anniversary of the Future Preparatory Course in August. The pilot program helped more than 8,800 eligible Americans overcome academic and physical fitness barriers to service.

The FSPC has an academic track and a fitness track, both three weeks long. The academic portion focuses on helping students improve their Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery scores while the fitness track educates students on the five Holistic Health and Fitness readiness domains.

Both tracks of the course had a 95% graduation rate in the first year of the program, with academic students increasing their ASVAB scores by an average of 18.5 points and fitness students losing an average of 1.7% body fat per week.

“The [course] is where desire meets investment, and every day these young men and women show that when provided the right resources and training, they are able to perform and meet or exceed the standards expected of every Soldier,” said Brig. Gen. Jason E. Kelly, the Fort Jackson commanding general.

Graduates of the academic track who increase their score to a higher classification category can re-negotiate their enlistment contracts and may qualify for a different military occupational specialty or additional incentives.

This year, the Army gave out more than $15.5 million to program graduates.

The course initially started at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, but expanded to Fort Moore, Georgia in January.

All-Volunteer Force 50th Anniversary

On July 1, the Army and the nation celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the all-volunteer force. The move was made by President Richard Nixon’s administration in 1973 to fill the U.S. military ranks with Americans who chose to serve rather than with draftees.

Over the next five decades, the Army continued to evolve from its draft days. Enlistments went from two years to varying lengths depending on a Soldier’s career path.

The Army now offers more complex education and training for more than 200 jobs in science, cybersecurity, combat forces, aviation, medicine, law and more.

Innovations to training have been added to set Soldiers up for success, including Holistic Health and Fitness as well as new approaches to mental, sleep, physical and spiritual readiness.

“Our Soldiers, from the newest E-1 to the most experienced generals come from all over the country, from many different backgrounds, from multiple demographics, races and ethnicities,” Wormuth said. “At the end of the day, what unites us is our shared Army values. That and our collective mission to fight and win the nation’s wars.”

75th Integration, Desegregation Anniversaries

It was a year of anniversary celebrations, as the Army marked the 75th anniversary of the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act in June and the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9981 in July.

The integration act allowed women to become permanent, full-time members of the Army. According to retired Maj. Gen Gina Farrisee, the first female commanding general of the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, the Army provides a way for every person to achieve their full potential.

“The Army is an amazing opportunity,” Farrisee said. “For those looking for a challenge and wanting to make a difference, it is certainly the place to do that. There is no doubt in my mind that the military makes you a better person.”

Just a month later in 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981, ending racial segregation in the armed forces.

“Ending racial discrimination in the military made our Army immeasurably stronger and moved our country closer to fulfilling its founding promise,” Wormuth said. “We should be proud of the progress the Army has made in ensuring that every Soldier, regardless of race, can pursue the unlimited opportunities that military service offers.”

Recruiting Reform

Facing a challenging recruiting environment, the Army announced the transformation of its recruiting enterprise in October.

“The competition for talented Americans is fierce, and it is fundamentally different than it was 50 or even 20 years ago,” Wormuth said. “Understanding that reality is key to designing new practices that will make us a more attractive and compelling career choice for young Americans.”

The sweeping changes include expanding the recruiting focus to a larger portion of the available population, creating a specialized talent acquisition workforce, improving the measurement and evaluation of recruiting policy decisions, and aligning the Army recruiting structure.

First, the Army will expand its focus beyond recent high school graduates. Army leadership set a goal of at least a third of the service’s newest recruits to have more than a high school degree by 2028, compared to 20% today.

Second, the service plans to create two new military occupational specialties for an enlisted talent acquisition specialist and a warrant officer to ensure the best recruiting subject matter expertise and leadership. A more specialized officer workforce remains under consideration.

Third, the Army will create an evidence-based learning capability at Army headquarters that will incorporate data collection and program evaluation design into policy planning and implementation.

Finally, Army leadership plans to consolidate marketing and recruiting into a three-star command that reports directly to them with the new commander’s time in position changing from two to four years.

“The fact is that even though it remains a challenge to attract new recruits, we are exceeding our retention goals every year,” Wormuth said. “That means that people who are in the Army by and large love their jobs. And that’s a message we want all young Americans to hear – that the United States Army is truly a place where you can be all that you can be.”

WASHINGTON — Before kickoff at Saturday’s Army-Navy football game, seven cadets and seven midshipmen will walk to midfield to be traded back to their home academies.

The annual ceremony is part of the Service Academy Exchange Program where students from each of the four service academies are exchanged to spend the fall semester at an academy other than their own.

The program has roots dating back to 1945, when the U.S. Military Academy cadets and Naval Academy midshipmen participated in a weeklong exchange program. The program expanded to a semester long in 1975. Second Class cadets from West Point participate in the exchange but go through a competitive selection process.

Cadet Mitch Walker, who was born in Annapolis, Maryland, said being selected and attending the Naval Academy for a semester has been invaluable.

“It’s extremely important to have a better understanding of our fellow services and their mission sets, tools and capabilities,” he said. “It allows us to hit the ground running quicker in the future in joint operations.”

Cadet Beau Briggs echoed this sentiment. “I’ve been told by many mentors in my life that I’ll be serving in joint operations more than you think,” he said. “I wanted to meet people I’ll likely run into at some point in my career, have those connections, make new friends, experience more culture, learn about other services.”

“It’s becoming more and more important to have programs where the joint forces work together,” said Cadet Ida McLaughlin, from Bethesda, Maryland. “As our focus shifts to peer adversaries, joint operations will become critical to the operational capabilities of our forces. Understanding the capabilities each player has and how they complement each other is crucial to any team. Each branch has a specialized mission, and we have a fighting force that is the most lethal on the planet.”

Some of the cadets felt a call to service and are following a family tradition.

Walker, from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, had an uncle who served in the Marines in Desert Storm, a grandfather in the Air Force during Vietnam, a great-grandfather in the Army infantry and a great-grandfather in the Army Air Corps in World War II.

“Service has always been a priority of mine and my family” Walker said. “I was raised to respect those who have sacrificed on my behalf so naturally I wanted to fulfill that obligation and calling as well. I want to be on the ground in the fight up front as an infantry officer.”

Briggs, from Charlotte, North Carolina, had a grandfather who served in the Navy.

“Being here at the Naval Academy, I earned a better understanding of his service,” he said. “I decided to join the military because service has always been a big part of my life in whatever capacity that may come in. Service to our nation is the highest form of service there is. The military was always on my mind. I landed on the Army because I liked the mission more than the other branches.”

Walker highly recommends the service academies to anyone considering attending.

“Going to a service academy is an experience that can’t be bought,” he said. “It’s truly a million-dollar education. You can’t match the experiences, the people you’ll meet or the friendships you’ll build anywhere else in the country. Going through life every day with more than 4,000 other people committed to defending the nation and its freedoms motivates me to be a better version of myself every single day.

“I would encourage anyone looking to join the Army or applying to any of the Service Academies to do your research and put the effort in before you go to be successful,” Walker said. “Be prepared to be out of your comfort zone but the sooner you discover the opportunities available to you, the more you’ll get out of your experience.”

“The Army provides a multitude of opportunities for Soldiers,” McLaughlin said. “Be aware of the programs in place to support you and take advantage of them. Broaden your horizons. Seek out opportunities to experience new things and learn from experts in fields that are different from yours.”

She plays Division-1A Rugby for West Point, studies mechanical engineering and hopes to commission as an aviation officer.

Prior to the start of the Army-Navy game, the cadets will be exchanged at midfield and allowed to cheer on their teams from friendly areas in the West Point seating areas.

“It’s Army-Navy week so tensions are high right now. Everyone’s very skeptical of everyone else,” Briggs said. “I’m looking over my shoulder constantly. I can’t wait to go out to that midfield line, do our exchange and run back to my student section. Go Army, beat Navy.”

“I’m absolutely excited to rejoin my classmates,” McLaughlin said. “The anticipation for this game has been building throughout this semester, and the exchange will be the culminating event for us. With the rivalry, we’re much more similar than different and united in our willingness to place duty, honor and country first.”

“Although the Army-Navy rivalry is strong and apparent in the attitudes of both academies and their sports teams, at the end of the day, we’re all on the same team,” Walker said. “We’re best friends and partners 364 days out of the year until one Saturday afternoon in December as we watch our teams duke it out on the gridiron.

“I’m super excited to see my company and cheer the Army team to victory,” Walker said. “Go Army, beat Navy!”",

JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska — For the 68th year, the Alaska National Guard's Operation Santa Claus is bringing the magic of the season to the remote communities of Fort Yukon, Golovin, Koyuk and Tuluksak.

Teaming up with the Salvation Army, the Guard will deliver gifts and tidings of good cheer to approximately 560 children.

Jenny Ragland, a service extension and disaster services director with the Salvation Army, said the organization collects the gifts and the Guard provides logistical support.

“So, when we show up in a community with Santa, there is a gift with every child's name that we share with them,"" she said. ""... Operation Santa wouldn't happen without the partnership between the Salvation Army and the Alaska National Guard.”

Gifts earmarked for the western Alaska communities were palletized by National Guardsmen at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson before their journey to Bethel or Nome. The Alaska Air National Guard's C-17 Globemaster III and the Alaska Army National Guard's C-12 Huron fixed-wing aircraft facilitated the transport.

Upon reaching the hub locations of Bethel and Nome, Santa, Mrs. Claus and their helper elves continued their journey to Tuluksak on November 14 via Army Guard UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters loaded with all the gifts.

Hanna Alexie, a kindergarten teacher in Tuluksak, said her students looked out the classroom window eagerly awaiting the arrival of Santa and Mrs. Claus.

""The students were very excited for this day, and today they were very anxious waiting,” she said. “They didn't want to take off their coats too, waiting in our classroom. They couldn't wait for you guys.""

Jerry Hawk, a community member, expressed gratitude for the rare gathering. He emphasized the significance of bringing the community together to celebrate the holiday.

""The best part was bringing my grandkids over here with everybody, with the community,” said Hawk. ""The peace of joy, the peace of God is within us.

""I'd like to thank everybody that came over, the [National Guard], Santa Claus, and all the presents, and all the people that came here,” said Hawk. “I'd like to wish everybody a Merry Christmas. Thank you.”

The Inupiat Eskimo village of Golovin welcomed Santa, Mrs. Claus and festive volunteers to the Martin L. Olson School gymnasium in Golovin, Alaska, for Operation Santa Claus, Nov. 30, 2023.

Two weeks later, the jolly bunch continued the heartwarming journey to Golovin on November 30, where local cheerleaders led chants and performed choreographed routines while welcoming the festive visitors.

Donna Katchatag, tribal coordinator, said, the community ""prepared desserts, cookies, lemonade, and all the decorating was the help of the kids also.""

Katchatag was a young student the last time Operation Santa Claus visited.

“I don’t have any memories besides him leaving, and I was wondering, why is Santa leaving in a helicopter?” said Katchatag.

It is an Operation Santa Claus tradition that the festivities kick off with everyone singing “Jingle Bells.” Students were then called one by one to meet and take a photo with Santa and receive personalized gifts and candy canes.

In the interior, gifts destined for Fort Yukon were loaded onto the Black Hawk at Ladd Army Airfield on Fort Wainwright, ensuring a direct and efficient delivery December 1.

The program visits the community of Koyuk over the first two weeks of December, promising more holiday magic for these remote areas.

KINDERHOOK, N.Y. - New York Army National Guard Maj. Gen. Michel Natali commemorated the 241st birthday of former President Martin Van Buren Dec. 5 by laying a wreath from the White House at the eighth president’s grave.

The presentation of the wreath from President Joseph Biden marked the climax of a ceremony that featured wreath presentations from local officials, volunteer groups and the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site.

The New York Army National Guard also provided a color guard and honor cordon for the ceremony, along with a bugler to sound taps and a military chaplain to open and close the ceremony.

New York Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Alison Ogden, a member of Joint Force Headquarters who participated in the honor cordon, said she was proud to participate in the ceremony for the second time.

”It is good for the military to be part of local events like this one,” Ogden said.

Natali, the assistant adjutant, Army, for the New York National Guard, praised Van Buren, who served from 1836-1840, for his efforts to keep the United States from going to war with Great Britain over border disputes in Maine and Americans’ support for a rebellion in Canada. Van Buren also refused to support the annexation of Texas as a state to avoid war with Mexico, Natali noted.

Since 1967, the current occupant of the White House has sent wreaths to be presented at the gravesites of former presidents on their birthdays, Natali said.

The ceremony at the Kinderhook Reformed Cemetery, hosted by Kinderhook Mayor Michael Abrams, included remarks by Megan O’Malley, the superintendent of the Martin Van Buren Historic Site, and a presentation by children from Ichabod Crane Primary School.

Natali said it was important to hold events like this to tie the legacy of the past to the present.

Jane Miller, the president of the Friends of Lindenwald, a volunteer group that supports the National Historic Site, said she appreciated the National Guard participating in the annual tradition in Kinderhook.

“We need to remember that our nation was shaped by people like Martin Van Buren,” Miller said.

He was the son of a Dutch tavern owner who worked and studied hard to become a lawyer and important political leader, she said.

Van Buren was the first president born as an American citizen rather than a subject of the King of England. He was also the only president not to have spoken English as his first language, having grown up speaking Dutch, and the first president from New York.

Before running for president in 1836, Van Buren, a lawyer, served as a New York state senator, attorney general, and governor of New York. He was secretary of state for President Andrew Jackson and vice president during Jackson's second term.

Shortly after taking office in 1837, an economic downturn known as the Panic of 1837 hit. Businesses closed, people lost their jobs, and the agricultural economy took a hit.

Van Buren ran for re-election in 1840 but was defeated by William Henry Harrison. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1844 but lost to James K. Polk.

In 1848, he was the unsuccessful presidential candidate of the Free-Soil Party, a group opposing an extension of slavery. That defeat marked the end of his political career.

Van Buren, known as Old Kinderhook because of his hometown, supposedly gave the English language the term OK. During his run for office, OK clubs were organized to support him. He also initialed papers with the letters OK to indicate he approved.

Van Buren died in 1862 during the Civil War.

The New York Army and Air National Guard headquarters traditionally conduct the wreath presentations at the grave of former President Chester A. Arthur in Menands and Van Buren in Kinderhook. The New York Air National Guard's 107th Airlift Wing in Niagara Falls honors former President Millard Fillmore.

KINDERHOOK, N.Y. -- New York Army National Guard Maj. Gen. Michel Natali commemorated the 241st birthday of President Martin Van Buren on Tuesday, December 5, by laying a wreath from the White House at the eighth president's grave in Kinderhook.

The presentation of the wreath from President Joseph Biden marked the climax of a ceremony that featured wreath presentations from local officials, volunteer groups, and the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site.

The New York Army National Guard also provided a color guard and honor cordon for the ceremony, along with a bugler to sound taps and military chaplain to open and close the ceremony.

New York Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Alison Ogden, a member of Joint Force Headquarters who participated in the honor cordon, said she was proud to participate in the ceremony for the second time.

It is good for the military to be part of local events like this one, Ogden said.

In his remarks, Natali, the assistant adjutant, Army, for the New York National Guard, praised Van Buren, who served from 1836-1840, for his efforts to keep the United States from going to war with Great Britain over border disputes in Maine and individual American’s support for a rebellion in Canada.

Van Buren also refused to support the annexation of Texas as a state, in order to avoid war with Mexico, Natali noted.

Since 1967, the current occupant of the White House has sent wreaths to be presented at the gravesites of former presidents on their birthdays, Natali said.

The ceremony at the Kinderhook Reformed Cemetery, hosted by Kinderhook Mayor Michael Abrams, included remarks by Megan O’Malley, the superintendent of the Martin Van Buren Historic Site, and a presentation by children from Ichabod Crane Primary School.

Van Buren, O’Malley said, was happy being at home in Kinderhook, where he was born and grew up and lived most of his, she said. He would have appreciated a home grown ceremony like the one she was speaking at, she said.

The elementary school students gave a presentation about Martin Van Buren’s life and sang happy birthday to the president.

“It was excellent to have the kids here,” Natali said.

It’s important to hold events like this to tie the legacy of the past together with the present, Natali said.

Jane Miller, the president of the Friends of Lindenwald, a volunteer group which supports the National Historic Site, said she appreciates the National Guard participating in the annual tradition in Kinderhook.

“We need to remember that our nation was shaped by people like Martin Van Buren,” Miller said.

He was the son of a Dutch tavern owner who worked and studied hard to become a lawyer and the not become an important political leader, she said.

Van Buren was the first president born as an American citizen rather than a subject of the King of England. He is also the only president not to have spoken English as his first language, having grown up speaking Dutch, and the first president from New York.

Before running for president in 1836, Van Buren, a lawyer, served as a New York state Senator, attorney general, and governor of New York before becoming Secretary of State for President Andrew Jackson. Van Buren was elected as Jackson's vice president during Jackson's second term of office.

Shortly after taking office in 1837, an economic downturn known as the Panic of 1837 hit. Businesses closed, people lost their jobs, and the agricultural economy took a hit.

Van Buren ran for re-election in 1840 but was defeated by William Henry Harrison. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1844 but lost to James K. Polk.

In 1848, he was the unsuccessful presidential candidate of the Free-Soil Party, a group opposing an extension of slavery. That defeat marked the end of his political career.

Van Buren, known as Old Kinderhook because of his hometown, supposedly gave the English language the term OK. During his run for office, OK clubs were organized to support him. He also initialed papers with the letters OK to indicate he approved.

The two letters became another way to say something was good if it was OK.

Van Buren died during in 1862 during the Civil War.

The New York Army and Air National Guard headquarters traditionally conduct the wreath presentations at the grave of President Chester A. Arthur in Menands, as well as that of President Martin Van Buren in Kinderhook. The New York Air National Guard's 107th Airlift Wing in Niagara Falls honors President Millard Fillmore.",

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – As two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters approached to rescue his battle buddies, then-Sgt. 1st Class Rick Dean was impressed by how closely they circled above before landing together in a tight space.

Dean had only set up the landing zone for one helicopter, not aware that a pair of them would arrive to medically evacuate two of his friends from a dangerous area near Baghdad.

But then they both touched down without hesitation.

“I was unbelievably amazed at the proficiency and skill level of the two crews that landed there,” he recalled, saying he found out later they often respond in pairs. “It was awe-inspiring.”

The incident later convinced Dean to pay it forward. He decided to switch careers from artilleryman to helicopter pilot, a role where he went on to provide similar support for many other military members.

On Friday, U.S. Army Aviation Battalion–Japan honored Dean’s 26-year career as he flew an Army helicopter for the final time. After he landed it at Camp Zama’s Kastner Airfield, his helicopter was sprayed with water and well-wishers doused him in champagne as part of an aviation tradition that dates back to World War II.

Over the course of his service, Dean, now a chief warrant officer 4, had logged 1,900 flight hours in 14 countries, including combat zones. And for the most part, those hours flew right on by.

“Now that you’re at the end, you’re like, ‘Wow, where did the time go?’” he said. “It went pretty fast.”

Medevac pilot

As a child, Dean dreamed of being in the Army and to follow in the footsteps of his grandfathers who had both served in WWII.

In 1997, he signed up for artillery and then completed additional training as a paratrooper. While stationed in Alaska, he remembered the invigorating experience of jumping out of planes in the winter.

After a deployment to Afghanistan a few years later, Dean returned to combat in 2006 and his tour was extended for the Iraq War troop surge.

Dean, who was a squad leader responsible for several young men, said the sight of helicopters would bring him a sense of relief as they kept an eye on them from above.

Once, while his unit conducted a patrol, Dean said an AH-64 Apache helicopter pilot warned them that a stretch along the dirt path ahead of them had been disturbed, possibly hiding a roadside bomb. The pilot then safely guided the Soldiers around it.

“Just to see the helicopters fly overhead,” he said, “it was something that gave you a lot of confidence to know that somebody’s up there watching over everything.”

As fighting intensified during the deployment, Dean said many Soldiers would still require a medical evacuation, including his battle buddies.

Dean and his unit were on a patrol when one of their vehicles hit an anti-tank mine, causing it to flip over. Two of the Soldiers inside the vehicle were badly wounded but would survive after being quickly flown by helicopter to a medical facility.

Despite his fear of heights, Dean said he aspired to be a pilot after that so he could be there for other Soldiers if needed.

Following flight school, Dean was initially assigned to an aviation unit at Fort Riley, Kansas, that mainly transported dignitaries. But he said he fought to get transferred to a “dust-off” medevac unit and served two more combat tours, where he assisted in numerous lifesaving missions.

“Having been on the ground where we needed medevac, I knew how important it was when I was flying it,” he said. “It’s an incredibly important mission.”

Big presence

Standing at 6 feet, 3 inches tall, the burly-sized Dean is easily recognizable wherever he goes.

His contributions have also been significant for the aviation battalion here, which conducts general support operations across the U.S. Army Pacific region.

“He is probably one of the most genuinely honest and outgoing people that I’ve ever met,” said Chief Warrant Officer 4 Jake Schmidt, the battalion aviation standardization pilot and senior warrant officer.

“He just has that presence that more or less attracts people to him, especially here in Japan where he is quite bigger than everybody else,” he said, smiling. “Naturally, people like to gravitate toward him.”

Dean, 46, who is an avid hiker, has climbed Mount Fuji seven times in the past three years, and many of those trips he organized to help friends and co-workers scale Japan’s tallest mountain.

As an aviation mission survivability officer, Dean has also trained tactics to crew members on how to safely fly Black Hawks against different threats.

“He is the subject-matter expert when it comes to that and guides us through all that training,” Schmidt said.

While in the cockpit, Dean had the opportunity to support earthquake disaster relief exercises and assault training with Japan Ground Self-Defense Force units.

Schmidt, who was in the same class of Warrant Officer Candidate School as Dean in 2008, said it was great to see a familiar face when he arrived at the battalion a year ago.

“He is going to be missed for sure around here,” Schmidt said. “He does so much stuff for us.”

And during those stressful times, Dean could always be counted on to help lighten the mood thanks to his contagious laugh, Schmidt said.

“To have that relationship with other people that you work with,” he said, “it just goes a long way to making your job more enjoyable.”

Next chapter

Before he officially retires, Dean plans to participate in the Career Skills Program, which allows Soldiers transitioning out of the Army to learn a new trade and improve their civilian employment options.

Like the job change he previously made in the Army, from combat arms to aviation, his next career move will also veer in a new direction.

Dean said he will return to his home state of New Hampshire to do an apprenticeship to learn how to be a blacksmith, a hobby of his that he started in high school.

While it will be his first foray into trying the profession full time, his motive to pursue it remains the same — to help others.

Once fully certified, he hopes to instruct lessons on blacksmithing at retreats that support former military members dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“I would like teach them another trade or something else they can try out,” he said.

Life after the Army will be bittersweet for Dean. While he jokingly said he looks forward to no more slideshow briefings, he will miss the camaraderie with his teammates.

“I will definitely stay in touch with as many as I can,” he said. “That’s the hardest part about leaving is not having them around.”

But his departure from the Army will also open the door to a new adventure in his lifelong journey.

“I don’t look at it as an ending,” he said, “but more as ‘on to the next chapter.’”

FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. — Screaming Eagle Division Soldiers here just completed training and testing the Army’s 6.8mm family of Next Generation Squad Weapon-Rifle (NGSW-R), NGSW-Automatic Rifle (AR) and the NGSW-Fire Control (FC) systems.

Troops of Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and members of 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, undertook New Equipment Training on the NGSW.

""The New Equipment Training gave the Soldiers a good base before coming out and using the NGSWs,” said Infantryman Sgt. Jack Scott, a team leader in Alpha Company.

Their training covered the similarities and differences between the new weapons and the legacy 5.56mm M4A1 Carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon systems, focusing on enhanced lethality.

“We did a lot of training with both static and maneuver ranges, so the product of Soldier you get now, during the live fire, is high quality due to all of that training,” added Scott.

Once complete with new equipment training, Soldiers tested the NGSW in a Limited User Test, or LUT, in a crawl-walk-run method to ensure all operational data is collected on the weapon, as well as user integration with the new equipment.

Alpha Company and 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment initially conducted static qualification and variable distance ranges with legacy weapon systems and NGSW, to compare performance of both and give Soldiers repetitions and familiarity with the NGSW.

Alpha Company 1st Sgt. Justin Babb appreciated the benefits of participating in an operational test and the opportunity for his junior Soldier’s feedback to contribute and impact Army modernization.

“The candid feedback that the Soldiers and NCOs provided during focus groups and surveys will provide the Army with perspective from the lowest level of user that will actually use the system,” said Babb.

Major differences between the legacy M4, M249 systems and the NGSWs were immediately noticeable by the Soldiers.

Spec. Maximiliano Arguindegui, an automatic rifleman with 1/75th Ranger Regiment, said, ""Overall, I feel faster with the M249, but I prefer the NGSW-AR because it makes me more lethal.""

Scott added, ""Stopping power with the 6.8 round is a big improvement compared to the M4 and M249 and having the ability to use with or without the suppressor is a huge feature for the support by fire element.""

Leaders of Alpha Company also said participating in a test with the Operational Test Command enabled them to get after their internal readiness.

Alpha Company Commander, Capt. Jordan Mares, said, “Being a part of the NGSW test absolutely supported our company readiness. The LUT gave us opportunities to hone our craft, practice lessons learned with feedback from subject-matter experts, and the ability to conduct a lot of repetitions to practice small unit tactics.""

Staff Sgt. Ivan Alvarez, a Squad Leader with Alpha Company, was initially skeptical of the NGSW.

""When we first started the LUT, I was very against the NGSW-R,” he said. “I'm used to the M4 — it's lighter — I'm used to the recoil, the engagements, everything the M4 has to offer. But, as we went through the LUT with the NGSW-R, I can see the capabilities that it brings to an infantryman, especially at a longer distance.""

Alvarez also said testing the new weapons gave his squad added training opportunities.

""We got after a lot of training that we would normally have to wait months to set up and accomplish,” he said. “We were able to get more marksmanship time, more range time, and were able to train under various environmental conditions.""

Another squad leader with the Rangers provided his observations on the training benefit while participating in an operational test.

“We were able to get reps in on a new weapon system as well as our legacy equipment,” said Sgt. Joseph Martin. “We were able to train on many basic things that we want to train on every year, but condensed to get more repetitions, as well as live fire iterations for our younger, inexperienced Soldiers.”

SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — When he returned from a tour in Iraq as the commander of the Oregon National Guard’s 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team in 2009, then-Army Col. Daniel Hokanson saw how the unit’s 3,500 personnel returned to their communities.

“We brought the fabric of America to the war because there are no active-duty bases in Oregon, they came from every corner of the state,” said Hokanson, the Guard Bureau chief. “They were teachers, police officers, firemen … and they deployed. Then they came back to their community, and they showed, look, you can do this. You can serve and you can go back and reintegrate into your communities.”

At the 2023 Reagan National Defense Forum — an annual gathering of national security and defense leaders — Hokanson spoke about recruiting and readiness and listened to remarks from key leaders.

During his keynote address, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III painted the backdrop of the current global environment as “challenging,” citing “the major conflicts facing our fellow democracies, Israel and Ukraine; bullying and coercion from an increasingly assertive China; and a worldwide battle between democracy and autocracy.”

“And let me be blunt about our mission,” Austin said. “The U.S. military is here to win our country’s wars — and to win them decisively. We will always try to deter conflict. But if we have to defend our country, we will fight — and we will win.”

On the recruiting front, the DoD is in competition with corporate America for the same talent pool, especially in high-tech areas like cyber defense and space. This issue was heightened in the wake of the pandemic. Employers have been offering incentives once unique to the military, including education benefits and healthcare packages.

In the 2023 Reagan National Defense Forum survey — a public opinion poll — about half of the respondents would encourage a friend or family member to join the military for reasons of patriotism, service and honor. More than 20% responded that a key point to discourage service is that it’s too dangerous and not worth the risks.

Hokanson joined U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Under Secretary of the Army Gabriel O. Camarillo, and Karl Rove to discuss these issues on the “Celebrating and Encouraging Service: How to Boost Recruitment and Ensure Readiness” panel.

Camarillo acknowledged recruiting as a long-term challenge for the Army. The service announced a major overhaul of its recruiting operations in October.

“This is the biggest transformation since the all-volunteer force was established in 1975,” Camarillo said of Army recruiting, citing increased prospecting and marketing and a revamped recruiting workforce to closer resemble Fortune 500 companies.

Hokanson sees recruiting as a tactical matter with strategic implications.

The Guard is 20% of the joint force funded at 4% of the defense budget. With about 430,000 members, it is the second largest military organization after the Army. There are eight full Army divisions and 90 Air wings within the Guard.

Hokanson emphasized that the National Guard exists to fight and win America’s wars as the Army and Air Force combat reserve. He noted that many Guardsmen either joined or renewed their commitment to serve after 9/11, with an expectation to deploy or mobilize overseas.

He said Guardsmen bring “a treasure trove” of experience and expertise.

The Air National Guard won big in September’s Air Force William Tell fighter competition. The Vermont Guard’s 158th Wing earned the title of top F-35 Wing, along with other individual awards.

Four Army National Guard sniper teams emerged as the best contenders in the 2023 International Sniper Competition, and all finished in the top 10, with the Guard taking first place.

The Guard is also at the forefront of future warfighting domains. The Army Guard has more than 1,095 Soldiers working in cyber units. There are more than 11,500 Airmen assigned to Air Force cyber specialty codes in the Air Guard.

In September, Hokanson presented a joint Guard cyber team with the 2022 SANS NetWars Department of Defense Services Cup, marking the third consecutive year the Guard team has won the cybersecurity competition.

“These Soldiers and Airmen embody the best of the Guard: experts in their civilian jobs who use their skills to serve their states and nation,” he said.

This warfighting posture enables the Guard to perform the most visible of its missions.

“Because we’re manned, trained and equipped to do arguably the most difficult task there is,” Hokanson said, “you can ask us to do almost anything within the local communities, and we will be there immediately to respond.

“We provide Guardsmen the opportunity to respond to their communities in times of need.”

Other panelists echoed the appeal of serving in the Guard.

“Because the [Guard] mission is right in front of you,” Cramer said, “you’re helping your neighbors during a flood or rescuing people in a snowstorm. And I think that does resonate.”

The CNGB spoke of the value and flexibility the Guard offers its members to serve as part-time Citizen-Soldiers or -Airmen.

“Many of our Guardsmen are college students because they can go to school and serve at the same time,” Hokanson said. “Another great advantage is if you’re from Des Moines, Iowa, or Medford, Oregon, and your family’s there and you want to live there, we offer you the opportunity to do all that.”

Still, Hokanson said the Guard is focused on connecting with the groups that have little or no association with the military.

He encourages Guardsmen to tell the story of the Guard, which includes almost 7.5 million personnel days supporting combatant commands at home and around the world. Last year, more than 8,500 people were rescued from disasters, and four countries were added to the 100-nation Department of Defense National Guard State Partnership Program.

A Pentagon data point says that 78% of those who entered military service had an immediate family member, friend or relative in the military.

“The difficult thing is, if you’ve not had contact with somebody in the military, and if you get your perception of the military from what you see on the news or the stuff that grabs headlines, you could have potentially a negative view of it,” Hokanson said.

“But those that actually know servicemembers realize there are great advantages and incredible opportunities,” he said.

The Guard has seen steady improvement in recruiting new members since the disruption of the pandemic, while retention is at historically high levels. Hokanson summarized some of his key initiatives to continue these trends.

“No-cost healthcare for our Guardsmen, the same incentive pay as active-component Soldiers and Airmen and duty status reform,” he said. “And our whole goal is for every Guardsman to have two retirements: their National Guard and civilian retirement.""

We want to show the value of serving our country and the long-term payback for you and your family,” he said.

LATHAM, New York – The New York Army National Guard’s 53rd Troop Command welcomed back a commander during a unit change of command ceremony held Sunday, Dec. 3, 2023, at the National Guard state headquarters.

Brig. Gen. Jack James, who commanded the 53rd Troop Command from 2019 to 2021, took over from Brig. Gen. Joseph Biehler, who replaced James in command in 2021. James had been serving as a deputy division commander for the 42nd Infantry Division.

Biehler has been selected to take command of the 42nd Infantry Division in the coming year.

Biehler, a veteran of deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait, said all credit for his success as a commander of the 53rd belong to the Soldiers of the unit.

“Truth be told, this was an excellent unit when I took command two years ago, and it remains an excellent unit today,” Biehler said. “The leaders and Soldiers made this job incredibly easy for me.”

James is an Army aviator who led the command from 2019-2021 and prior to that, led the 42nd Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade.

According to Maj. Gen. Ray Shields, the adjutant general for New York, who presided over the ceremony, James accepted the assignment without hesitation.

“I’m sure you never expected to be coming back to command the 53rd again,” Shields said to James. “When faced with finding a replacement for Biehler as the commanding general, only one name came to mind – Jack James.”

“I can’t thank you enough for accepting command of the 53rd for a second time so readily, and I know your leadership will ensure success of the 53rd and the New York Army National Guard,” Shields said.

James said that he was anxious to get to work alongside the Soldiers of the 53rd Troop Command again.

“I am grateful for this opportunity to continue to serve our New York National Guard and our fellow Soldiers in this position of responsibility,” James said.

“What an incredible honor – to command American Soldiers. I will not let you down,” James added.

Biehler is expected to take command of the 42nd Infantry Division headquarters in the new year as the unit prepares for mobilization and deployment in 2025 to the Middle East.

“Your experience makes you the ideal person for the role as the next division commander,” Shields said to Biehler. “You are the right leader for this upcoming deployment. It is a big job ahead, but we know that you’re up to it.”

Biehler, a Finance Director for L3 Harris Technologies in Rochester in his civilian career, told the formation of Soldiers that his leadership role with the unit was meaningful to him.

“It has been an honor to lead the 53rd Troop Command,” Biehler said. “There is no comparison in the civilian world than being a commander in an Army unit,” he said.",

APPLETON, Wis. - One hundred and five years after the horrific battle that caused his wounds, a Wisconsin National Guard veteran received his Purple Heart medal at a ceremony Nov. 11 at Outagamie County Courthouse.

Pvt. George C. Arts, a member of Company I, 127th Infantry Regiment, was wounded Aug. 4, 1918 during the Second Battle of the Marne. The 32nd Division, composed of Wisconsin National Guard and Michigan National Guard Soldiers, had just arrived from the trenches of Alsace, Germany, to be part of the assault on the heavily fortified town of Fismes.

The 32nd began its advance Aug. 2, 1918, and gained 15 kilometers in two days of fierce fighting. The 127th moved on the town of Fismes on Aug, 4, capturing the town despite suffering horrific losses.

“In those eight days, some of the best German divisions put up a terrific fight to stem the advance,” Lt. Col. Byron Beveridge wrote in his historical sketch of the Wisconsin National Guard.

Capt. Paul Schmidt, commander of Company C of the 127th Infantry, wrote that the Germans spared no effort to make Fismes impregnable.

“Huge stores of ammunition and engines of destruction were located here,” Schmidt said, “and preparations made to withstand the most formidable attack.”

During the bloody fighting that day, Gen. Pairron de Mondesir, commander of the 38th French Corps, observed the American troops in combat against the Germans. When he learned that the 32nd Division had taken all the German strong positions to the north of the Ourcq and had dug in and were holding their ground, he exclaimed, “Oui, Oui, les soldats terrible, tres bien, tres bien!” In English, that translates to “Yes, yes, terrible soldiers, very good, very good!”

The meaning of Mondesir’s use of the word “terrible” is “terrifying” or “formidable,” and his appraisal of the 32nd Division resulted in an official citation giving the division the nom de guerre of Les Terribles. The 32nd Division was the only American division to receive a nickname from an allied nation during the war.

Arts was one of thousands of Division Soldiers wounded in the assault by machine gun fire and gas artillery shells, suffering a fractured left knee and a bullet wound to his right hip. He was hospitalized in Europe for six months. In March 1919, he arrived at Fort Dodge, Iowa, for additional medical treatment. In August 1920, Arts was honorably discharged at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, with a medical rating of poor.

The U.S. military did not issue Purple Hearts at this time for battlefield injuries, but Arts was authorized to wear the American Expeditionary Force wound chevron to indicate he was wounded in combat. After the Purple Heart was reinstated in 1932, wounded veterans of any U.S. military campaign could apply for this award. However, Arts continued to suffer from complications of his wounds and died on Dec. 10, 1928, at the age of 35.

“If George received the wound chevron and sustained such injuries, why did he not receive the Purple Heart?” Kim Craddock of the Fox Valley Veterans Council asked during the Nov. 11 ceremony.

U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher’s office became involved, and after contacting the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, was able to confirm Arts’ eligibility for the Purple Heart medal in less than three weeks.

“Congressman Gallagher and I and the rest of our staff could not be more happy to collaborate and serve in this instance,” said staff member Kerry Niemceke. “The result is a fitting reminder to all in our community of the sacrifice of our veterans and to the sacrifice of the family members who wish to remember them.”

Mike Muthig, Arts’ grandson, said the approval process likely was aided because the family had kept his documents. He said there was always a strong family connection with his grandfather.

“I have always known my middle name was from him, and I've always felt a connection even though I never met him,” Muthig said. “When my mother passed, the name George Cornelius Arts was the last words she spoke on this Earth. And she never knew her father either, because he passed when she was only 17 months old.

“I promised my mother that people would remember the name George Arts,” Muthig continued. “To me the presentation of the award of the Purple Heart to the family was both the fulfilling of a promise and the completion after 105 years of appropriate recognition of extraordinary sacrifice.”

Command Sgt. Maj. Ryan Johnson, the current senior enlisted leader of the 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry Regiment, presented the medal to Muthig at the ceremony. Johnson is also a Purple Heart recipient for wounds suffered during his deployment to Iraq in 2004-05.

“We felt it was fitting, with me being a recipient,” Johnson explained, “as well as being the current command sergeant major for the 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry, which was the battalion Pvt. Arts fought with.”

The Fox Valley Veterans Council also presented the family with a replica of Arts’ wound chevron.

MACAPA, Brazil — Forty-four Soldiers from the New York National Guard, working alongside active-duty Army and Brazilian Army Soldiers, recently concluded three weeks of training in Northern Brazil from Nov. 1 to 16, 2023.

Exercise Southern Vanguard 24 brought Soldiers from the 258th Field Artillery Battalion, 466th Medical Company, Area Support, the 133rd Composite Support Company, the 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment and 138th Public Affairs Detachment to the cities of Belem, Macapa and Oiapoque.

The New York National Guard Soldiers learned how to survive in the Brazilian jungle and participated in and supported tactical operations and training while providing medical support to Soldiers during the exercise.

New York Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Isabel Smith, director of joint staff for the New York National Guard, explained that this training operation helped prepare both countries for rapid deployment and improved readiness in response to crisis or contingency.

“Exercising together allows our armies to increase interoperability and demonstrates a shared commitment,” Smith said.

New York has worked alongside Brazil through the National Guard’s State Partnership Program since 2019, executing bilateral military and civilian engagements in order to increase partner capacity and capability, Smith said.

The New York Guardsmen trained alongside Soldiers from U.S. Army South, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), the 7th Special Forces Group and the 1st Security Forces Assistance Brigade, as well as over 1,000 Brazilian army personnel assigned to Brazil’s 52nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Brigade.

New York Army National Guard Maj. Shelly Respecki, commander of the 466th, said she believed that the opportunity to learn about the jungle from the Brazilian Army was an invaluable experience from a medical perspective.

The unit provided medical support and supply throughout the exercise and treated a variety of injuries such as heat-related illnesses, environmental threats and emergency trauma, Respecki said.

“The course allows our Soldiers to understand what threats and risks are involved with training in the jungle,” said Respecki. “We’ll be better able to treat the participants knowing what they’re going through and how to survive in the jungle if needed to potentially sit on a patient.”

While they learned to operate in a new environment, they found a sense of familiarity in some of their missions as well, the Soldiers said.

Guardsmen from the 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment integrated with the 23rd Jungle Infantry Brigade’s staff section for the duration of the exercise to support operations.

The public affairs Soldiers from the 138th supported media relations in conjunction with Army South counterparts, according to Capt. Stephanie Fernadez, the detachment commander.

The four artillerymen from the 258th Field Artillery, spent a lot of time with Brazilian gunners, according to Capt. Anthony Migliore, the assistant battalion fire support officer for the 258th’s B. Battery.

“I spent most of my time at the gun-line yesterday and it was just like being back at A Battery or B Battery with the 258th,"" Migliore said.

He provided fires planning support for a scenario involving attacks on enemy objectives, during the exercise, Migliore said.

Spc. Myeonghyeon Chang, a water treatment specialist from the 133rd, said she got a lot of experience working in her specialty during the exercise.

“It’s been a really great experience for me, especially since this is my first time being in a Latin American country,” she said.

Chang said she and others from the 133rd provided pure water for both Brazilian and American exercise participants. They also got the change to cross-trained on the 7th Special Forces Group’s water purification equipment.

Ultimately, Southern Vanguard provided Soldiers with more than just training, as they returned to New York having formed new relationships and fresh perspectives, and also got a chance to experience Brazilian culture, the Soldiers said.

“I had a lot of opportunities to learn about their culture, language and how the Brazilian Army works and operates. The food was definitely great too,” Chang said.",

JOINT FORCES TRAINING CENTER CAMP SHELBY, Miss. – The 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, conducted annual training between July 23 and Aug. 4, 2023, and participated in Titan Warrior 23.

Titan Warrior 23 is an Army Reserve, multinational, multifunctional, military police exercise with a detention operations focus. The 290th Military Police Brigade, 200th Military Police Command hosted the exercise. Approximately 900 Soldiers participated this year.

The battalion’s training included mobilization and deployment exercises that took the unit from Joint Base San Antonio, Texas, to Camp Shelby, Miss.

Upon arrival at Titan Warrior, Soldiers conducted interrogations and debriefings at a newly established expeditionary Joint Interrogation Debriefing Center. The battalion staff also rehearsed interfaces required to operate alongside military police units conducting detention operations missions.

The 304th and 160th Military Police Battalions, 290th Military Police Brigade, 200th Military Police Command operated Camp Bobcat, a simulated theater detention facility, while other units established detainee holding areas. There military intelligence Soldiers supported screening, questioning and interrogations of role players. Rehearsing shared custody and control of detainees is a critical skill.

Soldiers and officers from the 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion, 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command, participated in simulated interrogation operations and worked alongside the 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation) within the Joint Interrogation Debriefing Center.

U.S. Army Capt. Victoria Martin, assigned to the 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion, said that the training was well-planned and enhanced their comprehension of interrogation operations. “The training reinforced our understanding of JIDC operations and brought our home station training into perspective,” said Martin.

The training provided context to military intelligence task training previously conducted at home-station. Interrogators divided into shifts, which added realism. Contracted role players received intensive and detailed instruction that provided necessary cues during interrogations. Each session ended after Soldiers received feedback from role players and observer controller-trainers.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), through its Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) initiative, contributed an artificial intelligence surveillance system to oversee and manage detainees during Titan Warrior 23. This collaboration offered valuable insight into the integration of artificial intelligence within current detainee operations and intelligence doctrine.

URSA cameras and sensors mounted to robots, patrolled the camp exterior and monitored role player interactions. Military intelligence Soldiers and the military police were then able to glean valuable information regarding interpersonal associations inside of a detention facility. This cutting-edge AI solution supports possible modernization priorities within multiple fields.

Military intelligence Soldiers also received opportunities to train alongside soldiers from Canada and Belgium. The multinational contingent participated in detention facility operations.

U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Tenay Benes, battalion commander of the 338th Military Intelligence Battalion, said, ""The opportunity to test our screening, interrogation, debriefing, and interviewing tactics with our military police partners has proven to be invaluable. As a result of this exercise, we have discovered opportunities for increased collaboration and better coordination.” Benes elaborated, “We've also had a lot of Army fun here - riding helicopters, working with detainees, and playing with robots!""

The 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation) is a deployable interrogation battalion assigned to the Military Intelligence Readiness Command’s Interrogation Group. The unit is headquartered in San Antonio Texas.",

MARIETTA, Ga. - More than 80 Soldiers of the Georgia National Guard’s 201st Regional Support Group Forward returned home Dec. 1 after a nearly year-long deployment to Europe. Soldiers and family members were reunited during a welcome home ceremony at the Clay National Guard Center in Marietta.

“You represent the very best of our nation,” said Maj. Gen. Dwayne Wilson, commander of the Georgia Army National Guard. “All of you have performed in an exceptional manner over the last 10 months.”

During their deployment, the Soldiers of the 201st RSG supported base operations for more than 60,000 personnel at multiple stations throughout Europe. Their mobilization was part of a rotation of U.S. military forces that conduct multinational training and operations with allies to build regional security.

“You had a very challenging mission and a very unique mission, providing support to nine forward operating sites across four countries … delivering unparalleled support to U.S. and NATO forces,” said Wilson. “Our forces in Europe are more capable because of you, and our world is safer because of you.”

The 201st RSG comprises a diverse group of units with specialty response missions, supporting overseas combat and domestic emergency response operations.

The 201st RSG has deployed units and personnel multiple times since its 2004 organization. Soldiers of the 201st mobilized to Afghanistan from 2011-2012 and 2013-2014. In 2018, Soldiers of the 201st mobilized to Iraq, serving as base operating support integrator for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve. Subordinate units of the 201st RSG have also supported operations in Korea and Egypt.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, more than 30,000 Citizen-Soldiers and Citizen-Airmen of the Georgia National Guard have deployed to support overseas missions.

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – The first-ever Okinawa Care for Caregivers Symposium was recently held at Torii Station to better inform those who help others of the self-care resources available to them.

The symposium, which the 10th Support Group’s unit ministry team hosted, focused on providing self-care tools to Army, Navy and Air Force religious support teams, while allowing them to collaborate with various enablers on Okinawa and discuss ideas on how to stay resilient.

“This joint and interoperability effort enhances readiness by equipping our UMTs and enablers to connect our Soldiers to the valuable resources in the community,” said Chaplain (Maj.) Neal Muasa, the lead organizer.

About 25 individuals participated in the event, including Col. J.P. Smith, command chaplain for U.S. Army Japan, and Lt. Col. Damon Saxton, chaplain for U.S. Army Garrison Japan.

Smith said a similar event may be held at Camp Zama in the future to ensure its community of enablers can come together.

“We always take care of Soldiers, and we always take care of families, but what do we do to take care of ourselves?” he said. “If we’re not taking care of ourselves, we’re going to be in a position where we’re burned out, we’re tired and we’re not able to give Soldiers our best.”

In the recent event, which took place Oct. 24 through 27, Saxton conducted training and led an interbranch, multidiscipline panel discussion on self-care for helping professionals.

Saxton, who previously served in a special operations unit, said the topic was very close to him, as caregivers can sometimes endure trauma vicariously when they see or hear the effects of it.

“I had heard some really tough things and had a couple of guys that had taken their own lives because of some of the experiences that they had,” he said. “And it was really hard, and I had to seek help from another caregiver to kind of get me back in the fight.”

By sharing his own story, Saxton hoped to convince others to seek assistance when needed.

“I wanted to make sure that everybody there, as they experience these challenging situations that we do in the field of caregiving, that they take care of themselves and each other,” he said.

Saxton said he appreciated how the UMTs on Okinawa brought everyone together for the event, which also had a kayaking physical training session led by the 1st Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group chaplain and a devotional by the 78th Signal Battalion chaplain.

The symposium concluded with remarks by the 10th SG commander, followed by a visit to the historic Hacksaw Ridge during a tour of Battle of Okinawa sites.

“These are all different units, but they all take care of each other,” Saxton said. “I think every time that we get the opportunity to work together, to see each other’s strengths, [being able] to build those relationships is absolutely key.”

Throughout the event, Smith said UMTs shared best practices for self-care and interacted with each other and with military and family life counselors, behavioral health specialists and other enablers in the area.

“We were able to basically learn from one another,” he said. “If you’re operating in isolation, you’re only understanding one perspective. We were able to hear from multiple perspectives, so when we walk away, we walk away with new tools on how to better care for ourselves.”

One of the lessons learned that was discussed was using a journal to take time to intentionally reflect on one’s work being accomplished.

“As long as we know that we are being value-added and we’re making a difference, it kind of keeps you energized,” Smith said. “But you’ve got to reflect on that, because otherwise we’re just on the go. We have to slow it down every now and then and process through the difference that it is actually making.”

Smith also suggested having breaks throughout the workday to reduce stress. He said he may take three to four short breaks, in addition to a lunch break, to walk around, breathe and relax.

“It’s all about staying sharp,” he said. “You’d be surprised at how well you will end up being when you do certain things like that [and] put certain mechanisms in place for yourself to where you stay sharp.”

STUTTGART, Germany - U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Steven Basham, U.S. European Command deputy commander, hosted Arnold Kammel, secretary general of the Austrian Ministry of Defense, and his staff at the command’s headquarters Nov. 30.

The meeting, aimed at identifying areas for future military cooperation, builds on a broadening relationship after Austria and the Vermont National Guard formalized their partnership under the State Partnership Program in 2022.

“Today’s meeting was another important step toward strengthening our relationship with a longstanding partner in Austria,” said Basham. “Our strategic partnership with Austria already includes cooperation for military mobility, information exchanges and military-to-military engagements through the State Partnership Program. We look forward to furthering our mutual commitment to realize a shared vision for European security.”

The two nations’ military-to-military engagement has steadily increased since the SPP partnership, including an air exchange in June in which the Vermont Air National Guard flew F-35s alongside Austrian Eurofighter Typhoons at Hinterstoisser Air Base near Zeltweg, Austria.

“Relations with the USA are of particular importance to Austria. The deepening of the strategic partnership with the USA, anchored in the Austrian government program and the growing State Partnership Program, underline this fact,” said Kammel. “As one of the key players in global security and defense policy, the USA is also relevant for Austria in other areas. Today’s talks mark a further point in the strengthening of joint cooperation.”

Cooperation between the United States and Austria has also included participation in the European Union’s Permanent Structured Cooperation program, enabling the movement of military personnel and assets within EU borders. That intra-European movement is pivotal to the U.S. ability to conduct military exercises and operations.

The State Partnership Program pairs National Guard units with allied and partner militaries to facilitate cooperation across all aspects of international civil-military affairs. The program has been successfully building relations for 30 years and now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe.

WASHINGTON — For the second straight year, first lady Jill Biden welcomed National Guardsmen, spouses and children to the White House to discuss their challenges and how best to support them.

The first lady heard stories of the pride and resilience children show in the face of frequent calls for their Guard parents to serve their nation, state and community.

“Our National Guardsmen and women have to be ready to go on support missions at a moment’s notice,” she told them. “And that means that their kids — all of you — know what it’s like to have your mom or your dad missing at the dinner table every time they’re called to duty.

“And you do it with humility and honor,” she said. “I want you to know that my husband, President Biden, and I are so grateful and so proud of all of you. We know it isn’t easy.”

Since 9/11, more than 1 million Guardsmen have deployed in support of operations around the globe. Because the National Guard is the combat reserve of the Army and Air Force, its members are trained and equipped to help with first-response efforts at home during a crisis.

Today, the Guard stands at more than 430,000 members strong. As the second largest military organization in the Department of Defense, its mission, motto and promise to America is to be Always Ready, Always There.

The National Guard is in about 2,800 communities — almost every ZIP code. Most Guardsmen serve part-time and balance their service with civilian careers and family responsibilities.

Kelly Hokanson, the National Guard senior spouse and mother of three service members, told the group that growing up as a military child is a sacrifice and a gift. Kelly’s husband, Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, is the 29th chief of the National Guard Bureau.

Gen. Hokanson has served in duty stations across the United States and deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.

“It’s a sacrifice of time with your family — a sacrifice every member of our community shares,” Kelly Hokanson said. “But it’s also a gift. A gift of compassion, service and unfathomable strength and resilience.”

Caleb Greico, 14, a New Jersey native, attended the event with his parents and sister, Penelope. He introduced Jill Biden to the group, a responsibility he relished.

“Thank you for inviting me and my family to the White House,” Caleb told her. “We are very honored to be here with you.

“It’s not just my family, but everyone here has a family member that has been contributing to this country.”

Caleb’s mom, Army Spc. Laura Greico, a signal support systems specialist assigned to Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 113th Infantry Regiment, 44th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, New Jersey National Guard, is preparing to deploy with her unit.

Caleb asked other children for advice on how to cope with a parent being gone for an extended time. Staying active and connected in community circles were common themes from those whose parents have deployed or been away for long durations.

“Focus on the stuff you enjoy and work on yourself,” said Aiden Buckner, 14, from New Mexico.

Aiden’s dad, Air Force Capt. Thomas Buckner, is the deputy commander of the New Mexico Guard’s 150th Civil Engineering Squadron.

“Try your best to work and focus on your goals,” Aiden said.

Eight-year-old Marina Munyabuhoro immigrated to America from a refugee camp in East Africa with her parents when she was 11 months old. Her father, Airman 1st Class Theogene Munyabuhoro, joined the New Hampshire National Guard and became an American citizen.

Marina told the first lady she wants to serve in the military “to honor my father’s legacy and to be a symbol of hope … and a good example to other immigrant kids.

And to protect and defend this blessed country.”

The president and first lady are familiar with National Guard service: their son, the late Army Maj. Beau Biden, served in the Delaware Guard, leaving behind his children to deploy on a tour in Iraq. It’s part of why Jill Biden helped establish Joining Forces to support service members, veterans and those they hold most dear.

She encouraged the children in attendance to share with their teachers, coaches and influential people in their lives that their parents serve.

“As a teacher, I ask my class, ‘Is anybody here militarily connected and what are your connections?’” she said. “That helps me to understand that they might be going through a rough patch or might be absent for a day.”

Guard leaders and families — more than 200 representing 36 states and territories — attended the event, which included a holiday presentation and the first lady’s unveiling of the 2023 White House “Magic, Wonder & Joy” holiday theme and decorations.

“We are grateful for everyone’s support of our National Guard families and especially of the children who are central to so many of our members’ lives and service,” Gen. Hokanson said. “We could not do what we do without the support of our families.”

VICENZA, Italy - In an effort to strengthen partnership and promote stability across the African continent, U.S. Army Reserve Civil Affairs Soldiers have embarked on a series of nine-month rotations, deploying in support of U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), to execute vital missions.

Civil Affairs Soldiers, often referred to as the ""bridge builders"" of the U.S. Army, play a crucial role in facilitating communication and cooperation between military forces and local communities. Their missions span a wide range of activities, from humanitarian assistance to civil-military projects. These skilled individuals serve as liaisons between the SETAF-AF and African partners, ultimately fostering goodwill and mutual understanding.

“We are a collection of Soldiers from across America, brought together to do this very important mission,” said Capt. Cody Miller, officer-in-charge of the SETAF-AF forward-deployed Civil-Military Operations Center. “Our companies are broken up into several small, 4-6 Soldier teams deployed throughout the continent of Africa. These teams interface directly with the civilian populations with the goal of strengthening partnerships.”

SETAF-AF provides U.S. Africa Command and U.S. Army Europe & Africa a dedicated headquarters to synchronize Army activities in Africa and scalable crisis response options throughout Africa and Europe. A key component to their success is to employ the experience and versatility of Army Reserve and Army National Guard units to execute missions across the African continent.

During their deployments, the civil affairs Soldiers assigned to SETAF-AF are actively engaged in African communities. They collaborate with local authorities, non-governmental organizations, and international partners to address critical issues. Such projects may include improving healthcare infrastructure, supporting educational initiatives, or aiding in disaster relief efforts. By doing so, they not only provide immediate relief, but also help communities become more self-sufficient and resilient in the long term.

""Africa is a continent of incredible diversity, and every country’s mission set is a unique challenge. I've seen firsthand how our work benefits African partners. It's about mutual respect and understanding, and when we can help a community achieve its goals, it's an incredible feeling,"" said Capt. Dominique Mosbly, SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Team 21 chief.

The majority of the U.S. Army’s civil affairs capability exists within the Army Reserve. These Soldiers serve part-time, typically one weekend a month and two-weeks a year. When not in an Army uniform, they work as police officers, business professionals, medical providers and school teachers, among many other professions. The SETAF-AF civil affairs teams harness these civilian expertise and skill sets to execute the mission.

""We employ a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach in our efforts to increase the region's security and stability. We integrate multiple host nation, US, and international partners into our work, which includes countering violent extremist organizations and helping build host nation institutional capacity,” said Maj. Jacqueline Li, Bravo Company Commander for the SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Battalion.

“As Army Reservists, the SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Soldiers bring a wealth of knowledge and experience from their civilian backgrounds that greatly assists them in their missions. This deployment is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and the Soldiers of Bravo Company are honored to be working with our West African partners,"" added Li.

Lt. Col. James A. Favuzzi, SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Battalion commander, provides guidance and oversight to the many civil affairs teams operating in Africa. For Favuzzi, the importance of these missions cannot be understated.

""Our Soldiers play a pivotal role in the effective execution of SETAF-AF activities. Their interaction with African partners, as well as the information they provide on civilian populations on the continent significantly contributes to our African strategy,” Favuzzi said.

SETAF-AF civil affairs Soldiers conduct multiple missions on the African continent each year, executing numerous civil-military events in support of the SETAF-AF mission to build capacity and strengthen relationships with African partners.

103,103.0,103.0,Fort Cavazos officials take proactive approach to deter workplace violence,https://www.army.mil/article/272033/fort_cavazos_officials_take_proactive_approach_to_deter_workplace_violence,"FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Fort Cavazos is one of 17 installations set to implement a program that focuses more on a proactive than a reactive approach to avert acts of workplace violence.

Motivated by incidents of violence that have plagued the Department of Defense through the years, the DOD Insider Threat Management and Analysis Center deployed the Prevention, Assistance and Response program to address indicators and elements of workplace violence and violent behavior at its earliest instance to minimize risk, maintain unit readiness and reduce movement along the critical path.

The PAR program utilizes a multidiscipline approach through collaboration with trained professionals, integrated prevention experts and key stakeholders to develop tailored mitigation strategies intended to provide commanders and civilian leaders with an understanding of overall risk within their organizations and options to care for their personnel.

“I am excited about the opportunity to host such a positive initiative,” expressed Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander. “The command is deeply committed to ensuring a strong vibrant command climate where everyone is free to excel and a program focusing on reducing workplace violence at Fort Cavazos is perfectly in line with our philosophy.”

The program is being introduced in three phases. The first focused on deploying PAR cadre to installations, establishing business rules and processes and conducting coalition building. The second phase will educate and train community members and increase awareness. The final phase represents the full implementation.

Drew Hunnicutt, Fort Cavazos PAR program coordinator, explained that the program is currently in its second phase and that PAR program coordinators are here to assist the Army with its mission and provide guidance.

“The PAR mission is to coordinate with the commanders of units,” he shared, “as well as law enforcement, intelligence agencies and counterintelligence agencies to identify if something might be going wrong as soon as possible and to get the person help.”

Each aspect of the program utilizes environmental factors such as personal predispositions, stressors, concerning behavior and hostile actions to identify potentially aggressive behavior. The program incorporates a multi-tiered methodology to recognize early warning signs, escalation and further escalation.

Prevention focuses on the execution of policies, programs, training or practices that aim to prevent workplace violence and prohibited abusive or harmful acts through recognizing personal predispositions.

Assistance emphasizes actions taken at the earliest indication of stress to provide access to necessary services or treatment to mitigate further risk by categorizing a variety of everyday stressors.

Response refers to actions taken to stop the violent threat and mitigate any damages done by the aggressor through identifying concerning behaviors.

Hunnicutt explained that PAR will work similarly to organizations such as the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program, the Employee Assistance Program and the Family Advocacy Program.

He emphasized that PAR is not an independent program or process, but part of the larger integrated prevention effort that works within the same operating procedures as other prevention efforts.

“We’re not here to have a redundancy on top of what Fort Cavazos is already doing,” he said. “We’re here to make sure that there is the coordination and assist with how we can really get these things that we have in place to really work together to get people off the critical pathway to violence.”

Full operations of the PAR program are slated to begin in October 2025, and Fort Cavazos leadership is in full support of the initiative.

“A violence-free workplace is not only a fundamental requirement for our mission but also a reflection of our values and dedication to the men and women who serve under our command,” Stokes said. “This initiative demonstrates the commitment to maintaining a safe and secure environment for personnel, enhancing morale and ensuring mission readiness. My role is to fully support and actively participate in the implementation of the initiative, prioritizing the safety and well-being of our service members and our Department of the Army civilians.”",

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place officially opened its doors for the 2023 holiday season Thursday with a ribbon cutting ceremony.

Dozens gathered in the facility to celebrate all of the hard work that went into filling the workshop’s toy vault as well as the organization’s 25th anniversary.

Brig. Gen. Thomas Felty, III Armored Corps deputy commanding general of maneuver, stopped by the event to express the leadership’s support for Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place. He expressed his gratitude to the many donors and volunteers who helped to fill the vault with so many toys.

“I’ve got goosebumps thinking about it,” he said. “When our Soldiers come in here, with all the elves, and they get to pick out toys, they’re just overwhelmed with joy and happiness at the opportunity to present their kids all of these wonderful gifts. (The emotions are) overwhelming for these young families and so it is a really, really big deal.”

Marizza Stokes, president of Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place, shared that last year, the organization provided toys to more than 1,600 children, with more than 800 families applying. This year, 973 families applied to Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place, meaning the organization hopes to provide toys for around 2,000 children.

Stokes said donations have made their goal a reality and shared that the organization received the largest donation in its history from the Jack D. Levy American Legion Riders Post 573 totaling $56,000.

“This is the largest donation Santa’s Workshop has ever received and we don’t know how to thank you,” Stokes said before presenting representatives of the American Legion Riders with a Santa-shaped diamond donor plaque.

After acknowledging the many other donors and volunteers, guests were invited to the vault where Felty and Santa Claus himself cut the ribbon, officially opening the vault. The vault was filled with a plethora of toys for children in different age ranges. There are also sensory toys for children with special needs.

When asked how she felt seeing all of their hard work coming to fruition and large support from the community, Stokes was at a loss of words.

“We could not do the quality of toys that we do for all of our families without these donations,” she said. “When the families come through the first thing they say is, ‘Oh my goodness, these are … really amazing toys.’”

Once a family is approved, they come into the workshop and an elf is assigned to them, who takes them around the facility so they can choose stocking stuffers, two toys per child, one book per child and a family board game. Stokes shared that the total package per child totals near $125 retail value, which the families receive completely for free.

Stokes has also been able to witness the lasting impact that Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place has had on the families that it has helped.

“This past weekend we had Santa at the Spouse’s (Club) Holiday Bazaar, and it was a little fundraiser for us,” she shared. “There was a young spouse with three little ones and she was messing with her phone. I said, ‘Can I help you?’ She said, ‘I’m trying to donate. I don’t have cash.’ I said, ‘You don’t have to donate.” She said, ‘You don’t understand, you saved our Christmas last year.’ That’s why we do it.”

Stokes shared that the organization is still looking for elves to volunteer to help families pick out the best toys for their children. She expressed that none of this would be possible without volunteers and encourages those who are interested to apply.

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Hundreds of cars lined up Nov. 15 in the Main Post Chapel parking lot here to receive Thanksgiving meal baskets where eager volunteers waited to greet them.

More than 100 Soldiers partnered together to put together the baskets that helped so many families who are in need this holiday season.

Sgt. Jesus Vazquez, 89th Military Police Brigade, said the preparation process for this giveaway began in June and it felt awesome to see all of the hard work culminate into finally being able to hand the food off to families.

“Knowing that after four months of coordination, families are going to be able to have meals on their table — it’s a great feeling,” he said, “especially knowing we brought together 150 Soldiers to make this happen today.”

Vazquez noted that when most people think of what they would receive from a food bank they think of canned food, but the baskets being given away at the event contained fresh produce including corn, potatoes and onions.

“We took it to the next level, knowing that we’re putting food on the table … that people want to eat and want to get,” he said. “Not that the canned food is not good, we just had the opportunity to bring something a little bit better for families.”

As they entered the drive through, families received a basket full of fixings including stuffing, desserts and fresh produce, provided by the Central Texas Food Bank who donated more than 21,000 pounds of food.

Sari Vatske, president and chief executive officer of the Central Texas Food bank, said the organization has provided food for this event for more than a decade. She was excited to see so much joy and said the organization was thankful for the opportunity to partner with Fort Cavazos.

“The camaraderie and the smiles and the happiness that goes into the holidays is just palpable and there’s so much that our military does for us,” she said. “It’s so important to be able to do this year-round but particularly on the holiday. We want to make sure that everyone has a traditional, happy holiday meal.”

Next, the drivers moved on to “Turkeyville,” as it was called by the volunteers there who were handing out the staple part of a Thanksgiving meal.

Chaplain (Capt.) Christopher Smartt, 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, and volunteer in Turkeyville, said it was a privilege to hand out turkeys to families.

“It’s a privilege to hand these out and to watch their faces as they receive these (turkeys),” he said. “You don’t know what they’re going through so just to be able to be here today as a community to be able to bless them … has been fantastic.”

The volunteers in Turkeyville greeted each car with a smile and asked the drivers how they planned on cooking the bird. Smartt said the positive attitude could make all the difference in the world for the recipients.

“(For) families coming to receive a box of food, what we’re worried about is that somebody might feel intimidated by it or maybe apprehensive,” he shared. “So when they come by, we tell them, ‘Hey, thank you for coming by. We’re glad to see you and Happy Thanksgiving,’ just so we can release any of that (tension) and let them know that we’re just glad that they’re here and that we hope (they) have a great Thanksgiving.”

He added that it was heartwarming to see so many people come together for such a great purpose.

“We’ve got different people from all over the post that are here today,” Smartt stated, “from all over Fort Cavazos, throughout different brigades, that are coming together for one purpose and that is to support one another. I love being a part of that. Nobody’s frowning, all smiles because it’s such a great cause. You can see it in everybody’s face. They love being a part of it too, something bigger than ourselves.”

Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, expressed her gratitude for the kindness for those who made a difference for many families at the Great Place, saying the donation of food and time showed great support for the military community.

“It is the contribution of others which truly makes a tremendous impact across our community providing for those in need,” she stated. “I truly believe as you give, you also receive a special feeling within your heart knowing your gift provides for deserving families. To our community partners, who continue to stand steadfast in their support with contributions that make a significant difference in the lives of our Soldiers and their families, we are immensely grateful for your support. Your donations exemplify the unity and support that exists within our community. It is heartening to witness the community continue to come together to support our Soldiers and their well-being.

“It assists in ensuring military families can enjoy a traditional Thanksgiving meal, fostering a sense of normalcy and unity during a time when they may be separated from a loved one due to military service,” she added. “Additionally, it eases the financial burden on the families, allowing them to allocate their resources to other essential needs, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being and morale.”",

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — The HOP initiated its first holiday transportation service here during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, making several stops, to include the Copeland Center, the Casey Memorial Library and Phantom Warrior Lanes.

The service is scheduled for a second run over the winter holidays and will extend to include the motor pool areas.

Fort Cavazos officials partnered with the Hill Country Transit District to provide transportation on the installation during the holidays to get a feel for how the HOP will run on post in the future and help boost morale during the holiday season, which can be especially difficult for Soldiers so far away from home and family.

The holiday service is pilot for the upcoming Cavazos Connector, which will provide mass transit service on post and throughout the local community.

“The post was kind enough to find us a home here, which will be based out of Fort Cavazos for all of our Fort Cavazos transit needs,” said Derek Czapnik, transportation superintendent for the HOP, during the Red, White and You hiring event earlier this month.

“This is going to be a game changer,” he said.

Darrell Burtner, director of urban operations for HCTD, said the organization is looking forward to the collaboration.

“We’re excited, and we really feel that this can make a huge difference to family morale on post and logistics as far as getting people from point A to point B. We’re looking forward to working together.

“I think historically the Army has done a great job as far as transporting Soldiers, but the transportation options for family members and dependents have not been as strong,” he added. “That is really the focus of this, to give them more options of not only getting around on base but also connect into the transit system immediately off post at the gate.”

Burtner explained that the transit system will eventually enable Soldiers to get wherever they need to go on base and connect into the HOP service in town, “so they can go anywhere from Copperas Cove, all the way out to Temple and really anywhere in between.”

To make things even more convenient, the HOP will launch an app for riders to order transportation, much like Uber or Lyft.

In an effort to help get Soldiers to breakfast and other early morning obligations, the upcoming holiday HOP will start slightly earlier from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. There will be no services on Dec. 25 or Jan. 1, 2024.

The holiday HOP is free of charge to anyone with access to the installation.

HCTD is also looking to hire dependents, spouses and veterans to fill part-time driver positions starting in February 2024. Positions start at $18 hourly, offer flexibility and the security of only driving on the installation. Commercial driver’s licenses are not required for the position.

JOINT BASE LANGLEY-EUSTIS, Va. – The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command’s leader professional development webinar series continued this week as Mr. Michael D. Formica, TRADOC deputy to the commanding general, and Mr. Nathan Whitaker, motivational speaker and former NFL executive, discussed the importance of mentorship in the workplace.

With leadership comes the responsibility to mentor those below you, as both Formica and Whitaker can attest to. With the wake of a new mentorship program developed by the TRADOC Civilian Human Resources Directorate, leader mentorship has become a great topic of discussion.

“The Army is a people business, and if a leader doesn’t acknowledge the aspirations of each individual on their team, there’s an essential piece of leadership that’s missing there,” Formica explained. “Mentorship can help inspire and enable their subordinates to reach their highest potential.”

As stated by Formica and Whitaker, the key qualities of a successful mentor are similar to those of an effective leader: character, trust, patience, empathy, and humility.

Whitaker elaborated on this with an anecdote on his experience working with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where their leadership had a character-based selection process during the NFL draft. This showed just how serious a player’s character is considered during such an important process.

Along with having good character values, Formica and Whitaker emphasized the value of empathy and demonstrating a genuine commitment to support the mentee.

“If leaders operate an organization where they demonstrate their desire to help subordinates improve their competence, they will be much more committed to the organization and its success,” Formica explained.

On the quality of humility, Whitaker stated that empathy and the ability to understand that we are all flawed as humans is one of the most important parts of being a positive mentor and develops a deeper sense of trust.

“If I’m willing to own my mistakes, that’s a powerful message [to the mentee],” Whitaker stated.

Formica expanded on this, adding that “humility is a key ingredient in mentorship, because when you recognize that, as a leader, you are fallible and that you will make mistakes and learn from them, you are opening up a learning environment of trust.”

With this comes a new opportunity for both parties to learn from each other, making the mentorship mutually beneficial.

“[Mentorship] must be a two-way street. I am amazed at how much I’m learning from mentees in the process of being a mentor,” expressed Formica as he shared his experience with the TRADOC mentoring program.

Earlier this year, the TRADOC Civilian Human Resources Directorate established the voluntary mentoring program as a personal and professional development opportunity for Army Civilians.

The program, which is available across the TRADOC enterprise, offers different mentoring approaches including cohort mentoring, peer mentoring, and reverse mentoring.

FORT LIBERTY, N.C. – Medical Soldiers with the 7458th Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Army Reserve Medical Commandb ran a weekend clinic as a part of the ongoing Operation Reserve Care Clinic (ORC) on Fort Liberty, North Carolina from November 3-5, 2023.

The goal of ORC is to aid Soldiers in staying medically ready to deploy at a moment's notice. By hosting a Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP) like event on the weekends, the providers of the 7458th MORU are meeting Soldiers around Fort Liberty and beyond to provide critical medical readiness functions. This saves time for the Soldiers, who may not have the ability or time to complete these assessments outside of the Army. Maj. Latasha Brown, the officer in charge of the ORC mission from the 7458th MORU, explained how this mission is critical to maintaining Soldier readiness.

“A lot of Soldiers have had really great Reserve Care experiences and it starts mainly with the staff,” she said. “They like the way the staff are in depth and really positive in their approach to the Soldiers. They actually really care and they are in depth with the Soldiers patient care, not just pushing them through the system. It is one stop, but they really take the time to sit with the Soldier and work with them through whatever challenges they may have while bringing their medical readiness to the green state. Coming to ORC, they were able to get good patient care where our providers care about their status while updating their health information and they were able to leave here with a positive outlook on their future. If they had problems that were just outlined, they were able to work through it and then they left with answers on how to correct those issues they had in the system.”

The ORC mission has been ongoing for seven years. It was initially implemented to relieve the military health contractors and ensure Soldiers were in compliance with Army medical health standards. Since then, it has served Soldiers conducting battle assembly weekend in the area, ensuring that they maintain medical readiness. The operation has had medical Soldiers from other regions look into performing their own versions of Operation Reserve Care clinics, although there have been resource issues in getting these programs off the ground. Sgt. Tarynn Gardner, the mission's non-commissioned officer in charge from the 7458th MORU, recalled all of the moving pieces unique to keep this mission moving.

“It's a lot easier to keep a ball rolling when it's already started,” Gardner said. “So what is hindering a lot of organizations from starting their own programs is getting that ball rolling. There are a lot of pieces. We're fortunate we have a facility and haven't always been in this facility. We've been in various facilities since it started. We eventually found ourselves here, which has been great because everything that we need is pretty close. So facilities, supplies, you need somebody like a point of contact that works like a liaison between the actual hospital and the reserve unit. So we have a person that's kind of coordinating. Then we have our own leadership, which you've been talking to, to lend unit support. In this particular situation, we've definitely had different leaders, but for the most part, the unit has supported us and the willingness of all these individuals who volunteered. There are obviously a lot of different roles that go into the whole process. So all of these individuals, had to go through MHS Genesis training. They all had to get approval for the MEDPROS update to be able to update patient information.”

Soldiers can expect a multitude of medical services, such as preliminary health assessments, vision screening, audio screening, dental services, and more.

The clinic's providers are Reserve Soldiers coming from the 7458th MORU. ORC allows them to be able to practice their medical skills in a realistic setting. While perfecting these skills, they are able to understand different common afflictions Soldiers are experiencing. The Officer in Charge of the Clark Clinic, Capt. Shanelle Warren of the 7458 MORU, explained the advantage of having a clinic run by Soldiers

“We are driven and ran by Soldiers,” Warren said. “ If there is something going on with the Soldiers, like for instance, when they do their PHA, it is definitely very important to answer all the questions correctly. If something's going on, our providers see and notice those things. They give that additional care. Something most people don't know, lot of Soldiers don't have care outside of here. So if there's something going on and we find, for instance, if a soldier has diabetes. We see that in their records, we do get them the referrals to help them get their medications. We don't just see Soldiers as numbers. We see them as our peers because all of us are Soldiers. It's driven through Soldiers to give them care.”",

BALLSTON SPA, N.Y. — Ten Army National Guard Soldiers from New York’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion volunteered to help send 131 Christmas trees from a Saratoga County tree farm to military families at bases in Virginia and Florida.

The Guard recruiters joined 30 other volunteers at Ellms Family Farm in Ballston Spa on Nov. 28 to load trees donated to the Trees for Troops program on board a truck and dispatch them for shipment by FedEx.

New York Army National Guard Sgt. 1st Class Derrick Zwack said he volunteered because he remembered how seeing a Christmas tree while he was deployed had cheered him up.

“When you are overseas, your fellow Soldiers become like a second family, but you still miss your family back home,” Zwack said. “These trees give us a sense of home when we are away for the holidays.”

Ellms Tree Farm, a Christmas season destination for families throughout the Albany region, has been a collection site for trees for 19 years.

Owner Sally Ellms said she is amazed by the generosity of the local growers.

“When I checked a week ago, we had about 30 trees stacked on the trailer,” Ellms said. “So, I made some phone calls to thank and remind our growers and in our final week, we had another hundred donated.”

Trees for Troops is a national program launched in 2005 by the Christmas Spirit Foundation, and with the help of FedEx, has delivered more than 293,500 trees. Fresh-cut trees are gathered at farm and retail lots, picked up by FedEx and routed through distribution centers for delivery to 84 military bases this holiday season.

This year’s trees from the Albany region are going to a Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, and an Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida. In previous years, trees have gone to bases in Afghanistan.

Volunteers helping this year included veterans representing all service branches from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Gulf War, the Cold War and the Vietnam War.

Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Moseman said it’s all about giving back.

“It’s a great day when we gather these Soldiers together and load the trees onto the truck,” Moseman said. “With so many service members sacrificing time with their families for the holidays, it feels awesome to do this for them and remind them of how much we care.”

TOKYO, Japan – The U.S. Army Japan Band took the stage at Tokyo’s famed Budokan arena for the last time for their final performance as longtime participants in the Japan Self-Defense Force Marching Festival.

The band’s Nov. 17 and 18 appearances in the concert ended their 42-year run of taking part in the annual joint event, as the unit will be stood down next year.

The USARJ Band have been performers in the festival every year since 1981, except for when it was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Current members of the USARJ Band said they recognize the significance of being part of the final iteration of the band to perform in the historic, 14,000-capacity venue, as it marks the end of a notable era for the unit, which was activated in 1957.

“We are obviously so grateful that [the USARJ Band] had a chance to be here for so many years consecutively and had the chance to work with all these great musicians, great people, and great staff that organizes the event,” said Staff Sgt. Nicholas Miller, a two-time performer at the festival. “It’s bittersweet, but it’s cool to be part of the [USARJ Band’s] last performance.”

Miller said he thinks the JSDF Marching Festival is every member of the band’s favorite event they do every year and said their participation in the event is a unique opportunity for a large, predominantly Japanese audience to listen to music from a diverse group of performers.

“It’s a lot of fun getting to meet all the bands, hearing all the great music that they make, and having the chance to show what we all can do when we come together and work as one,” he said.

Miller said he tried to have fun backstage and keep everyone’s energy up, but admitted he felt a tinge of sadness knowing that every time the band finished a song, they would be getting closer to the last time they would ever play at Budokan.

“I think our performance was very successful, and this will definitely stay in my heart for a long time,” he said.

Chief Warrant Officer 3 Matthew David, the USARJ Band commander and a first-time performer at the festival, said he has known about Budokan and the band’s participation in the festival since the start of his Army career 19 years ago. He said it was a huge honor to be able to be part of the event and represent the United States to the people of Japan.

One of the songs the band performed was from an anime series, and they chose it because they thought it was an appropriate tribute to their host country and one that would help the audience connect with them, David said.

The commander said he could see the crowd visibly enjoying and responding to the music. Making that kind of connection with an audience is “something you can’t put a price on,” he said.

“It’s about [exploring] the human dimension through music,” David said. “Music is one of those powerful ways to connect with people.”

The first JSDF Marching Festival was held in 1963, and Budokan has been the venue nearly every year since 1973. In addition to U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine bands joining the event, bands from Australia, France, Germany, India, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have also performed over the years.",

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Community residents donated, cooked and served a feast for the Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers program here on Thanksgiving Day.

The free dinner was available at the Camp Zama BOSS Warrior Zone Nov. 23, and about 60 Soldiers took advantage of the home-cooked food and chance to spend time with their peers.

Randy Benton, BOSS program adviser for U.S. Army Garrison Japan’s Directorate of Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation, thanked the people who worked behind the scenes to host the event.

“This would have not been possible without the outstanding community support from our residents,” Benton said. “Thank you to everyone who helped us out this year.”

In addition to food for the dinner coming from donations from the community, Benton said the Camp Zama Community Club turkey and ham.

Takila Frazier, an Army Community Services site coordinator, was on hand cooking and serving the food, to include her collard greens, mashed potatoes and banana pudding. She said she just wanted to make sure the Soldiers were taken care of on the holiday.

“If it were my son or daughter, I would want someone to take them under their wing and help,” said Frazier, an Air Force veteran.

BOSS president Spc. Michelle Antonio said the event was an important way to connect with those who might be away from home for the first time.

“The holiday season is especially hard for single Soldiers so if giving them something to do, a place to be at, and especially good food to eat helps make their Thanksgiving away from home easier, we will gladly do that,” she said.

Antonio said the community involvement made the event even more special.

“Thank you to all who helped us make the dinner possible,” she said. “All of us truly appreciate the gift you blessed us with this Thanksgiving. Personally, this is only my second ‘traditional’ Thanksgiving, and [it] has been such an honor to try such delicious food! Truly, I want to thank everyone who donated and took time off their day to make this possible!”

Staff Sgt. Lauren Hassler and Spc. Nayellie Maysonet, both Soldiers stationed at Camp Zama, said they were appreciative of the community efforts to provide them an additional option for Thanksgiving dinner with friends. And both said they told family and friends back in the States not to worry because they were receiving a home-cooked meal.

“This kind of event gives the single Soldiers living in the barracks the opportunity to feel like a part of a community on the holidays,” Hassler said. “It really makes a difference.”

Antonio stressed that Soldiers should continue to utilize the Warrior Zone, especially through the rest of the holiday season.

“As we all know, being away from home is hard enough—holidays are even harder,” she said. “Come out and meet new people. There is a roof, drinks, food, and even entertainment being provided … take advantage of it!

“We wish for you all to know you have a safe space here on Camp Zama, even if it is to just get out of your room—it can get stuffy in there,” Antonio said. “Please come to the Warrior Zone … we are looking forward to seeing you all this upcoming year and taking Camp Zama’s BOSS program to new heights!”",

MANGILAO, Guam — Over 100 cybersecurity stakeholders gathered at the University of Guam for the 2024 Central Pacific Cybersecurity Summit, hosted by the Guam National Guard Nov. 6-7.

Representatives from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the National Guard Bureau, U.S. Cyber Command, the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, public utilities, commercial service providers and others joined Guam Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero in the ongoing effort to bolster cybersecurity protection for the island and nation.

“Over the next two days, we are going to lean on one another, exchange ideas, and use our collective expertise to fortify our island and our region’s ability to respond and recover from a cyber attack,” Leon Guerrero said. “To simply say it’s a priority is an understatement. It is mission-critical to our island’s defense and our nation’s defense that we get this done.”

In May 2023, Guam experienced sustained 140-mile-per-hour winds from Typhoon Mawar, wiping out communication systems and other utilities across the 200-square-mile island. On the same day, a multinational advisory and Microsoft announced a malicious computer code was discovered in Guam. The attacks were attributed to Volt Typhoon, a state-sponsored hacking group that conducts espionage and information gathering for the Chinese government.

Guam, home to over 150,000 U.S. citizens, is located in the “typhoon alley” of the Western Pacific. Guam is also closer to Taiwan than Washington is to Fort Bliss, making it the westernmost U.S. soil in the Indo-Pacific.

Additionally, Guam’s Marianas archipelago is the only U.S. soil to have been captured and occupied by an invading force during World War II. This combination of natural and man-made threats to Guam’s fledgling infrastructure, together with Guam’s isolated location, prompted the Guard and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to bring stakeholders together.

Participants at the summit, the second in an ongoing series, addressed capability gaps, resource procurement, organizational structures and more. After two days of presentations and discussions, Guam Homeland Security announced a new, CISA-approved islandwide cybersecurity plan.

Lt. Col. Bumjin Park, chief information officer for the Guam Guard, described the importance of interagency cooperation during the summit.

“When we talk about homeland defense and integrated deterrence, it starts with relationships,” said Park. “Yes, we are generating plans and trying to procure much-needed cyber resources. But really, it’s the human element, like strong partnerships and well-trained communities, even for regular civilian users at home and at work, that provide a strong front against any adversary.”

Leon Guerrero echoed the importance of the whole-of-community approach.

“With so many experts in the room, this integration creates strength that is greater than the sum of its parts,” she said. “This integration showcases our relationships and unity of effort. And when it comes to defending the island and nation we love and call home, this integration deters. Integrated deterrence is a watchword over at INDOPACOM, and this is the work we are doing here today.”

WHEELER ARMY AIRFIELD, Hawai’i — At U.S. Army Garrison Hawai'i, a small but formidable team of ten, led by Jacob Faber and Justin Turnbo, stands vigilant against the relentless threat of wildfires. As the only full-time National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) wildland firefighters in the Army, their dedication extends far beyond the typical scope of duty, encompassing a vital role in maintaining the Army's training readiness.

Jacob Faber, the crew supervisor, outlines their unique position: ""Unlike other installations that rely on external assistance, our team is solely dedicated to wildland firefighting. This isn't just a job for us; it's our life's work.""

Distinct from other military bases that depend on collateral duty or external assistance for fire management, the Garrison Hawai'i team is exclusively devoted to wildland firefighting. ""Our role is unique in the Army. We are the only NWCG wildland firefighters entirely focused on wildland fire, not as a secondary duty but as our primary responsibility,"" shares Faber, underscoring the team's specialized expertise and dedication.

The team's role extends beyond fire suppression; they are a pivotal component in ensuring the seamless conduct of Army training exercises. ""Our presence is non-negotiable for Army training. Fires can ignite at any moment, and we must always be prepared,"" explains Turnbo. This level of readiness is particularly remarkable given the vast area they cover and their limited personnel.

This year alone, this dedicated crew battled over 67 wildfires across the Army installations, a testament to their relentless commitment. With responsibilities spanning across vast landscapes from Tripler to Fort Shafter and beyond, they ensure the safety of both military and surrounding civilian lands.

The team's expertise in wildland fire management is unparalleled. ""Our training spans decades, covering fire management, budgeting, finance, and command duties,"" shares Justin Turnbo, the program manager. This depth of knowledge positions them uniquely in the Army's ecosystem, where they often collaborate with Honolulu Fire Department and the Fish and Wildlife Service, especially during significant incidents like the Mililani Mauka fire where the team coordinated water bucket drop locations from assisting Army aviation assets.

A critical part of their duty is maintaining remote automated weather stations across O'ahu and Hawaii Island. These stations provide real-time fire danger information, crucial for both military and civilian forecasting. ""Our weather stations are a national asset,"" Faber adds. ""They offer essential data not just for us but for the National Weather Service and other agencies.""

Despite their crucial role, the team faces challenges. With a modest budget and a high turnover rate due to the strenuous demands of the job, they often operate under tight constraints. ""We do more with less,"" Turnbo states. ""Our team consistently faces the challenge of maintaining our high standards with limited resources.""

The team's dedication is unwavering, even during personal sacrifices. ""We've missed holidays, family events, all to ensure safety and training continuity,"" Faber reflects. Their commitment ensures that Army training proceeds uninterrupted, a crucial aspect of their mission.

Yet, this exemplary team seeks no glory. Their motto, ""embrace the suck,"" reflects a deep-seated resilience and a focus on duty. This quiet professionalism, however, often leaves their challenges unseen.

As the Army looks to expand wildland firefighting capabilities across other installations, the U.S. Army Garrison Hawai'i Wildland Fire Team serves as a pioneering model. Their experiences, both in triumphs and challenges, will shape the future of wildland firefighting within the Army.

""We're not just fighting fires; we're safeguarding the future of Army training and the communities around us,"" says Turnbo. Their story is one of silent heroism, a beacon of dedication and resilience in the face of ever-present danger.

As the sun sets over the lush landscapes of O'ahu, the U.S. Army Garrison Hawai'i Wildland Fire Team remains on guard, a testament to their unwavering commitment to protect and serve.",

HELEMANO MILITARY RESERVATION, Hawai’i — In the heart of Helemano Military Reservation, where urgent calls for help are met with swift responses, the power of collaboration between the Federal Fire Department, local Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, and the Hawaii Fire Department stands testament to the life-saving impact of mutual aid agreements.

On a critical day, the seamless partnership between these agencies was on full display during a cardiac arrest emergency involving Sgt. Dustin Charles Woodmansee of the 13th Military Police Detachment. The harrowing event, which saw Sgt. Woodmansee fighting for his life, underscores the vital role of interagency cooperation in emergency response.

Mateo Mariano, emergency medical technician, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, a key responder, recalls the intensity of the situation: ""My role was to assist my paramedic partner in every way possible, from EKG monitoring to applying defibrillation pads."" His efforts, alongside those of Lead Paramedic Shalei Meneses, paramedic, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, were crucial in stabilizing Sgt. Woodmansee.

Meneses, reflecting on the incident, shares, ""It started as a seizure call and escalated to cardiac arrest. The rapid response from FedFire, who were on the scene performing CPR when we arrived, was crucial.""

This sentiment of collaborative effort is echoed by Captain Alon of the Federal Fire Department. ""It was a day where everyone came together – EMS, FedFire, everyone. The result was we saved a life, not just one but an entire family,"" he states, highlighting the broader impact of their actions.

Brittany Woodmansee, Sgt. Woodmansee's wife, played a pivotal role in the initial response. ""I started CPR until the fire department arrived. Thanks to their quick actions and the care at Tripler ICU, my husband is here today, walking and talking,"" she gratefully shares.

Jonathan Poe, battalion chief of the Federal Fire Department, sheds light on the mechanics behind such coordinated responses. ""When our resources are stretched, the mutual aid agreement with city and county is a lifesaver. HFD and our teams have a strong working relationship, and it shows in emergencies like this,"" he explains.

This mutual aid agreement ensures that when one agency is tied up, others step in seamlessly. ""We have a system where city and county's 911 calls are coordinated with our dispatch. This means quicker response times, more hands on deck, and ultimately, more lives saved,"" Poe adds.

The story of Sgt. Woodmansee’s survival is a compelling example of how mutual aid agreements transcend mere policy, becoming a lifeline for those in dire need. His experience, from the initial seizure to his miraculous recovery, is a testament to the dedication and skill of the first responders and medical staff involved.

""I'm here because of the quick actions of EMS and the excellent care at Tripler. I can't thank everyone enough,"" says Sgt. Woodmansee, expressing his gratitude.

This incident in HMR is more than just a successful emergency response. It's a narrative of unity, skill, and the unwavering commitment of various agencies working together to save lives. It's a reminder of how crucial these agreements are in ensuring that when a call for help rings out, it's answered by a unified front, ready to do whatever it takes to bring a person back from the brink.",

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. – In the complex landscape of U.S. Army Sustainment Command’s logistics infrastructure, Logistics Readiness Centers play a pivotal role in managing materiel and support services to U.S. Army units. From ammunition management to equipment maintenance, and hazardous materials operations to bulk fuel, each LRC's unique mission requires careful analysis. Sarah Nadermann, a management analyst and senior technical subject matter expert in ASC’s G8 (Resource Management) Manpower Management Division, is at the forefront of optimizing these essential LRCs.

Nadermann, who joined ASC in 2020, has spent the past two years leading the operation of analyzing all LRCs in the continental U.S. on their size, complexity, and mission to ensure that they are adequately staffed and have the manpower needed for their workloads. This operation is known as optimization, and to date, 35 out of 57 CONUS LRCs have been optimized thanks to Nadermann’s efforts.

With a total of 78 LRCs worldwide, each with a wide range of supporting requirements that impact Soldiers daily, it is important for Nadermann to get the most comprehensive view of each LRC’s individual mission. This allows her to best assess their manpower needs to enable ASC to get Soldiers what they need, when and where they need it.

To ensure the mission success of each LRC, they must have employees with the right skillset in the right place. “We started by categorizing all LRCs based on mission, size, and type-specific principles in order to maximize standardization and replication of force structure models,” Nadermann explained.

“After sites were bucketed and models were standardized, we met with each LRC one-on-one with their Support Operations Directorate functional area to discuss their structures line by line to ensure they understand how model positions meet their needs and document their additional and unique mission requirements,” she added.

Although it is a tedious process, Nadermann said taking the time to meet one-on-one with each LRC has been invaluable. It has led to increased partnership and understanding between the LRCs and HQ.

The RMM team works closely with ASC G1 (Human Resources) to staff the LRC’s after assessing their manpower requirement level. “Manpower and G1 are uniquely intertwined,” Nadermann said. “After RMM documents a position, G1 is responsible for classifying the positions and hiring. We work very closely and there isn’t a day in a manpower analysts’ job that doesn’t involve collaboration with the G1.""

G1 Human Resources Specialist Shelonda Broyles regularly collaborates with Nadermann. “I can honestly say both directorates do a great job building and maintaining relationships, so we are synced and moving towards the same goals,” she said. ""I am honored to work with Sarah and consider her not only a great colleague, but a great friend as well.”

Prior to Nadermann’s employment at ASC, she worked at U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command in finance and accounting and industrial base operations and Joint Munitions Command in budget and manpower.

The prior knowledge and experience Nadermann brought to the table has led her to become a huge asset for ASC.

“I feel one of my strongest strengths in manpower is due to my extensive background in finance and budget, which allows the greater understanding of manpower and how it affects pay and budget,” she said.

Nadermann’s supervisor Erica Slattery, RMM Chief, also sees the value Nadermann brings.

“Sarah is a self-starter, team player, and change agent who possesses a positive, infectious can-do attitude that is recognized across the command,” Slattery said. “Her enthusiasm and professionalism exemplify commitment to the Army enterprise and personal contributions help propel the organization into the future with staying power.”

Working at ASC has proven to be beneficial for Nadermann as well. RMM has allowed her to advance her career by having opportunities to lead special projects and initiatives, such as LRC optimization.

“I love working at ASC,” Nadermann said of her work in RMM. “ASC gives you the unique ability to interact with military, Civilians, and foreign nationals across the CONUS and OCONUS (outside the continental U.S.) enterprise. It allows you to understand the intricate responsibilities of a logistics command.”

LAS VEGAS – The Nevada National Guard executed Operation Silver Circuit, a comprehensive mission dedicated to ensuring safety and security during the inaugural Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix.

About 90 Soldiers and Airmen from the 72nd Military Police Company, the 152nd Medical Group, and the 92nd Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high-yield Explosives Enhanced Response Force Package Command and Control element were activated Nov. 15-19 to support local law enforcement, including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, and first responders in Clark County.

Their concerted efforts supported local agencies at key locations, including the Las Vegas Strip and two hospitals in the city.

The Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix attracted an estimated 315,000 spectators from around the world and $1.2 billion in economic impact, according to numbers from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Brig. Gen. D. Rodger Waters, Nevada National Guard Joint Staff director, said Operation Silver Circuit enhanced security and emergency response capabilities.

“The deployment is a testament to the ongoing partnership between the Nevada National Guard and local emergency response agencies, showcasing their commitment to public safety and effective collaboration in times of need,” Waters said.

The deployment engaged units with specific roles: the 72nd Military Police Company, providing security expertise; the 152nd Medical Group, emergency and triage response operations at local hospitals; and the 92nd CERFP C2 element, contributing to communications, logistics and strategic decision-making.

Tech. Sgt. Zeshan Mahmood, 152nd Medical Group, the noncommissioned officer in charge, emphasized the importance of proactive measures.

“We grasp the gravity of the situation, the potential for calamity, and why we have been here,” Mahmood said. “We understand that these sorts of things can be very dynamic and fluid. We’re all professionals. So, we know how to handle those situations and how not to.”

Capt. Erica Steele, a critical care nurse overseeing the University Medical Center Hospital site, expressed the group’s commitment.

“We are here to help with triage, basic lifesaving, and patient flow in case of an emergency,” Steele said. “In the case of a mass casualty event, it is crucial that we are here to help the hospital care for their trauma victims.”

Frontline responders, such as Soraya Robertson, a civilian ER Nurse at UMC Hospital, emphasized the invaluable support provided by the Airmen.

“It’s nice to have almost a sidekick, you know, somebody who is a partner that’s like, ‘Hey, I got your back,’ ” Robertson said. “It relieves a lot of stress, and we love the support.”

The 92nd Civil Support Team, one of 57 National Guard teams responding to domestic CBRNE threats, provided an extra layer of expertise and support to the mission.

Beyond the Formula 1 event, the Guard regularly supports local agencies and events throughout the year, including on New Year’s Eve and for the upcoming NFL Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium.

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — It didn’t take Jennifer Zaldivar very long to make her mark at Redstone Arsenal. She has only been with Logistics Readiness Center Redstone, located in Huntsville, Ala., as a transportation specialist since the end of January and already has been named Army Materiel Command Employee of the Quarter for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.

LRC Redstone is one of more than 70 LRCs under U.S. Army Sustainment Command, a major subordinate command of U.S. Army Materiel Command. AMC’s mission is to ensure the Army and Joint Forces have the necessary equipment -- including guns, artillery, ammunition -- to fight and win on the battlefield.

As a transportation specialist in the LRC Redstone Transportation Division for Personal Property, Zaldivar processes official, military dependent, and diplomatic passports. She also reviews preapprovals for household goods moves and passenger travel. ASC is the executing arm of AMC, bringing together all of AMC's capabilities to make sure Soldiers have what they need, when they need it, and where they need it, including at home station.

“Our transportation office supports all AMC customers on Redstone Arsenal by providing personal property, passenger travel, and passport and visa support, including transportation motor pool and freight services,” Zaldivar said.

“My work is important, because by processing accurate and timely passport applications, I am able to support our military with important overseas matters,” Zaldivar said. “I also determine whether extra costs are permitted during household good moves which saves the government money. And by being a contracting officer’s representative, I ensure that the government is being taken care of as well as the contractor.”

Zaldivar said she has always been an ardent supporter of America’s military, and her family has strong military connections. Her grandfather was in the Marine Corps for 28 years, and she was born and raised at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

“All four of his sons, including my dad, joined the Navy,” she said, “and my dad served 30 years, retiring as a command master chief petty officer.” Her husband, Salvadore, was a Marine when she met him but has since left the military.

Getting to where she is took her on a somewhat bumpy road. She and her husband had moved to Alabama from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where both had served as Department of Defense Civilians working for the Navy, in late 2019 when she was hired by CWT SATO Travel in Huntsville, Alabama, home of Redstone Arsenal. She was laid off during the COVID pandemic, but because of her experience in working with government travel situations, she was hired as a quality control inspector for household goods for another company. And after two years, she landed at LRC Redstone.

Zaldivar said she feels very honored to be named Employee of the Quarter after such a short time, and attributes it to her strong work ethic. “I am ecstatic and feel very proud to be honored with this award,” she said. “I take pride in my work,” she added, “and it shows.”",

FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. – Fort George G. Meade held a joint wreath-laying ceremony Sunday, November 19, 2023, alongside representatives from Germany and Italy in honor of the two Italian and 33 German World War II prisoners of war buried at the post cemetery.

Maj. Gen. Trevor Bredenkamp, Commander of the Joint Task Force – National Capital Region and the U.S. Army Military District of Washington, and Lt. Col. Chaveso Cook, Fort Meade Headquarters Command Battalion, welcomed Rear Adm. Axel Ristau, German Defense and Naval Attaché; Col. Paolo Scimone, Italian Military Attaché to the U.S., and guests to pay tribute to those who did not return home.

“Today, we continue a tradition that began just 12 short years ago to recognize the strength of the alliance between our countries and service members,” Bredenkamp said. “Our world has changed a great deal since these young service members were laid to rest. I am humbled to join with representatives from both Germany and Italy to remember and honor the sacrifices made by their countrymen.”

Fort Meade was one of 19 camps where German and Italian prisoners were shipped, receiving 1,600 Germans and 58 Italians in September of 1943. Some of those prisoners died during their captivity and were buried at the installation.

“This location is unique however, as it is the only internment site for foreign prisoners of war in the state of Maryland and remains a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by those who served their nation in a time of war,” Bredenkamp said.

A common duty and knowledge of the danger facing them is a universal understanding between Soldiers that transcends country lines, according to Ristau.

“That is why there will always be a universal common remembrance,” Ristau said. “That is why we are assembling here today remembering fallen German Soldiers resting among Soldiers from other nations who we never met or spoken a word together.”

In his remarks, Scimone stated the freedoms the United States and its allies enjoy today come from the sacrifices made by millions of Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen who fought before, during and after World War II.

“We may change how we operate our weapons, structure and procedures, and it is all part of the business, but the ideals that move us and the examples of our heroes remains steady; unaffected by the flow of time,” Scimone said. “Like our ancestors, we stand together, and we fight together. They did it yesterday, now it is our turn and it’s also our responsibility to inspire our successors.”

Ristau noted there is no better place to start the path for peace than at a war cemetery because it raises awareness of what war means.

“It is precisely this place here that reminds us to differentiate between those who are actually responsible and those who are followers and those who are forced to fight a war that you at the end of the day tried to avoid,” Ristau said. “Let us use this day as a day of understanding, a day to learn from the past and a day not to tolerate violence or to be guided by prejudices for a peaceful future.”

In honor of the fallen, Maj. Rick Barnes of the Maryland Defense Band, Matthew Canales of Howard High School and Connor Wright of Bugles Across America played renditions of “TAPS,” “Der gute Kamerad,” and “Il Silenzio d’Ordinanza,” respectively.

At the conclusion of the ceremony, those in attendance were given time to pay their individual respects to the fallen and to mingle before being invited to share lunch at the Freedom Inn Dining Facility here.",

LATHAM, New York -- The New York Army National Guard was tops in recruiting and retaining Soldiers for federal fiscal year 2023, outdoing the other 53 state and territorial Army National Guards, according to figures released by the Army National Guard.

The New York Army National Guard achieved a score of 118.12 percent for the 12 months from October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023, according to a year-end analysis of each state’s recruiting and retention success.

The score is based on the number of enlisted Soldiers, the number of new officers and warrant officers who joined, and the number of Soldiers who reenlisted as a percentage of each state’s total Army Guard strength.

A score of 100 percent means the state met its recruiting goals. Scores above 100 percent indicate a state exceeded those recruiting goals.

This was the third time that New York was rated best in recruiting among the states with “large” Army National Guard contingents and the second time the New York Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Battalion has been rated best in the nation, according to Lt. Col. Josh Heimroth, the commander of New York’s recruiting force.

At the beginning of fiscal year 2023, the New York National Guard was authorized a strength of 10,209 Soldiers and had 10,706 personnel assigned.

The New York Army Guard finished the fiscal year with 10,969 Soldiers in the ranks. According to New York National Guard officials, this reflected an increase of 270 soldiers, 760 soldiers above the authorized strength for New York’s Army Guard.

During that fiscal year, the New York Army National Guard recruited 1,594 Soldiers, with 1,521 new enlisted Soldiers and 73 officers who were not previously in the ranks, according to Heimroth.

Another 1,731 Soldiers chose to reenlist in the New York Army National Guard during the year, while 1,235 Soldiers left the force.

All these gains and relatively few losses resulted in New York finishing first in overall recruiting achievement for 2023, Heimroth said.

“We just had the best year for our retention mission that we have ever had,” Heimroth said.

“Our people focused, and Soldier first strategy is showing results. Our leaders at every level and our recruiting and retention teams are performing at an exceptionally high performing level of effort and achievement,” said Major General Ray Shields, the adjutant general of New York.

Success in recruiting and retention also led to the Army Guard ranking New York as the number one state for Army Guard “Strength Health” in 2023, according to Col. Mark Frank, the personnel officer for the New York Army National Guard.

The combination of assigned strength, recruiting efforts, moving Soldiers who missed drills out of the ranks without delay, resulted in this designation for fiscal year 2023, Frank explained.

This recruiting and retention success means that New York currently fields the fourth largest Army National Guard, Frank said. This recruiting success has also allowed New York to add a division artillery headquarters and a finance battalion headquarters to the Army Guard force structure, he said .

Recruiting and retention success is a result of Shield’s emphasis on recruiting and retention, which has been embraced by leaders at all levels, said Command Sgt. Major Anthony Abbate, the New York Army Guard’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion senior enlisted advisor.

“It is the senior NCOs and company leadership teams working with their recruiters and hiring and training their NCOs to enlist people out in their communities and working and forming relationships,” Abbate said.

Retention success is also being driven by New York Army Guard leaders offering Soldiers the opportunity to go to schools to further their military careers and participate in unique training opportunities, like overseas training exercises to Brazil, he said.

“We continue to invest in our Soldiers,” he said.

New York National Guard Soldiers have been busy at home responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and now a migrant crisis, so there is “a sense of fulfillment and the belief that what they are doing matters,” Abbate said.

A real key, Abbate said, is the adjutant general’s commitment to resourcing the recruiters. Out of the over 800 Active Guard and Reserve Soldiers in the New York Army National Guard, 207 are working in recruiting, he said.

The command is committed to keeping the recruiting battalion full – with 124 “production recruiters” interacting with potential Soldiers – and allowing recruiters to be successful by giving them autonomy, Abbate said.

Recruiting, he said, is vital.

“We are the only [occupational specialty] in the military that’s wartime mission and peacetime mission are the same,” Abbate said.",

LATHAM, N.Y. – Ten Soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division’s Dismounted Chemical Reconnaissance Team refined their skills alongside 16 Airmen and Soldiers from the New York National Guard’s 2nd Civil Support Team Nov. 14-16.

The event at the Colonie Fire Training Center presented the Active Duty Army Soldiers with the challenges of a chemical, biological, radioactive, or nuclear scenario.

Participants had to find and test a stockpile of materials in a house basement at the training center.

The Dismounted Chemical Reconnaissance Team, based in Fort Drum, uses search, survey, surveillance and sampling techniques to determine the presence and extent of CBRN contamination.

Members of the 2nd Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team (CST) guided and supported the 10th Mountain Soldiers during the exercise.

Lt. Col. John Giroux, 2nd CST commander, said the training is essential.

“Exercises like this are crucial for many reasons. It allows us to identify and fill training shortfalls, expands technical skills and builds cohesion between us at the state level and our contemporaries at the federal level, such as the Soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division,” Giroux said.

The Soldiers used protective suits, oxygen masks and tanks, sensors for detecting hazardous materials, and sample kits. They maintained constant contact over the radio with a nearby command post.

The Soldiers began by circling the house’s exterior, looking for spikes on their detection equipment, and eventually entering the house to pinpoint the origin of the hazardous materials.

The source was a makeshift lab set up by 2nd CST personnel to simulate a situation where someone could be making a weapon of mass destruction in their home.

“This type of situation might be uncommon, but a lack of training when responding to one could have catastrophic consequences,” said Sgt. 1st Class Ryan Wallace, the platoon sergeant for the reconnaissance team. “Therefore, the training must be strenuous, realistic and objectively critiqued.”

1st Lieutenant Rosa Dominguez, the platoon leader for the reconnaissance team, said she and her Soldiers appreciated the help and mentoring of the Guardsmen.

“It was a real pleasure to work alongside the CST members and to absorb some of their expertise,” Dominguez said. “This week, we built a lot of camaraderie with them and working relationships that will benefit both of our units for years to come.”

After completing their mission, the Soldiers decontaminated and removed their protective gear.

The 2nd Civil Support Team comprises Army and Air Guardsmen trained to identify hazardous materials resulting from terrorist attacks, disasters or criminal activity and inform local first responders.

New York has two teams: the 2nd CST at Stratton Air National Guard Base in Scotia and the 24th CST at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn.

Senior Airman Karlie Foster, a hazmat technician with the 2nd CST and cadre member for the event, said she enjoyed working with the active-duty military members.

“It’s great to compare their perspective, which is a unit that will deploy internationally, with ours, which is domestic, and bridge that gap,” said Foster.

WASHINGTON – Throughout November, a display at the Pentagon titled, “Why We Serve” highlights how Native Americans have served in all the nation’s wars since the Revolutionary War.

The Defense Department and the nation celebrate National American Indian and Alaska Heritage Month every November.

“[Native American Heritage Month] is an opportunity to recognize the rich and diverse cultures, traditions, stories, and important contributions of Native American and Alaskan Native people,” said Edward Blauvelt, Society of American Indian Government Employees, or SAIGE, warrior society director.

Throughout America’s history, 22 Native American servicemembers earned the Medal of Honor, 29 were U.S. Soldiers.

About 190,000 American Indians are military veterans. The U.S. is about 1.4% Native.

“Our Army is made up of Soldiers, their family members and civilians who come from all of the cultures in our American society,” said Brig. Gen. Joe Hilbert, director, Army force development. “In essence, we are America. Recognizing and celebrating our Native American cultures and those within our ranks who are serving or who have served and have come from those cultures, it is a way to celebrate us. It’s an opportunity to recognize the great contributions Native Americans have provided us, and what they as a people have contributed to our great nation and our Army.”

Blauvelt said many of the warfare and battle tactics the service branches use today originated from the Native Americans.

“The American Indian, Alaskan Native style of warfare is so ingrained into America that it is now America’s version of warfare, and along with excellent training and equipment, it makes the U.S. military superior on the battlefield,” said Blauvelt.

These tactics include their perseverance, skulking (now known as guerrilla warfare), blitz attacks such as shock and awe, and the use of stealth technology.

Native Americans would skulk game when hunting. They used this for enemy attacks as well.

When the Mohawks skulked, they hid in the terrain to surprise attack the enemy, along with diversions and ambushes. Skulking was an essential mode of warfare for the forest Indians in the northeastern U.S. It enraged the European officers who viewed it as being against the “rules of war,” though they had skulked in wars in Ireland, Scotland, France, and other European countries.

Crazy Horse of the Oglala Lakota tribe performed quick attacks and divided the enemy. The Apache leader Geronimo and the Seminole people used resistance fighting with hit-and-run tactics. Muscogee warriors used night attacks. The overall battle strategy of these Native American leaders focused on preserving the lives of the individual warrior, he said.

Infantrymen Sgt. Taylor Ericco, Spc. Mark Quijada, Pfc. Matthew Pryor and Pfc. Johnathan Stewart of the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, conduct Military Operation in Urban Terrain, using similar guerilla tactics traditionally used by Native American warriors.

This warfighting blueprint evolved into the current multi-domain battle tactic concept aimed at overcoming local threats with small units instead of exposing major assets decentralized command structures. These stealth structures include aircraft, drones, ships, tanks and missiles; camouflage to hide assets; and decoys such as drones and missiles.

Stealth methods include swarming to engage an adversary from all directions simultaneously, nighttime special operations teams and using tactics for surprise and mobility.

The U.S. military evolved using Native American guerilla tactics in Vietnam, Afghanistan and other modern conflicts.

Native American leader Crazy Horse and the plains tribes misled Gen. George Crook and his troops to rest at the bottom of a valley. They hid their numbers by walking and attacking in a single file. They waited until they were upon the enemy before they broke formation and surprised them with their numbers with devastating results against Crook’s command.

They also sowed the battlefield with confusion. A similar tactic in today’s battlefield was used during the U.S. “shock and awe” campaign, part of the 2003 Iraq invasion.

During the Revolutionary War, Native American warriors saw the war as an internal battle and didn’t want to get involved. Still, tribal members fed troops at Valley Forge, served as minutemen, or fought with colonists if their tribes were directly attacked.

After the Revolutionary War, many tribes fought against the U.S. as the nation expanded westward. Still, many Native Americans fought with the Army right up to the American Civil War.

Standouts who fought during the Civil War were Cherokee Gen. Stand Watie and Seneca Gen. Ely Parker, also known as Donehogawa.

Between 1872 and 1890, 16 native scouts were awarded the Medal of Honor. During the Indian Wars, 5,817 American Indians served as scouts during the 81 years.

The War Department authorized Native Americans to be enlisted in the Army and serve in Indian companies. Each existing regiment of cavalry would contain one Indian regiment. A maximum of 55 Indians were authorized for each company or troop.

Some Native Americans supported the programs while others fought against it. American Indians served in the Spanish-American War and earned Theodore Roosevelt’s highest regard, Blauvelt said.

Blauvelt said that even though they couldn’t vote and their numbers were thin, the American Indians were registering for the draft or volunteering for World War I.

“Americans were praising them for their virtues, courage, energy and daring,” he said. “Tribes with elite warrior societies sent their sons willingly.”

American Indians were some of the first to land in France during the last week of June 1918. Their service was recognized when seven Indians from seven tribes accompanied General Pershing in the French parade to honor Americans.

American Indians fought in every major engagement of World War I. Pvt. Joseph Oklahombi, Choctaw, Company D, 141st Infantry Regiment, 36th Division, earned the French Croix de Guerre, a French military medal, for sprinting across the battlefield and capturing 171 prisoners.

The most famous Native American servicemembers from World War I and II were the code talkers from the Choctaw, Cheyenne, Cherokee, Comanche, Ho-Chunk, Osage, and Yankton Sioux tribes.

These Native American service members used their traditional tribal languages to send Allied messages in code during World War I and II. They were present in battles such as D-Day and Iwo Jima. They kept their work secret, and their codes were never deciphered by Japan or Germany. In 2001, they received Congressional Gold Medals for their work.

During World War II, 44,000 Native Americans from 50 tribes of an estimated population of under 400,000 served on active duty, including nearly 800 women. About 150,000 served or supported the war effort. The Army used about 534 code talkers from the Comanche, Meskwaki, Chippewa, Oneida, Hopi, and Dine nations during World War II.

More than 6,300 Alaska Natives from 107 communities volunteered to serve in the Alaska Territorial Guard during World War II.

Native Americans continue to serve today.

“American Indians and Alaskan Natives have made major military contributions to this nation that helped America win battles and wars at crucial moments in history,” Blauvelt said.",

WASHINGTON - Pfc. Marques Downing thrives on a good challenge, problem-solving and constant change. He spent most of the past two years working in information technology, studying the latest computer networks and systems courses.

“It can be a lucrative career that offers flexibility, but there’s a lot of certificates and classes,” Downing said. “New technology and software are constantly coming out and you have to learn it.”

Last year, Downing realized he wanted a more hands-on job.

“I’m loving every second of my new job,” he said. “I like getting my hands dirty.”

Downing is one of dozens of wheeled vehicle mechanics who keep tactical vehicles operational at the District of Columbia National Guard’s Combined Support Maintenance Shop at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling.

“We’re like the D.C. National Guard’s own mechanic shop. We’re here to make sure people can get from point A to point B,” Downing said.

On any given morning, there is a line of mission-critical vehicles to test, maintain or repair.

“Our mission is to provide readily, fully mission-capable vehicles to the D.C. National Guard,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Courtney Britton, supervisory surface maintenance specialist, officer in charge for the DCARNG Surface Equipment Maintenance Facilities. “Whatever mission is tasked to the D.C. National Guard, and no matter where it is, we have the vehicle to support it.”

Britton leads the operation of four maintenance shops, while Chief Warrant Officer 2 John Eldridge ensures mechanics are technically sound in maintenance and recovery to fulfill mission requirements.

“Medium Tactical Vehicles, Light Medium Tactical Vehicles, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicles — there’s different types of vehicles for different operations,” Eldridge said. “The vehicles belong to the units ... and we are responsible for the maintenance. So, we’re constantly coordinating with units and honing our skills.”

Eldridge stresses expertise and skill aren’t the only traits that keep the operation thriving; he values people in the organization.

“If I likened it like a vehicle, bad parts create bad output, but good parts create good output,” CW2 Eldridge said. “We’ve got good people working in here.”

Britton says preventative maintenance for the D.C. National Guard motor pool is not reserved for a particular season but lasts throughout the year.

“The maintenance community doesn’t have a slow period,” he said. “While requests for vehicles for annual training peak during the summer months, preventative maintenance checks and services are still done every month by individual units on every vehicle in stock.

One of the mechanics helping to keep vehicles fully mission-capable for the past three months is Downing, one of the newest wheeled vehicle mechanics. He likes the responsibility of knowing he can support mission-ready personnel in training, war or national emergency.

“Every week, there’s something new to learn or get my hands on to figure out,” Downing said.

FORT SHAFTER, Hawai’i – In a concerted effort to bolster fire prevention and enhance the safety of military families, U.S. Army Garrison Hawai’i conducted a comprehensive vegetation survey at Fort Shafter. The survey, led by the Deputy to the Garrison Commander, Ms. Brandi G. Skasik, took place on Friday, November 17, marking a significant step towards proactive fire risk mitigation.

The team, comprising key civilian personnel, explored densely vegetated areas to discuss and strategize on fire mitigation techniques. The diverse group of attendees, representing departments and services like Island Palm Communities, Directorate of Public Works, Natural Resources, Wildland Fire, Federal Fire, and Safety, addressed vital concerns related to tree trimming, grass cutting, preservation of native species, and fire prevention.

""The safety and well-being of our residents are paramount. This survey is a crucial initiative by USAG-Hawai'i to assess fire risks and discuss strategic mitigation for the community's safety,"" commented Iris KirkPilger, project director for Island Palm Communities.

The day's activities involved assessing various risks and discussing potential quick-fix solutions. The approach was comprehensive, looking into factors like combustible fences, proximity of vegetation to structures, and the condition of gutters and parking areas. This proactive stance reflects the Garrison's commitment to the safety and well-being of its residents.

Richard Marsh from Installation Management Command Pacific noted, ""This is about more than just surveying; it's about integrating knowledge across departments to achieve the best outcomes for fire prevention and community safety.""

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – The Housing Office here is currently looking to form a committee to gather resident input on a new policy that may allow pets in the housing towers.

“We want everybody to have an active role in [the policy] and try to make it their own,” said Jesus Chavarria, the housing division chief.

The two high-rise apartment-style complexes here only permit cats on the first floor, while residents in single-family homes and townhomes can have up to two pets, including cats and dogs, with some breed restrictions set by the Japanese government.

An updated policy, which housing officials plan to publish this spring using resident feedback and pet-related rules found in other documents, may help ease the transition for incoming pet owners.

While still in its early stages, Chavarria said the policy will likely grant tower residents the option to have at least a small pet.

“We’re trying to aim for the right size,” he said. “For apartment living, I don’t know if we would want a 100-pound dog sitting in there and barking and creating a lot of noise.”

There will be other issues to consider as well, he said, such as space for designated pet relief areas.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan, introduced the possibility of changes to the policy during a housing town hall in September.

While he said the garrison tries to accommodate several different things for residents, he noted that a new pet policy would require community involvement for it to work.

“The option to have pets in the towers is being relooked,” Hunter said at the meeting. “Every family comes with its unique situations, and … pets are [often] a big part of that.”

Chavarria said his office needs to listen to the community on this topic, since a pet is something that family members become attached to and can provide them comfort during stressful times.

“A pet is part of the family,” he said. “[It] helps pull you through grief or it's your friend when you're away from home.”

Chavarria said a committee of at least 10 residents from both towers, with a mix of people who are pet lovers or not, could help guide the draft policy in the right direction.

“I want everyone to have a comfortable home,” he said. “The more the volunteers we have to help out with that would be great.”

(Editor’s Note: Tower residents who are interested in serving on the committee to discuss changes to the pet policy can contact Chavarria at DSN: 263-3441 or 046-407-3441.)

ROŻYŃSK WIELKI, Poland — U.S. Army Soldiers with Task Force Marne visited a local school to learn about Polish culture and to familiarize Polish children with American culture near Bemowo Piskie Training Area, Nov. 15, 2023.

A group of U.S. Army Soldiers with Bravo “Barbarian” Company, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, serving as part of NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group Poland, met with the school staff and students of Primary School Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński as part of an effort to learn about Polish culture and connect with local citizens.

Staff Sgt. Bryce Roatch, a tank commander with Barbarian Company, explained that with the large, nearby presence of the NATO base, it’s important to help the children understand that the Soldiers are friendly and not scary and why they are serving in Poland. Likewise, learning about Polish culture and history helps the American Soldiers understand why their service in Poland is so important.

“This is an opportunity for us not just to show that we’re scary beings with big scary vehicles,” Roatch said. “We’re actually here to learn and understand what’s going on with the local kids here. It’s a huge way to show the next generation of Polish children that this is not only a cool opportunity; it’s very fun.”

“My idea for cooperation with Battle Group Poland when I became the director of our school in 2018 was that children have the opportunity of meeting new cultures without going out of school,” Grzegorz Kacperski, the director of Primary School Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, said. “Because we, geographically, have this honor that you are near here. We wanted to take the benefit [of teaching Polish culture] for American Soldiers not just as Soldiers but mainly as American Citizens.”

The students taught the Soldiers about Poland’s history and one of Poland’s most notable figures in its struggle for independence.

“Józef Piłsudski was the most important person in Polish independence after 1918,” Kacperski said. “American Soldiers are here to help us keep our independence. Leaving Poland, they should know, first of all, why they were here… for Polish people they are [helping to keep] the independence which was started by Piłsudski.”

Roatch, in turn, gave a presentation to the students about the culture of the U.S. Army, the state of Georgia, and the United States. The Soldiers also did some arts and crafts with the students, which allowed them to learn words in each other’s languages, as well as their interests and backgrounds. The Soldiers toured the school and answered the students’ questions in different classrooms.

“The children here are really smart and nice,” Cpl. Daemazejah Corbett, a signal operations support specialist with Barbarian Company, said. “They asked me a lot of questions, so I got to talk to them a lot. I had a good time.”

“For me, it’s very fun, because I get to see my Soldiers interact and grow in not just public speaking but also being able to see the different attributes and ways that cultures talk, and do similar things that we do over in Georgia,” Roatch said. “Getting to watch them sit down and relate is notably critical to their growth in being NCOs and Soldiers, but I think it’s critical in our future here and for them when they end up being staff sergeants and sergeants first class.”

“I got to talk to some of the children, where we learned a little about them,” Corbett said. “I’m realizing that we’re all kind of the same in a way. They like some of the stuff I did… I connected with them a little bit more.”

Roatch believes that it is important for Soldiers to get comfortable interacting with local populations, whether it be in Poland, the Middle East, or wherever they may be serving, so they can build trust and positive relations with local populaces.

“We’re here for now, but we don’t know where the conflict is tomorrow,” Roatch said. “A lot of these Soldiers — they may stay in or they may not — when they become my position, it's important for me and for them to see that they need to be able to trust their community when times are tough.”

PABRADE, Lithuania — Task Force Marne Soldiers and their Lithuanian Allies honed their combat skills during a force-on-force training exercise at Pabrade Training Area, Nov. 16-17.

Known as Strong Griffin 2023, the exercise saw U.S. Soldiers with 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, serve as an opposing fighting force for the Griffin Brigade of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, which provided the NATO Allies an opportunity to share each other’s defensive and offensive tactics, strategies, and standard operating procedures.

“Strong Griffin is an opportunity for us to train together and build towards interoperability procedurally, technically, and the human domain,” U.S. Army Lt. Col. David W. Griffith, commander of 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, said. “It allows us to train tactics, techniques, and procedures so we can operate better with each other.”

Task Force Marne Soldiers conducted infantry and armored offensive operations against Lithuanian Armed Forces partners in a series of training exercises across rural and urban environments to test their combat readiness. Lithuanians, in turn, prepared a defense to counter the American attacks. In the training scenario, the American forces worked their way through a forest environment in an effort to seize a town, while the Lithuanians defended the territory.

Both armies were able to adapt and adjust to their situations which allowed them to learn how each other operated as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses in real time.

“The end goal, of course from the tactical perspective… we check the abilities and the gaps we have within the training cycle,” Lithuanian Army Col. Aurelijus Alasauskas, commander of the Griffin Brigade, said. “So if we see that everything goes so well, I don’t think we’re really organizing our exercise the proper way. We happened to see some gaps already, which might be training points for the next year.”

Lithuanian Soldiers trained on their light and anti-tank infantry tactics against an armored force with the help of Task Force Marne tanks.

“We have tanks. We have larger vehicles than they do [in the exercise],” U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Jaden Brown, a tank commander with Alpha “Ares” Company, 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, said. “Bringing in all that heavy machinery against a much lighter force allows them to develop how they would act against a much better equipped, much larger force,”

In turn, Task Force Marne tank crews adapted their tactics to the forested terrain, which meant tankers stayed vigilant by looking out for smaller, light infantry in the tree lines versus much more visible larger vehicles, according to Brown.

Having the opportunity to face each other in a force-on-force exercise during Strong Griffin ultimately made the two NATO allies stronger together. The exercise also allowed the two allies to familiarize themselves with the tactics and techniques they’d employ together as well as similar terrain and environments they might encounter one day on the battlefield together.

“It’s not about fighting [against] each other, it’s about fighting together with a purpose,” Alasauskas said. “So with the U.S. providing offensive capabilities, and Lithuania providing defense capabilities — when you combine those two into one — you have a very mobile, aggressive defense, which is not letting the forces penetrate you or to maneuver in front of you. So you’re leading even in the defense position. This is the main purpose: To lead the battle the way you want to.”

“It’s been an incredibly rewarding experience working with the Lithuanians,” Griffith said. “They’ve been a great partner here in Pabrade. We’ve worked together to define each other's training objectives. We built an exercise that allowed us both to reach them.”

WASHINGTON — The Army’s top leader honored an organization dedicated to funding the education of military children whose parents made the ultimate sacrifice Tuesday morning.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth awarded members of the Children of the Fallen Patriots Foundation the 2023 Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Award, which highlights the efforts of those who profoundly impacted the lives of service members and their families.

Since 2002, CFP has provided $70 million in scholarships and grants to nearly 3,000 children of Gold Star families, or families of veterans who died in combat, including about 1,600 graduates.

“The Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation serves those who have given the most to this nation – our Gold Star families,” Wormuth said during a Pentagon ceremony. “They know the sacrifice of our military families, and they know that the greatest of these sacrifices is to lose a loved one in service to the nation. They also know that one of the greatest challenges faced by parents and students alike is the rising cost of education.”

A 2022 study showed about 25,000 military children today have lost parents in service-related deaths. CFP identified about 12,000 of those children and has pledged to fund any college costs that exceeds Department of Veterans Affairs scholarships for qualified recipients.

The foundation has closed the gap between supplemented expenses and the total cost of a four-year college degree. On average, that funding disparity totals to about $25,000 annually per student.

“The impact that this makes – to lift the financial burden from our Gold Star families, to increase the educational and financial standing of those surviving children, and to realize our fallen service members dreams of setting their children on the road to success – is immeasurable,” Wormuth said.

Steve Smith, a retired Army officer, and CFP development operations supervisor, Kayla Martin, accepted the award in a Pentagon ceremony Tuesday morning.

The roots of the Children of the Fallen Patriots organization began more than 30 years ago, when founder David Kim, then a young Army officer, faced his first bout with tragedy in his military career.

During Operation Just Cause in December 1989, U.S. forces invaded Panama to remove dictator Manuel Noriega from power and restore democracy in the Central American country.

Sgt. William Delaney Gibbs, a member of Kim’s unit, the 7th Infantry Division, died during the operation, leaving behind his wife and unborn daughter. Moved by the tragedy, Fisher, would eventually found Children of the Fallen Patriots in 2002.

More than two decades later, the foundation not only aids those whose parents died in combat, but also those who passed away in training accidents, illnesses and even suicide. CFP does not place limits on its funding for the children’s college expenses, instead it works with each student to assure they graduate without debt.

“Our nation is forever in debt to these children – children who didn’t choose the military life for themselves, but who loved someone who served and wore the cloth of our nation,” Wormuth said. “The Fishers knew this and were dedicated to repaying this debt. And the Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation knows this and has shown us all what it means to make a difference in the lives of these Gold Star families.”

Sixteen of CFP’s 27 full-time staff come from Gold Star families, including four veterans and 13 scholarship recipients.

Philanthropists Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher established the Fisher House Foundation in 1990 to give free housing to family members of hospitalized U.S. troops during treatment. In honor of their efforts, the Army, Air Force and Navy created the award in 1996.

BETHEL, Alaska - The Alaska National Guard’s annual community outreach program, Operation Santa Claus, took an unexpected turn this year as its mission to bring holiday joy to the village of Tuluksak became a vital lifeline for a resident of the nearby village of Napaskiak.

On Nov. 15, the Alaska Army National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter supporting Operation Santa Claus was en route to deliver gifts and holiday cheer to the children of Tuluksak when an urgent call for assistance came into the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

A critically ill patient in Napaskiak required immediate medical evacuation, but adverse weather and icy runway conditions prevented civilian air ambulances from landing there.

Napaskiak is five miles south of Bethel on the other side of the Kuskokwim River. With river ice restricting travel by boat and insufficient snow and ice for travel by snowmachine or ice road, evacuation by helicopter was the only option.

As soon as the AKARNG accepted the mission from the AKRCC, the pilots, Chief Warrant Officers 2 Colton Bell and David Berg, assigned to Golf Company, 2-211th (General Support Aviation Battalion), altered their mission plan to prioritize the medevac.

Having just completed one of two scheduled Operation Santa Claus flights to Tuluksak, the aircrew added two LifeMed paramedics and equipment onto the helicopter with the remaining gifts and volunteers already on board and immediately headed to Napaskiak.

Bell said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Nick Lime, an aviation maintenance technician and crew chief assigned to Delta Company, 2-211th (GSAB), played a crucial role in the team accomplishing both missions within seven hours despite rainy and icy weather conditions.

“He assisted greatly in the configuration of the aircraft and loading and unloading of patients, medics and passengers even with the mission changes and difficult weather conditions,” said Bell. “Our UH-60L is able to transport up to 13 passengers with a full assortment of seats. In this case, we didn’t need all of them, so we took out the extra seats to make room for the presents, medical equipment and paramedics.”

Less than five minutes after departing Bethel, the helicopter touched down in Napaskiak, delivering the paramedics and medical equipment to stabilize the patient for travel to the local clinic, a process expected to take 30-40 minutes.

The aircrew flew 15 minutes to Tuluksak to deliver the remaining volunteers and gifts.

They immediately returned to Napaskiak to pick up the paramedics and patient. They flew them to the Army Aviation Operating Facility in Bethel, where the patient was transferred to a LifeMed ambulance. As of Nov. 16, the patient was in stable condition and awaiting transport via civilian air ambulance to an Anchorage hospital.

“The integration of the LifeMed folks went seamlessly due to previous detailed cold-load trainings and lessons learned in past joint medevac missions,” said Bell. “The coordination with LifeMed was extremely smooth since Chief Warrant Officer 3 Bryan Kruse was in the hangar during the mission and coordinated with LifeMed, RCC, and (a) state Army aviation officer while the crew continued executing the Op Santa mission simultaneously.”

While the Black Hawk and crew completed the medevac mission, Santa, Mrs. Claus and 10 other Alaska National Guard and Salvation Army volunteers delivered an early Christmas to the children of Tuluksak as planned. After celebrating with gifts, ice cream and photos with Santa, the team loaded back onto the Black Hawk for the trip back to the AKARNG aviation facility, where they transferred to an Alaska Air National Guard C-17 Globemaster III for the final leg back to JBER.

“This mission was a great example of how the Alaska National Guard is able to work jointly between Army, Air Force and multiple civilian agencies to support the local population through state missions like Operation Santa and through federal missions such as this RCC request for assistance,” said Bell. “This mission specifically showcases our abilities to adapt to multiple, rapidly changing missions while operating in adverse weather while still completing them efficiently and safely.”

PINEVILLE, La. – November is Native American and Alaskan Heritage Month, a time to acknowledge the rich and diverse cultures and histories of native Alaskans and Native Americans.

Louisiana Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Bruce A. Phillips Jr. is a proud Native American who has served in the military for over 21 years.

In 2002, Phillips enlisted in the National Guard as an aircraft fueler, reclassing to human resources specialist in 2013. He deployed to Iraq to support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

“From maintaining personnel readiness to ensuring aircraft do not fall from the sky, I enjoy being trained in a variety of skill sets,” said Phillips. “This diversity in skills allows me to better serve the LANG and the people of Jackson Barracks.”

Phillips didn’t plan on a military career.

“My grandfather served in Vietnam,” Phillips explained. “Listening to his stories and watching how he carried himself was a huge influence on me. His guidance has led me in both my military career as well as my personal life.”

His father played a pivotal role in developing an appreciation for his Native American heritage and a positive approach to life.

“I looked up the most to my father,” said Phillips. “He taught me how a man should be, how a man should lead and to be a chief at everything you do. He also taught me to be a good cook and hunter and to provide for my family.”

Phillips continues some of the traditions of his Native American lineage. He attends powwows, has dreamcatchers and uses home remedies.

“I still attend traditional things like powwows, but I especially enjoy fishing and bow hunting. And we Native Americans have such good hair,” he joked.

When not working at Jackson Barracks or responding to natural disasters, Phillips enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.

As a federal technician and reservist with the LANG, Phillips says he understands the benefits of being a Guardsman and serving the community.

“This is an excellent way to earn a college degree while enjoying other benefits the Guard has to offer,” he said. “Living the Guard lifestyle teaches you how to thrive in the civilian world, both mentally and physically. The money and friendships are also an enjoyable part of what the Louisiana National Guard has to offer.”

In 1990, President George H. W. Bush approved a joint resolution designating November 1990 “National American Indian Heritage Month.” Similar proclamations, under variants on the name (including “Native American Heritage Month” and “National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month”), have been issued each year since 1994.

“We are all people under the same roof,” Phillips said. “This month not only benefits Native Americans but people of every heritage that have contributed to what American culture is today. ... We are all in this world together with nowhere else to go, so let’s work together.”

SCHOFIELD BARRACKS – The Army & Air Force Exchange Service’s senior enlisted advisor is ensuring Schofield Barracks Soldiers and their families have what they need to stay ready and resilient.

During his visit to Schofield Barracks on Nov. 16, Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Kevin Osby toured Exchange facilities and met with United States Army Garrison-Hawaii Commander, Col. Steve McGunegle to discuss how the Department of Defense retailer can improve the quality of life for the community.

“The Exchange is all in to make Schofield Barracks a great place to work and live,” said Osby, one of about 30 active-duty service members assigned to the Exchange. “We’re committed to expanding and improving our services and options to best serve the community.”

The Schofield Barracks Exchange recently added name-brand clothing from Old Navy, Gap, American Eagle and Aerie to their lineup giving Soldiers and their families more clothing options.

Earlier this month, the main store started it’s $14.3 million image upgrade project that will give the facility a complete face lift with polish concrete floors throughout, new restrooms and new lighting and paint in the food court. The re-grand opening is scheduled for the middle of next year about the same time their Express completes their remodeling.

Throughout Schofield Barracks, the Exchange has installed nine self-checkout registers at the main store and 22 more at the Expresses and other facilities to help reduce customer wait times. Exchange associates are still available to assist shoppers throughout the store.

Every time service members shop their Exchange—whether in person or at ShopMyExchange.com—they are strengthening their community. 100% of Exchange earnings are reinvested into the military community through funding for critical Quality-of-Life programs, as well as capital improvements. In the last 10 years, the Exchange worldwide has contributed $3.5 billion in earnings to Quality-of-Life programs.

“It matters where you shop,” Osby said. “Small changes can make a big difference in a community. The Exchange is passionate about enhancing the quality of life for our heroes.”",

RAPID CITY, S.D. – Elizabeth “Promise” Crawford was promoted to the rank of sergeant major in the South Dakota Army National Guard during a ceremony on Camp Rapid Nov. 9.

“It gives me great pleasure to be the first to address you as sergeant major. You are an outstanding Soldier, you’ve never disappointed,” said Col. Phillip Stiles. “You are always a hard worker and I have a ton of respect for you. I would send my son or daughter to war underneath you any day, any time.“

Crawford thanked her family for laying the foundation she built her character on — love, passion and courage — and for giving her a life that led her to join the Army.

“I’ve had an amazing career and I’m so glad I get to finish it here at Joint Force Headquarters,” said Sgt. Maj. Crawford.

She joined the Army in 1996 and served five years on active duty, stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, and Vilsek, Germany, before becoming a South Dakota Army National Guard member in 2002.

“She’s very deserving of everything she’s gotten in life and she’s worked very hard to get there, but she didn’t do it alone,“ said Marty Reum, retired U.S. Army combat veteran and mentor to Crawford. “With the support of her family, fellow Soldiers, those past and present, they’ve all influenced her life and helped her get to where she is today.”

Crawford incorporated her culture into her ceremony with a traditional flag song, a prayer and an honor song. She presented three satin star quilts to Stiles, Lt. Col. Brian Hass, and Command Sgt. Maj. Monte Patterson.

“These men have provided me with sound guidance and mentorship that I have often relied upon their expertise and advice for over 20 years,“ she said. “It’s to say thank you for all of the support and encouragement they’ve given me in my career.”

Crawford is from Poplar, Montana, and the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Indian Reservation.

“My advice is to always remember who you are and where you came from, keep yourself grounded to the earth and always carry yourself with pride and respect,” Crawford said.

She served as the supply NCO for the 147th Field Artillery Brigade, senior supply NCO for the 109th Reginal Support Group, 1st sergeant for the 152nd Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, and S4 senior operations sergeant for the 196th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade. Crawford was recently selected to mentor and lead as a member of the Joint Staff, supporting performance excellence programs, the State Partnership Program and domestic operations.

Crawford has deployed on federal missions three times, to Afghanistan in 2013, Kuwait in 2016 and Djibouti in 2020-2021.

“This is incredible,” said U.S. Navy Cmdr. Mary Beth Linnell, an optometrist from the USNS Mercy docked in Majuro, Republic of the Marshall Islands. “This is the whole reason that I decided to stay in the Navy after my initial three-year obligation. This is what I always hoped to do.”

Linnell and her team of Sailors flew to Kwajalein in early November to provide medical assistance and care for the residents of Ebeye recently, providing vision screenings and glasses dispensing to the Kwajalein Elementary School students, along with a dental team providing dental screenings and a cardiologist providing heart exams.

“I was able to deploy back in 2007 and 2009 and I waited until now to do it again,” said Linnell. “This is the best thing I’ve ever done in my 16 years in the Navy – the planning for the mission and the mission itself.”

Linnell explained that her team will go back to Majuro to perform vision screenings and glasses dispensing at the Lara Clinic as well as the Majuro Hospital. She said that the next stop on their Pacific tour will be the Solomon Islands where they will provide medical coverage for the Pacific Games. “I will be going to the outer islands to provide vision screenings again and glasses dispensing. It will be an adventure.""

The largest contingent of Sailors provided dental screenings and dental education to more than 800 students over two days on Ebeye, led by Lt. Cdr. Amie Heim, pediatric dentist with the USNS Mercy.

“For the dental component, we screened and treated about 800 children in the local community. We did exams to find out what kind of dental problems they might have or cavities or infections. We painted fluoride vitamins to make their teeth really strong and then provided dental education to try to teach kids the right way to brush and how to take care of their teeth. Then we used all that information to give to the local dentist at the Ebeye Hospital dental clinic where he will continue to do some of the treatment. We had one of our own dentists over the two days helping with the treatments as well.”

Heim said that this is her first Pacific Partnership mission but she deployed for the Continuing Promise mission last year on the sister hospital ship, the USNS Comfort.

“This is something I really enjoy doing,” said Heim. “In dental school, I always signed up for all the mission trips possible. I always raised my hand. It’s just an honor and a privilege to be able to do it on a much larger scale in the Navy. This time was even more exciting because I go to see it from the ground up in the role of a dental planner.”

Heim was here earlier this summer to meet people in the local community to figure out what the needs are here to come up with a plan together.

What was the response from the community like? “Oh my gosh, it was incredible,” Heim said. “All the kids running in the street after we did some of the education with the big toothbrush. They were so happy and everywhere we went they were welcoming and giving us high fives and saluting us.

“Honestly, I was so very touched by the ceremony at the hospital we attended and all the folks at the hospital and elementary school who came to thank us. From a place that, they will tell you that they don’t have a lot but they have big hearts, you could feel that today. It was just a real honor and a privilege to be able to be a part of that and give back to that community.”

The third aspect of the USNS Mercy visit to Ebeye was having a cardiologist conducting exams on the populace.

U.S. Navy Cdr. Matt Russell, cardiologist with the USNS Mercy, said there was a backlog of about 150 patients who need both pediatric and adult echocardiography.

“The first two days we spent doing mostly adults, looking for patients with heart issues,” Russell said. “In total we did 26 echocardiography studies and saw 26 patients and consultations over the two days. Today we saw 13 pediatric patients of varying conditions from congenital heart disease to rheumatic heart disease, ages 2-17.

Russell explained that this was his first Pacific Partnership. “Clinically, I get exposure to a lot of conditions that I wouldn’t normally see in the United States such as rheumatic heart disease or non-corrected congenital heart disease in kids. Personally these were just wonderful people that I’ve ever met and really terrific doctors. It was a privilege to work with them.”

Russell further explained that “they have a major need for cardiovascular studies and it’s unmet unfortunately. I think we made a dent in the number of echoes that they need and the number of consultations they need but I think they need more.”

Russell’s assistant, HM Ramoune Scarlett, a hospital corpsman from the USNS Mercy said that a lot of the patients aren’t sick right now but could be as adults.

“I think this is crucial to get that information out to help the providers here so they can start treatment now so in the long run they aren’t suffering,” said Scarlett who has done this for six years.

“As a technologist, I am the hands-on guy. I take the images and the doctor does the interpretation.”

Scarlett explained that this was the first time he has deployed in 12 years in the Navy. “I’m happy I came on this trip. You get to see why you are in healthcare. You get to see the why. Being here reminds me so much of being back home (in Jamaica) so it hits home for me being able to help people. Being able to go to poorer countries and identifying what they are going through. It just reinforced my why … as to why I am in healthcare.”",

Steven McGunegle, commander, U.S. Army Garrison Hawai’i and Col. Charles Green, director, Directorate of Emergency Services, met with Representative Trish La Chica on Wednesday November 8, 2023. The discussions, which continued at the Hawai’i Okinawa Center in Waipio Gentry, centered around the pressing issue of homelessness, particularly the encroachment of homeless encampments on federal property in Hawai’i.

The meeting marked a significant effort to engage with Representative La Chica, the elected leader for the Mililani Mauka area, in addressing the challenges posed by homeless encampments. These discussions were crucial for Army Garrison Hawai’i, as the encroachment of civilian homeless populations onto Army managed lands presents unique challenges.

“We’ve been seeing increasing homeless trespassing at several Army locations on Oahu,” said McGunegle. “This meeting was important step forward to discuss the joint effort with city and state officials required to reach collaborative solutions.”

Representative La Chica, who had firsthand experience observing the operations of homeless sweeps, brought valuable insights to the table. The talks delved into the complexities of the homeless situation in Hawai’i, including the logistical hurdles and the coordination required with various agencies.

A significant part of the discussion revolved around the removal of debris and hazardous waste from these sites. The group acknowledged the financial and logistical challenges associated with homeless encampments as key concerns.

In addition to discussing the current situation and challenges, the meeting also opened up conversations about potential long-term solutions and strategies to address the broader issue of homelessness in Hawai’i. This included exploring various models from other areas of the country that could be adapted to the Hawai’ian context.

Overall, the meeting was a constructive step towards fostering collaboration and finding effective solutions to the challenges of homelessness in Hawai’i. The discussions highlighted a shared commitment to addressing this complex issue and the importance of working together across different levels of government.",

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Kevin McGovern first met his future wife, Armie, in Yokohama after a mutual friend introduced them, sparking what would turn into 20 years of marriage.

From their encounter, Armie recalled that she knew Kevin was interested in her, yet she initially wanted to take her time before pursuing a serious relationship.

But Kevin’s cheerful demeanor, and the sacrifices he made for her along the way, made her realize he was the real deal.

“He was the best thing to ever happen in my life,” she said. “He was a great father; he was a great husband. I will never forget him. He’s always in my heart.”

Armie and her family joined several community members for a memorial service Wednesday at the Camp Zama Chapel to celebrate Kevin’s life following his death from natural causes on Sunday. He was 66.

The dedication Kevin showed to Armie and his five children also extended to his work life.

After graduating high school in 1975, Kevin enlisted in the Navy to serve in aviation ordnance. He retired after 21 years of service and moved to Florida where he received a certification in culinary arts.

Kevin used his new skills at several resorts and country clubs before returning to Japan, where he was previously stationed, to be the chef at the Atsugi Enlisted Club. He later worked for the Defense Commissary Agency and then became a cook for Child and Youth Services, or CYS, at Camp Zama.

He also was active with the Veterans of Foreign Wars post here, where he continued to make an impact with other veterans in the area, said Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan.

“I am struck by the exemplary commitment and performance of Kevin,” the colonel said. “He had such a positive attitude and was infused with joy in everything he did and … made everything fun for all who knew him.”

Hunter said Kevin’s legacy will endure through the lives he touched from both his family and many others in the community.

“I will say Kevin will be missed,” he said, “but his spirit lingers in our hearts and, as such, is a true testament to a life well lived.”

Loretta Murray, the CYS coordinator, said Kevin brought so much happiness to the children as he nourished their lives with the meals he served.

When Kevin interviewed for the job four years ago, Murray remembered that he showed his true self to the hiring panel.

“He said, ‘If you hire me, I’m going to be the cook that’s singing, dancing, hanging with the kids and having a party,’” she said. “And that’s what he did. Mr. Kevin was the life of the party.”

Murray said he also displayed that liveliness outside of work as she often saw him and his wife mingling at the VFW or singing karaoke at the Firelight Lounge.

“I will miss his positive energy and attitude, but I am wishing the family the [best] through these trying times,” she said. “We are here to support you all, because while Kevin was part of our CYS family, his family is part of our family as well.”

Kevin’s eldest daughter, Shannon Nease, said she was thankful for the Camp Zama community coming together to honor her father.

“To know my pops was to love him,” she said. “Our very own ‘Mr. Popular’ that was not bothered by others’ opinions or thoughts. He was an amazing father and loved all of us so, so much.”

Nease then spoke of having the opportunity to see her father one last time. She had just arrived at Tokyo Narita Airport from Florida when she got a call from her family to rush to the hospital.

It was the longest bus ride in her life, she said, as she hurried to the hospital to say goodbye to her father.

“My dad waited for me,” she said. “He gave me 10 minutes and for that I am eternally grateful.”

Nease was able to let her father know that everyone was there with him and that they all loved him.

“I will never forget that moment,” she said. “Dad, we love you and we will never forget you.”

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos Commander Col. Lakicia R. Stokes, Directorate of Public Works officials and Camille Wiseman, a woodland ecologist with the Texas A&M Forest Service, celebrated Texas Arbor Day with a tree dedication and proclamation signing ceremony Nov. 9 at the Sportsmen’s Center picnic area here.

“Today is a great day to plant a tree and gather, as we declare Arbor Day at the Great Place,” Stokes said. “I want to thank you all for being here, but most importantly for your skills, your expertise, your dedication and your commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainability.

April is the month National Arbor Day is celebrated, but November is the month Texas celebrates its own Texas Arbor Day because autumn is the best season to plant trees in the state. The ceremony was also a celebration of Fort Cavazos receiving the Tree City USA award for the 18th consecutive year by the Arbor Day Foundation.

“It’s truly an honor to be awarded for the 18th year,” Stokes said. “The Fort Cavazos Arbor Day proclamation signing is a reminder of how simple acts can create healthy communities, while searching for hope for a better tomorrow.”

The Tree City USA program is sponsored by the Arbor Day Foundation in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters.

“This team is so inspired and motivated, doing such good work being persistent about planting trees, and continuing the effort that it takes to be a Tree City USA community,” Wiseman said. “Celebrating 18 years as trailblazers is a great example to share for other organizations and installations to follow suit.”

Fort Cavazos achieved Tree City USA recognition by meeting the program’s four requirements: a tree board or department, a tree-care ordinance, an annual community forestry budget of at least $2 per capita and an Arbor Day observance and proclamation.

“Our biologists, environmental professionals and community partners serve as a bridging element and bring together communities to create lasting change,” Stokes said. “Thank you for continuing to highlight Fort Cavazos’ commitment to environmental stewardship, and also to creating beautification in green spaces.”

Highlights of Fort Cavazos’ accomplishments included planting 360 trees; pruning and watering more than 3,627 trees; and overseeing design and landscaping plans for construction projects.

“As we look forward, I encourage not only Team Cavazos here but other military installations and our surrounding communities to celebrate and support our efforts on planting and protecting trees,” Stokes said.

Wiseman recognized Fort Cavazos’ successes in maintaining a green space and the symbolism of planting the ceremonial bur oak tree.

“There’s not just environmental sustainability in mind but also the sustainability of this installation that continues to grow,” she said. “The planting of a tree is symbolic and important that you’re not just keeping what exists already. You are improving upon what you have — it’s a great joy to see all the motivation.”

KILLEEN, Texas — Citizens, Soldiers, veterans and families of the Central Texas community lined the streets Nov. 11 in downtown Killeen for the Veterans Day Parade hosted by the City of Killeen and the Central Texas Area Veteran Advisory Committee here.

This year’s parade entries participated with a variety of Soldiers, floats, marching bands from the Killeen Independent School District, and the U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, Col. Lakicia Stokes, as the parade’s grand marshal. The parade serves as a way for the local community to show their appreciation to the veteran and active-duty community alike.

“There’s everything from Soldiers from Fort Cavazos, there’s cars, antique cars, motorcycles, a lot of nice floats. It’s just a great day to come out and see everybody’s kind of creativity come to life and supporting the Soldiers and veterans in our community,” said Pat Christ, co-chair for Central Texas AVAC.

Children waited eagerly on the sidewalk to collect the candy that was being thrown to them from people in the parade.

Shortly before the festivities began, Lori Spencer, AVAC member and spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Day National Committee, presented City of Killeen Mayor Debbie Nash-King a document declaring Killeen, Harker Heights and Copperas Cove as regionally recognized sites for Veterans Day celebrations as citizens, local organizations and friends and families gathered in front of Killeen City Hall looked on.

“Mayor Nash-King’s late husband began this back in 2014. And he did a lot of work to ensure that we were recognized as regional site from the Department of Veterans Affairs,” Spencer said. “I’ve been so honored to be able to take that on and so for the 10th year in a row, the cities of Killeen, Harker Heights and Copperas Cove area has been designated a Veterans Day regional site. It is my honor to present this declaration to Mayor Nash-King on behalf of the Area Veterans Advisory Committee and the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Day National Committee.”

Mayor Nash-King offered opening remarks and kicked off the parade with some encouraging words.

“I’d like to thank you all for attending and thank you for recognizing our area as a regional site for Veterans Day celebration,” Nash-King said. “We stand behind our Soldiers, veterans and their families and it is an honor for me to be able to say thank you for all you do, all you’ve done and the sacrifices that were made for this great nation. Thank you.”

Each year the Central Texas AVAC sponsors the event, according to city officials. AVAC is comprised of all the veteran organizations from Nolanville, Harker Heights and Killeen.",

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Several days of rain provided much needed water to Belton Lake, but also created dense, muddy terrain that was a challenge to maneuver in, let alone conduct the largest combat exercise here in three years.

Remagen Ready 24-1 was a blended live and constructive, joint, multi-echelon, division-sized combined arms exercise that included a contested gap crossing.

Soldiers participated in a hands-on tactical exercise Oct. 30 – Nov. 9, which tested the brigade’s proficiency in navigating a wet gap crossing; moving troops, light and heavy vehicles and supplies from one side of Belton Lake to the other; and reinforced the vital training required to be “ready to deploy, fight, sustain and win in multi-domain operations anywhere in the world,” according to III Armored Corps.

“It doesn’t matter that you have the world’s greatest tank ready, if you can’t get it to where it needs to be,” said Maj. Brian Harris, chief of community relations, III Armored Corps. “The ability to move and not to get bogged down and to advance is so crucial, and so in III Armored Corps, you know, that can’t be more important to us.

“So, this is one step in the evolution of figuring out how we can use the sort of unique aspects of Fort Cavazos, which includes the fact that we have Belton Lake here and that we own both sides of it,” he continued. “And so, we can do something like this which oftentimes at installations you’re not able to do.”

An exercise of this magnitude could not function independently of the many Garrison tenants that provide constructive services and resources support.

Nearly 60 civilian team members from across the Directorate of Plans, Training, Mobilization and Security collaborated to provide range operations support, devices and secure and schedule training areas.

“It’s very important to provide them with training neighbors to assist training units on the installation to be successful,” said Chris Hoffman, chief of training for DPTMS.

The Fort Cavazos Fire Department arranged emergency medical, water rescue and hazmat response support and was prepared to render first aid and water rescue measures at a moment’s notice.

Additionally, more than a dozen volunteer personnel from Morgan’s Point Dive Team provided additional water rescue support.

“The safety of the Soldiers is important,” said Andrew Lima, chief of the Fort Cavazos Fire Department. “If we don’t have the assets for personnel, then we don’t have an exercise. To keep those guys safe at all times, that’s why it’s very important that we were there.”

Maj. Edwin Martinez, deputy corps engineer for Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, III Armored Corps, described the partnership as symbiotic.

“We could not do an exercise of this scale without working hand in hand with the Garrison entities,” he said. “The digital environment, the systems, the hardware, everything enables us to do this.

“We are interconnected. Fort Cavazos installation and the Fort Cavazos units, we have to work hand in hand,” Martinez continued. “When we all work together for the common goal to train our Soldiers and our armed forces, we train our young men and women to be ready and that’s our purpose. We’re working together to achieve that goal.”

Trudging in boot-deep mud, Soldiers from the 74th Multi-Road Bridge Company, 62nd Engineer Battalion, 36th Engineer Brigade, worked to assemble an Improved Ribbon Bridge consisting of ramps and interior bays to create a floating roadway that allows Soldiers, their vehicles and equipment to cross the waterway safely.

M30 Bridge Erection Boats attached to the sides of the IRB guided sections into place and kept the fully assembled structure from floating off site due to the current.

Soldiers drove Bradley Fighting Vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and fuel trucks, onto the IRB to float the machinery approximately 1,700 meters, or a little more than a mile, to the opposite side of the lake.

“It may look like a relatively small gap that they’re crossing,” Harris said. “(Yet) it’s a significant effort to do it right, to do it safely.”

Soldiers were also tasked with completing the crossing while negotiating obscured vision due to thick smoke emitting from non-toxic fog oil canisters.

“It’s a representation of the current operating environments, the current battlefield that we foresee, and we have to move, we have to learn to operate in these conditions,” Martinez explained.

The water crossing began the morning of Nov. 3 and was expected to take a couple of days to complete according to Lt. Col. Tania Donovan, deputy public affairs officer for III Armored Corps.

She explained that the wet gap crossing is just one aspect of the exercise.

“While this is what we are seeing right now, really the entire Remagen Ready exercise is focused on large scale combat operations,” Donovan explained. “It is 24/7 where they test out everything from communication capabilities talking to units all across the battlefield, talking to each other, coordinating, synchronizing.

“In order to have and put together an exercise for the Soldiers, we need planners, we need facilities, we need the support to really identify the objective, set it on the map for the Soldiers and also, play the other side,” she continued. “In this exercise, we have Garrison capabilities doing that, we have a lot of our civilians focused on the systems that are required to facilitate the training for the Soldiers.”

More than 100 civilians collaborated with roughly 6,000 Soldiers from 1st Cavalry Division, III Armored Corps Headquarters, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command, 11th Signal Brigade, 36th Engineer Brigade, 75th Field Artillery Brigade, 504th Military Intelligence Brigade and 3rd Air Support Operations Group, in the exercise and more than 700 wheeled vehicles and nearly 160 tracked vehicles crossed the wet gap during the nearly two-week training.

Harris said the long-term goal is to see if Fort Cavazos can eventually become the gap crossing training headquarters for other installations.

“For now, it’s training tenant units at Fort Cavazos, but there’s a belief that there’s other units around the Army that potentially could use this kind of training,” he explained. “And so, this is the next step in testing out our ability to do it here; can we get it to the point where we could potentially be able to offer it as an option to units that are deploying. Maybe it becomes a training center that’s not just for Fort Cavazos.”",

Fort George G. Meade, Md. – Sailors assigned to U.S. Fleet Cyber Command/U.S. TENTH Fleet focused on self-care and holistic nutrition during a cooking class at Fort Meade’s Kuhn Hall, the Education and Resiliency Center, Nov. 1.

Offered upon request, ""Meal in a Mug,"" aims to assist service members residing in the barracks with healthy meal options and meals prepared using only a mug, a microwave, and a few utensils. During the demonstration and meal preparation, the Sailors prepared two, 2-minute healthy meals, each costing less than $2.00. The course is open to all service members, military family members, and Department of Defense (DoD) ID cardholders, and provides recipes and hands-on experience.

“This class is about laying the foundation for a good whole foods diet,” said Dr. Shari Youngblood, a professor at the University of Maryland, who is also board certified in personalized nutrition. As a self-professed “Army brat,” she volunteers to teach the course at Fort Meade to help service members.

The Demonstration Kitchen at Kuhn Hall was designed by the Fort Meade Alliance, an advocacy group to promote lifelong culinary and nutritional skills.

“There is a lot of confusion around nutrition. We all have cultural and powerful emotional associations with food,” Youngblood said. “Food is the most powerful way of fixing [or avoiding] a health condition.”

“Food facilitates mental, spiritual, emotional and physical wellness,” she said.

One has to be well to perform well, and food habits can be taught, there’s a natural connection between wellness and readiness, she said.

As Cyber professionals, the Sailors duties may require flexible hours and long days. Protecting the DoD’s networks is work that requires dedication 24/7/365 days a year. The force is agile, resilient and responsive to facilitate intelligence, logistics and combat support functions to the Fleet and Combatant Commanders. Fleet Cyber Command is a tenant command at Fort George G. Meade, which employs more than 64,000 personnel, many with specialties in intelligence, information and cyber operations.

One of the Sailors who participated said, learning to cook healthy foods on the run is important and he appreciated the opportunity to participate.

“Growing up, I really didn’t learn to cook,” he said. “I want to be able to cook my own food, three meals a day.”

The Sailors learned to make a Coffee Mug Quiche, Protein-packed quick oats and received other recipes to share with the unit.

Likewise, the other Sailor who participated said buying fast food is expensive and not ideal for personnel living in the barracks. She recalled the resourcefulness of the junior enlisted personnel when it comes to food preparation but said the demonstration kitchen and the course offers new insight.

“We want our service members and community members on the installation to know the demonstration kitchen is available for use,” said Chad Jones, public affairs officer. “The education, resiliency center promotes well-being and can serve as another outlet for continuing education, personal growth and development.”

“We hope the Sailors spread the word,” said Jones. “The class, and the Demonstration Kitchen are open to the community. Our hope is that it’s a safe space for all personnel, units and families.”

Any community members interested in the nutrition program can contact Noelle Austin-Jones, director of Fort Meade Armed Forces Wellness Center at 301-677-2006.",

WASHINGTON — The Army’s artillery production doubled in the last year with the service currently producing 28,000 155-millimeter howitzer rounds a month.

The dramatic uptick comes as the Army expanded its capacity at current facilities while looking to bring new ones into the mix next year.

""We will have taken, over a couple years, what was a very fragile, admittedly, industrial base and dramatically improved its strength,” said Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology.

The need for the increased artillery comes in response to supporting the war in Ukraine, the recent conflict in Israel and replenishing U.S. stockpiles. The service has sent more than two million rounds to Ukraine thus far.

Currently, the Army ships steel from Ohio to two facilities in Pennsylvania, the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, and a sister facility in Wilkes-Barre. These two plants turn 2,000-pound steel rods into two-foot-tall artillery shells.

The shells are then transported to the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, where they are filled with explosives and sealed. The propellent and charges for the rounds are mostly produced at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant in Virginia and the Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Tennessee.

Throughout this year, the Army expanded production at these facilities by constructing new buildings, installing new equipment and improving automation. These upgrades helped double the Army’s artillery production rate, Bush said.

With the expanded capacity at current facilities, the Army is shifting its focus in fiscal year 2024 toward bringing brand-new production facilities into the manufacturing process. This will give the service multiple sources for each production step.

“Which is what you want in the ammunition production world,” Bush said. “You don’t want one building being the single point of failure.”

The service is building a new factory in Mesquite, Texas, and it awarded a contract last year to a Canadian company to build the artillery shells. It is also funding two new facilities to load the shells with explosives. One will be in Arkansas, and the other will be in Kansas.

The improved production process is part of the Army’s modernization plan to bring the industrial base into the 21st century. Current and future Army readiness requires modernization on a sustainable path that develops, implements, and deploys new technologies to deter current and emerging threats.

Bush said the Army aims to increase 155-millimeter production to 60,000 by next summer and to 100,000 by the end of 2025. The 100,000-round goal is largely contingent on the approval of President Joe Biden’s request to Congress for fiscal year 2024 emergency supplemental funding, which has $3.1 billion for 155-millimeter artillery production and facility modernization.

""This important legislation is needed to make sure the Army is ready to meet the growing challenges we face today, and in the future,” Bush said. “It will strengthen our industrial base to ensure we can supply our defense needs while we serve as the arsenal of democracy for our allies.”

FORT RILEY, Kansas – Inside the brain of a division-level combat operation exists a complex neural network consisting of dozens of shops and hundreds of people working towards a common objective.

Over a ten-day period, Danger Ready 2, an exercise designed to train elements of the 1st Infantry Division on the scope and scale of large-scale combat operations implemented multiple movements to test the unit's ability to break down and rebuild functioning sites.

Logistics elements play a key role in all warfighting capacities. The ability to sustain a fighting force often is the difference between victory and defeat. These commodities are the lifeblood of any combat element. In a strenuous environment, knowing what a unit needs is equally as important as knowing how to supply it.

“I believe we are replicating what happens overseas,” said Sgt. 1st Class Tyler Robinson, senior movements noncommissioned officer assigned to the 1st Sustainment, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Division Materials Center, 1st Inf. Div. “It’s great training. It’s kind of rough at times but that’s what refines you and makes you better.”

The second stage of the Danger Ready exercise implemented more advanced warfighting techniques, which focused on perfecting the art of synchronizing time and space in a hostile environment where large forces are engaged with one another. Soldiers reviewed satellite imagery, studied by geospatial analysts, conducted two-minute briefing drills that highlighted key decision points in the simulated battle space and coordinated rapid relocation of key combat assets.

Elements belonging to the 1st Inf. Div.’s Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, Sustainment Brigade, Signal Company and Division Artillery, trained in tandem with Soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Division and the U.S. Army’s V Corps, who are currently operating in Poland, in preparation for Warfighter, a capstone exercise synchronizing the U.S. Army and Allied forces across the globe on more sophisticated operational standards.

“Character development is very important when it comes to day-to-day operations,” said Spc. Bilend Amin a geospatial intelligence imagery analyst assigned to Signal Company, Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 1st Inf. Div. “Part of being an enlisted Soldier there are going to be times where you're going to do grunt work, where you're going to have to help set everything up.

“You’re not just going to walk in and just do your job. Sometimes it requires you to get your hands dirty and set up some C-wire or help run cable or clean up equipment or facilities to maintain the area that you work in.”

Like logistics, accurate reconnaissance of an enemy’s composition and disposition informs senior leaders and provides them with an accurate representation of the battle space as it evolves over time.

“We are responsible for full motion imagery,” said Amin. “This information feeds the other sections of the division staff providing location of the enemy forces in time and space.”

Communication amongst headquarters elements leads to appropriate decisions which, in turn, fine tunes the ability for the division and allied elements to function in synchronization with one another.

“It’s going to start going faster and faster,” said U.S. Army Col. Terry R. Tillis, the 1st Infantry Division deputy commanding officer for maneuver, during one of many two-minute drills. “Your reports are important.”

Providing efficient and accurate communication at every level allows for effective moves to be made on a battlefield. In active combat environments, relaying accurate and timely information to senior officers can make the difference between success and failure. In this simulated environment, officers and noncommissioned officers are offered the opportunity to improve the level of detail and the speed at which accurate information is transferred.

“We should be building upon this every time,” said Tillis. “We are doing this to try and be better.”

For each Soldier the end state of training exercises is in understanding the capabilities of a division involved in a large-scale combat operation and their role in maintaining those capabilities.

The series of Danger Ready training events will continue to build upon one another, improving lethal functions of the 1st Inf. Div. and its ability to operate in any combat environment as it prepares for Warfighter 2024.",

FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. – Fort Meade broke ground on the construction of two new buildings, the Freedom Center IV barracks, in ceremonies Nov. 9. The barracks will house 380 enlisted service members from all military branches when complete.

Special guest speaker, Gen. Paul Nakasone, Commander U.S. Cyber Command, Chief Central Security Service (CSS) and the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), identified those service members in his remarks. “It’s going to be members of the Central Security Service, 40 percent of NSA’s workforce, the Marines, the Soldiers, the Sailors, the Airmen, the Guardians, the Coast Guardsmen that make up the analysts and linguists and reporters that ensure that the National Security Agency can do its principal missions of signals intelligence and cyber security.

This is a world-class facility for a world-class workforce,” said Nakasone.

Gen. Nakasone also talked about the cooperation it took to get to this stage. “It’s been a partnership, the partnership of U.S. Army Garrison Fort (George G.) Meade led by Col. Michael Sapp, Directorate of Public Works (DPW), obviously working very hard to make sure that we have everything that we need, and my incredible team, Installations and Logistics led by Mr. Randy Westfall at the National Security Agency. I also pass along my thanks to our representatives and certainly our congressional leaders that have been so key for us to be able to ensure that we have the funding and resources to be able to build such world-class facilities,” he said.

Col. Michael Sapp, Commander, U.S. Army Garrison Fort George G. Meade also emphasized the importance of partnership. “As you know, the combined effort between the NSA and the U.S. Army Garrison (Fort George G. Meade) to fund this facility could only happen because of the partnership and cooperation. When we combine our efforts, we can do so many great things.”

“These buildings and the joint service members that will reside in them are another reminder of the incredible talent and skills that we need to attract and retain service members with skills that the nation needs so dearly. It should not be underestimated and cannot be overstated the quality housing and the impact it will have on morale and the quality of work,” Sapp added.

The Freedom Center IV project represents the first phase of the long-term barracks solution at Fort Meade. “A solution that’s vital for this installation’s growing mission, as it provides tenants with the proper, necessary housing that they deserve,” said Lt. Col. David Myers, Deputy District Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Baltimore District).

Garrison Housing Chief, Aimee Stafford, who also served as the ceremony’s emcee said, “This project has been a long time coming, over 10 years. With included kitchenettes, it will be quite an upgrade from the barracks that will be demolished by the time this project is complete.”

Officials of the Freedom Center IV project have set a target completion date in the Fall of 2025.",

BARRINGTON, Ill. - Overcast skies and blustery, cold wind could not stop the patriotic spirit from burning brightly during the Village of Barrington’s Veterans’ Day ceremony, November 10, 2023.

Veterans and civilians gathered to listen to remarks from Karen Darch, Barrington Village President and Captain Michael Ariola, Public Affairs Officer, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, based in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

“Today we say thank you to our veterans and those serving in the military,” said Darch. “Thank you to all for being with us today.”

Darch’s family shares in a rich family lineage of service in the armed forces.

“My dad served in the Army Air Corp during World War II. It was wonderful growing up with a dad who was a veteran. My husband served in the U.S. Navy. He was in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps during college and served on two different destroyers.” said Darch.

“It’s important to remember the sacrifice of those who have served our country and it’s important to be grateful for it,” said Darch. “We are very thankful for our veterans in the community.”

In the audience, Paul Corwin, Navy veteran from Barrington, listened to the Village President’s words and recounted his own military service.

“I attended Lane Technical High School in Chicago and graduated in 1962. I went into the Navy in 1965 and trained to be a nuclear plant operator. My job was to take samples and do surveys of radioactive areas,” he said. “I lost my best friend who was a radio operator with the U.S. Marines. He was killed in Vietnam.”

Corwin served on two ships during his Navy service. The U.S.S. Bainbridge and U.S.S. Cavalier, a Bayfield class attack transport, which operated in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Ariola spoke about the history of Veteran’s Day.

“As many of you know, we celebrate Veterans Day on the anniversary of the Armistice that ended the First World War. On November 11th, 1918, the armistice agreement was signed in a railroad car in Compiegne, France,” said Ariola.

In 1954, Congress changed the name from Armistice Day to Veterans Day to honor all veterans who served the nation.

“On Veterans’ Day, we honor the brave men and women from all walks of life who have stepped forward to defend our nation throughout our history,” said Ariola.

Barrington resident Rich Bowman served in the U.S. Air Force from 1962 to 1967. He is an ROTC graduate from Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois.

“I was in logistics and transportation,” said Bowman. “In Vietnam, I ran a small air terminal. My men loaded and unloaded cargo from cargo planes because it was too dangerous to use the roads.""

Bowman completed his military service at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii.

“They needed people who had served in Vietnam. It was a good experience. People always thank me for my service. It was the highlight of my life,” Bowman said.

Ariola paid tribute to what is the greatest asset in the U.S. military. The people who serve day and night in defense of the nation.

“Our all-volunteer force is a credit to Americans of all races, genders and creeds; and our common commitment to defense of, and love for, our country binds and unites us together. That goes to the heart of what it means to be an American,” Ariola said.",

FORT BARFOOT, Va. – Virginia National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crews completed aerial firefighting support and Soldiers and Airmen began ground firefighting training Nov. 11.

After Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Nov. 6, aviation crews assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 224th Aviation Regiment, 29th Infantry Division, used two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters equipped with 660-gallon water buckets to drop almost 22,800 gallons of water on fires in Madison County through Nov. 9. Two helicopters flew missions in Patrick County Nov. 11, dropping nearly 13,900 gallons of water.

“Our helicopter crews mobilized and deployed in record time to provide additional resources to help the Virginia Department of Forestry in the fight against multiple large wildfires,” said Brig. Gen. Todd H. Hubbard, the VNG director of the Joint Staff. “Our partner agencies depend on the VNG to rapidly respond with requested capabilities when needed, and we are really proud of how quickly and safely our Soldiers responded.”

Approximately 30 VNG Soldiers and Airmen conducted the field day exercise portion of wildland firefighter training with the Virginia Department of Forestry Nov. 12 at Fort Barfoot after a day of online training. Guard members received personal protective equipment

and focused on basic tools, familiarization with bulldozers and engines, fireline construction and proper fire shelter use.

Once their training is complete, the troops will deploy where needed by DOF for ground support.

“The Soldiers and Airmen coming together to train for a possible ground support mission are from Virginia Army and Air National Guard units across Virginia, to include our 12M Army firefighters assigned to the Fort Barfoot Fire Department,” Hubbard said. “I am sure they are going to be a welcome sight to the crews who have been fighting wildfires for weeks, and we expect them to provide additional capabilities to allow some people to rest or help speed up the effort to finish getting the fires under control. It really is an honor to work with such dedicated professionals towards a common goal.”

Additional Soldiers and Airmen, members of the Virginia Defense Force and Virginia Department of Military Affairs employees are providing operations center, administrative, logistical and public information support in Richmond and Fort Barfoot.

“We owe a special thanks to the loved ones of all our personnel who are on duty as well their employers,” Hubbard said. “Without their support, we would not be able to accomplish our mission.”

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — The month of November started off productive with the annual Red, White and You Career Fair Nov. 1 at the Lone Star Conference Center at Fort Cavazos.

The Texas Workforce Commission, Workforce Solutions of Central Texas and the Texas Medical Center collaborated with the Fort Cavazos Transition Assistance Program to organize the event.

The event is one of three major career fairs held annually at Fort Cavazos to connect transitioning service members, military spouses, veterans and family members with hundreds of employers waiting to put service members’ unique skill sets to work for their respective companies.

Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, welcomed employers and anxious job seekers.

“This joint hiring event with team Cavazos and Workforce Solutions of Central Texas is one way that we improve the quality of life for our transitioning Soldiers, veterans and families,” she began. “This event plays a crucial role in helping Soldiers, veterans and families transition to civilian life successfully by connecting them with employment opportunities, resources and support, while also recognizing their contributions to the community and the nation. This is all about taking care of people.”

Almost two-hundred employers in a variety of career fields set up tables throughout the venue and spoke to a steady stream of interested parties about what their organizations offered and the types of positions available.

Jerry Hernandez, marketing manager for the Fort Cavazos TAP, explained that events like this are vital to help transitioning service members prepare for civilian life.

“What Soldiers need to understand when they get out of the military … right now they get their basic pay, they get their BAQ (Basic Allowance for Quarters), they get the medical and housing all paid for,” he explained. “When they get out to civilian life, that’s no longer covered. So, now they have to pay their medical, their housing, all that good stuff.”

Hernandez added that connecting Soldiers with hundreds of employers under one roof makes it a lot more convenient to find their next careers.

“It’s much easier,” he said. “Soldiers working on Fort Cavazos don’t have to go outside the installation or get transportation. So, that’s why we do it.”

Spc. Shakera King, 115th Brigade Support Battalion, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, said she appreciated being able to connect with numerous employers in one venue.

“Events like this help us. It’s during the workday, our jobs know that this is where we have to go, and we can meet all these people at one time. You can meet everybody at once, so that is really, really great.”

Representatives from “The HOP” were on hand to talk to potential hires about positions as bus drivers on Fort Cavazos. The organization will start micro transit services on post and is hiring Soldiers, veterans and military family members to fill approximately 50 part-time driving positions at $18 hourly, starting in February 2024.

“The base was kind enough to find us a home here, which will be based out of Fort Cavazos for all of our Fort Cavazos transit needs,” said Derek Czapnik, transportation superintendent for the HOP.

“This is going to be a game changer,” he said. “This is going to give the quality of life to a lot of one car families or single Soldiers or anybody that doesn’t want to drive. It’s going to be just a wonderful addition to the community.”

Two brothers from St. Paul, Minnesota joined the U.S. Army in 1917 as the United States was drawn into the First World War. One sacrificed his life serving in the Great War. The other survived a gas attack, returned to Minnesota, and started a family. Several generations hence, his great-grandson, inspired by his family’s legacy of service, is back in Europe with the U.S. Army’s 3rd Infantry Division protecting freedom once again.

It all started when U.S. Army Pfc. Frank Dingle from St. Paul Minnesota, joined in 1917. His brother U.S. Marine Pvt. Richard Wallace Dingle joined the Marine Corps April 20, 1917, just 14 days after the U.S. declared war.

Both brothers fought in World War 1. Frank was attached to the U.S. Army Ambulance Corps from 1917 to 1919, while Richard was an infantryman attached to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. Richard fought in the famed Battle of Belleau Wood where he was killed in action June 6, 1918, at the age of 20 years old.

His brother Frank survived World War I despite a gas attack and received the French Croix De Guerre Medal March 17, 1919 followed by an award citation from a field marshal from the French-East Army.

“Since entering service in the division, he has shown the most robust qualities of courage and dedication,” the award citation read. “During the night of October 1, 1918, despite great fatigue and great disturbances coming from a wave of gas, refused to be replaced and continued his service until all the wounded were evacuated.”

After returning from the war, Frank went to Pine River, Minnesota to become a dentist. In 1921, he founded American Legion Post 98 in St. Paul Park, Minnesota with the help of fellow local World War I veterans and named the Legion hall after his brother, Richard.

A generation later, following in the service of his grandfather, John Dingle joined the U.S. Army in May 1982.

“I wanted to be an Airborne Ranger,” he said.

Determined, he started his military career in basic training, then completed advanced individual training (AIT), as well as the airborne, and air assault schools.

“It’s about taking the challenge in front of you,” John said. “It’s what defines you.”

He was initially assigned to the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade combat team, 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. He was later transferred to the 2nd Ranger Battalion at Fort Lewis, Washington. During this time, he completed Ranger School.

He served with the Ranger Battalion until 1986 and decided to attend college at Saint Martins University in Washington State, where he joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.

“My proudest moment is getting through it all, basic training, AIT, airborne, air assault, Ranger School, and getting to where I wanted to be,” John said. “The second proudest would be commissioning as an officer.”

John served as an officer until 1991 at the age of 32.

“My life would have been drastically different if it wasn’t for the military,” John said.

Starting a family a few years later, John has four children. Three of the four sons, including his son Jordan, decided to follow in the footsteps of their family’s Veterans and joined the military.

“Service has always been on my mind since I was a little kid,” Jordan said. “I was always surrounded by it growing up and my dad would always talk about his time in the service.”

He attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and was commissioned as an armor officer May 21, 2022.

Jordan graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in military history and landed in the top 30 percent of his class.

Like his father, Jordan began completing tough training and military courses, like the U.S. Army’s Armor Basic Officer Leader Course, the Bradley Commander’s Course, and the Scout Leader Course.

“The most challenging of the courses was the Armor Basic Officer Leader Course,” Jordan said. “I had to learn to fight mounted on an (M1A2) Abrams which is similar to fighting dismounted, but maneuvering tanks provides a greater tactical challenge. It was definitely a learning curve.”

He eventually was assigned to the “Rock of the Marne,” the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division, which earned its nickname for its heroics on the same French battlefields of the First World War where his great grandfather and great-great uncle served. In fact, the 3rd Infantry Division fought alongside U.S. Marine Corps units during the Battle of Belleau Wood near the Marne River in 1918, where Jordan’s great-great uncle was killed in action.

“It’s probably my proudest moment in my military career to join the 3rd Infantry Division,” said Jordan. “The history of this unit is very inspiring: from the Thunder Runs in Baghdad, Vietnam, most campaigns in the European theater of war during the Second World War, and then back to my lineage, World War I.”

Like many service members, Jordan, who is currently deployed in Eastern Europe, looks to his fellow Veterans and his family’s legacy of service as a source of inspiration in his own service.

Members of the Dingle family have served in World War II, Vietnam, and Afghanistan to the present day in addition to Jordan’s service with the 3rd Infantry Division in Europe.

“I think it’s humbling to be able to serve in Europe just like previous Dingles,” Jordan said. “I am proud of my family for serving, especially my great-grandfather, and great-great-uncle, for their sacrifices. They represented the family well for the service they gave and I want to thank them for their impact on my life even though I’ve never met them.”

Veterans Day takes on a special meaning for Jordan. It’s important to him to not only reflect on family members who have served or those who continue to serve, like his brothers, but it’s important to remember all those who have served for the United States, he said.

“Ultimately it’s about selfless service and sacrifice,” Jordan said. “Most people see military sacrifice through the lens of combat, but it also encompasses the day-to-day sacrifice. It harkens back to being told what you do, even if it’s not something you want to do, you do it. Service members choose to join the military, to be something bigger than themselves, to give back to the country, and to challenge themselves every day. That’s why we honor service members on Veterans’ Day.”

Jordan’s service may very well inspire another generation of his family or other Americans to follow in his footsteps of service one day, just as previous generations of Dingles inspired him. He wants to continue being the best he can be for his unit and country. He hopes to attend law school someday and continue his service in the Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps. At the same time, his brothers are currently serving elsewhere in the U.S. Army. Capt. Jack Dingle is the commander of Alpha “Able” Company, 3rd Battalion, 509 Infantry (Airborne) in Anchorage, Alaska, and 2nd Lt. Jared Dingle is attending the Infantry Basic Officer Leadership Course at Fort Moore, Georgia.

As for John, he has plans to retire and move to Florida within the year.

“I am very proud of all four of my boys,” John said. “What comes to mind when I think of Jordan, he’s very intellectual. He enjoys learning and sharing his knowledge. I’m proud of what he has accomplished so far in his career, and I can’t wait to see what he does in the future.”",

WASHINGTON – As the air raid sirens and mortar blasts went off, medical evacuation crews dropped the wounded off at a hospital near the demilitarized zone. Young nurses worked around-the-clock to treat the injured despite attacks from the Viet Cong in South Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam War.

Some of the nurses never made it back and are honored on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Many of the other women gather each year at the Vietnam Women’s Memorial for camaraderie and to share stories of the past. This Saturday several of those women will celebrate the memorial’s 30th anniversary in Washington.

Call to Service

Many female combat veterans were following in their family members’ footsteps when they joined the Army.

Two former first lieutenants described their family connections. Patti Ehline’s father served in World War II and Vietnam. Her future husband was also joining the Army and would serve in Vietnam with her. Mary “Edie” McCoy Meeks commissioned into the military because her brother joined the Marines.

Capt. Diane Carlson Evans became an Army nurse because her brother served in the 101st Airborne Division, and then her other brother was drafted. Mary Breed, also a first lieutenant, joined after losing family members and a friend. Her brother was injured in Vietnam in 1968; a friend from her church was killed; and her girlfriend’s brother died.

“I was closely affected by the war,” she said.

Eileen King, then a second lieutenant, didn’t have any family members who served but felt a call to service. “There was a lot of criticism about America, what it stood for, especially about our military,” she said. “I wanted to serve my country. I felt very protective of my nation and the military. I wanted to do my bit.”

Nurse Recruiting

Jobs for women were limited in the 1960s. Many of the female nurse candidates were in nursing school when Army recruiters contacted them about joining the Army Nurse Corps.

“They were desperate for nurses over in Vietnam. They were desperate for stateside nurses to take care of the wounded because the Army hospitals needed staff,” Breed said.

As a student nurse, Breed received permission from her parents to enlist and sought out an Army recruiter. “I said, ‘I’m going to graduate next year as a registered nurse. How do I go to Vietnam?’” Carlson Evans said. “The Army offered the Army Student Nurse Program because there was a shortage of military nurses. They paid my tuition, my books and my uniforms my senior year in college. It was nice.”

They all said they passed their state boards, enlisted as private first classes for basic training, and then commissioned into the Army Nurse Corps.

In the trenches

The Viet Cong dug tunnels under the hospitals and stole equipment while the nurses worked in shifts that lasted 12 hours or longer. Soldiers would go into the tunnels to retrieve equipment but some would die from fatal cobra attacks.

The nurses learned techniques such as starting intravenous lines in the dark, performing amputations and working with burn patients.

“We had to measure up. When a Soldier came in and his life depended on us, we learned quickly,” Evans said. “We were the youngest nurses ever sent into battle. We had energy and stamina. We wanted to do our job. We were given a mission. We wanted to get each other home alive.

The men sandbagged the hooches and hospitals as they were rocketed and mortared. They were in the guard towers, some standing guard, getting killed, protecting us. We were in the hospitals saving lives.”

She said they heard artillery rounds 24 hours a day.

“We got used to the sounds of war, but we pulled together as a team. The men valued our service, and we valued theirs,” Carlson Evans said.

Breed worked at the 18th Surgical Hospital, which sat close to the demilitarized zone, and the 95th Evacuation Hospital.

“Sometimes you would have at least four doctors [working] on the same patient at the same time,” she said. “In the U.S., doctors take turns. Everybody had to work at once as quickly as possible to save the patient’s life and then move on to the next patient.”

“There was a tremendous team effort in caring for our patients,” Capt. Elaine Niggemann added. “We worked long hours but everyone pitched in. Some days were very hard but the camaraderie among us was great. It was enlightening to go from a college atmosphere to a war zone caring for patients.”

Memorable Patients

While nurses remember quite a few of their patients, each of the nurses have memorable patients from Vietnam.

King worked with a pilot who had lost both of his legs and one of his arms.

“It was obvious he was going to die. I don’t remember his name; I feel so guilty about it,” she said.

She said she went to the bathroom and when she came back, she saw that someone had left a letter for him.

It was from his wife and had a photo of his wife and child in it. “She told him she loved him,” she said.

Although King was tired from working a double shift, she said she didn’t want to leave. King finally had to rest for a few hours before her next shift. The pilot died 20 minutes later.

“For years, I wondered if I had just stayed, would he have lived longer? But I did my best,” she said.

Edie Meeks said an encounter with a young Soldier from Kansas still haunts her.

“I read a letter to him from his mom. She talked about his dad just coming in from pheasant hunting with his dog. At the end, she said, ‘We’re so proud of you, son.’ Three days later, he died,” she said.

Breed said she was in civilian clothes shopping at a shoe store on Fort Dix, New Jersey, when a former Soldier approached her.

“He said, ‘You were my nurse in Vietnam,’” she said. “He told me I took off his leg. I took off so many legs. I couldn’t remember each patient at that time and didn’t want to tell him that. I was still grieving the loss of my father at the time. I didn’t even hug him.

“Now I would give him the biggest hug in the world,” she said. “I asked him how he recognized me, and he said, ‘When you’re dying, you remember the last person you heard. You said to me, ‘I’ll take good care of you.’”

Ehline grew attached to a 10-year-old Vietnamese boy named Mai Van Bo. “It was the only day I cried in Vietnam,” she said. “It was the day I had to send him back to his village. I had become very close to him in the months he was at our hospital. He was paralyzed from the waist down, and I feared he wouldn’t survive in the village. His mom and I both cried.”

Niggemann worked three consecutive 12-hour shifts while caring for a young South Vietnamese man in the burn unit. On day four, he had a cardiac arrest and passed away.

“It was very sad and one of the few times I cried at work,” she said. “I will always remember him and the delightful conversations we had before he died. He told me about his family and children.”

Five years ago, she found his sister while searching the internet and spoke to her on the phone. “It was an emotional conversation,” she said. “I was able to answer some of the questions she and her family had regarding their loved one [and] tell her how much the nurses cared for and liked her brother; and that he did not die alone. It was an incredibly healing phone call for both of us.”

Life After Vietnam

Because of their hands-on experience, many of the Vietnam nurses went on to become physicians, dentists, civilian nurses and other high-ranking positions which were uncommon to women in the 1960s and 1970s.

Evans served as head nurse in a surgical intensive care unit and recovery room at Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas, and then founded the Vietnam Women’s Memorial in Washington.

Ehline serves on boards for the Vietnam Veterans of America to fight for the rights of veterans with PTSD.

Niggemann went to medical school and became a doctor.

Breed worked as an ICU nurse for the Department of Veterans Affairs for 15 years, as a missionary nurse for two years and then in the operating room.

King went on to practice law for 10 years, then she sat on the Superior Court of California. Now, she serves on the California Court of Appeal.

Advice for the Next Generation

Nurses faced mortar attacks and worked long shifts from Vietnam to Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. For these Vietnam nurses, they said they’d do it again in a heartbeat and recommend service to the next generation of nurses.

“It was an honor to serve in the Army Nurse Corps. I would do it all over again,” Niggemann said.

“Those two years changed my life, and I’d do it all again in a minute. Don’t just sit on the sidelines of life. Step up and participate,” Meeks said. “For the nurses after me, talk to each other, get help if you need it. We don’t have to carry everything alone.”

“I encourage young people to think about the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, some area of service,” Evans said. “I’m biased. I liked the Army. I liked boots on the ground. I wanted to be close to where the fighting was. Serving our country makes us more united; taking that oath to protect the Constitution and our democracy.”

WASHINGTON — Before James Earl Jones was making Americans remember their love of baseball or striking fear into their hearts as the voice of Darth Vader, he was an Army officer.

He commissioned in the summer of 1953 as a second lieutenant following graduation from the Reserve Officer Training Corps at the University of Michigan. After his initial training, he completed his first and only assignment by establishing a cold weather training command at the former Camp Hale near Leadville, Colorado.

Jones is just one of many Army veterans who not only served their country but also had illustrious civilian careers.

Below are a few others:

The late Tony Bennett was the son of Italian immigrants and grew up during the Great Depression in New York. Born Anthony Dominick Benedetto, he was drafted into the Army in 1944 during World War II.

As a young Soldier, he deployed to Europe with the 63rd Infantry Division, which replaced large casualties suffered during the Battle of the Bulge. His division fought its way across Germany throughout 1945 and liberated the concentration camp at Dachau.

At the end of the war, Cpl. Benedetto was sent to Mannheim, Germany as part of an Allied occupation force. There, he started singing with the 314th Army Special Services Band under the stage name Joe Bari.

Bennett used his GI Bill to study bel canto singing at the American Theatre Wing in New York City after leaving the Army in 1946. He was discovered shortly after by Bob Hope while he was on tour with Pearl Bailey. Hope told him he needed to change his name and said they would start calling him Tony Bennett.

Bennett went on to win 20 Grammy Awards and two Emmys during his prestigious career before passing away this summer.

Actor and filmmaker Robert Duvall grew up in a military household. He was the son of Navy Rear Adm. William Howard Duvall. Instead of following in his father’s Navy footsteps, Duvall enlisted in the Army in 1953 at the end of the Korean War.

He served two years at Camp Gordon, Georgia, now Fort Eisenhower, before being honorably discharged as a private first class.

He too used his GI Bill to take acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. He was classmates with Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Gene Hackman. His big acting break came in 1962 playing Boo Radley in “To Kill a Mockingbird.”

That springboarded a career that saw Duvall appear in many military theme films including “M*A*S*H,” “The Great Santini,” “Gods and Generals,” and “Apocalypse Now.”

Duvall, now 92, spends some of his spare time visiting Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals to thank injured veterans for their service.

Another celebrity that was drafted in the 1950s was Clint Eastwood, known to many as “Dirty Harry.” He became a swimming instructor at Fort Ord, California, after basic training.

In his spare time, he was a bouncer at bars and clubs off base, gaining recognition from some in Hollywood. After his honorable discharge in 1953, he used his GI Bill education benefit to take acting classes.

That was the start of a 70-year career in the entertainment industry as an actor, director and producer of movies and television.

The “King of Rock and Roll” went from superstar to Army private after getting drafted in 1957. Following an initial service deferment to finish filming a movie, Presley went through basic training in 1958 before being assigned to the 2nd Armored Division and then the 3rd Armored Division.

He spent two years on active duty, which included an 18-month stint in Germany where he was a truck driver. He finished his Army career as a sergeant and received an honorable discharge in 1960.

""I was in a funny position,” he said during an Armed Forces Radio and Television interview before his discharge. “Actually, that's the only way it could be. People were expecting me to mess up, to goof up in one way or another. They thought I couldn't take it and so forth, and I was determined to go to any limits to prove otherwise, not only to the people who were wondering, but to myself.

The future Hall of Famer and man who broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson was drafted into the Army in 1942 during World War II. This was following a distinguished college career at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he became the first athlete to letter in four sports: baseball, basketball, football and track.

He was initially assigned to a segregated cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas, before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1943. He joined the 761st “Black Panthers” Tank Battalion.

In 1944, Robinson boarded an Army bus and was ordered to sit in the back but refused. He was taken into custody by military police and court-martialed. He was later acquitted and sent to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky.

There, he served as an Army athletics coach until receiving an honorable discharge in 1944. The next year, Robinson began playing baseball for the Missouri’s Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro leagues. He was spotted by Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Rickey signed Robinson and placed him with Brooklyn’s minor-league club, the Montreal Royals. Robinson was called up to make his major league debut with the Dodgers in 1947 as the first African-American player in MLB history.

He went on to be a six-time All-Star, Rookie of the Year and 1955 World Series champion. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 and passed away in 1972. His number was retired by MLB in 1997.

Schulz Museum; Roger Higgins/Library of Congress) VIEW ORIGINAL

The man we all must thank for “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” Schulz is the author and illustrator of the popular “Peanuts” newspaper comic strip, which stars Charlie Brown, Snoopy and friends.

Before he created the iconic series, Schulz, who grew up near Saint Paul, Minnesota, was drafted into the Army in 1943 during World War II. He served as a staff sergeant in the 20th Armored Division.

He came back to the U.S. in 1947 and started his career as an illustrator with the publication “Li’l Folks” in the St. Paul Pioneer Press. He pitched a four-panel strip to the United Feature Syndicate, and it was accepted.

The first release of “Peanuts” was Oct. 2, 1950, and it ran until Feb. 13, 2000. He passed away in his sleep at 77 after completing the final comic strip.

WASHINGTON — While bike riding along a busy German road, Rory Cooper suffered an injury that changed the trajectory of his life.

An avid runner, the Army sergeant pedaled to work while recovering from knee pain on a summer day in 1980. Suddenly, a bus sideswiped with his bike. The impact pushed Cooper into the oncoming traffic, where a semi-truck hit Cooper and his bike.

Cooper awoke in a German hospital with tubes inserted into his body. The impact broke his clavicle, several ribs and ruptured his spine. Doctors told him that he would never walk again.

The sergeant didn’t know then, but the devastating injury would steer him towards a career where his work would touch the lives of thousands of Soldiers and civilians.

Years of treatment and therapy would follow for the sergeant before his medical discharge from the Army in 1982. As Cooper recovered and began planning his next steps, he never forgot the lessons he learned during his years in the Army as a unit armorer and civil affairs Soldier.

“If you take care of your people, they will take care of you,” he said. “I also learned about the importance of selfless service and not leaving anyone behind.”

The native of San Luis Obispo, California applied those lessons to the rest of his life.

He devoted his career to improving the lives of people with disabilities, from his research at the University of Pittsburgh to his more than three decades of work as a senior scientist and director of the Department of Veterans Affairs Human Engineering Research Laboratories. Cooper and his research teams developed new models of wheelchairs and services designed to make activities and facilities more accessible to patients throughout the nation.

Those achievements culminated in a White House ceremony Oct. 24 when Cooper accepted the National Medal of Technology and Innovation Medal from President Biden, the highest honor for technological achievement.

The medal reflected the impact of his wheelchair and service innovations, and the example he set for future rehabilitation engineers as a professor and mentor. Two days later, the distinguished professor was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

Since 2014, Cooper has served as a Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army, or CASA, for Western Pennsylvania. In addition to acting as advisors to Army Secretary Christine E. Wormuth, CASAs use their positions of influence to connect the Army with the larger civilian population.

“I think the CASA program is awesome. The CASAs that I’ve had the opportunity to work with are truly remarkable Americans and patriots,” Cooper said from his office in Pittsburgh. “[The CASA program] allowed me to connect with the Army in a deeper, broader way. I intend to stay connected and serve the Army in any way I can add value.”

As a CASA, he has coordinated Army-related events at the Pittsburgh Marathon and worked with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers on visits by Army leaders. During the marathon, he organized the planning of Army recruiter stations at the race and a military relay. Cooper said he coordinates internships for veterans and helps former service members with job placement.

“Being a CASA has been good for me because at the time I was injured, there was no warrior transition support,” Cooper said. “You just kind of went from being in the Army to being a patient. It’s been great to reconnect with the Army and serve again.”

Following that July 1980 injury, Cooper faced a crossroads in his life. He had originally considered returning to the Army as a commissioned officer prior to the accident, but after his spinal injury, he admittedly didn’t know his next move.

Cooper’s commanding general in Germany, then-Maj. Gen. Clarence McKnight visited Cooper at the hospital and encouraged him to pursue a career in engineering science.

“[He] told me I should continue to pursue my dreams,” Cooper said.

Before the bicycle accident, Cooper represented the Army as a track and cross country athlete at the World Military Games. While studying electrical engineering at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo County, Cooper again found his competitive edge, and began training to compete in wheelchair racing and wheelchair basketball.

He later participated in the National Veterans Wheelchair Games and eventually became a Paralympian, winning bronze at the 1988 Paralympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. He currently chairs the Paralympic Games Science Task Force, which studies athlete classification and ethical standards.

After receiving his master’s degree in electrical engineering at California Polytechnic State University Cal Poly, Cooper earned his doctorate in electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Cooper considers himself a “Soldier for Life,” concurrently contributing to the Army while working on his research in academia.

One of his projects at the University of Pittsburgh included the development of a lightweight, battery less wheelchair called a “PneuChair,” which allowed people with disabilities to participate in waterparks. Through the use of a joystick, patients could control their movements in the park while eliminating the danger of electrocution.

Cooper also invented a device known as the SmartWheel, which tracks and categorizes user movement and a variable-compliance joystick that makes wheelchair controls customizable.

“My proudest achievement, besides convincing my wife to marry me, is creating the Human Engineering Research Laboratories and all that we have been able to do, the people I’ve been able to train, and the impact that we’ve been able to have on the lives of people in our veteran population,” Cooper said.

For more nearly 30 years, Cooper worked with the Wounded Warriors program to help accommodate the needs of veterans with spinal injuries, traumatic brain injuries and multiple amputations. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Cooper made regular visits to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.

Cooper provided the veterans with devices that included ultra-light wheelchairs, and manual wheelchairs.

“To see our service members come back despite the challenges they were facing was very rewarding,” Cooper said. “We really give them good, quality wheelchairs and teach them about hand cycles, [cycles powered by hands]. To me it was very rewarding to see that the technology that we had contributed to was allowing them to get back into society.”

Cooper served as an Army World Class Athlete Program coach for the Army’s Paralympic athletes in wheelchair racing in 2011, even training future Paralympian swimmer Elizabeth Marks. Cooper also helped former Army Col. Greg Gadson, who lost both of his legs during a bomb attack, with his mobility. Cooper trained Gadson on hand cycling and helped get his wheelchair fitted.

“It is a privilege to serve. I’m very grateful to have served as a Soldier and then again as an athlete, and as a coach,” Cooper said. “It’s pretty meaningful.”

WASHINGTON — Around the corner from the Vietnam Wall stands a bronze statue of a nurse with a wounded soldier lying across her lap and sandbags at her feet. A second nurse searches for a medivac while the kneeling female Soldier stares at an empty helmet. The scenes are enshrined on the Vietnam Women’s Memorial, a monument that honors the services of women during the Vietnam War.

Female Vietnam veterans visited the memorial for its 30th anniversary celebration this past Saturday. Among them was the woman who spent 10 years fighting for its construction.

“I founded the Vietnam Women’s Memorial because I was very proud of the women I served with, and I felt they hadn’t received recognition and honor and had been left out of our memorials, books and movies,” said Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a captain and nurse in the Army.

The Vietnam Women’s Memorial, unveiled on Nov. 11, 1993, is the first monument to honor the efforts of military women at the National Mall. Evans, a Vietnam War veteran, said her time in the Army inspired her to find and tell more stories of women who served.

“No one really talked about the women who served in the military,” she said. “We were just invisible veterans. Even while we were serving, there wasn’t a lot written about what we were doing around the world during the Vietnam era. My service in Vietnam galvanized me to help tell their stories.”

Veterans returning from Vietnam weren’t welcomed by the public, Evans said. “It was very painful but I was very proud of my service, what I had done and accomplished, but we weren’t allowed to show that pride as women or men because we were being disparaged and diminished and scorned for serving our country. It was extremely painful,” she said.

After attending the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1982, she said she started to heal but recognized that many women who had served remained unknown.

“When I started this effort in 1983, I had to defend my proposal as to why women deserve this and why there should be an addition,” Evans said “There’s lots of criteria and gatekeeping, all kinds of opposition. It took 10 years of fighting and winning various approvals and working with Congress. It was like a second war for me. I wanted to honor my sister veterans.”

Her Time in Vietnam

Evans was raised around farmers while growing up in Buffalo, Minnesota. In 1964, many of those farmers were getting drafted. Two of her brothers enlisted in the Army, and one served with the 101st Airborne Division. While attending nursing school, Evans decided to talk to an Army recruiter. She learned the Army had a shortage of nurses and decided to join the service.

The military paid for her tuition, books and uniforms for her senior year in college. After her college graduation, Evans was assigned to Kenner Army Hospital at Fort Lee, Virginia for training. Finally, she deployed to Vietnam from August 1968 to August 1969.

“We were the youngest nurses ever sent into battle,” Evans said. “Most of us were under 25 years old. I was 21. The casualties in Vietnam in ’68 and ’69 were huge.

It was the height of the war, and I learned quickly. It didn’t take long to learn how to start IVs in the dark. We had to measure up when some Soldier came in and his life depended on us. We learned quickly. We were young and had a lot of energy.”

She said the hospital would get rocketed and mortared regularly. Soldiers put sandbags around the hospital and manned the guard towers.

“We were in the hospital saving lives as we heard incoming and outgoing artillery. We got used to knowing what the sounds meant; the air raid sirens,” Evans said. “We pulled together as a team — men and women. Our job was to take care of each other and get our jobs done and get home safely. We were there to protect our patients.”

Because of her hands-on experience in Vietnam, when she returned to the U.S., she was immediately promoted to captain at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. She later became head nurse in a surgical intensive care unit and recovery room.

Nurses on the Wall

Evans said she and her fellow nurses helped save the lives of 300,000 men who were wounded in Vietnam. “We were with so many of the men [whose names are on the Vietnam Wall] when they took their last breath,” she said.

Many of the nurses who made it back from the war continued their careers as physicians, dentists, teachers and colonels, Evans said. Some even went on to be the first female generals, including Brig. Gen. Anna Mae Hays, the chief of the Army Nurse Corps who became the U.S. military's first female general officer.

Importance of Memorial

Vietnam veteran Eileen Moore, now a justice with California Courts of Appeal, said having the memorial is important for her and the other female veterans.

“Being there and being among the other nurses who had gone to Vietnam was really healing for me,” the former second lieutenant said. “I had never tried dealing with the memories. Being around that statue and the other nurses helped me begin healing. The community really helps you.”

Moore, travelled from California to attend the anniversary, said she will never forget a pilot she treated who lost both of his legs and one of his arms. Like Moore, the pilot was Irish, so Moore spent more than 12 hours singing him Irish songs that they both had grown up with.

“I could see tears going down his face because I suspected his parents sang him the same songs,” she said. “I took a break and when I had come back, there was a letter for him. One of the guys in his unit must have brought it in. I opened it up and read it to him. It was from his wife. It had a picture of his wife and a little boy. She told him she loved him.”

She said her time in Vietnam gave her the courage to go to law school, sit on the Superior Court of California and then the California Court of Appeal.

Mary “Edie” McCoy Meeks served as a first lieutenant from February 1968 to February 1970 in Vietnam. She said she joined the Army Nurse Corps so that she could be there for her brother, a U.S. Marine, if he suffered an injury.

She said the memorial saved her life.

“I now know where to find women who speak my language; no explanations necessary, no judgements, just understanding,” she said.

If she could, McCoy said she would join the Army Nurse Corp again in a heartbeat. “Don’t sit on the sidelines of life. Step up, participate,” she encouraged.

For the nurses of the next generation, she said, “Talk to each other, it makes all the difference. Get help if you need it. We don’t have to carry everything alone.”

Mary Breed was a first lieutenant from 1969 to 1971 in Vietnam. Because of her on-the-job experience, she became an ICU nurse for the Department of Veterans Affairs for about 15 years and worked as a missionary nurse in developing countries.

“Vietnam taught me a lot,” she said. “I learned you are not self-sufficient. You have to work as a team and respect what everybody does. Their job is just as important as yours.”

She said she’s honored to have the memorial.

“I can’t thank Diane enough for all of the work she put in to make that possible,” she said. “As women, we’re taught to just accept life experiences. A lot of people kept it inside. We all identified with at least one of the people on that statue. I identified with the one holding the patient and the one looking up to the choppers.”

She said 17 crew members from the 237th Dustoff medical evacuation helicopters died the year she was in Vietnam so she was thankful she made it back safely.

“The statue is very moving, and I’m so thankful,” she said. “I hope it leads to more recognition of women in conflict and war.”

Call to Serve

As a pioneer who led the way for nurses to serve in the years that followed Vietnam, Evans encourages young women of the next generation to join the military.

“It’s the responsibility of each one of us to serve our country in some way. It makes us a better country to know that we took an oath to protect the Constitution, to protect our democracy,” she said. “We should all be taking that oath and stepping up to do whatever we can in service through military service or some kind of service to our country. It makes us a stronger, more united country.""

“We recognize that your service did not end with retirement,” she said. “Many of you continue to give back to our communities, mentor the next generation of leaders and support our Soldiers and their families in various ways. Your continued engagement is a testament to your enduring dedication.”

During the ceremony, a presentation with Soldiers wearing historical and current uniforms showed the long history of the U.S. military. Honorary retiree retired Sgt. Maj. Guadalupe Lopez was also recognized for his years of service in and out of uniform.

Guest speaker Robert Farias, assistant director of the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, spoke to the retirees on the health care available to them in the area and thanked them for their service.

“Thank you for your service,” he said. “Thank you for your bravery. Thank you to your spouses and family members for supporting you … and most importantly, thank you for all of your great sacrifices to our great country.”

There were many resources available to the retirees at the hospital including the CRDAMC Health Fair, which provided immunizations as well as health screenings. There were resources also available around Fort Cavazos, including legal assistance and ID card services.

Stokes encouraged them to take advantage of the resources available at the facility, connect with other veterans and allow the installation to help them receive the benefits and support that they earned through their service.

“As we look to the future, know that your legacy lives on in the military service members who stand here today and those who will follow in your footsteps,” she said.

“Your wisdom, experiences and leadership continue to guide us as we face the challenges of an ever-changing world,” Stokes added. “The bond that connects us as military service members, past and present, is unbreakable and we stand united in our commitment to defending freedom and protecting our great nation.”",

KILLEEN, Texas — Hundreds came out to enjoy the United Service Organizations at Fort Cavazos Trunk or Treat with H-E-B Operation Appreciation event Oct. 27 at the Killeen Special Events Center here.

Originally slated to be held on Fort Cavazos, the event was moved to the indoor venue because of inclement weather.

But a few intermittent showers didn’t stop hundreds of attendees who waited outside in long lines, while hundreds more enjoyed the festivities inside.

Benjamin Griffin explained that the USO at Fort Cavazos partnered with H-E-B for their Operation Appreciation 10-year anniversary, making the annual Halloween event one of the biggest ever.

“Events like this is something that’s super exclusive to our active-duty service members and their families. That’s what it’s about,” he said. “We see all these kids out here dressed up and we have provided a safe environment for them to come enjoy some candy, enjoy a bouncy house, some ice cream, some music and it’s once a year that we’re able to do something like this.”

With the smell of barbecue in the air and the upbeat sounds of the 1st Cavalry Division Band entertaining onlookers, the wide-open space bustled with interactive activities, circus performers, face painting stations, games, six large bouncy houses and a huge inflatable slide.

Because no Trunk or Treat event would be complete without an array of sweet treats, the USO at Fort Cavazos staff and volunteers, along with volunteers from the Directorate of Public Works, 1st Medical Brigade and Cavalry Family Housing, handed out candy.

The H-E-B mobile kitchen provided barbecue sandwiches, drinks, popcorn and cotton candy. Guests also delighted in using the 360-activation station.

Military spouse Sandy Kerfoot and her five children made quite a creative and tasty impression dressed as a variety of iconic characters representing their favorite cereals.

“It’s the highlight of our Halloween season, picking out costumes,” she said.

Kerfoot shared that dressing up is a 12-year tradition for her children and the event was a great opportunity to bond with other military families.

“It’s just great to see the whole community out together, making those connections, seeing those same people over and over again.”

But it wasn’t just the youngsters that showed off their creativity when it came to their Halloween get-ups.

Dressed as superheroes, the Go Team Therapy/Crisis Dogs Central Texas joined in the fun and delighted guests with their inventive outfits and friendly dispositions.

Spc. Brittney Caraway and Spc. Sahria Blanks, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command, said the event was a great way for Soldiers to get out and have a good time.

“It’s important for the unit as a whole to boost morale and get to know each other,” Caraway said.

“You have people that come, dress up, without it being so serious. We can actually have fun together,” Blanks added.

Griffin estimated that more than 4,500 Soldiers, military families and Halloween enthusiasts attended the event, adding that it’s about serving the military community.

“At the USO, it’s all about hospitality,” Griffin said. “Touching those folks in ways where they can relax, have a good time and just enjoy themselves.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. - When discussing national security is not uncommon to examine India in comparison to China as a rising power in the Indo-Pacific. In the second Cultural and Area Studies panel of the 2023 academic year and 11th of 2022-2023, the impact of India as a rising power, the history of the U.S. and China’s counter strategic stances and basic blockades to a U.S.-China relationship were examined by a panel of experts in each area during the event held Nov. 2.

The panel included Mr. Michael Kugelman, Director of the South Asia Institute, The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; Dr. Megan Greene, Professor of modern Chinese history, Department of History, the University of Kansas; and Mr. Terry Mobley, Diplomacy Chair, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, a career foreign service officer, U.S. Department of State.

Trifold of advantages of India to national security

Kugelman discussed India’s role in the China-U.S. relations from three perspectives; history, geography, and strategy.

In the late 1950’s the U.S. was quite interested in having India as a partner to counter China, but this idea was altered with the changing of administration in the 1970s.

This change was followed by an ebb of pursuit of U.S.-India partnership for nearly 20 years. With the emergence of China competition, the views of India for national security have shifted.

“In the last decade, especially in the last several years, India is being seen as partner in efforts to counter China,” Kugelman explained.

China continues to push westward to expand its presence in south Asia.

China’s recent aggressive territorial claims to areas equally important to the U.S. and India such as the south China Sea and Taiwan Straight have encouraged the U.S. and India to again amplify their partnership, Kugelman explained.

“For many years India has been concerned with what it describes as a ‘String of Pearls’ and ‘Encirclement’ strategy on behalf of China to deepen influence in India’s backyard,” Kugelman said. “India has grown increasingly concerned in more recent years as China has been doing that even more intensely. BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] being one of the main vehicles in which it has done that.”

Kugelman introduced the question if space should be a frontier of concern in the future when it comes to the U.S.-India-China triangle, with a recent lunar landing by India.

Strategically, India has been seen as the best bet to countering China in south Asia due to its size and location, among other areas such as military and population size, he explained.

“U.S.-India relations have been growing exponentially since the early 1990s and trade cooperation has been one of the reasons for that,” Kugelman said. “U.S.-India trade cooperation proceeds along a track that is completely separate from China that doesn’t relate to China competition that much.”

There are challenges for the U.S. India policies due to certain factors such as bureaucracy slowing down or stopping initiatives between the two countries; India’s continued connection to Russia for various goods; and India’s stance on the U.S. alliance system.

“India has vowed to never join the U.S. alliance system because of its policy of strategic autonomy,” Kugelman said.

China-U.S.-Taiwan Relationship: then and now

As early as 1945, the Chinese absorption and then rapidly afterward control over Taiwan began, Greene explained.

Due to the continued control of the Republic of China over Taiwan, in the 1900s and 2000s, Taiwan began to call for separation from China as a whole.

The late 1970s saw the creation of the Taiwan Relations Act by the U.S., vowing the need to ‘maintain capacity’ to defend Taiwan, after the nation was de-recognized within the United Nations.

Prior to this the U.S. invested heavily in Taiwan’s economic growth particularly in the areas of fiscal, advising, and technological support, Greene explained.

“These efforts on the part of both the U.S. and Taiwan have led to the emergence of Taiwan as a high-tech hub in certain areas, with a good example of that is semiconductors,” she said. “In 2023, Taiwan produces more than 60% of all semiconductors and over 90% of the most advanced semiconductors produced worldwide, which is a strategic concern.”

“Although Taiwan was governed for 40 years under martial law, in 1987 martial Law was lifted. It was lifted partly as a strategy to gain support outside of Taiwan,” Greene said.

Since then, Taiwan continues to hold elections that have garnered rotating representation of the parties within elected leaders.

“The democratization was at some level a strategy to solicit continued U.S. support,” Greene said. “It also satisfied the demands on the part of Taiwan’s people to determining their own futures. And it certainly succeeded in doing the later.”

Five Key Issues in China-U.S. Relationship

Taiwan continues to be a central priority to the China-U.S. relationship.

An upcoming election could see a leader in power who is motivated for independence, which would be contrary to China’s thoughts on the nation, Mobley explained.

South China Sea is another area of focus, Mobley said, pointing out the Chinese Nine Dash Line.

A significant trade route for more than 10% of U.S. trades plus competing interests of territories and area create choppy geopolitical waters for this region.

“Maritime domain awareness is something the U.S. has been pushing with south Asian countries for some time now,” Mobley said.

The Senkaku or DiaoYu Islands, are used as a way to push nationalism by China, he explained, making incidents around the area volatile, much like events of similar nature around Taiwan, with the U.S. taking a neutral stance on the area’s sovereignty.

Rare earth elements are critical to several different applications to include defense.

“As of the end of 2022, China accounted for 63% of the world’s rare earth mining, 85% of rare earth processing, and 92% of rare earth magnet production,” Mobley said. “Not just the U.S. but the entire world is heavily, heavily dependent on China for rare earth elements.”

Furthermore, nearly 20% of pharmaceutical ingredients are imported from China, with 40% of global antibiotic production also falling to China.

The discussion continued with questions regarding the effect the Belt and Road Initiative has on the U.S. and China relationship, conversations about what India-U.S. cooperation may look like in space and the potential use of Myanmar by China to bypass the South China Sea trade route tension.

and dance and weave ‘neath violent winds of change.

War rages betwixt blackened air and chopped seas,

entrenched in rage -- no way across No Man’s range:

Central Powers four and Allies six, hatred’s blood overspills.

Warriors, rooted, stand their ground where vainglories die—

No hope of home light’s warmth beyond Flanders Fields,

just poppies freely waving where heroes, resting, lie. ~ E. Pilgrim

Some veterans have served in combat, some have served in peacetime, some have served a few days or years, some have served until retirement and beyond. But each has taken the oath to support and defend the Constitution and the United States against all enemies, even if that means losing their life. All are worthy of honor on this and every Veterans Day. (Photo Credit: Eric Pilgrim, Fort Knox News) VIEW ORIGINAL

Like Memorial Day, Veterans Day sprang from war.

Unlike Memorial Day when we remember and honor our fallen heroes, Veterans Day is an opportunity to honor all who have answered the call to serve the nation. Service in war, service in peacetime, 10 days, 10,000 days, it matters not.

It doesn’t matter because those who have served or are serving have done so with the full understanding that they might one day have to sacrifice their lives for that service. It starts with the contractual oath:

“I solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic …”

It’s implied in the Warrior Ethos:

“I will ALWAYS (emphasis mine) place the mission first. I will NEVER accept defeat. I will NEVER quit. I will NEVER leave a fallen comrade.”

It’s clearly spelled out in the Soldier’s Creed: “I am an American Soldier. I am a warrior and a member of a team. I serve the people of the United States, and live the Army Values … I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy, the enemies of the United States of America in close combat.”

Soldiers regularly sing about it in the Army Song at every ceremony: “Count the brave, count the true, who have fought to victory” and “Fighting till the battle’s won.”

They breathe it every day of their service to the nation, spelled out in the Army Values: Loyalty. Duty. Respect. Selfless Service. Honor. Integrity. Personal Courage. Those aren’t empty platitudes that are spoken to deflect the unsuspecting away from our failures or substandard efforts. The words matter. Every word matters.

Most successful organizations have mission statements, mottos, cultural beliefs and standards. Otherwise, they likely wouldn’t be successful. Few employees, though, are willing to die for them. That’s what sets the warrior apart.

It’s what ushered the Central Powers – Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria -- to agree to an armistice with the Allied Forces of France, United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Japan and the United States on Nov. 11, 1918. It was a way for the Central Powers to admit defeat without further bloodshed.

Most historians agree that it was the entrance of America’s warriors into World War I that eventually led to the armistice and then to the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, which officially ended the war. On Nov. 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson officially called for the nation to celebrate “Armistice Day.” He told the public to honor the day with parades and public gatherings as well as a moment of silence at 11 a.m.

Exactly two years later, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was established at Arlington National Cemetery when officials interred and commemorated a warrior who had died in World War I. The Soldier’s casket was chosen by Sgt. Edward Younger out of four identical caskets. Younger had been wounded in the war and had earned the Distinguished Service Medal.

The unrelenting, determined sacrifices of America’s warriors is a fixture in the American psyche. It is stitched into America’s banner: a banner carried in war, a standard raised high in battle by men and women who have answered the call and have stood in the gap to defend the nation’s freedom and its Constitution against all enemies.

Our veterans devoted their lives to safeguarding our freedom. Devote some time on this special day to thank them. Remember the red poppies of Flanders' fields, and honor them all.",

MADISON COUNTY, Va. - Virginia National Guard Soldiers assigned to the Sandston-based 2nd Battalion 224th Aviation Regiment, 29th Infantry Division, are helping fight wildfires in Madison County.

In the first 24 hours, VNG aviation crews dropped nearly 10,000 gallons of water on the fires.

After Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Nov. 6, the VNG deployed two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters equipped with 660-gallon water buckets at the request of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management to support the Virginia Department of Forestry.

The Guard planned to continue to assist in the firefighting efforts Nov. 8.

“We are extremely proud of how quickly and safely our aviation crews responded to start assisting with aerial fire suppression in Madison County after Governor Youngkin’s emergency declaration,” said Brig. Gen. Todd H. Hubbard, the Virginia National Guard director of the joint staff.

“The role of the National Guard in domestic operations is to provide additional capabilities to partner agencies to help our fellow citizens in times of need, and this is a perfect example of how that works,“ Hubbard said. “The Department of Forestry and firefighting crews from across the region have been battling the fire in Madison County for nearly two weeks, and now our capabilities give them extra resources in the fight. It is an honor to work with such dedicated professionals towards a common goal.”

VNG aviation crews conducted water bucket training in October at Fort Barfoot. Aviation assets can support firefighting efforts using water buckets, which require periodic training for flight crews to ensure proficiency with the equipment.

The training provided currency and qualifications for three flight crews, capitalizing on lessons learned fighting fires during the unit’s deployment to Kosovo in 2022.

During domestic operations, the VNG receives missions from VDEM and responds as part of a multi-agency team with other state and local agencies.

158,158.0,158.0,Sowing seeds of service starts with vets,https://www.army.mil/article/271532/sowing_seeds_of_service_starts_with_vets,"REDSTONE ARSENAL, Alabama —The excitement was almost electric when I dropped my kids off at school this morning. You could feel the energy pulsing in the halls and the current of conversation was all about the day’s big event: the Veterans Day program.

As I sat and sipped my coffee waiting for my husband to arrive, I reflected on the morning’s progress so far. My usual challenge of rousing my girls was effortless – they were up and fully dressed before I was – and all because their Soldier dad was coming to school for Veterans Day. It was, apparently, a VERY big deal.

As I observed and listened to the hallway chatter, I heard snippets of conversation. “My mom is a veteran – she’s coming!” “My grandpa is a veteran – he’s coming!” These were endearing to hear, but not surprising. It’s totally natural for immediate relatives to come and support their kids’ and grandkids’ school events.

What did surprise me, however, were those with no familial relation showing up as a guest of a student, or as a supporter of the school. As the program commenced, students and their veterans were announced and then walked under the sabers of an honor guard, getting the full VIP treatment for all in attendance to recognize.

Some who came with the students were announced as friends of the family, others as neighbors. Some of the older veterans who were invited by the school to participate were solo and announced as friends of the school.

Every single one of them was treated like a rock star and cheered by a gym full of pre-kindergarteners to eighth graders. Every. Single. One.

It struck me, as I looked around at little hands waving clutched American flags that, as military families, we often take for granted that everyone has a veteran in their lives. That everyone has someone to set the example of selfless service for them. That everyone has someone who took an oath to protect and defend our nation.

We forget that many of those little flag-waving hands, cheering at the events, want to have a veteran, too. They want to have a special person on Veterans Day to stand proudly next to and declare to the world, “This is MY veteran!”

When you look at the statistics of people who have served in uniform, it’s an astonishingly small number when compared to the rest of the population. And it’s getting smaller by the minute.

Whether through the passing on of those who served in prior wars, or simply the lack of those currently enlisting or commissioning, our supply of veterans is dwindling. And friends, that simply is “unsat” (to employ a phrase often used by veterans when the situation isn’t satisfactory).

So, for those veterans still hearing a call to duty, here is a challenge to you: find a young person who may not have a veteran in their life and be THEIR veteran.

It might be a neighbor, it might be the child of a co-worker, it might be someone you already mentor. Talk to them about your service. Let them know you care about them, and their Veterans Day activities at school.

Be the one to teach them about the importance of selfless service, duty and honor. Be the one who inspires their own service to their community.

Be the one to teach them to be all they can be.

It’s an investment worth your time. Your military leadership and mentorship experience could be the key to their success. Being THEIR veteran could have far-reaching impacts for our nation that you can’t even begin to imagine.

Just take the first step, sow the seeds of service, sit back and watch them grow.

Who knows?

You might just grow a Soldier.",

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Senior army leaders from 21 Western Hemisphere nations gathered in the coastal city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for the 2023 Conference of American Armies Commanders Conference beginning on Nov. 6, 2023. Brazil served as the host of this year’s conference as they concluded their role as the permanent executive secretariat of the 35th cycle.

Each CAA cycle lasts two years and rotates on a voluntary basis between the 23 member armies. The theme of the 35th cycle is, “The CAA’s contribution in the process of transformation and preparation of the ‘Army of the Future’ for the expansion of cooperation and integration on confronting the challenges and threats that may affect the security and stability of the American Continent.”

“Just the fact that you are all here means you are committed to strengthening these relationships,” said Brazilian Army Commander, Gen. Miguel Mine Ribeiro Paiva Tomas, during the opening ceremony. “The CAA reinforces the military diplomacy and is a forum where we can have conversations on topics of similar interest. The CAA is indispensable to the politics of the region.”

As a founding member, the U.S. Army stands alongside the partners in an effort to achieve each cycle’s goals. The U.S. Army also recognizes the significance that international organizations such as the CAA play in stabilizing various regions of the world.

“The CAA is an opportunity for us to foster relationships and provides a platform to increase the stability and security across the Americas,” explained Gen. Andrew P. Poppas, U.S. Army Forces Command commanding general and senior U.S. Army representative at the CAA. “I am honored to have taken part in this event.”

Throughout each year, the U.S. Army participates in several training exercises to further the CAA objectives of strengthening integration and cooperation among the American Armies, protect against threats to peace in the region, and advance democracy and freedom.

U.S. Army South, commanded by Maj. Gen. William L. Thigpen, serves as the primary representative for U.S. Army activities throughout the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility.

“Throughout the year, we conduct a large number of events demonstrating our commitment to the CAA objectives, including training exercises, subject matter expert exchanges, and senior leader dialogue,” said Thigpen. “In the past week, Soldiers arrived in Brazil to take part in Exercise Southern Vanguard 24 and we hosted the Chilean Army commander in chief at our headquarters to discuss future combined training opportunities.”

This year’s commanders conference started with an opening ceremony followed by a plenary session, during which the Brazilian Army provided an overview of the 35th cycle’s activities. Participants also reviewed the results of the electronic vote that took place earlier this year which made changes to CAA bylaws, included Portugal as a special observer to the CAA, and identified Paraguay as the host army for the 37th cycle of the CAA.

At the conclusion of the plenary session, attending armies conducted bilateral meetings to discuss shared challenges and security cooperation opportunities.

“This conference was a great experience,” remarked Poppas. “I enjoyed being able to sit down and discuss training opportunities and develop a better understanding of the unique challenges throughout the region.”

This year’s conference concluded with the official handover ceremony marking the end of the Brazilian Army’s role as the permanent executive secretariat as they passed the responsibility over to the Mexican Army, who will fill the position for the two-year duration of the 36th Cycle.",

ARLINGTON, Va. – In a hallowed corner of Patton Hall at Northern Virginia’s Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, a journey through the annals of American military history awaits. An officer’s saber from the late 19th century, a World War I-era combat helmet, and a flag that bore witness to the attack on Pearl Harbor stand as sentinels to a remarkable legacy.

Welcome to The 1636 Room, a treasure trove of nearly 200 unique artifacts curated by the National Guard’s 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia. It’s a living tribute to the nation’s oldest military organization.

For Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, the room honors the Guard’s heritage and its legacy of “courage, duty, honor and service.”

“The 1636 Room is a tribute to that tradition, a commemoration of a force unlike any other — one that continues to have an impact as 20% of the Joint Force and continues to shape the course of history,” Hokanson said during the ceremony unveiling the exhibit Nov. 1.

The idea for The 1636 Room originated late last year when Hokanson asked the National Guard Bureau History Office to develop a plan for a heritage space where Guard members could gather for events and social occasions and for others to learn more about the force.

By spring, he signed off on the history office’s recommendation that Patton Hall would be the ideal spot, said Richard Clark, NGB chief historian.

“It is centrally located, and it has a rich history of its own,” he added, noting the 3rd U.S. Regiment, as “the oldest regiment in the Army, has a room at Patton Hall, and it seemed appropriate for the oldest U.S. military organization to have a place there as well.”

Honoring the roots of today’s National Guard, the exhibit space is named in tribute to the 1636 Massachusetts Bay Colony militia and boasts an extensive array of strategically positioned artifacts that include framed flags, panel displays, photographs, visual artworks, and replicas. Clark explained each item encapsulates the essence of unique events, remarkable achievements, unit emblems, and historic missions undertaken by different Guard elements.

Army Maj. Gen. James W. Ring, adjutant general of Virginia, said the series of framed pictures showcasing Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division from its beginnings in World War I to Operation Iraqi Freedom was a fitting contribution to the room.

“For us on the Virginia side, we carry heavy within the 29th,” said Ring, who attended the ceremony along with nearly 150 senior Guard leaders.

While the photographs are significant for Virginia Guard members, Ring said the room’s spirit can resonate with all Soldiers and Airmen.

“This is a chance for all of us to have the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of the Citizen-Soldier and Airman tradition of those that came before us,” he said. “It’s a tremendous honor to be here today.”

NGB history officials emphasized the room’s purpose extends beyond showcasing history.

There is a canteen, cup and mess kit engraved by Soldiers from New Mexico National Guard’s 200th Coast Artillery during World War II. These very Soldiers later endured the harrowing Bataan Death March, followed by internment in POW camps.

The artifacts represent valor and immense suffering. Of the roughly 1,800 Soldiers from New Mexico who fought in the Pacific Theater, only about half returned at the war’s end.

The history office will continue updating the room as it receives more items representing different aspects of Guard heritage.

“As the National Guard evolves, the room will evolve with it,” said Clark, adding the room “is not a static display. It’s a dynamic space that evolves as states swap out artifacts, and as additional states and territories and District of Columbia identify their contributions.”

In his closing remarks, Hokanson said the room — with the intent and purpose of honoring Guard heritage with unique items from the past — is only the beginning.

“These items are not only part of our history — they are part of our ongoing story,” he said.

OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. - The 55th Operations Support Squadron’s survival, evasion, resistance and escape specialists, better known as SERE, joined with the Nebraska Army National Guard to conduct hoist training Nov. 4.

Company G, 2nd General Support Aviation Battalion, 104th Regiment, flew a UH-60 Black Hawk from Lincoln to Offutt, which enabled personnel from both units to carry out some mandatory training.

“In order to maintain our mission-capable status, SERE specialists are required to accomplish hoist proficiency training every 36 months,” said Master Sgt. Clifton Cleveland, 55th OSS SERE program superintendent.

All of the 55th OSS SERE specialists had accomplished their training before arriving at Offutt, so Cleveland came up with a plan to keep them proficient.

“We reached out to the Nebraska National Guard in September and the discussion evolved into this joint training opportunity,” he said.

For the Nebraska Army National Guard Soldiers, this training also allowed them to remain current, which is required every 90 days.

“It is important for us to continuously train hoist to remain proficient for any potential missions we may get,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Russell Kuhlman, G Company, 2-104th GSAB training officer. “For example, during the 2019 floods, we conducted many hoist missions to rescue people from the cold water.”

SERE specialists are experts at surviving in the most remote and hostile environments. Hoist training is invaluable for exfiltrating people when aircraft cannot land.

“Hoist training is designed to prepare SERE specialists and aircrew members how to properly execute recovery tactics, techniques and procedures safely in a wide variety of austere environments,” Cleveland said.

“If an aircraft could not land for whatever reason, like steep terrain, foliage or urban environments, a hoist could be used,” Kuhlman said. “This involves hoisting a medic down to patients to treat, package, triage and evacuate them from the battlefield. Once the medic has done what is needed on the ground, we can hoist patients and the medic out using different types of extraction devices.”

Maintaining proficiency is essential not only to the SERE specialists but also to all of Team Offutt. By maintaining their mission-capable status, they can offer SERE refresher training, a 36-month requirement for all aircrew members.

“The SERE program exists to better train, prepare and equip over 2,700 warfighters here at Offutt as well as at three operating locations and two geographically separated units,” Cleveland said.

With the positive outcome for both units involved, they are already looking ahead for other chances to collaborate.

“This initial integration with the Nebraska Army National Guard has already opened numerous opportunities for our SERE specialists to integrate into future personnel recovery exercises and events together,” Cleveland said.

“There are a lot of valuable training opportunities our teams could mutually benefit from,” Kuhlman said. “We are looking at the possibility of doing a SERE training event for some of our crew chiefs and medics who do not get the same SERE training our pilots do.”

FORT MITCHELL, Ky. – Honor Guard Soldiers from the Kentucky National Guard on Nov. 4 helped honor a Medal of Honor recipient whose grave had gone unmarked and almost forgotten for 148 years.

U.S. Army Sgt. John F. Rowalt of Bellville, Ohio, served during the American Indian War before contracting smallpox and dying at the age of 28 in Cincinnati. He was buried at the nearby Highland Cemetery in Kentucky.

“It’s definitely something special for us,” said Army Sgt. Scott Zelensky, northern Kentucky area coordinator for the Honor Guard. “It’s not something we get to do every day, especially for a Medal of Honor recipient, but at the end of the day, we do the same job as normal. We provide the same honors to that veteran.”

Representing Rowalt’s family was his great-niece, Fran Dankovic of Lexington, Ohio.

“This is awesome,” she said. “I’m so grateful to everyone who helped put this together and to the ones that showed up. I was nervous yesterday thinking about it, but being here today has been great.”

During the ceremony, Capt. Mitchell Hagen with the KYNG Honor Guard presented Dankovic with a folded flag in honor of her late great-uncle.

“I’m at a loss for words,” she said after the ceremony. “This was a lot more than I expected. I’m just so honored by all this.”

Former Kentucky Air National Guardsman Rob Schultz and journalist Carl Hunner with the Richland Source led this “labor of love.”

Their research and hard work paid off, as they were able to provide a headstone for Rowalt.

According to Hunnell, Rowalt was 19 years old when he earned the Medal of Honor. As a private serving in Company L with the 8th United States Cavalry Regiment, his unit got into a fight at Lynx Creek in the Arizona Territory during the Apache Wars Oct. 14, 1869. It was during that battle that Rowalt distinguished himself, earning the Medal of Honor for “gallantry and action with Indians,” according to the citation.

Rowalt was discharged from the Army May 11, 1873, in Fort Union, New Mexico, as a sergeant. He returned to Cincinnati to live with his brother but contracted smallpox, for which there was no cure. He died and was buried at Highland Cemetery. The grave was unmarked for the past 148 years.

“It will never again be unmarked,” said Hunnell, as he spoke to those in attendance. “A hero has his recognition.”

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash.— —A movement on the horizon catches the eye of a sniper team. Through his scope, the spotter tracks the gentle movement of the grass, gauging the direction of the wind and distance to the target. His partner takes aim, gently squeezes the trigger... and bang.

For a snipers and spotters with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion, 161st Infantry Regiment, 81st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, success depends on perfect calculation in an imperfect environment. That is why they conducted an alternate position and urban stress shoot training event at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Nov. 4, 2023.

This training is all in preparation for Guard snipers to compete at the Winston P. Wilson Sniper Championship, an annual National Guard competition held at Camp Robinson in northern Arkansas.

“The preparation for this competition is pretty hard,” said U.S. Army Sgt. Remi Milslagle, a sniper team leader with HHC, 3-161 Inf. “They keep the majority of the details from all of the competitors, so you really have to work well with your teammate to prepare for whatever the competition throws at us.”

Getting to know how to best work with a teammate is essential for a sniper. Training together and participating in these competitions help build unit cohesion as well as allow the unit to know how well they can perform alongside their peers. Sniper/spotter teams must work quickly to make precise adjustments in a high-stress environment. The attention to detail before taking a shot at a target is a key factor for every move a sniper and his teammate will make.

“You’re taking out all of the factors such as wind, distance, position and so on before the first shot even goes off,” said Milslagle. “It's definitely a two-person job. If you don’t hit the target, you need your partner to spot the shot and make adjustments quick.”

In addition to showcasing a unit's excellent marksmanship skills, the competition's objective is to evaluate the performance of competing teams and how it pertains to unit training. Teams have the opportunity to network and display how well they perform when given newer and more efficient equipment.

“We just recently received the MK22 rifle which will replace the M2010 that we currently use,” explained fellow sniper Sgt. Matt Meckley. “So doing these training sessions as much as we can will help us get familiarized because these new weapons are what will be used in the competition.”

Training with better equipment allows for the snipers to do their job to the best of their ability. When units take part in training and competitions, it enables snipers to shoot at long distances, learn how to maneuver, conduct reconnaissance operations and overall prepare and train for missions.

“The competitions are a great way for us to measure our skill relative to our peers,” said Meckley. “We don't get a chance to do that with other units very often because we're such a small organization. It allows us to work as a team and to see how other teams perform as well.”

Snipers are an asset whose primary focus is to be able to shoot at long distances. It takes time and effort for a sniper unit to prepare and train. Their mission begins long before a shot is even fired.

“We conduct reconnaissance for days at a time, we hike through the woods, and we try to get vantage points to best see the battlefield before the battle even starts,” said Milslagle. “The sense of responsibility that is given to us as a small team and being able to accomplish the mission feels very rewarding.”",

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash.-- U.S. Soldiers with the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion (Linguist), 56th Theater Information Operations Group, Washington National Guard, put their language skills to the test during the annual Valor Language Games on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., Nov. 4, 2023 .

""It has been a very successful iteration of these games,"" said Maj. David Grun, operations officer for the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion. ""Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves and they feel challenged by the events.""

The Valor Language Games, named after the battalion’s call sign and motto,“Vigilance and Valor”, consists of three events, each testing intelligence soldiers on their expertise in tactical questioning, voice intercept/analysis, and briefing a senior office on the commander's priority intelligence requirements (PIR) they found during their questioning. Linguists are tested as individuals and as a team on their abilities to read, speak, and listen to the languages including Russian, Korean, Chinese, Spanish and French.

""The Valor Games are used to test the linguists' proficiency in their language and as a precursor to a much larger game, called the Polyglot games, hosted by our higher headquarters, the 300th Military Intelligence Brigade (Linguist),"" said Grun.

The first test of the games is a tactical questioning lane where linguists must question an informant to obtain potentially critical information about a scenario using their foreign language skills. The second lane is voice intercept/analysis, a computer-based challenge where competitors must use their skills as a linguist in both reading and listening in their perspective languages while gathering details of the scenario for their brief during the culminating event. During the last lane, linguist must come together as a team and compile all of their intel from their previous lanes and create a brief to present to a senior officer. They are graded on the interpretation of the information they gathered and on the presentation.

""We're just happy we can support the battalion and looking forward to doing this again next year on an annual basis,"" said Capt. Jeff Bridges, commander, Bravo Company, 341st Military Intelligence Battalion.

The Valor Games are a precursor to the Polyglot Games, an annual language game hosted by the Utah National Guard's 300th Military Intelligence Brigade (Linguist). More than 140 participants from 25 different organizations came together earlier this year for the 5th annual Polyglot Games, the 2024 games are expected to be the largest language games ever conducted.

“The Valor games tested the language proficiency of the Soldier's before being sent to the Polyglot Games,” said Grun. “We want to make sure our folks are set-up for success.”

The 341st has been successful in the past at the Polyglot Games: Staff Sergeant Sergei Corduneanu was named language professional of the year at the games in 2019. In 2020, Sgt. Robert O’Donnell took top honors, followed by Spc. Louis Delorme in 2021. Each year the 341st was also named the Best Command Language Program in the 300th.

“Time and time again our Soldiers have proven that they are professionals in their assigned languages,” said Lt. Col. Nolan Rinehart, commander of the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion. “The work we do is critical in developing intelligence products for combatant commanders when deployed and postured to help to assist civil authorities and our communities during disasters, so ensuring our linguists are at their best is one of our training priorities.”",

FORT INDIANTOWN GAP, Pa. – A routine flight on Nov. 2 was much more than that for two Pennsylvania National Guard pilots, as it encapsulated a family’s unwavering commitment to service and a shared love for aviation.

That morning, 2nd Lt. Zack Adams, a recent flight school graduate, got to fly a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter alongside his father, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Rich Adams, a veteran of Army aviation.

According to Zack, a platoon leader with Alpha Company, 2-104th General Support Aviation Battalion, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, his father was his hero growing up and he wanted to become a helicopter pilot like him.

“My father has always been a huge role model for me both in life and now inside the cockpit. It doesn’t happen very often for someone to begin their career field where one of the most senior and skilled individuals also happens to be their father,” Zack said. “I have this privilege of learning from the best.”

Upon graduating from the U.S. Army Initial Entry Rotary Wing school at Fort Novosel, Alabama, an aviator returns to their assigned unit to learn to tactically employ their aircraft on military missions. They train and grow as aviators in a process broken up into three readiness levels.

The Adams’ flew together for Zack’s first flight of his readiness level progression, with Rich as his instructor pilot.

With crisp air and fall foliage as a backdrop, their flight originated at Muir Army Heliport and took them around the Harrisburg and Fort Indiantown Gap areas.

Inside the cockpit, their interaction was professional — instructor pilot to pilot-in-training. But their connection as father and son was apparent with occasional comments like “been waiting a long time to say that” from Rich when he handed over control of the helicopter to Zack. Or “not a bad life” from Zack as they took in the moment and the views from the sky.

Rich is the command chief warrant officer for the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, a full-time standardization instructor pilot and aviation mission survivability officer. He has served on multiple combat tours over his 34-year career, including 1,500 hours of missions in an AH-64 Apache helicopter during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006, where he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. He has flown nine types of helicopters.

Even after such a long career, Rich says this experience with his son will stay with him forever.

“The opportunity to fly a military helicopter with Zack has always been in the back of my mind. However, if anyone knows how challenging the path can be, I never assumed it would happen,” Rich said. “Here we are, a few years into his service and me near the end of mine, and the culmination of planning is met with opportunity.”

Among their family and friends, there is a running joke that Zack had been conditioned from birth to want to fly. Rich acknowledges he may have planted a seed there, as many fathers who love their profession also do with their children. But the path to becoming a pilot requires years of hard work, preparation and discipline, and Zack followed the blueprint himself.

“I always get people saying I have been brainwashed since birth with all the helicopter toys, being taken to airshows and listening to all the stories from my father,” Zack said. “Although those things certainly contributed to my desire to fly, I find that for myself, what made me want to start this career is wanting to experience the joy of flying while supporting my desire to serve our great nation.”

Many may expect Zack to emulate his father’s experience and skills. Zack holds himself to high standards, but for now, he is soaking everything in, taking advantage of the lessons he can learn from his father and making his own path.

“The biggest piece of advice I can give anyone is to make their career their own journey. If there is someone that you emulate and aspire to become just like, know that your paths will never be exactly the same,“ he said. “Find a path that best suits you and strive to get to where you want to be and never give up on that.“

DJIBOUTI CITY, Djibouti -- Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) engineers and civil affairs service members delivered refurbished desks and chairs to schools throughout Djibouti as part of their Desk Rejuvenation Project (DRP).

The DRP is a small, yet self-sustaining mission that’s been carried out by the civil affairs and engineering battalions of CJTF-HOA during the past year. The project focuses on creating a comfortable learning experience for students across Djibouti.

U.S. Army SFC Josh Barnett, 294th Engineer Support Company (ESC) member, was the project lead for the ESC’s portion of the desk program. Barnett led ESC service members on rebuilding broken chairs and refurbishing and sanding desk pieces to help make the desks they gather look good as new.

“It’s easy, it doesn't cost too much and it really helps the city out,” said Barnett. “The kids love the work we do and so do the teachers”.

The 294th ESC and former Alpha Company Civil Affairs Battalion refurbished and delivered approximately 400 desks to four schools across the country.

Earlier this month, they passed their mission and the DRP to the 1782nd ESC, who began making desk deliveries to both the Hali English Institute and the Annex 3 School. Their most recent delivery took place in October during which they delivered 15 refurbished desks for children at the Annex 3 School in the Balbala district of Djibouti City.

“We’ve delivered a lot of desks already,” said Barnett. “At Annex 3, we were even able to help build new swings for their playground to really help these kids have a more enjoyable learning environment. The headmasters’ are always super thankful when we come by, which makes it all the more worthwhile.”

Kamil Mohumed, Hali English Language Center CEO and Headmaster, shared this sentiment. Kamil works with Civil Affairs as a translator and hosts English Discussion groups for all ages out of his school. He’s been outspoken within the Djibouti community about the positive work that comes from the presence of U.S. military personnel in the country.

“I started my center off very small and provided some of my own chairs and desks for the students,” said Kamil. “ Now, thanks to Civil Affairs, I’m able to see my school grow. The work they do is really good for my community.”

U.S. Army Civil Affairs personnel work as the primary liaison between the Army and non-U.S. populations. In Djibouti, the Civil Affairs East Africa Team spends their weeks planning and organizing ways to engage and coordinate cross-national events and cultural exchanges between CJTF-HOA’s partners and the Djiboutian community.

U.S. Army Sgt. Allan Jefferies, CJTF-HOA Civil Affairs East Africa Team member, explained that while dropping off new desks might seem like a small win, these projects have helped improve conditions at local schools considerably and helped foster a bond between U.S. personnel and the local community.

“When we see there’s a need at these schools, it’s always great to be able to help fill that need,” said Jefferies. “As civil affairs personnel we try to really get involved in these communities and especially try to do things for the youth since they are the future.”

When their deployment is up, the 1782nd ESC and the current Civil Affairs East Africa Team will be replaced by new companies and personnel just as they replaced the 294th ESC and previous Civil Affairs team. However, just as each new team has made their own mark on Camp Lemonnier and the region, the DRP will remain an enduring legacy of Camp Lemonnier’s ongoing humanitarian efforts in the Horn of Africa.

The 2023 West Africa Logistics Conference, co-hosted by the Chief of Defense of the Armed Forces of Côte d’Ivoire and United States Africa Command, convened in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, Sept. 19-20, to address West African security challenges through logistics cooperation.

Rear Admiral George Bresnihan, Director of Logistics at U.S. Africa Command, welcomed logistics leaders representing 12 African nations, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union.

“We’re here to share our collective insights and discuss challenges and potential solutions to the herculean task of sustaining and maintaining a military through peacetime and crisis,” said Bresnihan. “I’m very excited to hear from our African partners and learn how we can strengthen our partnerships through logistics.”

The specter of terrorism, transnational crime, humanitarian crises and the effects of climate change were at the forefront of vigorous discussions on regional security challenges.

U.S. Ambassador to Côte d’Ivoire Jessica Davis Ba, speaking in the country’s official language of French, stressed, “It is through our shared experiences that we can emphasize the importance of continued dialogue, cooperation and mutual understanding as we move forward in our joint efforts to maintain the security and stability of our countries and our world.”

The Ambassador identified military logistics as a pillar of strategic power and reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to our African partners in their pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity. She also highlighted the United States’ 10-year partnership plan aimed at addressing the root causes of violent extremism.

The initiative, she stated, “emphasizes the importance of a proactive approach in building trust between communities and security forces. It is essential, more than ever, to improve interoperability and coordination [in order to] to strengthen our armed forces and work together to address the myriad security challenges we face.”

In the keynote speech, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for African Affairs Ms. Chidi Blyden echoed the Ambassador. “In Africa, synchronized operations, coordination and interoperability are key to readiness when addressing a multitude of threats in the region such as humanitarian and climate disasters, threats from violent extremist organizations and even cyber criminality.”

Blyden further highlighted that Department of Defense events like the West Africa Logistics Conference, annual exercises, noncommissioned officer training and rotational engagements with state partnership programs advance military strategic logistics in Africa.

Dr. Joel Amegboh, from the African Center for Security Studies, provided a regional overview and scene-setter outlining emerging threats confronting West African militaries. Attendees critically analyzed real-time threats of violent extremist organizations engaging in terrorist activity, drug trafficking, organized crime and poor governance in the region within the frame of three reoccurring themes: interoperability and equipment compatibility; logistics strategy, support concept development, and doctrine; and resourcing readiness.

Interoperability and Equipment Compatibility

Conference participants viewed interoperability between regional forces as a critical component to countering emerging threats. In the current operating environment, equipment, parts, supplies and diversity of language pose challenges to logistics support among militaries in the region. Partners shared real examples of how those challenges presented obstacles to interoperability and collaboratively agreed that joint exercises were an effective way to verify and validate capabilities and gaps.

Examples shared brought to light how varying equipment from international donors arriving with inadequate levels of resupply and repair parts can greatly affect interoperability. Additionally, the variety of official languages spoken in the region invariably poses challenges to information sharing and communicating in the battle-space. Attendees agreed that a common operating language and compatible equipment have the potential to significantly enhance interoperability and shared logistics practices in the region.

Logistics Strategy, Support Concept Development, and Doctrine

Multinational operations demand ready forces from contributing nations. Participants agreed that readiness is a national priority within their respective countries, but preparedness for peacekeeping operations can sometimes be misaligned with the readiness demands of counter-terrorism or disaster response efforts. This perceived gap drove discussions on the need to harmonize efforts starting with aligned doctrines, strategies and concepts of support.

Partners acknowledged the benefits of U.S. support, highlighting logistics institutional capacity building, lauded national and regional centers of excellence, and encouraged potential for increased instruction on logistics concept development at professional military education establishments across the region.

Resourcing Readiness

West African partners described the need for a culture of accountability in defense procurement and in a limited resource environment, sharing mechanisms, mutual logistics agreements and common-sense resource strategies as critical to sustaining operational readiness. At the core of addressing readiness, is the needed investment in human capital recruitment and retention. Members also discussed the efficacy of local manufacturers as organic sources of supply, acknowledging that the reliance on donor equipment implies a lack of absorptive capacity to sustain a variety of donor equipment using local sources. Dependence on donors also requires supplying more than just major end items, but the spare parts to sustain them. This problem set intersects with barriers to interoperability.

For example, partners outlined how although U.S. security cooperation programs are affordable options to defense equipment and a force enabler, there is a need for faster delivery of equipment and parts. More efficient access to partner or regional markets by U.S. industries is vital to resourcing and readiness.

The reality of donor nation processes and slow delivery windows generated ideas among participants centered on regional training support centers and repair depot concepts that enable forces to conduct counter-terrorism training while sustaining forces and equipment employed in multinational operations. There was interest among African partners in utilizing a logistics hub for crisis response in the Gulf of Guinea.

There was also a consensus that in crisis response, forces need to be prepared to collaborate with commercial and non-governmental organizations and integrate quickly with other teams on the ground. The expectation of militaries to be highly organized, responsive and easily mobilized in the event of natural and man-made disasters requires forces to be prepared as first responders.

At the beginning of the conference, the Director of Cabinet for the Ministry of Defense of Côte d’Ivoire, Mr. Jean Paul Malan, enthusiastically shared his hopes that from the West Africa Logistics Conference would emerge “viable logistical solutions that effectively contribute to meeting the challenge of peace and security in our sub-region.” By the conclusion of the conference, participants achieved a shared understanding of regional military logistics challenges, best practices and opportunities for increased collaboration.

To continue momentum, Bresnihan stated, “During this event, we heard insights from our African partners and gained a greater understanding of methods to strengthen regional collaboration. In the upcoming months, we look forward to continuing to fortify logistics efforts in the region.”",

CASERMA DEL DIN, VICENZA, Italy — Class of 2024 Cadets from U.S. Military Academy West Point’s Civil Engineer Capstone Design Program are designing a canopy structure to cover the west-side basketball court for the U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) on Caserma Del Din, Vicenza, Italy during their stay on October 23 to 25, 2023.

The Capstone Design program requires students to navigate a complex engineering problem, work collaboratively in teams, and persistently tackle the challenge over the course of an academic year.

“For their senior year, instead of having a typical taught class, one of their classes is a capstone project. For the entire year, they are working in teams of 3 to 6 on some project, typical for a client, with the idea that they are working on something that doesn't have a solution already,” says Capt. Robert Hume, a civil engineering instructor from U.S. Military Academy West Point. “This trip is a small part of that year-long project. We figured it would be helpful to meet the clients we are working for, see the site, and see if we can get a feel for the region as well.”

The Deputy Chief of Staff, Engineer (DCSENG) of SETAF-AF has been mentoring and providing open-ended engineering design projects to the program for four consecutive years, guiding students in meaningful engineering design projects that align with their academic commitments.

This year, the Cadet team must provide a structural analysis and design for a canopy structure that fully covers the three basketball courts while minimizing interior columns.

If constructed, this canopy promises to open up exciting possibilities for the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) department, allowing them to expand the fitness area to include an outdoor workout space, mirroring the offerings at Caserma Ederle.

“The strongest benefit is the partnership opportunity, both for West Point, the department of civil mechanical engineering, and for SETAF-AF,” said Capt. Matthew Glavin, a civil engineering instructor from U.S. Military Academy West Point. “We both benefit by providing the Cadets a world class opportunity to put their engineering education into practice to solve a real world problem.”

Student teams undergo an iterative design process: defining the problem and its requirements, analyzing alternatives within the constraints of applicable codes and standards, and ultimately selecting the most viable solution that culminates into the presentation of written deliverables and presentations to a faculty advisor team, external customers, and stakeholders.

SETAF-AF's continued involvement in West Point's Capstone Design Program exemplifies its dedication to fostering engineering talent, preparing Cadets to confront real-world engineering challenges, and ensuring they are equipped to contribute to innovative solutions in the future, reflecting SETAF-AF's commitment to building the engineers of tomorrow.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Nine Army National Guard Soldiers from across New York State spent more than 48 hours in competition to become the “Best Warrior” of the Syracuse-based 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.

Spc. Peter Fillion, 23, of Rochester and Sgt. 1st Class Travis Wood, 32, of Basom were named the brigade’s best warriors in the Soldier and Noncommissioned Officer categories.

Fillion and Wood, both infantrymen, are assigned to Charlie Troop of the brigade’s 2nd Squadron, 101st Cavalry Regiment. They will compete in the New York Army National Guard Best Warrior Competition in spring 2024, with hopes of extending a five-year streak of 27th IBCT Soldiers placing first and representing New York in the Army National Guard’s northeast regional and national competitions.

“The best warrior competition tests a Soldier’s mind, body, and spirit,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Kevin Roeser, senior enlisted leader of the 27th IBCT.

Over two and a half days from Nov. 3 through 5, Soldiers were tested in six events:

- Formal interview board in dress uniform

- 12-mile ruck march carrying a 35-pound pack

- Three-gun shoot, combining rifle, pistol, and shotgun qualification with 10 burpees, a high crawl, and 25 air squats

- Warrior tasks and battle drills

- Land navigation

- Army Combat Fitness Test

Soldiers also had to submit a paper on their Army experience, with junior enlisted competitors focusing on how to improve peer relationships and best prepare for military schools, and NCOs focusing on how to improve leadership, operations, and management.

During the warrior tasks and battle drills, Soldiers were challenged to bound with a buddy while under fire – taking cover behind barriers, crawling under obstacles, and firing back at an enemy. Once they cleared the challenge, they had to immediately provide care to a simulated wounded Soldier under stressful conditions.

“Adding a lot of pressure like screaming, battle sounds, and even putting pressure like hinting at the time – that can allow them to perform under pressure in real scenarios,” said Staff Sgt. Danielle Dillard, a combat medic evaluating Soldiers on their medical skills.

“You have all these factors to increase the heart rate, increase the blood pressure, make them sweat, and get nervous. Their hands are shaking, and that’s what we want. We want them to be under that pressure so that they can train and perform,” she said.

Competitors were chosen as the best-of-the-best from thousands of 27th IBCT Soldiers across the state, after completing competitions at their home units. Fillion and Wood spent extra time preparing for the challenges at the brigade-level.

“It’s a lot of studying, maintaining physical performance, and your sponsor preparing you to go out there and succeed,” said Wood.

Fillion works part-time as an architect for Kideney Architects, while pursuing his graduate degree in architecture from the State University of New York at Buffalo. Wood is an area manager for Amazon.

Whether operating weapons, enduring the ruck march, or presenting knowledge in a professional manner during the formal appearance board, both say the skills and traits they used in competition translate to their civilian careers.

“A lot of my job is attention to detail. Reminding myself, you need to think about the little, tiny things. They all affect something later down the line,” said Fillion. “And just [having] a never-quit attitude.”

Fillion has served in the New York National Guard for more than two and a half years. Wood has served for 14 years, and returned this summer from a deployment to Germany, where he helped train members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Runners up in the competition were Spc. Damien Pagano, an infantryman from Buffalo, assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment, and Sgt. Nicholas Dorrman, a military intelligence systems maintainer and integrator from Saranac, assigned to Delta Company, 152nd Brigade Engineer Battalion.

Competitors in this year’s competition also included:

- Spc. Andrew Buck, an unmanned aircraft systems operator from Victor, assigned to Delta Company, 152nd Brigade Engineer Battalion

- Staff Sgt. Kurtis Schneider, a wheeled vehicle mechanic from Mechanicville, assigned to Golf Company, 427th Brigade Support Battalion

- Spc. Bradley Brundige, a wheeled vehicle mechanic from Baldwinsville, assigned to Bravo Company, 427th Brigade Support Battalion

- Sgt. Nedp Edouard, a cannon crewmember from New York, assigned to Alpha Battery, 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery Regiment

- Pvt. Keara Conn, a fire control specialist from Patterson, assigned to Charlie Battery, 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery Regiment",

BELEM, BRAZIL – Four New York Army National Guard combat medics assigned to the 466th Medical Company, Area Support (MCAS), completed a Brazilian jungle familiarization and academics course with U.S. Army South, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), 7th Special Forces Group and 1st Security Forces Assistance Brigade Soldiers Nov. 1-4.

The medics are among 18 medical personnel and their Brazilian partners providing medical care to service members in Belem, Macapa and Oiapoque during the Southern Vanguard training exercise Nov. 6-16.

New York Army National Guard Maj. Shelly Respecki, the commander of the 466 MCAS, believes the opportunity to learn about the jungle from the Brazilian Army is an invaluable experience.

“The course allows our Soldiers to understand what threats and risks are involved with training in the jungle,” said Respecki. “We’ll be better able to treat the participants knowing what they’re going through and how to survive in the jungle.”

Participants in the jungle course learned about fruits and vegetables in the jungle, hunting and survival techniques, day and night land navigation, and conducting jungle movements and recovery.

Sgt. Gina Alexandro enjoyed the experience.

“I’m excited to not only function as a medic but actually be incorporated in the training with them,” said Alexandro. “I’ve been able to practice on my machete, build my own jungle hooch, and eat exotic fruits.”

Sgt. Brion Pasquale, a combat medic and civilian emergency medical technician, returned for his second visit to Brazil after attending Operation Parana III in the southern region of Brazil.

“I really love coming back to Brazil,“ he said. “It was such a great experience the first time, but to get this type of training in the Amazon is special.”

The 466 MCAS had medical field tents in various locations where service members could be treated for heat-related illnesses, environmental threats, emergency trauma and any other potential illnesses or diseases.

“We have a strong team here on the ground with lots of experience,” said Respecki. “The Brazilian medical team here have been open and receptive, and it’s been great working together.”

The New York National Guard and Brazil have been partners under the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program since 2018.

The 30-year-old SPP program now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe.

RICHMOND, Va. – The Virginia National Guard’s 34th Civil Support Team was evaluated by U.S. Army North as trained and mission capable Oct. 17 and 19.

The 34th CST supports civil authorities in a domestic chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive incident.

During the training proficiency evaluation, usually conducted about every 18 months, the CST was evaluated during two full-scale training exercises, responding to scenarios involving a mock chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive threat.

One of the exercises was conducted at the Petersburg National Battlefield’s Five Forks Unit visitor center, and the other at the Dinwiddie Airport. During the exercises, the CST conducted reconnaissance and sample-collection missions, analyzing substances to determine the severity of the hazard and appropriate next steps, all under the scrutiny of ARNORTH evaluators.

“We are very proud of the men and women of the 34th CST,” said Brig. Gen. Todd Hubbard, VNG director of the joint staff. “Their performance during this TPE reflects their ability to perform a very complex, technical mission with a high level of proficiency. The team demonstrated an ability to deploy at short notice in support of local, state or federal requirements within the commonwealth or anywhere in the nation.”

Lt. Col. Thomas D. Mecadon, commander of the 34th CST, said the unit trained for several months to prepare for the evaluation.

“I could not be prouder of them,” said Mecadon. “The truth is that based on our rigorous training schedule over the past six months and the dedication of the team to training, the TPE just felt like another day of training.”

Their ARNORTH-certified success was even more impressive given the relative lack of experience by many of the CST’s members.

“Over the past year, the team has gone through an immense amount of changeover, approximately 50%,” said Mecadon. “The amount of work, time and preparation they all dedicated to developing as a team is not measurable. It is a testament to their dedication to our mission.”

Mecadon singled out Virginia Air National Guard Capt. Samantha Vittorioso, the CST’s science officer, for developing realistic scenarios to prepare the team.

“The scenarios and agents may have been different and unknown, but nothing presented was new,” he said. “The team approached the evaluation days with flexibility and the knowledge required to overcome the challenges.”

Each team member completes 500 to 900 hours of specialized training during their first year of assignment and continues advanced training throughout their tenure with multiple agencies, including the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, the National Fire Academy, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency.

The team’s primary response area includes a 300-mile radius from Fort Barfoot south to South Carolina and north to Pennsylvania. They maintain personnel on standby at all times and can deploy an advance team within 90 minutes and the main body within three hours.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - The Tennessee National Guard celebrated the life and legacy of former President James K. Polk in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tennessee State Capitol Nov. 2 in honor of Polk’s 228th birthday.

Each year, a representative of the current president is responsible for placing a wreath on the tomb of past presidents to honor them and their service on their birthday. Col. John Kinton, commander of Jackson’s 194th Engineer Brigade, represented President Joe Biden at the ceremony.

“It was a privilege and honor to represent the president today,” said Kinton. “As a Tennessean, I’m flattered to be able to commemorate President Polk for all he has done for our state and country.”

During the ceremony, Kinton and Jaryn Abdallah, the education and outreach coordinator for the President James K. Polk Home and Museum, laid a wreath on Polk’s tomb. Kinton spoke about Polk’s legacy and contribution to the state and nation.

“Polk devoted his life to making Tennessee and the country a better place,” said Kinton. “As president, Polk directed the country’s efforts in the Mexican-American War and shaped the nation into what it is today. There are many parallels with what he endured during his time as president and what we are going through in modern times. We can learn much by studying his life and presidency.”

Also participating in the ceremony was Col. Mark Phillips, the Tennessee National Guard’s state chaplain, who gave the invocation; Sgt. 1st Class James Tate with the 129th Army Band, who played Taps following the wreath laying, and Soldiers from the Tennessee National Guard’s Joint Forces Headquarters, who served as honor guards.

Polk was the 11th president of the United States from 1845 to 1849. He also served in the Tennessee Legislature, as governor of the state and as a member of Congress. He was a captain in the Tennessee Militia and a colonel on Tennessee Gov. William Carroll’s staff.

WASHINGTON — The Army wants to add 800 new students over the next two months to its Army Recruiting and Retention College at Fort Knox, Kentucky, a service leader said today.

In addition, Soldiers who volunteer to serve as recruiters will receive incentives, and the Army pledges to care for those troops and their families, said Lt. Gen. Doug Stitt, deputy chief of staff for personnel.

The bonuses include immediate promotion to staff sergeant upon reporting to their first recruiting assignment and graduates of the school who enroll in the Army Recruiter Course by February 2024 will receive a one-time lump sum of $5,000. The promotions to staff sergeant will be conditional, and Soldiers will still need to meet professional military education requirements.

Staff sergeants who volunteer will be eligible for promotion to sergeant first class if they field 24 signed enlistment contracts and all 24 recruits attend Basic Combat Training over a maximum 12-month period. Current recruiters who extend their three-year assignment will be awarded $1,500 per month for up to 12 months.

The service will also consider reassigning Soldiers slated to attend the Army’s Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina to the Recruiting and Retention College.

Sgt. Maj. Christopher Stevens, senior enlisted advisor for Army Personnel, G-1, said that the selections will not impede the service’s abilities to train new recruits.

Stitt said that last week the service identified a drop in the number of students scheduled to attend the college on Monday, as the service looks to bolster its recruiter corps of more than 10,000 Soldiers.

“The losses exceeded the gains and in order to maintain that momentum that we were seeing within the recruiting force, we [started] to set the conditions for transformation,” Stitt said while speaking to reporters Wednesday. “We made the decision this week to bump up the numbers [of recruiting college students].”

Over the past two weeks, the Army screened and selected Soldiers throughout the force to report to the college by Monday.

Staff Sgt. Dustin Biven, assigned as a non-commissioned officer-in charge of multimedia production at the Defense Media Activity, Fort Meade, Maryland said he received his notification to report to Fort Knox on Friday. Biven’s wife recently gave birth to a baby boy, and he was scheduled to complete his paternity leave. The father of four also had mission commitments and a full-time college schedule that could be compromised by the new assignment.

Biven said that reassigned Soldiers have been asked to shift their life and careers in a short window of time.

“I am very fortunate to have the support system and a wife who could care for our children,” said Biven, 30. “But there are some single Soldiers out there and some single mothers out there — people who probably are not medically fit or are able to go because of pre-existing conditions or surgeries — that are being tapped with this [assignment] and they are frightened.”

Stitt expressed regret for the late notice and said the service will contact the selected Soldiers and work with their unique circumstances.

“I’d like to open up and first of all apologize to the Soldiers and the families that received this last-minute notification,” Stitt said. “That mistake is mine.”

He said the service is working on multiple avenues to minimize the impact to Soldiers and families.

“It’s not lost on me, particularly at this point in time, the impact this last-minute notification and now being on the cusp of the holidays has on our Soldiers and our great NCOs as they navigate a process to support the recruiting enterprise,” Stitt added.

When questioned whether the service will open selection to candidates who do not meet requirements, such as fitness and physical training scores and body fat requirements, Stitt reiterated that standards will be met.

He said that the branch will prioritize identifying the candidates that meet the qualifications to attend the college. Soldiers must be in the grade of E-5 to E-7 and have a minimum four years in service to qualify.

“This is not about a number,” he added. “This is about identifying the right Soldiers to go in there and support this effort.”

“Our standard for suitability screening has not changed,” Stevens said. “We're talking about positions of trust.”

Army human resources will work with the Soldiers’ chain of command and career counselors on a case-by-case basis to assure that recruiter candidates have a smooth transition, Stitt said.

“We will communicate with the family and the chain of command and work this by the individual, to ensure if that Soldier has a life situation, family situation or professional situation,” Stitt said. “We’re going to talk to that Soldier, to that family, to work through this to ensure that we have the right NCOs at the right time to perform this vital mission in service of our recruiting enterprise.”

To build recruiting momentum, Stitt said Army leaders are working closely with U.S. Army Recruiting Command to outline required knowledge, skills and behaviors for the Army’s new military occupational specialty, 42T talent acquisition specialists.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth announced on Oct. 3, 2023, the Army will transform its recruiting force from temporary positions to permanent military occupational specialties for both Soldiers and warrant officers. A pilot program will soon be in development.

For now, the Army hopes to attract enough volunteers to recruit the next generation of Soldiers and asked commanders and leaders throughout the force to encourage Soldiers to volunteer to become recruiters.

“We are communicating through the chain-of-command,” Stitt said. “Talk to your Soldiers. If they are ready to volunteer, here are the incentives. And if you've been identified for reassignment and have some family, personal, professional concerns, let's sit down and let's talk about it.”

THE ARMY UNIVERSITY, FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. - The Army University’s Command and General Staff College inducted two new military members to the International Hall of Fame; Commodore Errington R. Shurland, Chief of Staff, Barbados Defence Force and General Javier Iturriaga Del Campo, Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, Oct. 31, 2023, at the Lewis and Clark building on Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

Since its establishment in 1973, the CGSC IHOF has inducted nearly 300 military officers representing 80 nations.

Nominees are selected based on their distinguished service that has helped them achieve the highest level of leadership within their respective militaries.

“The inductions of Commodore Shurland and Gen. Inturriaga’s today represents the fulfillment of the potential that resides in each student in the military education institution as a direct return on the investment made jointly by our respective militaries and the professional military education of our officers,” Lt. Gen. Milford H. Beagle, Jr., commandant, CGSC said. “Today we celebrate alliance capability and credibility and commitment. Something as necessary as now, as any other time in our history.”

Shurland, a graduate of the Class of 2002 and classmate of Beagle’s, is the first inductee from the nation of Barbados.

He has served since 1984 with his career culminating in his appointment to Chief of Staff to the Barbados Defense Force in September 2021, the first naval officer to serve in this position.

Throughout his career, Shurland has represented Barbados at every level of military service and his leadership is and will remain important as the U.S. and Barbados relationship moves forward, Beagle explained.

Shurland joked that while most claim CGSC is the best year of a young officer’s life, his time can’t be labeled as such wholeheartedly due to a missed first wedding anniversary, tragic events of 9/11, and a historic ice storm.

He continued that the lessons learned while at CGSC 21 years ago have made lasting impressions personally and professionally.

“It was impactful and a significant professional development program that I’ve ever undertaken on my military career,” Shurland said.

He mentioned lifelong lessons in diplomacy and experience in joint, interagency collaboration.

The two lessons he’s taken with him for the entirety of his career include not to seek perfection, and dispute remediation and diplomacy.

“Perfect is the enemy of good enough, is a phrase he [then Commandant Gen. James Sitright] used during an introductory speech to us back in 2002,” Shurland said. “That phrase provided me and I’m sure some of my classmates with some critical guidance.”

Shurland explained seeking perfection often ties up progress to completing tasks.

The second lesson was the impact of the events of 9/11 on the class which included 91 international students representing more than 70 students.

“The current deputy was responsible for managing that situation. He did so with a calm reassurance,” Shurland explained of how the tragic events were explained during the 2002 CGSC. “He managed to resolve concerns and disagreement and conflict in a very constructive way. He encouraged ‘creative tension’ and for a difference of opinions to be share.”

The creation of a space to share conflicting ideas and opinions in a professional, constructive environment was recognized by the international student population who would later address the leadership’s actions in a letter of reflection and condemnation of the actions against the U.S.

Beginning his military career four years before Shurland, Inturriaga’s would take him to positions at every level of the Chilean Army to include his current as Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army.

In 2017, he gained notoriety as he commanded military forces during a national state of emergency during devasting wildfires of Santa Auga.

Since returning to Fort Leavenworth after 18 years, Inturriaga has also reflected on his time at CGSC and its impact on his career.

“My time as an international student of the class of 2006 afforded me the opportunity to complement and enhance my character and knowledge as a field grade officer and throughout my career,” he said.

The CGSC experience was a “key factor” to help him achieve one of the highest levels of his career.

The experience includes the professionalism of the teachers and professors who were part of his CGSC time.

“They acknowledged the experience of our differences that would improve the quality of their lessons and was demonstrated for their respect to our opinions and customs,” Inturriaga said.

He closed his remarks thanking his sponsors and with a parting thought for those in attendance.

“Success is never the objective. Sometimes it is the result of hard work, loyalty and friendship between partners, to include within the Army.”

Inductees into the International Hall of Fame are presented gifts from the Greater Kansas City Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars and the CGSC Foundation.

FORT MEADE, Md – Hundreds of retirees from all branches of service gathered at McGill Training Center here Oct. 27 for Fort George G. Meade’s 48th Annual Retiree Appreciation Day.

The installation hosts this annual event to honor our retiree community and showcases diverse services and support that is offered to retirees around Fort Meade and state of Maryland.

“Every year, Retiree Appreciation Day is Fort Meade’s chance to show our appreciation and celebrate you all for your committed service to our nation,” said Fort Meade Garrison Commander Col. Michael Sapp during his opening remarks. “It’s our connections with the community that make us strong. You all are a significant part of that community.”

Sapp’s intent for this event is to provide a first-class Retiree Appreciation Day event for our deserving retirees, their families within the safety and comfort of Fort Meade.

This year’s event featured a health fair, vaccine clinic, vendor exhibit, DEERS/ID card renewals, casualty and legal assistance, raffle and door prizes as well as an opportunity to hear from keynote speaker, Maryland Secretary of Veteran Affairs, Honorable Anthony Woods.

“We have a military that is going to be called upon to do challenging things at some point in the future. Your experience, seeing everyone stand up here today, makes that very clear. As much as we love to preserve peace, every once in a while, we find ourselves in very tough times,” said Woods. “I am thankful for your service, but I also call upon you to see what you can do to encourage the next generation of people to serve.”

Woods went on to describe different initiatives that the Maryland Department of Veteran Affairs is currently working on to improve quality of life for veterans including the MDVA Service and Benefits Program, PACT Act, Cemetery and Memorial Program, Maryland Veterans Trust Fund, 988 infrastructure and the Joining Forces Project.

The office is also focusing on improving employment options for military spouses, combating food and housing insecurity, encouraging health and wellness initiatives and seeking opportunities to serve alongside the civilian community. Woods took the time after his remarks to speak with many of the attendees one on one to address their specific concerns and point them in the right direction.

Retirees also heard from Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center Commander, Col. Chris Maker, Fort Meade Human Resources Director, Wes Smith, and Fort Meade Military Personnel Division Chief, Marcus Ufeanyui. Maker spoke on KACC’s dedication to taking care of veterans and service members while Smith offered attendees a hearty welcome and Ufeanyui highlighted services available to retirees and their spouses through the Fort Meade Retirement Services Office.

This event ensures retired service members and their families are kept up to date on changes affecting their retirement rights, benefits, and privileges, while fostering goodwill between the retired and active-duty communities.

WASHINGTON — Each day Spc. Joelle Pamplona, a physical therapy specialist, heads into the Madigan Army Medical Center on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington to help veterans, Soldiers and their families heal.

Being able to make a difference in their recovery is what drives him.

""It's the reason I picked this job,” he said. “It makes my day every time knowing that I helped someone and that now they are living their best life again.""

Growing up in Southern California, Pamplona was an active kid. He was into athletics and martial arts.

While watching the popular animated series “Naruto,” he became drawn to one of the characters, Rock Lee, who lacked the talent of others but was able to keep up by training extremely hard.

“This inspired me as a kid to get strong and always improve,” he said.

He started doing pushups, sit-ups and running to increase his strength and endurance. As he got older, he turned to weightlifting and then powerlifting to push himself harder.

While in college in 2018, he broke the state squatting record for his weight class during a powerlifting competition.

The constant training and repetitive heavy lifting took a toll on his body as the injuries mounted. He dealt with foot, ankle, knee and back pain.

“I’ve had it all,” he said. “When you’re younger you have a little bit of an ego, and you just need to outlift everybody. It doesn’t always work out well, and sometimes you have to learn from your mistakes.”

He did just that. He researched how to improve his form, how to prevent injury and how to heal himself. He also started changing his workouts to increase flexibility and mobility.

With his ability to transform his own body, others in school started to take notice and began coming to him for advice. He enjoyed coaching them and helping them bounce back from injury.

This love of movement, physical activity and helping others fueled him as he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology from California State University, Fullerton in 2020.

The timing was not on his side as the coronavirus pandemic hit, limiting his ability to get the hours and experience he needed for a physical therapy specialist position.

He turned his attention to the military and contacted an Army recruiter. The Army offers more than 200 ways to serve as a Solider, including careers in science, cybersecurity, combat forces, aviation, law and medicine.

The recruiter told Pamplona that nothing was available in his desired field at the time, and he would keep him in mind if anything popped up.

Sure enough, a few months later the recruiter called and asked if he was still interested.

“I was like, ‘Heck yea,’” he said emphatically. “I always wanted to join the military. I always looked up to people who served the country. Being able to put on the uniform gives me a lot of pride.”

He enlisted in 2021 as a physical therapy specialist and went to basic training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma before heading to Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston for job training.

The course was challenging as he juggled studying, staying fit and being a Soldier. Time management became a key to making sure he didn’t burn himself out.

Finding enough hours in the day to complete his work might have been a struggle but comradery with his classmates was not.

“We became like brothers and sisters,” he said. “I still talk to them almost every day.”

Following his completion of phase two of physical therapy training at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, he was assigned to his first duty station at Madigan Army Medical Center last year.

There, he’s been able to help veterans, Soldiers and their families recover from injury. He’s even helped several of them rehab following surgery to repair Achilles tendon tears.

This time has allowed him to grow close to many of his patients.

“You build a lot of great relationships in this field,” he said. “You spend so much time with them, and they are in such a vulnerable state. They put a lot of trust in you and in the process to get them better.”

The rehab can be slow at times, but Pamplona says patients get energized as they start to make progress. This is an important step for them physically and mentally.

“Getting back your life is critical,” he said. “It’s critical to your mental health and it’s critical to your well-being.”

In just a few short years, Pamplona has used his drive to improve and help others to become the Soldier everyone on post knows for helping them recover.

“[Joining the Army has] been better than I thought it’d be,” he said. “Just the opportunities it’s given me and the friends it’s given me. I think I got placed in a great situation.”

Pamplona is scheduled to be promoted to sergeant next month.

October is National Physical Therapy Month. It is a dedicated time to celebrate the ways physical therapists, physical therapy assistants and physical therapy students help improve the lives of patients across the country.

WASHINGTON — From war heroes’ stories on the front lines to discussions on leadership, Soldiers have a wide palette of podcasts available to them.

Organizations across the Army have adopted podcasts to share local services and events while podcasts from service-wide publications such as the NCO Journal focuses on broader Soldier topics like transitioning to civilian life. Soldiers can conveniently stream episodes on or off duty, while working out or traveling.

The Army News Service looks into nine growing podcasts from across the Army.

NCO Journal and the Sergeant’s Time podcasts: What began as supplemental content for NCO Journal articles and stories has expanded to regular episodes with topics that vary from career advice, tips on building Soldier camaraderie, and talks on future combat operations.

The NCO Journal podcast provides relevant advice for Army NCOs as well as leadership lessons. The publication fields submissions from the Army’s senior NCO academy staff, NCOs and civilians. For instance, the program hosted a discussion on transition assistance for Soldiers retiring from active duty. The NCO Journal hosts have also held talks on ending NCO misconduct.

“We're trying to diversify and make it more all-encompassing, more approachable for all NCOs,” managing editor Chago Zapata said. “Everything that we do in the NCO Journal we look at it through the eyes of the NCO. Does this article have any bearing? Or does it provide any sort of for depth professional development opportunities for our audience? We have a chance to dive deeper into it in our podcasts.”

Zapata, a retired Marine Corps gunnery sergeant, expanded the programming to a second podcast, titled “Sergeant’s Time” to feature guests of different ranks and backgrounds who do not submit articles. Guests will include the Recruiter of the Year and Drill Sergeant of the Year winners with retired Sgt. Maj. of the Army Daniel Dailey slated to be featured in the first episode.

The Spear, Modern War Institute, West Point: Already renowned for its harrowing accounts of Soldiers in combat, “The Spear” ranks as one of the Army’s top podcasts in listenership. Timothy Heck, deputy editorial director, wanted to diversify the program further.

Heck featured Soldiers of all ranks, genders, and career fields, including logisticians and public affairs officers, and even included troops outside of the Army. Heck, now a former assistant West Point professor, noticed episodes focused heavily on Operation Enduring Freedom and the war on terror.

He then began featuring stories from the Vietnam War and World War II.

“There’s more to the Army, and there’s more to combat than the 11 Bravo [infantry] experience,” Heck said. “So, let’s look there. I wanted to make [the podcast] more than just the Global War on Terror.”

In the Spear’s episode “Across the Fence” on Sept. 27, Heck interviewed former Army Green Beret John Meyer, who went on secret missions in North Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Meyer volunteered for Special Forces training in Vietnam, where eventually Green Berets would join indigenous Soldiers in an eight-year secret war.

Heck spent time as a Marine Corps artillery officer and did one tour in Iraq before becoming a military historian. His featured guests included Medal of Honor recipient Earl Plumlee, Navy Seal Rick Witt, and Army Rangers.

Heck added that the podcast’s audience grew in part to episodes that focused on the Russian-Ukraine conflict and the U.S. contributions to the war. Last spring, Heck interviewed the chief of the Ukrainian Army’s chaplain corps.

The Marne Report, Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia – Fort Stewart’s local weekly podcast has slowly grown after initially having a small following. Hosted by Molly Cooke, the Marne Report updates Soldiers and post residents on local events including holiday celebrations and fitness competitions.

The episodes offer tips on deployment preparation for Soldiers, as well as back to school advice for families, and interviews with installations commanders and leaders.

Topics range from discussing respite care for the family members of deployed Soldiers to anti-terrorism awareness tips.

“A really cool thing about this podcast is that we've got interests across the board from active-duty service members to their family members,” Cooke said. “So, it’s a broad range of topics.”

FORSCOM Frontline, Army Forces Command, Fort Liberty, North Carolina – FORSCOM’s podcast focuses on the command’s mission of bolstering Soldier readiness and tells stories of troops on the frontline. The program features topics unique to the command, including FORSCOM’s recent Best Squad Competition but also delves into subjects that impact the whole force, including improving quality of life and suicide prevention.

Frontline publishes two episodes a month and most recently featured the Golden Knights, the Army’s demonstration and competition parachute team. The podcast has posted interviews with Olympic Gold Medalist Amber English, a member of the Army’s World Class Athlete Program as well as an explosive ordnance Soldier who was featured on the Food Network.

Some episodes offer advice including one that discussed how to identify scams and fake social media profiles of prominent military members, while another offered testimony from a holistic health and fitness officer.

Leader Up, Army Management Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas – The “Leader Up” podcast, hosted by the Army Management Staff College, focuses on Army civilian professionalism and leader development.

Episodes feature commentary by Army senior leaders including James Helis, director of the Army Resilience Directorate. Helis discussed how Soldiers and civilians can build resilience by learning coping skills to plan, set goals, and maintain positive attitudes to prevent harmful behaviors.

“If you’ve got the coping skills to deal with the challenge, you’re less likely to turn to unhealthy alternatives; to substance abuse, to [suicide], to acting out in the workplace,” Helis said.

The podcast also tackles broader Army topics including the service’s digital transition to streamline its data processes.

Kyra Pearl, 11th Corps Signal Bde., interview guests on Fort Hood’s Great Big Podcast, while host Samantha Harms, Fort Hood Public Affairs, controls the levels during a podcast recording Monday at III Corps Headquarters.

The Great Big Podcast, Fort Cavazos, Texas- Derived from the installation’s “The Great Place” nickname, “The Great Big Podcast” explores the mission and achievements of Fort Cavazos’ local units including the 1st Cavalry Division. However the podcast features a diverse array of topics that not only caters to Soldiers but the larger military community.

The weekly program, which launched on Dec. 16, 2019, also delves into topics such as the prevention of domestic violence, domestic abuse and suicide. The episodes feature a variety of subjects, from the role of a first sergeant to how Soldiers can contribute to the Army’s antiterrorism program and environmental sustainability.

“The Great Big Podcast is unique truly because of the focus that we take when it comes to telling the Army story,"" said Samantha Harms, command information chief. ""So often you only hear about the typical topics of being a Soldier — trainings, weapons, deployments — which are covered in our podcast.

""But it is important to remember that a Soldier is human first ... We tell the story of services on the installation, the reminders of how the Army operates for that young Soldier or to inform the public, share intimate stories on domestic violence to remind people that they are never alone, and so much more.""

Episodes have discussed the impact of Army civilians in service modernization as well as leadership development. One episode featured the impact of the Army on the Texas-based rock band Bowling for Soup.

""The community we have here in Central Texas is something that is quite special,"" Harms said. ""It is filled with service members, retirees, veterans, Department of the Army civilians, contractors and people who truly work hard to constantly better the place they live in. Our podcast reminds them that we are here for them too.""

Breaking Doctrine, Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, - The Army’s flagship center for doctrine located outside Kansas City, Kansas focuses its “Breaking Doctrine” podcast on current and trending topics related to doctrine; the fundamental principles that guide the military’s actions toward national objectives.

For example, a recent episode examined recruiting challenges as the Army looks to rebound from recruitment shortfalls. Gen. Johnny Davis, who leads Army Recruiting Command, answered questions on how Army recruiters could better appeal to potential candidates for military service.

Another episode performed a case study on a dangerous combat operation maneuver called passage of lines. During the operation, a stationary force creates a pathway for another force to pass its position.

Episodes ranged from exploring how the Army shifted from active defense to the most recent operational philosophy, “AirLand Battle,” which stresses air and ground theater operations to intricacies of the Army Field Manual 3-0. The manual establishes the doctrine for multi-domain operations, the service’s operational concept.

The Army Soldier for Life Podcast, Soldier for Life – “Army Soldier for Life,” which connects Soldiers and families to assistance programs, offers advice on permanent, change-of-station moves and the transition to civilian life.

The podcast, hosted by Lt. Col. Ismael Ortiz Rivera, Soldier for Life employment director, also discusses financial tips for Soldiers, career development for military spouses and career skills programs.

Additionally, episodes highlight eligible healthcare for Soldiers once they retire. The program featured episodes that explored various career opportunities including the Secret Service.

The Army Soldier for Life program works closely with communities to encourage opportunities for veterans to keep ties with the Army.

The High Ground, Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama – USASMDC’s podcast offers news of the command, which provides space and missile capabilities to joint services and partner nations while supporting multi-domain operations.

One episode discussed how members of the 100th Missile Defense Brigade Operations Team in Colorado Springs, Colorado, perform a critical national security mission. Under the guidance of a presidential order, the 100th Missile Defense Brigade defends the U.S. from the threat of intercontinental ballistic missile attacks.

FORT BUCHANAN, Puerto Rico—Various service members and federal civilian employees supported the Red Ribbon Week campaign, led by the 1st Mission Support Command and U.S. Army Garrison Command Fort Buchanan Army Substance Abuse Program, by wearing a red shirt for work to raise awareness about the dangers of substance abuse and encourage healthy, drug-free lifestyles, October 25.

Red Ribbon Week is a national campaign in the United States. Dr. Carlos Montañez Cintrón, the ASAP coordinator for the USAGC Fort Buchanan, explained that the campaign was established in 1985 to honor Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, an American Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was killed in the line of duty while working undercover to investigate drug trafficking.

""The red ribbon has become a symbol of his sacrifice and a commitment to drug prevention efforts,"" said Dr. Montañez. ""With the slogan 'Be kind to your mind, live drug-free,' our aim is to raise awareness in the community.""

An information booth was set up at The Exchange here, where informative pamphlets and campaign materials were distributed. Visitors were also educated on the proper use and handling of controlled substances.

The goal is to guide veterans and the community towards a healthier, drug-free lifestyle, said Sgt. 1st Class Yadira Valle Lopez, a soldier of the 1st MSC working at the ASAP information booth.

""We are actively raising awareness in the community about substance abuse and promoting Drug Collection Week,"" said Yesenia Pagan Rosario, the Drug Testing Coordinator of the 1st MSC. ""On October 28, the Fort Buchanan community will have the opportunity to drop off their expired, unused, or unwanted medications at the Fort Buchanan's PX from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm.""

Pagan Rosario explained that the event is organized by the DEA and promotes proper disposal of medicines.

Visitors at the Exchange expressed their appreciation for the initiative, as they believe that the information provided promotes the well-being of the community.

""I found the presentation very informative because there are times when people are unaware of the consequences of mishandling medications,"" said Jose Miguel Rodriguez Melendez, a retired veteran.

""The last time I attended an event like this, I received a campaign ribbon, which I still have hanging in my vehicle to raise awareness,"" said Nilda Lopez, the wife of a retired veteran.

The 1st Mission Support Command offers services and programs that enhance readiness and resiliency, like the Sexual Harassment and Assault Program (SHARP), Suicide and Prevention, Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP), and Private Public Partnership Office.",

WASHINGTON — It is four in the morning and already they are lined up at Chicago’s Midway airport, ready to go. It’s like a military formation, 107 men and three women, all veterans who served either in World War II, Korea or Vietnam.

Their destination: Washington D.C, on a chartered Southwest Airlines 737 thanks to Honor Flight Chicago, a group of dedicated volunteers who make it their mission to provide a well-deserved thank you to veterans for their military service.

“Three World War II veterans, 10 Korean War veterans and 97 Vietnam veterans are on this flight,” said Honor Flight Chicago Co-director Doug Meffley, “We have now flown over 10,600 Veterans which is the most of any Honor Flight hub in the nation.”

Southwest Airlines First Officer Brian Dunn, who serves as an Army Reserve public affairs officer at the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, was the co-pilot on this flight. He met with the veterans, shook their hands, and asked about their service prior to the flight.

“I think it’s such a special thing. There’s an organization that will mobilize all these volunteers to have such an impactful day for the World War II, Korea and Vietnam Veterans,” said Dunn, who worked his first honor flight eight years ago. “To have the honor of working as a crew member on this flight is pretty special.”

Flying and military service are part of Dunn’s Family heritage too. He always wanted to pursue flying since he was a young man.

“I think flying was always a part of me. I’ve known since I was eight years old that I wanted to be an airline pilot. I put all my energy and focus into achieving that dream. It’s a big reason why and how I (joined) the military,” said Dunn.

Dunn, who currently serves at the rank of lieutenant colonel, further touched on his service in the Army Reserve.

“Along the way I’ve made a wonderful career in the Army Reserve in a non-flying capacity. I’ve had the opportunity to be the head of human resources on a general staff and I’ve taught military history at the University of Illinois Chicago. I’ve been a commander and now I get to work in Army public affairs,” said Dunn. “It’s been a diverse, wonderful 26-year career so far and I’m not done yet. I’m grateful for it.”

Dunn’s grandfather was the captain of a B-17 crew that flew 38 missions over Europe at the end of World War II.

“He was at Pearl Harbor when it was bombed. My father and husband both served in nuclear submarines in the Navy,” Dunn said.

After they arrived in Washington, D.C., a police escort led the chartered buses to the Iwo Jima memorial for the first stop. Then it was on to the World War II memorial where they were greeted by an actor portraying General George Patton.

There, John Clauson, a St. Charles, Illinois resident, recalled his service in the Army Air Corps during World War II.

“I was in the air corps cadet program for pilots for about 18 months. They sent us to college for four months in Galesburg, Illinois. Then I went to cadet training in San Antonio, Texas. In 1945, we finally got to Chickasha, Oklahoma where we started to fly the PT-17 Stearman,” said Clauson. “I was reclassified to go to B-29 gunnery school. We used the B-24 to learn the gunnery system. We finished gunnery school in August and we were ready to go when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.”

Clauson was honorably discharged at Fort Sheridan, Illinois.

After leaving the World War II memorial, the veterans traveled to the Korean War and Vietnam Veteran’s memorials.

At the Vietnam Veteran’s memorial, a veteran quietly etched the name of a Soldier on a piece of tracing paper.

Vietnam Veteran James Doffin, of Dyer, Indiana, who served as a demolition expert and combat engineer, was moved by the outpouring of gratitude from citizens which, Doffin stated, did not happen when he returned home.

“When we came home (from Vietnam) nobody paid much attention to us. Today was awesome. I think I shook more hands than I did in my lifetime,” Doffin said. “Words can’t express how nice it was.”

The last stop for the veterans was the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport. It is home to the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Space Shuttle Discovery and a SR-71 Blackbird spy plane.

When they returned to Midway Airport that evening, the veterans were greeted by hundreds of well-wishers who waved American flags and held welcome home signs thanking them for their service.

“This is the most fulfilling thing I will do in my life. To see the veterans come home to this love and respect that is 50 years in the coming,” said Meffley. “I have yet to get through a flight day without tears.",

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. – The 39th Annual Army 10-Miler, held October 8, 2023 in Washington D.C., annually attracts more than 35 thousand runners and 900 teams from around the world.

U.S. Army Reserve Master Sgt. Laroy Warren, G-1 Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge, IPPS-A Liaison, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, was in the pack competing in his first Army 10-Miler.

“At the starting line, they had runners broken down into waves. It was a lot of people. The atmosphere was inspiring. There were all levels of fitness, whether it was walk run or run,” Warren said. “Each wave may have had five thousand runners.”

Each wave was released roughly eight minutes apart, followed by another wave. During the race, Warren maintained a nine minute per mile pace and finished in one hour and 35 minutes while encountering trouble at mile four.

“I sprained my ankle near the water stop. I stepped into a pothole. For six miles I was in pain, but I knew if I stopped, the swelling would have intensified,” said Warren. “I stopped thinking about the pain and continued the same pace. I wasn’t looking for an excuse to stop. I just kept pushing through.”

Despite the pain, the veteran Soldier, with 24 years of Army Reserve service, said he found plenty of enjoyable moments along the route.

“My favorite parts of the course were running past the Washington Monument, running through a viaduct where the light changed from sunny to dark, and during the turnaround where you get to interact with other runners by giving each other a high five or yelling words of encouragement,” said Warren.

Leading up to the Army 10-Miler, Warren ran numerous 5 Kilometer (3.1 mile) races for months.

“I was training to run 5Ks in 2022. I ran a total of 30 5K and 10K (6.2 mile) races from March to November. In 2023, I decided to step it up and run 10K races. I have run 35 races so far this year. I run every weekend. When the Army 10-Miler came around, I decided to get involved and go for it. I’m currently looking to participate in a half marathon,” said Warren.

However, it is an ironic situation for a Soldier who pursued running because he does not like to do it.

“The reason I run is because I don’t like running. If I make it fun, I kind of enjoy it,” said Warren. “The way you get better at something is you pick something you do not like to do and work on it and get better at it.”

He referenced a quote, from boxer Mike Tyson, that he keeps on his phone.

“Discipline is doing what you hate to do but, nonetheless, doing it like you like it,” said Warren.

Fitness and sports have always been a passion of Warren’s since he was a child.

“I played little league baseball. I swam in high school and played a lot of basketball. I’ve been an athlete all my life. I think I found my passion to be fitness,” said Warren. “If you love doing something, whether you get paid or not, I consider that a passion.”

He also conducts a free early morning fitness session for Soldiers and Army Civilians working to improve their fitness.

“I’ve been doing my morning fitness group for five years,” said Warren. “There are other Soldiers that need help with fitness, and it also helps me out. Just like I’m pushing them, sometimes they push me.”

Warren stated that he has advice for those thinking about running the Army 10-Miler in future years.

“Start training now. It depends on your goals. Get some miles under your feet. Start running some 5K races. That makes it fun. Keep doing them and do some running on your own. Increase the mileage and you will be ready for 10 miles in no time.”",

WASHINGTON — The Army will build a new blue book and blue book app to reinforce standards and discipline across the service, the Army’s top enlisted leader said.

The Army Software Factory in Austin, Texas leads the initiative, scheduled to release by October 2024.

The app will contain the non-commissioned officer and Soldier creeds and feature a set of standards that will remain uniform across the Army including leadership responsibilities. A digital library in the app will link to other service publications and units can add their own unique history.

The new blue book mobile app will eventually be able to provide instant updates and alerts when the Army passes a new regulation. Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer said that adopting clear, service-wide reference, like the new blue book, will be critical in future conflicts.

“You can’t build standards and discipline in a time of crisis,” Weimer said during his initiatives briefing at the Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington Wednesday. “If we’re really going to be truly ready for large-scale combat operations, we have to have those standards and discipline before we get called upon for that.”

Army Training and Doctrine Command Sgt. Maj. Raymond Harris will form an operational planning team to seek Soldier feedback to help create the app across the three service components, Active Duty, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard.

The Army created the blue book as a guide for all Soldiers for standards, discipline and culture. Soldiers will receive the document upon entering Basic Combat Training. The book establishes Army ethics early in a Soldier’s career to introduce new troops to the Army’s culture and form their moral core.

Weimer said the responsibility of enforcing the Army’s standards remains with its NCO corps.

“The foundational document will be the same for all of us, period,” Weimer said. “You still have to lead and still have to have the personal courage to live the standard and enforce the standard.”

Concerns over the erosion of discipline and adherence to service regulations grew during the coronavirus pandemic when many Soldiers teleworked from home for the first time.

“I think COVID really highlighted an issue with standards and discipline,” Weimer said.

Weimer said that Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy A. George’s transition team held more than 500 conversations with division commanders and division sergeants major, and the most frequent topic was standards and discipline.

Harris said Soldiers have had some questions about the clarity of current Army standards and their interpretation. He said that the new blue book will provide needed specificity.

“We’re going to remove some of that ambiguity, so you leaders and Soldiers feel empowered or are empowered to make that change and correction,” Harris said. “And you’re not afraid to do it.”

WASHINGTON — Between his full-time duties as a special operations non-commissioned officer, deployments and parental obligations, Sgt. Maj. Benjamin Buzek spent more than nine years earning his bachelor’s degree.

He then wanted to pursue a Master of Business Administration without pulling dual responsibilities as a Soldier. So Buzek devised a way for NCOs to attend The College of William and Mary Raymond A. Mason School of Business in Williamsburg, Virginia full time while still receiving active-duty pay.

The college offers a full-time MBA program for active-duty officers and veterans, but previously, there was no program for active-duty NCOs, Buzek said.

Two other NCOs have earned their MBA through the Buzek’s initiative since Buzek graduated from William and Mary in August 2022. Although the program has limited eligibility, Buzek now hopes to expand it to afford other Soldiers the same opportunity.

Buzek’s efforts earned him the 2023 Sgt. Maj. Larry L. Strickland Educational Leadership Award. Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer presented Buzek the award in a ceremony at the Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington Oct. 9.

Strickland, senior enlisted advisor to the Army deputy chief of staff for personnel, died in the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. The 29-year Army veteran strongly believed in Soldier education and professional development.

Buzek believes the changing nature of war requires Soldiers of all ranks to be better educated to make smarter decisions in combat.

“I think the times when officers were the only educated people that make decisions, that’s changed,” said Buzek, 40. “[On] today’s battlefield, the command team of officers and NCOs have to move at the speed of light because the enemy is moving that quickly.

“As the wars have ended, the best thing that you could have is experience,” he added. “The second best thing you could have is education. So, I think it’s incredibly important that our force is educated and that our NCOs get the time to go to school.”

Buzek said that he had to secure permission from his chain of command for successful enrollment in the program and to receive his full-time salary.

“I think great leaders don’t do things for themselves,” Buzek said. “They do things for people that they’re leading. This program that I’ve developed wasn’t just for me, it was for the next person.”

As a teen growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, he described himself as a “troublemaker.” After enlisting in the Army at 17 in 2000, he went on to have a successful 23-year career in special operations.

Master Sgt. Jacob Connor, NCO-in-charge of the 101st Airborne Division Public Affairs Office at Fort Campbell, Kentucky won the Sgt. Maj. Dawn Kilpatrick Memorial AUSA Scholarship Award for excellence in Public Affairs.

The award is given in honor of the late Kilpatrick served in Army public affairs from 1979 to 1999. She took roles as the editor of three Army publications and also acted as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Army. She died of cervical cancer eight days after her retirement from the Army in 1999.

Connor, a 16-year veteran who started his career as a cavalry scout, credited his fellow staff members for winning the award.

“My shop stands out because of the teamwork; the team that we built, the camaraderie that we have,” Connor said.

Story by: Carlos Cuebas, Fort Buchanan Public Affairs Officer

FORT BUCHANAN, PUERTO RICO- The U.S. Army story would not be complete if it did not include the contributions made by Hispanic Americans. This ethnic group has an honorable military service record dating back to the Revolutionary War. That is why Hispanic Heritage Month allows us to recognize and appreciate the contributions of our Hispanic American Soldiers, Army Civilians, and family members, who live by the core Army values every day.

One of the most memorable contributions of Hispanics can be seen through the eyes of the Borinqueneers. The unit was active from 1899 to 1956 and, in 1959, reconstituted as part of the Puerto Rico Army National Guard.

The Borinqueneers were the only Hispanic unit from the Korean War to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. Many recognize this as the last battalion-sized bayonet assault in Army history. Today, the youngest of the surviving members are in their eighties and nineties.

Many hear these stories and can only imagine. At Fort Buchanan, we are blessed because we have the privilege to see members of the Borinqueneers around post almost daily.

One of the members of the Borinqueneers that frequently can be seen around the post is Victor Labarca, a Korean War veteran.

""I am very proud to see these young Soldiers who serve with a great sense of dedication,"" said Labarca, who served in Korea in 1950, wearing the Sentry Box uniform patch, also known as Garita, currently used by the U.S. Army Reserve 1st Mission Support Command.

""That patch is very special. To us in Korea, it meant that we had a piece of Puerto Rico with us on the battlefield,"" added an emotional Labarca during an interview a few years ago.

But at Fort Buchanan, we can honor the sacrifice of past generations, such as the Borinqueneers, and first-hand witness the significant contributions the new generations of Hispanic Soldiers make every day.

With ten years of service in the Army Reserve, Staff Sgt. Liza Baez is a member of that new generation of U.S. Army Soldiers from Puerto Rico. She has excelled in and out of uniform.

""I have played professional basketball successfully for a long-time representing Puerto Rico. When I joined the U.S. Army Reserve, I quickly realized that the same skills that you need to be a successful professional athlete are the same ones you need to be a Soldier: discipline, dedication to duty, and the ability to focus on your mission,"" said a proud Baez who is a Puerto Rico native.

Baez also reflected on her Hispanic ethnicity.

""I am proud to be Hispanic and to be a U.S. Soldier. Everywhere I go, I honor past generations of Hispanic Soldiers by being professional and by doing my very best in everything I do while trying to inspire others to do the same, regardless of their ethnicity. We all are Soldiers,"" said Baez, a Culinary Specialist in the Army Reserve.

According to the U.S. Army Equity and Inclusion Agency, today, more than seventeen percent of America's Soldiers and seven percent of Army Civilians are of Hispanic or Latino descent. A large proportion of Fort Buchannan's workforce is of Hispanic origins.

Fort Buchanan serves a diverse military community of approximately 15,000 active duty, Reserve and National Guard military, Marine Corps Reserve, and Navy Operational Support Center.

The military installation also offers critical services to the Department of Defense civilian population, veterans, retirees, and their families, as well as more than 30 federal agencies in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.",

WASHINGTON — The Army becoming a data-centric, technology-driven service is one of the Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth’s top objectives.

During her keynote speech to kick off the 2023 Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C., she spoke about the importance this plays in fielding the Army of 2030.

“We must continue to embrace innovation and transformation or risk failing to address future threats,” she said. “In close partnership with industry, the Army has pressed ahead and stayed on track to implement our most ambitious modernization effort in 40 years. With the introduction of each new system, we continue to increase our force’s capability to respond to various threats and serve as a credible deterrent to our adversaries.”

To expedite changing the Army and its business and operating model to leverage data strategically, the service created the Digital Transformation Strategy in 2021.

This outlines three key areas the Army must improve to leverage innovative and transformative technologies: modernization and readiness, optimized digital investments, and a technically savvy, operationally effective digital workforce.

In the last two years, the Army has been laying the foundation of the strategy by implementing the right policy, guidance and resourcing so it can quickly integrate technologies in the future.

“I think that is a big piece of where we are moving right now, and as you look at the next couple years, it really is about maturing that foundation,” Army Chief of Information Leonel Garciga said during an AUSA panel this week. “I don’t care how good an algorithm is. If you don’t trust the platform, or you don’t trust the network, do you trust the output of that algorithm? I think the answer is no.”

One of the key foundational pieces is making sure that the data being collected is properly labeled across the entire Department of Defense. This will allow the systems to communicate and scale quickly.

“We’ve got to ensure across all the functional communities in the Army, we have a common way of tagging, governing and ensuring that the data is accurate,” said Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo, who serves as the Army’s chief operating and management officer. “Once we do that, then I think we’ll be able to really start humming.”

The Army is taking an enterprise approach to change and transform faster. It is working on a more unified and coherent network. It’s changing how it trains Soldiers to use and interact with emerging technologies. It’s also adopting industry best practices for software development and updating its acquisition policy.

“In order for us to succeed, the challenges aren’t really technical because industry has most of this stuff already figured out,” Camarillo said. “The real question is how quickly can we adopt and change our processes to make the most advantageous use of capabilities that are already in the market.”

All this work is being done to give commanders and Soldiers on the battlefield the timely information they need to make informed decisions.

“So much of what we do involves software, involves data, it’s going to impact the entire range and spectrum of military operations in the future,” Camarillo said. “For us to maintain [our technological] advantage, we absolutely, as an imperative, have to get this right.”

WASHINGTON — Hundreds of Soldiers and Family members participated in a Family forum on quality-of-life concerns with Army senior leaders during the last day of the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C.

The participants voiced their concerns on a wide range of topics including health care, spouse employment, education, and barracks and housing issues.

“I know that we have a lot of work to do,” said Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth. “We are an enormous organization with an enormous inventory of housing and barracks. We know there is always continuing work to do, but I think we’ve done a lot in the last few years to make sure we are supporting our Soldiers and Families.”

Child Development Centers

The Army is putting an emphasis on expanding its number of child development centers, Wormuth said. The service built six new centers and has at least five more on the way.

The Army is also looking to increase staff at CDCs by increasing wages and providing incentives. The Department of Defense recently adjusted how much service members pay for child care at CDCs for the current school year.

“I know child care is a huge issue,” she said. “For me, as a mom, that was one of the hardest things when my kids were young.”

New Installation App

When Soldiers and Families move to new installations, one of the biggest challenges they face is finding the right resources for the information they need, said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George.

To alleviate the problem, the Army Software Factory is working on a mobile application that will bring information into one place. The team is currently reaching out to Soldiers and Families for ways to tailor the “My Army Post” application for use across the service.

“We are going to make this happen, and we want your feedback on what else you need,” George said. “I think this is important. We have a lot of resources in the Army, and we want to provide them.”

Spouse Employment

The Army is working on a number of initiatives to increase spouse employment. One example is that military spouses and dependents stationed in Italy can now telework for American companies. This is a big win, Wormuth said.

The Army is looking at increasing direct hiring opportunities for spouses. They are also working to ensure states follow the recently passed Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act that recognizes service member and spouses’ valid professional licenses when they move to another state.

Barracks and Housing

The Army is the service with the largest number of barracks. It spends more than $1 billion annually and has a maintenance backlog of $6.5 billion to bring the quality of barracks up to standard.

“That’s going to take some time, but we are making progress,” Wormuth said. “The chief of staff of the Army and the sergeant major of the Army and I are working to increase the amount we are spending on military construction for barracks.”

Army leadership is working to provide 100% sustainment funding for barracks and to spend more on renovation and construction, Wormuth added.

There is a barracks summit scheduled for the end of October to discuss improvements.

“We are doing a lot in that area to really try to make sure that our Soldiers are living in the kind of accommodations that they deserve to live in,” she added. “Be patient with us.”

As the forum ended, leadership reiterated the importance of these quality-of-life issues for Soldiers and their Families.

“We just want you to leave here today knowing that none of these concerns surprised us,” said Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Weimer. “We absolutely know they’re important. We absolutely know these are priorities, and we are taking a look at each and every one of them.”

ARLINGTON, Va. — Africa is a continent of potential and service members at the Southern European Task Force, Africa, work every day to help African partners turn that potential into reality, said Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, commander of the unit based in Vicenza, Italy.

“We are responsible for all of the Army’s operations, activities and investments in support of U.S. Africa Command,” Wasmund said Oct. 11.

Africa is the second largest continent, with more than 50 nations and hundreds of languages. Tens of millions of people live in poverty even as the resources exist to lift up populations.

The African continent contains more ungoverned, under-governed or misgoverned areas, which attract extremist groups like Boko Haram, al-Shabaab, al-Qaida and the like, according to Defense Department officials.

It’s also a continent with little infrastructure and many natural disasters.

SETAF-AF — as the task force is abbreviated — provides a scalable crisis response option to the commander of U.S. Africa Command.

“It is scalable from a platoon all the way to a two-star joint task force headquarters,” Wasmund said.

The command had to do that recently following the coup in Niger. The task force quickly stood up and managed the U.S. forces in Niger. There are about 1,000 U.S. service members in the country, with a small footprint in the capital of Niamey and the most at an airfield in Agadez. The command provides the facilities for the Air Force and Special Operations Command — Africa, which had the counterterrorism mission.

The State Department said the July 26 deposition of the elected president was a coup, which limits the aid the command may provide to Niger. Restrictions under section 7008 of the State Department’s annual appropriations dictate what the United States can provide to Niger in foreign assistance, military training and equipment.

”With the announcement yesterday of the 7008 status for Niger, there will be some things that are suspended,” Waslund said. “They do require a little bit more scrutiny of how we might provide some of that partner support. That’s not something we can continue without further policy decisions.”

The general said the command will continue to maintain communications as the State Department establishes with the Nigerien junta a path to reestablish constitutional government.

Overall, the command’s operational activities include security cooperation, exercises, key leader engagements, medical readiness exercises, and other engagements.

The command also provides crisis response, including a noncombatant evacuation operation from Sudan earlier this year.

While West Africa is a focus for the command — it is the most populated portion area — it engages across the continent. The biggest exercise each year is African Lion, hosted by Morocco and SETAF-AF. It brings together nations from the continent and Europe to train together. The command also sponsors a yearly African Land Forces Symposium, giving military leaders the chance to meet and exchange ideas.

SETAF-AF and U.S. Africa Command help partner militaries as many of them mount counterterrorism efforts. U.S. service members help train partner militaries. The Africans train with U.S. Army security force assistance brigades and civil affairs teams. U.S. military personnel participate in medical readiness exercises and more.

“We have a lot to offer, but we are careful about their capacity so that we don’t overwhelm them,” the general said.

The command works closely with the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program. Wasmund called the program “brilliant” and a true force multiplier. The program, which pairs state National Guard units with nations, began in 1993 and started in Africa 20 years ago. The first two partnerships in Africa were Morocco-Utah and South Africa-New York.

“These Soldiers grew up together,” the general said. “That gives us this depth of relationship, [and] continuity. What we’re doing is ensuring everything ... we do with the African partner is synchronized and complementary.”

VICENZA, Italy – U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, commanding general of U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), said goodbye to a close friend and colleague, Italian Army Col. Michele Biasiutti, Caserma Del Din base commander and SETAF-AF deputy chief of staff - Italy, Sept. 8, 2023.

At an awards ceremony, Biasiutti received a plaque from Wasmund, thanking him for his service and dedication to SETAF-AF.

Biasiutti served in the position since Jan. 2020, and relinquishes his post to incoming Italian Army Col. Michele Amendolagine, who currently serves as the Italian base commander for Caserma Ederle in Vicenza.

“I served with a total of three [U.S. Army] generals during my time at SETAF-AF,” said Biasiutti. “Of course, everyone has their own personality, but there’s a common professionalism within each of these leaders.”

He shared how the source of this leadership must be traced back to the professional development and education the American military provides to its soldiers.

As the Italian deputy chief of staff for SETAF-AF, Biasiutti supported all training and operations for U.S. deployments and redeployments on Italian soil. His team ensured that all Italian rules were followed while Americans lived and operated on Italian bases and training areas.

His work also helped forge lasting partnerships between U.S. and Italian forces.

He regularly facilitated engagements between SETAF-AF leadership and the Italian Army, as well as local civilian and regional authorities.

""Working with my close friend Col. Michele Biasiutti over the last three years was a pleasure,” said U.S. Army Col. Keith McKinley, who recently retired as SETAF-AF’s chief of staff. “Michele contributed directly in enhancing the great military-to-military relationship between the command and our Italian hosts.""

Biasiutti’s position at SETAF-AF was not his first exposure to working alongside American service members.

Previously, Biasiutti deployed to several countries including Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Balkans, Kosovo, as well as Afghanistan where he served as the executive officer to the deputy chief of staff for operation Resolute Support headquarters. In this last assignment, Biasiutti worked under U.S. Army Gen. Scott Miller, commander of U.S. and NATO forces, during operation Resolute Support.

“Gen. Miller personified how a great leader can maximize and magnify the strengths of those around him, leading different services and diverse professionals to unified objectives,” said Biasiutti.

Biasiutti looks forward to his next assignment as he takes command of an Italian Alpini unit in Bolzano, Italy. Donning his distinctive peaked Alpini cap, adorned with a white feather, the new assignment marks a return to his mountain combat roots, he said.

“I am going back to my origins,” said Biasiutti. “I expect there will be challenges, but I will be equipped with the skill set developed over my career, enhanced by my experience working with SETAF-AF.”

WASHINGTON — Simplifying the way the Army trains and builds teams while continuously transforming the force are among the focus areas of the Army’s new Chief of Staff Gen. Randy A. George.

George said the Army must reduce the use of complicated, cumbersome technology while leveraging technology that cuts costs, including video game simulations that can lower spending on training formations. Using artificial intelligence, the Army can replicate realistic battlefield scenarios with less assistance from additional units.

The Army’s top uniformed leader said the nation’s largest military branch must find ways to continually transform, including developing methods to better access and process data while enabling machine learning and autonomy.

“We have to ruthlessly prioritize how we use time and resources,” George said during an Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition’s Eisenhower luncheon today. “Our days, dollars and decisions must be spent on building lethality and cohesive teams.”

George said the service’s top priority in transforming the force will be effective command and control as a foundation. In June, the Army discussed plans to transition to divisions as its unit of action to allow smaller units to maneuver and provide greater command and control capabilities.

The general recently visited the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Vilseck, Germany and praised the unit for its innovative command and control. The 2nd Cavalry’s regiment commander uses five Stryker armored vehicles digitally connected across the battlefield to exercise command and control.

“[The regimental commander] understands the challenges of large-scale combat operations and is adapting in real time to be more mobile, low signature and lethal,” George said.

George also said the Army can use simple, accessible technology such as a tablet to replace large operations centers.

“The world and warfare are changing rapidly,” George said. “We will stay ahead of our adversaries. And so, continuous transformation means iteratively adapting and evolving how we fight, how we organize, how we train, and how we equip.”

George said that he will place trust in Army leaders and commanders to decide how to invest in resources and find the means to build lethality.

The Army must remain ready when called to support operations worldwide. George cited the conflict in Ukraine as an example. Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Army deployed an armored brigade in Poland and paratroopers in the Baltic region to bolster the war effort.

George also announced plans to reduce excess and little-used equipment to help deliver combat-ready formations.

“Our leaders spend too much time laying out equipment and checking serial numbers,” George said. “I talked to a company commander in Europe who had a 118-page property book. That makes no sense.”

Gen. Andrew Poppas, Army Forces Command commander, and Army Materiel Command leader Gen. Charles Hamilton will lead a two-year effort to reduce the supply of excess equipment at two divisions by the end of 2023. In turn, the initiative will save Soldiers hours from managing excess materials, George added.

George said the Army will reduce time spent on vehicle maintenance across the force with “modest changes” to maintenance intervals in the service’s fleet of vehicles. The saved hours will give Soldiers more time to train and spend with families.

The war in Ukraine also revealed the need for greater reserve munition stocks. George said the establishment of a Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team earlier this year will help the Army create a more predictive maintenance model and leverage advanced manufacturing.

“We’ve learned so much from Ukraine’s experience and our experience supporting them,” George said. “We are going to adapt and change.”

During the next iteration of Project Convergence in spring 2024, the service will focus on establishing “kill webs” across the joint and combined teams with partner nations. Kill webs provide decision aides for commanders to quickly outline and identify tasking and re-tasking options on the battlefield.

George said the service’s efforts to modernize and innovate paints a positive portrayal of Soldiers to the American people. He said Americans see Army leaders who demand excellence and hold Soldiers accountable.

“This is critically important because the character of war is changing,” George said. “It is changing rapidly because disruptive technology is fundamentally altering how humans interact.”

WASHINGTON — Gen. Randy A. George, Army chief of staff, detailed five areas that Army Recruiting Command will revamp during the Be All You Can Be Symposium at the Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington D.C. Oct. 9.

The Army will shift how it prospects for recruits, transform its recruiting workforce, realign the recruiting command structure, create an experimentation capability within the recruiting command, and use evidence-based recruiting. It already revamped its slogan, “Be All You Can Be” in March.

George said recruiting has changed drastically since he joined the Army 42 years ago, when “Be All You Can Be” was also the Army slogan. He was trying to figure out how to get money to go to college. He talked to a Korean War veteran who told him he should join the Army.

“It was the best thing I ever did,” George said. “He was very successful in my very small, local community and had a big impact on me.

“When I first came in, I went over to the National Guard armory; got into a van; drove down to Des Moines, Iowa; took the ASVAB test; [and] got to stay in a hotel,” George said. “The next day, I did the medical piece, and by noon I was calling my mom to let her know I was signing up. It was that quick. It’s different now.”

He said he went out and talked to troops around the world to learn from the boots on the ground.

“We’re retaining great Soldiers; they love being in the Army. They love the people and the mission. They’re making lifelong friends and being fulfilled by what they do by being in the military,” he said. “Now we just need to look at how we need to recruit a little differently in today’s day and age.”

Changing how the Army prospects

Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, commanding general of the Army Recruiting Command, trains and leads more than 8,000 recruiters worldwide.

Recruiters are prospecting in a competitive environment with shifting generational and workforce preferences.

George said the Army may need to target recruits from the labor force who are going to work during the day and college in the evenings.

“They still think of the Army as only infantry, armor and combat arms when we have a gamut of critical career fields, George said. “I don’t know if many in the labor force and those in school understand what we truly do for this nation.”

“The high school markets make up a large portion of our enlisted force but with that number shrinking, we need to expand into the labor market,” Davis said.

He said he talks to non-military people like his delivery drivers as much as possible.

“I ask them to educate me. I’ve been in the uniform for so many years. I just want to understand from their perspective,” he said. “They’re very supportive. They trust the military. But they don’t relate to the Army.”

Transforming the Army’s recruiting workforce

The Army developed its recruiting workforce reforms after conducting a 90-day quantitative and qualitative analysis of two million contracts, 1.5 million accessions and 70,000 recruiters since 1998.

“We’re picking the right people, training them and keeping them, and not rotating them all the time so they can interact in their communities,” George said. “They will have language skills, know the area, know the people, continue to progress, know the environment and can be more effective.”

The change will result in a new military occupational specialty, 42T, talent acquisition specialist.

“This whole rollout, it has been on all of our minds every single hour as we look at transforming. This is potentially the biggest change ever to occur in the United States Army Recruiting Command’s history,” Davis said.

Davis grew up hearing war stories from his grandfather, who served in World War II.

“He spent a lot of time sharing his Army story with me,” Davis said. “He was very inspiring to the whole family.”

He hopes to carry on that inspiration to his team of recruiters as they create this new career field.

Davis touts the Soldier referral and recruiter performance incentive programs as successes because they were recommended by recruiters on the ground.

“When [they see] that investment in them, then there’s this surge of energy to get out there and do more in terms of our prospecting, processing and future Soldier management,” Davis said. “Listening to these recruiters and acting on their recommendations, that’s what I’m doing; it’s driving this positive resurgence across the recruiting force.”

Realigning the recruiting command structure

George said that marketing and recruiting will be consolidated and realigned into a three-star command directly reporting to him and the secretary of the Army.

“The tenure will be for four years. I’m going to be personally involved to help drive and make sure we’re getting after the change that we need,” he said.

“This synergy with the brand rollout has been able to help us align our marketing with the needs of our recruiters,” Davis said. “We’re starting to see all of our efforts from marketing, our retraining, what we’ve done to invest in our recruiters and then educating them on this brand.

Creating an experimentation capability within recruiting command

The Army will have an experimentation team, comprised of recruiters supported by experts in information management, data management, survey design, labor market analysis, marketing, operations and procurement.

Recruiters will be able to use technology to analyze the job market, what is and what isn’t working, and use technology in recruiting efforts.

“Most of the great ideas come from the people who are actually doing the mission,” George said. “We need to empower the people who are out there innovating for the Army.”

“Everything we’ve done in this command is from the feedback provided by these recruiters. It’s allowed us to really move resources and invest in their needs. We’re all interdependent,” George said.

Using evidence-based recruiting

George said the Army needs to improve the formal measurement and evaluation of recruiting policy decisions to better determine return on investment and more effectively allocate resources.

“We need to do a better job in the Army of understanding what’s working and what isn’t,” he said. We need to know what’s working in our marketing, how effective is it if you give someone a bonus, [and] what is the sensitivity analysis.”

Some people join the Army to be assigned to specific locations or for specific career fields, George said.

“We need to study that and make sure we have the analytics behind it as we move forward. There’s no more important topic in our Army right now.”

“Our responsibility to the Army is to be experts in warfighting and to be prepared to defend our nation,” George added. “We need the right people inside the Army. People have always been the strength of our Army.”

Rebranding the Army

In March, the Army rolled out the “Be All You Can Be” brand to address a younger generation.

Brian Griepentrog, executive vice president, Fors Marsh Group, leads a team of more than 60 scientists who conduct research for the Army with a focus on recruiting, market and advertising research, vocational choice, personnel selection, training and youth demographics.

His team conducted years of research with young adults and veterans about the perceptions of the Army and Army service. They used the concepts of possibilities, purpose, passion, communities and connection to find out what slogan participants liked best for the Army.

“Across all of these stakeholders, in a number of criteria, when asked if it would be a strong representative of purpose, passion, communities and connection, that was the winning candidate, so that’s why we’re now represented with Be All You Can Be,” Griepentrop said.

Lt. Gen. Douglas Stitt, deputy chief of staff G-1, joined the Army 33 years ago when the slogan was “Be All You Can Be.”

“My father encouraged me to be a part of something bigger than myself. I started out thinking about the mission but fell in love with the people I served with,” he said. “I’d do this job for free. I’d sign up the day after I retire.”

Whether it’s revamping the slogan, prospecting the workforce, transforming the recruiting command structure and workforce, creating experimentation capabilities, or using evidence-based recruiting, the Army is seeking Soldiers for the 21st century.

WASHINGTON — With the Georgia heat bearing down on them, Sgt. Jake Phillips and members of 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, struggled to finish the final leg of the 2023 Army Best Squad Competition’s first phase in September.

Still, the Soldiers had confidence in one another as they carried 35-pound rucks for 15 miles in the woods of Fort Stewart, Georgia. The Soldiers operated on only two hours of sleep and endured food deprivation. Fortunately, the squad boasted some of the most physically-fit Soldiers in the Army including Spc. Chancellor McGuire, who had the highest physical training test scores among all 60 competitors.

They had also competed and trained together for at least three years and some members even deployed together. Knowing his team’s robust fitness levels, Phillips wanted to push his squad to its limits.

The fire team leader learned that slowing their speed during the march actually helped his squad find the endurance needed to secure victory.

“I was always wanting to push the pace past what I think we’re capable of as a squad,” said Phillips, 25. “I was wanting to put more gas when it should have been more brakes. That was personally more challenging.”

Phillips’ guidance helped his 75th Ranger Regiment, U.S. Army Special Operations Command squad win the 2023 U.S. Army Best Squad of the Year award. Phillips, a native of West Chester, Pennsylvania, took Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year honors. McGuire, who hails from Austin, Texas, won Soldier of the Year.

“I think the key for us to win was we’ve all been working together for years,” Philips said. “We all know each other pretty well.”

Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer presented the awards in a ceremony at the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C. today. Soldiers from Army Medical Command finished in second place while the Army Pacific Command squad took third.

McGuire said keeping the goal in sight helped his squad weather through the endurance march.

“It was the last day of the competition. You can do anything for however long you tell yourself you can,” he said.

The 24-year-old McGuire credited his squad leaders and company commanders with helping mold him into a more capable special operations Soldier.

“It means I’m doing something right,” McGuire said of winning Soldier of the Year. “I took a lot from my team leaders coming up, my squad leaders. I took in everything that they have taught me … I’ve kind of become a sponge, so really I’m an image of them.”

The Army revamped its former Best Warrior contest two years ago into the Best Squad Competition to encourage a greater focus on team building and unit cohesion.

This year’s contest, executed by 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, featured another incentive. While competing, the participants could simultaneously earn their special skills certifications: the Expert Infantry Badge, awarded to Soldiers in infantry and Special Forces units; the Expert Soldier Badge, given to Soldiers who are not in infantry, Special Forces and medical branches; or the Expert Field Medical Badges, earned by outstanding medical technicians.

Twelve, five-person squads competed in the first phase of the competition during 10 grueling days at Fort Stewart.

The Soldiers went on ruck marches, completed exercises and did battle drills across more than 200,000 acres of land. The Soldiers engaged in land navigation, operated in urban areas and rucked from each destination. They learned to operate while sleep-deprived, while also taking part in night exercises.

During the competition’s final phase, the competitors travelled to Washington D.C. to be interviewed and evaluated by senior leaders.

McGuire said that his squad, which also includes Staff Sgt. Andrew Ewing, Spc. George Mascharka, and Spc. Shane Moon, finished first because of the bonds that the Soldiers share during and outside of duty. The Soldiers know each other’s families. They work out together and spend time studying in coffee shops.

The USASOC Soldiers faced stiff competition, particularly from the MEDCOM squad of Sgt. Jaime Padilla, Spc. Axxel Pasos, Sgt. 1st Class Kaleb Richardson, Spc. Robert Rupers and Christopher Trejo.

“My squad is the best squad,” said McGuire, a fire team leader. “We achieved something that we set our hearts and minds to, but at the end of the day we came out on top.”

WASHINGTON — Army leaders gathered at the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C. to discuss the service’s strategy as it starts the new fiscal year.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth spoke about the Army’s need to innovate and transform its modernization effort, force structure and recruiting.

“This is a crucial moment for the Army to summon our ingenuity,” she said. “To innovate and invest in emerging technologies; to test and develop in uncharted areas like artificial intelligence and contested domains like space and cyber; to reshape and transform the force to be more adaptable and flexible.”

In the past year, the Army has moved several systems into stages of advanced prototyping, production or fielding.

The Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office demonstrated the successful launch of a Tomahawk Land Attack Missile from the prototype Mid-Range Capability Weapon System in June. This followed the successful launch of a Standard Missile 6, or SM-6, from the system earlier in the year, confirming its full operational capability.

This system gives the Army the ability to strike enemy ships from land, a capability Wormuth said is well-suited for the Indo-Pacific.

One of the top modernization efforts for the Army is the development of long-range hypersonic capabilities. In February, the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force deployed the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon during Operation Thunderbolt Strike.

The Army is also working on emerging technologies including short-range air defense capabilities to defeat unmanned aircraft.

“As small unmanned systems increase in number and decrease in cost, we must have this capability to defend our formations against what will soon be the most common threats on the battlefield,” Wormuth explained.

Robotics is another area where the Army continues to research and develop new capabilities.

This year, the Army started fielding the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport to lighten the logistical load for infantry Soldiers. This paved the way for an even larger system the Army is prototyping, the Robotic Combat Vehicle designed to carry weapons, sensors and other robots.

The secretary also announced the Army is beginning a Human-Machine Integrated Formations Initiative to figure out how Soldiers and robots will work together on the battlefield. She said these integrated formations will bring robotic systems into units alongside Soldiers with the goal to have robots make first contact with the enemy.

“I see us embracing change, looking to the future, and becoming the more modern, more lethal, and more adaptive force we need to be,” she said. “As we pursue the most significant modernization effort in generations, we are building an Army that can dominate in large-scale multi-domain operations.”

Building this Army will require transforming the force structure to ensure the service has the capabilities it needs to meet current and future strategic requirements, she added.

As the force structure changes, so will Army recruiting. Last week, Army leadership detailed the change in who they recruit, how they recruit, and who will be recruiting.

The service is shifting its focus from high school seniors to the larger available workforce. It will also switch to permanent specialized recruiters by creating two new military occupational specialties.

“We have to innovate and transform in recruiting, but also in warfighting concepts and modernization, or risk irrelevance,” Wormuth said. “And the United States Army cannot and will not be irrelevant.”

VICENZA, Italy – The U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) will co-host a Warriors Corner presentation titled ‘State Partnership Program: Twenty Years of Making a Difference in Africa’ during the Association of the United States Army’s Annual Meeting and Exposition Oct. 9-11 in Washington, D.C.

The National Guard’s State Partnership Program has been successfully building relations for 30 years and now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe. There are currently 16 State Partnerships in Africa from 13 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

Gen. Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard, will introduce the National Guard’s SPP Program. Maj. Gen. Todd Wasmund, SETAF-AF Commanding General, will discuss the Army’s support U. S. Africa Command's campaign in Africa and where it interfaces with SPPs in Africa, before turning over to Maj. Gen. Alan Dohrmann, The Adjutant General for the North Dakota National Guard, state partner to Ghana, Benin and Togo to discuss his state’s individual partnership.

Lastly, Maj. Gen. Thomas Oppong-Peprah, Chief of Staff for the Ghana Army, will discuss partnering with both North Dakota and SETAF-AF.

The SPP evolved from a 1991 U.S. European Command decision to set up the Joint Contact Team Program in the Baltic Region with Reserve component Soldiers and Airmen. A subsequent National Guard Bureau proposal paired U.S. states with three nations emerging from the former Soviet Bloc and the SPP was born, becoming a key U.S. security cooperation tool, facilitating cooperation across all aspects of international civil-military affairs and encouraging people-to-people ties at the state level.

This cost-effective program is administered by the National Guard Bureau, guided by State Department foreign policy goals, and executed by the state adjutants general in support of combatant commander and U.S. Chief of Mission security cooperation objectives and Department of Defense policy goals.

Through SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-society relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic and social spheres.

The panel will be held Monday, Oct. 9 from 1430-1510 in the Army Exhibit in Exhibit Hall E at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The discussion will also be livestreamed on the SETAF-AF Facebook page and on DVIDS.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III paid a special visit to service members deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, during his first trip to Africa Sept. 24-25, 2023.

The Secretary addressed a small formation composed of Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines from various units reflecting the joint mission operating out of Camp Lemonnier.

“This command and this installation is the epitome of jointness. The work you do here with our Djiboutian partners and our other allies here is important,” Austin said. “I also know that because you’re here you’re away from home missing family, missing birthdays and anniversaries. So when you talk to your family tell them Lloyd Austin said ‘thank you’ not just for your service as the military members, but for their service as well.”

Before departing, Austin personally recognized several enlisted members for their superior performance while deployed. Among them was U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Craishod Norris, a Foreign Liaison Officer assigned to CJTF-HOA.

“It was an honor to meet Secretary Austin and the feeling of having someone at such an esteemed position in our chain of command take the time to congratulate service members like myself is indescribable.” said Norris. “I’m thankful to be recognized during such a special occasion, but our mission here at Camp Lemonnier is a team effort.”

Secretary Austin’s stop in Djibouti exemplifies the strategic importance of the U.S.-Djibouti partnership and is home to Camp Lemonnier, a critical military installation that serves as a linchpin in counterterrorism efforts and regional stability.

During his visit, Austin met with the President of Djibouti Ismail Omar Guelleh and the Minister of Defense Hassan Omar Mohamed Bourhan to discuss the security partnership between the two nations and shared priorities in the region. He also met with Somali President Hassan Mohamud and discussed the shared effort to counter al-Shabaab in the region.

From here Austin will continue his travels through the African continent later this week by traveling to Kenya and Angola to showcase the department’s appreciation for our African partners.",

WASHINGTON — The Army will now provide incentives for more skilled, experienced civilians who join the Army Reserve.

The service recently expanded the number of certifiable, reserve career fields in the Army Civilian Acquired Skills Program from seven to 44.

Nearly 200 new Soldiers in Fiscal Year 2023 have enlisted or commissioned through the program, which has mutual benefits for both recruits and the Army.

Civilians with experience in jobs that range from musicians to human intelligence collectors, and orthopedic specialists to vehicle mechanics can take advantage of the program. Enlisted Soldiers who meet qualifications will be awarded the rank of specialist, or E-4, and bring needed skills into the force.

The Army in turn will spend less time training new Soldiers, who have already certified their skills through trade schools, professional certifications, academic degrees and time on the job.

“[ACASP] allows us to open a greater talent pipeline to the Army, giving more people an opportunity to join with those skills,” said Col. Fred Hockett, deputy commander for support, Army Recruiting Command. “[ACASP] makes it a little more attractive when people say I can use the skills I've already gotten in the civilian workforce in the Army.”

Hockett said the Army does not currently have plans to expand the number of active-duty career fields but may add more ACASP jobs as the service’s needs change.

Angie Holbrook, Army chief of military personnel, Accessions Division, said that the majority of the new ACASP recruits joined as in the military occupational specialties of42R/S musicians, 68W combat medic specialists and 88M truck drivers. About 80 Army band members enlisted through ACASP.

Holbrook said the program has given Army recruiters another tool to entice potential recruits as they compete for talent in a highly-contested job market.

“The expansion of seven MOS to 44 gives us a much broader range to bring in [Soldiers] who have those skills,” Hockett said.

Holbrook said the service expanded the program due to the success of the original seven reserve MOS and changing demographics. He added that the Army has recently seen more interest towards in intelligence, technology and vehicle maintenance. Coincidentally, Army leaders have targeted recruiting Soldiers in those fields.

“[ACASP] allows us to get people that are using recent, relevant technologies into the force,” Holbrook said. “I think it’s going to give us more depth because it takes a long time for the Army to field the new equipment or field new systems … These people are coming in straight away and being able to put those things into practice with the most recent technologies.”

Holbrook said that qualified applicants may also have the option of shorter service contracts because the Army saves time and funding on ACASP recruits’ training. ACASP not only gives Soldiers a head start on their careers, but it provides a cost-savings tool to bring skilled troops into the force.

“The Army realizes there’s some definite, emerging skills, talents and technologies that we want to be able to put into the force quicker,” Holbrook said. “[ACASP] is giving more opportunities to more people, but also it gives us those knowledge, skills and abilities faster.”

A Soldier who enlists as a track vehicle repairer with two years of training and experience in the repair and overhaul of engines, power trains and chassis components will only require three weeks of advanced individual training compared with 14 weeks for a normal recruit.

Other careers including firefighters, construction engineers, electricians and carpenters require two years of professional experience to receive an ACASP certification.

In some career fields such as combat medic, Soldiers already certified can also hasten the training process. Combat medics must re-certify their skills every two years, and ACASP recruits will already be familiar with the certification process.

Medics must attend a 16-week training program where they will not only learn emergency care but basic life support and in-patient and out-patient care. Through ACASP, a recruit can reduce that training time to 9 weeks.

New Army Spc. Adam Michael of Walterboro, South Carolina joined the Army through ACASP as an 88M Motor Transport operator because of his prior civilian experience working for J.B. Hunt, a motor transport services company.

The program specifically benefits recruits considering joining the National Guard or Army Reserve. Hockett said that qualified recruits can begin applying their skills immediately in their home states.

“There's a lot of overlap between those civilian skills that they've already gone to school and potentially paid for and the MOS-producing courses that we have in the Army Reserve,” Hockett said.

More than 80 leaders from 14 European countries met to discuss strengthening reciprocal fuel support during Defense Logistics Agency Energy Europe & Africa Fuels Exchange Agreements Forum in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Sept. 19-21.

For the 18th year, international partners met to learn more about the DLA Energy International Fuel Agreements program and explore increased partnership opportunities.

“The relationships we have built consistently show the world that we can stand united while supporting one another. This is especially true during the turbulent times being experienced in the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and on the African continent,” DLA Energy Commander Navy Capt. Brian Anderson said during his opening remarks. “Together, we continue to improve and grow this forum through the interchange of open discussion. We all have a lot to learn from each other.”

What started in 2005 with 34 representatives from eight countries talking about fuel support has grown to 80 representatives from 14 countries spending almost a week together networking, discussing capabilities and exploring enhanced interoperability. Representatives were from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Albania, Georgia, and NATO Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

For first-time attendees like Albania and Georgia, the forum provided an opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge of the U.S. fuel exchange agreements program. These agreements, which provide cross-servicing capabilities between partner nations and coalition forces worldwide, help manage fuel costs and optimize the supply chain.

“When a host nation partner with a DLA Energy international fuel agreement receives DLA Energy-owned fuel, the host nation partner pays the standard price DLA Energy charges U.S. military forces,” said Gerald R. Candelaria, DLA Energy Europe & Africa International Agreements chief.

As of July, DLA Energy has 40 fuel agreements with 23 countries around the world. Its International Fuel Agreements team synchronizes with regional DLA Energy offices to establish and maintain these long-term Defense Department fuel agreements with foreign militaries.

Lt. Col. Giorgi Maisuradze of the Georgian Defense Forces said the forum helped him better understand the Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreements process. ACSAs are the formal mechanisms that allow the DOD to acquire, and in some cases to provide, logistics support, supplies, and services directly with eligible countries and international organizations.

“It’s a very good event especially because we are conducting a lot of different exercises and activities with U.S. forces in Georgia,” he said. “This forum is really great for improving understanding of how the system works, especially ACSA and ACSA orders, and to eliminate some of the deficiencies we have in the process and better understand the procedures.”

Capt. Lampros Lampropoulos of the Hellenic Navy General Staff in Greece said the benefits are mutually beneficial.

“The collaboration between DLA and the Hellenic Navy is useful for both parties,” he said. “We are looking forward to improving future engagement.”

Maisuradze found value in meeting his counterparts in person.

“This conference has been great for sharing information and knowledge of other people, who is doing what,” he said. “This is perfect ground for finding people you’ve only met by email and to discuss issues face to face.”

Albania General Staff Lt. Col. Oliverta Dulo agreed.

“Through DLA, we have the opportunity to have fuel access for our troops when they go abroad for training exercises or other cases,” she said. “Now that I’ve been here, I now know the right process to follow and the right person to contact for help.”

Candelaria said his team works hard to maintain strong partnerships across Europe and help DLA Energy’s international partners understand the ASCA process and its benefits to all that participate.

“These fuel agreements are essential elements for U.S warfighters and partner nations not only during routine and emerging operations but in supporting international exercises around the world,” he said. “They help build supply chain efficiency, enhance interoperability with participating foreign militaries, and strengthen long-term collaboration with our partner nations.”

During the week, Italian, Spanish and British partners briefed participants on their fuel programs and experts discussed the Central Europe Pipeline System, Spanish Pipeline System, Turkish Pipeline Facility and Italian Pipeline. A DLA Finance team was also on site to explain invoicing and financial settlements.

“This forum provides a great opportunity to enhance partnerships, discuss worldwide capabilities and explore potential reciprocal fuel support, as well as a chance to reconcile fuel accounts between allies and partners,” said Army Lt. Col. Leslie Shipp, DLA Energy Europe & Africa commander.

DLA Energy Finance personnel presented a briefing, met one-on-one with international counterparts, and signed settlements totaling $80.4 million providing reimbursement to the Department of Defense Working Capital Fund.

Carl Petermann, a fuels management analyst for the U.S. European Command Joint Petroleum Office in Stuttgart, Germany, said the event was one of the best events he’s attended.

“Well done to the DLA Energy Europe & Africa team for putting on a first-class event,” he said. “I've been to a lot of conferences, forums and meetings over the years. However, I don't ever recall one being executed so well.”

The next forum is being planned for Sept. 17-19, 2024.",

Each year, U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) engages in hundreds of theater security cooperation activities, events and exercises in Africa. These initiatives encompass a wide spectrum of training activities across various warfighting domains, reinforcing partner capabilities and fostering improved interoperability.

In order to assist with training activities and exercises, SETAF-AF Soldiers must maintain their own training and readiness. Soldiers permanently assigned to the unit are required to achieve qualification on an M-4 carbine, while those on temporary duty orders are expected to qualify on an M-17 pistol.

“The first things we look at before sending a Soldier to the continent is medical readiness, current with annual training and weapon qualification.” says Capt. Fernando Rubio, company commander of Intelligence and Sustainment Company, SETAF-AF.

SETAF-AF hosts ranges twice a year, specifically during the first and fourth quarters. This scheduling enables the unit to prioritize its support for executing theater security cooperation activities in Africa, including the largest multinational, joint, all-domain exercise conducted by U.S. Africa Command - African Lion.

“The operation tempo slows down during the first and fourth quarter of the year. That is the best time to be proactive with individual readiness and position us to be prepared for exercises such as African Lion and Justified Accord,” said Rubio.

SETAF-AF places emphasis on maintaining and improving Soldiers’ marksmanship by first refreshing their skills on the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST). The trainer is designed to simulate live weapon training and permit Soldiers more trigger time on a weapon, allowing them to increase confidence and familiarization once it is time to qualify their assigned weapon on the range.

“The EST helps Soldiers get comfortable with weapons they haven’t shot before and develop muscle memory…practice makes perfect!” states Sgt. 1st Class Erin Reagan, mobility and exercise non-commissioned officer with 79th Theater Sustainment Command assigned to SETAF-AF.

Soldiers are allocated one week to zero their weapons and refine their skills at the EST. Afterward, they have another week dedicated to qualify with their assigned weapons. Rubio said, “We make every effort to accommodate the schedules of Soldiers departing for and returning from diverse exercises in various parts of the world, including countries in Africa.”

The range is where Soldiers become familiar with their weapons, as the repetitive nature of firing live ammunition helps Soldiers develop muscle memory and fine-tune their marksmanship fundamental training. To qualify, Soldiers must shoot no less than twenty-three out of forty targets on the M-4 carbine, and twenty-one out of thirty on the M-17 pistol.

“You never know what’s going to happen, I can speak from experience. As soon as I graduated from AIT [Advanced Individual Training], I went to Iraq. The more you know about your weapon the better, if anything should happen, you can pick up that weapon and suppress fire,” continued Reagan.

Marksmanship is a fundamental aspect of readiness and embodies the Total Soldier Concept. It fosters weapon proficiency, reinforces safety protocols, and instills confidence in soldiers. Moreover, it contributes to SETAF-AF’s overarching mission in the continent of Africa. Africa is crucial for the security and stability of the United States, as well as for our allies and the global community. SETAF-AF cultivates partnerships with African nations through security cooperation, fostering strength through friendship and a steadfast, enduring commitment. The United States and our allies recognize the significance of Africa, and the U.S. Army is dedicated to promoting security and stability across the continent.

STUTTGART, Germany — General Randy A. George, Chief of Staff of the Army, addressed U.S. Africa Command Soldiers and personnel at Kelley Barracks on Thursday, September 28, 2023, to provide direction and inspiration for those serving within the combatant command.

""I want to thank each and every one of you for what you do,"" expressed George.

The Army Chief of Staff is currently in Europe providing guidance to Soldiers across various military installations. The theme of his tour includes key principles of military leadership, among them reputation, professionalism, and operational excellence.

""If you've got Soldiers on your staff or in your unit, it's imperative they are the absolute experts at their warfighting mission,"" stated George. ""Whatever your rank, the expectation is that you know your job.""

Articulating his expectations, George emphasized the importance of professionalism and expertise in contribution to a Soldier's reputation among peers and superiors.

On physical fitness, George highlighted the connection between fit Soldiers and operational efficiency and excellence. He emphasized the role of physical health in ensuring mental clarity, especially in the demanding context of military operations.

""Expect that you have to be athletes,"" said George. ""If you're more physically fit, you are better able to be a clear thinker.""

Acknowledging the significant role families play in supporting Soldiers, he stressed the importance of families as integral support systems, enhancing the morale and effectiveness of military personnel.

""My wife was in the military for a while,"" stated George. ""She was my classmate at West Point. My view is our families are combat multipliers.""

The 41st Army Chief of Staff also reiterated his ""Ready Army"" mnemonic, a foundational guide for leaders disseminated in August.

Concluding his address, George challenged the audience to empower peers and rising leaders in upholding professional standards despite hesitation.

""We have to push through that and make sure that we are getting after our standards. That's our profession. That's what a profession means.""",

The Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) committee and members from the CJTF-HOA plans and policy section organized a three-day class in Djibouti City, Djibouti, Sept. 25-27.

The WPS level 100 class allowed students to engage in group discussions with their peers to focus on ways they can better integrate the WPS model and gender perspectives across management, development, and employment within the joint forces.

WPS focuses on teaching U.S. service members how to proactively integrate the needs and perspectives of women and empower them to participate in decision-making processes at all levels to influence international peace, security and prosperity. It also aims to work within both the ranks of the military and partner national defense and security sectors to protect the human rights of women and girls, especially during conflict and crisis.

U.S. Maj. Gen. Jami Shawley, CJTF-HOA commanding general, emphasized the importance WPS plays within the command, the African continent, and the military as a whole.

“If one woman is in the room, will she have a voice that has the power of every other voice,” said Shawley. “If not, use your voice, I promise you that for as long as you are here in my command, you will be supported and you will be listened to.”

As one of Shawley’s high-priority initiatives during her time at CJTF-HOA, the WPS has welcomed engagements with both Djiboutian and foreign partners to find ways to educate service members on gender perspective and how to promote equal representation of all voices.

Leading the WPS level 100 course was Denise Phillips, the CJTF-HOA WPS gender advisor, and her team. The intent of the level 100 course is to maximize the success and reach of WPS objectives and give the students the necessary resources they need to serve as Gender Focal Points within their command.

“Every human being deserves the right to feel secure within their ranks, within their jobs, and within their lives,” said Phillips. “The goal of this week’s course was to bring over 40 individuals from CJTF-HOA and spend the proper time to teach them how they can better implement the lessons they’ve learned in their sections and in their components back home.”

During the class, men and women from all branches of service and backgrounds learned practical lessons on how to make their workplace more secure and accepting of different gender perspectives. They also participated in moderated group discussions on problems they have seen in the commands they have served under and how they can solve these issues in their own ranks.

Among the 40 students in attendance was U.S. Army Capt. Ronald Lofano, Civil Affairs East Africa team leader. Lofano and his Civil Affairs team facilitate an English discussion group in Djibouti, teaching English pronunciation and grammar to Djiboutian citizens. A key aspect of his mission is to engage with the Djiboutian community, something he feels more prepared to do with the lessons he has learned from the 100 course.

“WPS impacts every facet of Civil Affairs operations,” said Lofano. “In our bi-weekly English discussion groups WPS plays an integral role in identifying and understanding the socio-economic and cultural experiences that impact women, children and men in vastly different ways.”

Another student, U.S. Army Col. Antionette Mulholland, CJTF-HOA logistics director, expressed the importance of looking inward and then

“In a lot of cases we’re so focused on trying to fix other countries when we need to look at ourselves first,” said Mullholland.“One of the most important things with WPS for me is to empower that next generation of female leaders. I see WPS as one of the key drivers of making sure that we fulfill the promises we’ve made to our young women and service members and that we will promote inclusion and equal opportunity within our ranks.”",

WASHINGTON ­­— As Dillon Agnew drove his car north on a sweltering summer afternoon in June 2021, he saw that the Mojave Desert stretched out seemingly in all directions.

The Soldier had just left a Denny’s in Barstow, California, and cruised past the gas stations and neon motel signs before he got on the desolate, two-lane road that leads to Fort Irwin.

His heart sank.

Agnew only saw coarse desert and small clutters of houses until he came upon a wooden banner bearing the words “Welcome, National Training Center,” with an AH-1 Cobra helicopter display perched above.

Single and in his mid-20s, Agnew enjoyed attending theater productions and night life. He didn’t see any semblance of a vibrant city near Fort Irwin.

“It’s about 31 miles and 45 minutes of nothing,” Agnew said of the drive through San Bernardino County. “So, I was a little disheartened.”

He knew that his new assignment would be more than a normal adjustment.

Located in the middle of the Mojave between the Calico Mountains, the California installation sits two hours from Los Angeles and 180 miles from Las Vegas. Although Agnew grew up in Southern California, he still found the dry temperatures stifling.

Isolated from civilization, Agnew found little to do in his free time at the desert installation. Soldiers assigned to Irwin often find activities limited to the post’s bowling alley, bars or making the commute to Barstow. Others simply stay in their barracks rooms and only leave to go to work or the gym.

So he buried himself in his duties as a medic; bonding with troops in training center rotations.

Weeks later, one of his supervisors asked him to become his unit’s representative for Irwin’s Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers, or BOSS program. Agnew knew little about the group other than it planned some social events for Soldiers.

Single Soldiers stationed in remote locations often struggle with feelings of isolation and depression. Sometimes it can even lead to suicidal thoughts. According to an April 2022 Government Accountability report, troops stationed in remote locations attempted to take their own lives more than other Soldiers.

The problem extends beyond the Army. According to the National Institutes of Health, remote locations have seven times the suicide rate of those living in urban areas.

“A lot of people haven’t experienced remoteness like this,” Agnew said. “You can look [around] and see the same brown mountains. And that can weigh on you.”

The Army started BOSS programs in 1989 to broadly improve the lives of Soldiers and boost unit morale through recreational activities and life skills classes. The Army believes that if it encourages Soldiers to take part in BOSS, it can retain more of its talent according to the service’s Morale, Welfare and Recreation website.

The events vary from kayaking, camping and museum visits to volunteer efforts and attending professional sports games. Each of the 67 worldwide BOSS programs hosts indoor and outdoor activities, many unique to the installation and the region. For instance, the program at Fort Wainwright, Alaska offers classes on preparing vehicles for winter while the Fort Irwin program takes Soldiers on hiking trips in California’s national parks.

BOSS also offers Soldiers the opportunity to voice quality of life concerns through their chain of command. The program supports the notion that a happy Soldier equals a more combat-ready Soldier. In the last fiscal year, more than 242,000 Soldiers participated in about 2,000 events. Camp Humphreys, South Korea has the largest participation with more than 119,000 troops actively taking part in team and morale building activities.

However, Agnew, who previously served as Fort Irwin’s BOSS president, said maintaining and building Soldier morale at remote locations like Fort Irwin can be a delicate challenge.

Something as simple as the Wi-Fi service suffering an outage can be devastating to single Soldiers.

The Army News Service spoke to Soldiers at two remote locations, Fort Irwin and Fort Wainwright, Alaska to learn how BOSS programs tackle recruitment challenges and how they give Soldiers an escape from everyday duty. And they tell how sometimes, the programs save lives.

“I think [BOSS] is really essential to how a young Soldier forms their opinion, not only about the Army, but themselves,” said 1st Sgt. Brian Samaniego a BOSS program member. “It helps not only their unit’s cohesion and morale, but you get that person out of the barracks.”

Braving Alaska’s endless winter

Thousands of miles north at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, Spc. Adrian Gonzales, recalled one December evening when he nearly ended his life.

The long winter nights ate away at him in the first few months that he arrived at the far northern installation, nestled in the Alaskan interior, 190 miles from the Arctic Circle.

Soldiers must prepare for Alaska’s harsh cold and ready themselves for possible frigid weather injuries, including frostbite and hypothermia.

As a gate guard at the installation, he got swept into spiraling depression. During most winters at Fort Wainwright, the sun only rises for short periods, leaving the region in darkness for up to 16 hours.

After work, he retreated to his barracks room, rarely stepping outside.

Then in December 2022, in the basement of a friend’s house, he held a weapon in his hand and contemplated suicide.

Gonzales had grown up in an Army family; his father had served for nearly three decades and he had grown accustomed to separation from loved ones. But even he found the isolation of Fort Wainwright daunting.

“I was breaking down,” Gonzales said. “I couldn’t take it anymore.”

Fortunately for Gonzales, he called a supervisor who calmed him down. The Soldier soon encouraged Gonzales to join Wainwright’s BOSS program. Gonzales, who arrived at the post in 2022, went on his first volunteer project: collecting trash along the Chena River. He also joined the Soldiers Against Drunk Driving program, run by BOSS members.

The program offers rides to Soldiers who have consumed alcohol in the Fairbanks area. From October 2022 through July 2023, Fort Wainwright’s SADD gave more than 1,000 Soldiers rides.

Gonzales found that the volunteer work gave him a purpose and feelings of accomplishment that he lacked when he confined himself to his dorm room.

“To say [BOSS] was eye-opening would be an understatement,” Gonzales said. He became one of many Soldiers across the Army who claimed the program saved them from suicide.

Suicides spiked at the Alaska installation from 2014 to 2021 with 17 Soldiers taking their lives. BOSS members keep a vigilant watch to help prevent suicide.

The Department of the Army’s BOSS representative Staff Sgt. Cody Mackall said that the program saved his life twice — once following a failed relationship in 2016. A phone call from a fellow BOSS member asking him to volunteer for a charity event prevented him from committing suicide.

Sgt. Matthew Ruiz, who grew up in a conservative Latino household in Arizona, said he had a jarring transition to living in Alaska and the Army. When he first woke up in a plane, the midnight sun in Fairbanks perplexed him.

“I had no idea what was going on,” he said. “It was … mesmerizing.”

Ruiz, a BOSS member assigned to an infantry unit, said the eight months of winter and two months of longer nights can lead to Soldiers isolating themselves. During the onset of the COVID pandemic, many Soldiers retreated to their barracks rooms. At the time, the BOSS program struggled to schedule weekend activities due to the closure of many businesses in the Fairbanks area.

“The things that get into Soldiers’ minds is usually the relationships or the alcohol,” Ruiz said. “[In] this program we try to make Soldiers’ lives better. And we always have something to do.”

Each month Fort Wainwright BOSS Soldiers ask peers to leave their barracks rooms and enjoy the immense Alaskan wilderness. The Wainwright BOSS program has taken troops to Grapefruit Rocks, a hiking area 50 miles north of Fairbanks. Solders have taken ATV rides, fished and went ice climbing.

“[BOSS] allows them to open doors and realize, “oh, I like to ice climb,” said Ruiz.

Although Ruiz said that BOSS participation has risen, recruiting new members remains challenging. The program currently has 180 Soldiers in the program at an installation that serves more than 6,000 active-duty members.

In an environment as isolated as the Alaskan interior, Fort Wainwright boss members understand the importance of keeping Soldiers active.

Sgt. Naomi Herbert, a six-year Army veteran who emigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria, said members try not to pressure Soldiers to participate, instead they encourage troops to visit to the local gym or bowling alley.

On Fridays and Saturdays, they encourage Soldiers not to wear uniforms and to address each other by their first names instead of rank.

“We’re trying to be an agent for change against depression,” said Herbert. “It is really hard to be here without families.”

Soldiers at Fort Irwin faced similar struggles.

Michigan native finds niche at Fort Irwin

Cpl. Kelly Kribs lived near the water most of her life and spent summers swimming and fishing. Kribs grew up in the riverfront town of Bay City, Michigan, south of Lake Huron.

Life circumstances thrust her toward military service, after working three jobs just to make ends meet.

After travelling to Fort Irwin for her first assignment in November 2019, she heard rumblings from fellow Soldiers about the California installation — none of them good. But several Soldiers from her Advanced Individual Training joined her on the assignment.

Kribs, who had never visited California, initially found the heat and dry air unbearable. Like many Soldiers at Fort Irwin, she limited her activities to staying in her barracks room. Then, other Soldiers told her about the BOSS program as means to get away from her duties as a visual information specialist.

She joined BOSS in mid-2021, and eventually becoming its president, determined to breathe life into a dormant program.

She understood the feelings of isolation new Soldiers experience at Fort Irwin having lived through it herself. Joining BOSS changed her.

“I was that Soldier who was just sitting in the barracks, drinking, playing video games, counting the bricks on the wall, you know what I mean?” she said. “But having that outlet and that opportunity to just … explore is a big deal.”

Kribs petitioned leadership of each resident unit to fund trips outside of the base. She talked about the importance of finding recreational trips for single Soldiers who often found themselves confined to their dorm rooms or frequenting the bars on post. She used the program’s Discord server to invite as many interested Soldiers as he could.

And Kribs began planning for more trips to the surrounding areas in Southern California.

“I'm a very social person,” Kribs said. “Having someone who's outgoing and willing to go talk to people and go brief every single week and walk up to random Soldiers at the bar on post and be like, ‘Hey, are you single? You should check out the BOSS program.”

In only eight months, Kribs, along with Agnew, grew the program from about 100 Soldiers to nearly 900 at an installation of about 4,800 active-duty members.

Originally Kribs said, the BOSS meetings consisted of talks on improving facilities such as upgrading furniture in the barracks or workout programs at the fitness center. Kribs said she would like Soldiers to experience a semblance of life outside of the installation where Soldiers can be themselves and form connections with their peers.

Soldier bonding

Irwin’s BOSS members have toured Universal Studios, attended a San Diego Padres baseball game and in June visited Catalina Island off the Los Angeles coast. Soldiers have even went skiing on Big Bear Mountain, a resort that has a top elevation of 8,805 feet and 748 acres for skiers.

Although Fort Irwin lies hours from the major cities, BOSS made trips to Southern California’s attractions more accessible.

“One of the selling points here is … you can go skiing in the morning and watch the sunset on the beach at night with a quick hour and a half drive. Right?” Samaniego said. “And I think making that available to them … and then letting them go on these trips and opportunities really opened up the BOSS program in a positive manner for everyone.”

Private 1st Class Nat Manansala, a 19-year-old Soldier with less than a year in the Army, said that joining the BOSS program provided a welcome introduction into the military. Originally shy and reserved, Agnew said he saw Manansala gradually build confidence and become more social with each bus trip.

Manansala said he didn’t have the best introduction to his first duty station and had to find his own way onto post without a sponsor.

“[BOSS] gave me a different perspective of what Fort Irwin could [be],” said Manansala, who manages the program’s social media accounts.

Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers began in 1989 as a program to address recreational needs of Soldiers. Today BOSS programs raise Soldier morale through activities both outdoors and in urban environments. Sometimes activities can help Soldiers combat depression and feelings of isolation. BOSS members can also take life and pro skills classes. (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

The program also provides “Boss Buses” where they will take Soldiers to the surrounding towns of Victorville and Barstow to go to the mall, movie theater or restaurants.

Dillon and Kribs spent many months working after hours to plan a regular slate of trips within the allowed 250-mile radius from Fort Irwin. Although they have the support of commanders and senior NCOs, they often must contend with scheduling conflicts with squad leaders, Agnew said.

The core of the program lies in the friendships built. BOSS members said that the trips and volunteer activities let Soldiers from different careers and walks of life learn about one another.

“I have a passion for helping people and helping these brand new Soldiers,” said Dillon who has been a BOSS unit representative, vice president and now president of Fort Irwin’s program. “And [when] I see them on every single trip, I know we’re helping people, giving them a break.”

Private 1st Class Albert Gray, a 19-year-old Soldier from Anderson County, Indiana, initially struggled with the harsh desert climate when he arrived at Fort Irwin in March 2023.

He found himself out of breath during training runs.

The death of his father Jerry, a retired Marine, encouraged Gray to enlist in the Army.

Gray, a combat engineer, joined the program first by volunteering for events such stacking tires for a paintball park. Gray said that he had not been around many people. Attending a BOSS trip to the Santa Monica pier and Long Beach helped him overcome his shyness. Gray became friends with a Soldier serving as a cavalry scout.

“I’ve never been around that many people,” said Gray, who described himself as an introvert growing up. “[BOSS] kind of opened me up as far as my social interaction.”

“It helped with my confidence,” he added.

Agnew said that Gray told a story becoming more and more common among BOSS members. And that’s when, Agnew said, he knows the program has done its job.

“If you come here not knowing anybody and you’re not very social, it’s hard to make friends,” he said. “I think we give people an avenue to make friends.”

BOSS programs give Soldiers the opportunity get away from the stresses of military life, by venturing into the surrounding communities and for a few hours, dissuade feelings of depression and isolation.

Dolsan, Somalia - U.S. military members from Kismayo, Somalia partnered with the Kenya Defence Forces and Somali National Army Danab Forces to bring medical supplies and treatment to a local village as part of a Medical Civic Action Program clinic, July 1, 2023, in Dolsan Village, Somalia.

The 91st Civil Affairs Battalion, Special Operations-Airborne, coordinated with the Mobile Surgical Response Team to provide medical care to the villagers as the KDF screened patients and distributed prescriptions for those who were ill. Members of the Somali National Army Danab Forces and Somali National Army provided security while the KDF and 91st Civil Affairs Battalion assisted patients.

“With the partner forces, we were able to administer medical supplies to the local population,” said U.S. Army Capt. Ben Coad, 91st Civil Affairs Battalion Civil Military Support Element-Somalia Team Lead. “It’s a great opportunity for the Kenya Defence Forces and the SNA Danab to work together and to bolster those partnerships.”

Operated by host nation partner forces in coordination with U.S. joint services, MEDCAPs serve as temporary field clinics to provide limited medical treatment to the local population. U.S. forces regularly engage in MEDCAPs to work alongside African partners and provide medical care to remote communities, bolstering trust and security within the region.

“We have come to promote the safety of the local populace,” said Maj. D. K. Mosbey, KDF commanding officer. “It’s about the promotion of security, justice and local authority to the federal government of Somalia, to include Jubaland. Today we met with the chief of this area and had an opportunity for a positive engagement.”

Over 250 men, women and children sought medical aid at the MEDCAP for conditions ranging from Dengue fever to urinary tract infections. Patients that required specialized treatment were referred to the medical facility on Kismayo where more advanced treatment options were available from the KDF.

“It goes a long way towards building confidence,” said Capt. B. C. Omondi, KDF physician. “It has been a pleasure working with the locals, as well as working with our partner forces (Somali National Army, Danab, U.S. forces).”",

WASHINGTON — To keep pace with a changing battlefield, Army leaders said the service must continually adapt while maintaining a robust exercise schedule and adjusting to a challenging recruiting landscape.

In addition, the Army’s new Chief of Staff, Gen. Randy A. George said the service must continually change the force, through strengthening deterrence capabilities and bolstering interoperability with other services and multinational partners.

“We’re trying to look at [warfighting] as continuous transformation,” George said during a Center for Strategic and International Studies land power discussion Sept. 19. “What we want to do is tie all the pieces together and make sure we’re doing this in a continuous fashion.”

The Army engaged in two of the largest multi-national exercises, Super Garuda Shield in September and Australia’s Talisman Sabre in July and August. Super Garuda Shield, which concluded Sept. 13 in Indonesia, fielded participation from 14 nations including first-time participants Australia, Singapore and Japan. The event included a combined arms, live-fire and amphibious and airborne exercises.

In August more than 3,000 Soldiers completed Pershing Strike 23, a mass mobilization exercise at Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois; Fort Riley, Kansas; Camp Atterbury-Muscatatuck, Indiana; Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort McCoy, Wisconsin and other locations.

Earlier this year, the Army announced the branch’s joint, multi-domain series of experiments, Project Convergence, will no longer be an annual event. Instead, the service will adopt a more steady set of exercises throughout the year in support of the experiments. The service expanded the complexity and scope of its exercise during both Project Convergence 22 and Talisman Sabre 23, which included 12 partner nations with exercises across five states and territories.

Talisman Sabre featured a joint, mass exercise where U.S. forces and allies protected an island chain from a hostile force. In PC 22, the Army used autonomous vehicles to simulate longer distances that U.S. forces could see in future wars.

For the first time, Project Convergence included participation from the United Kingdom, Australia and the U.S. Space Force in 2022. The Army will resume its fourth iteration of Project Convergence 4 in spring 2024.

“What we found is generating that complexity and learning all the lessons from the previous years, Project Convergence really needed to take more than 12 months,” Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth said Tuesday. “So, we are not doing this now on strictly an annual cycle. And that allows us to both learn fully from last year's experience and really build the set of experimentation cases for the next year so that we get the most out of it.”

George added that the Army could explore more cost-effective options including using 3D printing drones and loitering munitions.

The ongoing Ukraine conflict has led to a greater focus on contested logistics, Wormuth said. In April, Army Futures Command announced the establishment of a Contested Logistics Cross-Functional team, which will reduce the service’s logistics footprint, use autonomous technology to extend operational reach and movement, and leverage data analytics to invest in predictive logistics capabilities.

To meet the requirements of supporting operations in the Pacific and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Army must continue to bolster recruiting, Wormuth said. In June, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks assigned the Army as the lead service for the defense of the U.S. territory of Guam.

“The Army, in terms of [operations] tempo, is about a busy now as we were during two decades of the global war on terrorism,” Wormuth said. “That’s surprising but when you think of everything we’re doing in Europe … with all that we’re doing in the Indo Pacific. We’re very, very busy.”

While the branch will likely fall short of its recruiting goals in 2023, the service has seen an uptick in the “pace” of new enlistment contracts over the last two months Wormuth said. Wormuth said that she would like the Army to be able to recruit about 60,000 new Soldiers annually to attend basic training.

“You could not fight a major war in Europe or in Asia very effectively with an Army that's smaller than 450,000,” Wormuth said. “That’s why it’s really an existential issue for us to resolve our recruiting challenges.”

George added that the service must holistically transform the way it trains and educates the Army’s people.

“People are decisive element of this and I think we’ve seen that in Ukraine with the will and the skill down at the very tactical level,” George said.

The CDE was held in Vicenza and brought together military medical professionals, planners and experts from SETAF-AF, U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Medical Command and others, alongside medical providers from Burundi, Chad, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The primary objective of the event was to work collectively to refine the fiscal year 2024 MEDREX execution strategy and discuss the framework for fiscal years 2025 to 2027.

MEDREX is a program designed and overseen by the SETAF-AF that allows medical personnel from the U.S. military and partner nation militaries to exchange medical procedures and strengthen treatment capabilities.

U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, SETAF-AF commanding general, welcomed participants and emphasized the importance of such collaborative events.

""The MEDREX program is a vitally important component of our global health engagement strategy,” Wasmund said. “The work you are doing here reflects your commitment to build strong partnerships and enhance medical capabilities that benefit the force and people in your communities.""

One of the highlights of the CDE occurred when participants from the various nations discussed the positive impacts and exchange of medical practices during FY23’s MEDREX events.

Discussions touched on addressing challenges within each country’s healthcare systems, lessons learned during the MEDREX prevously held in their country and strategies for future global health engagement. This knowledge-sharing served to create a cohesive approach to the planning and tailoring of the FY24 MEDREX plan.

“Medicine is universal, so regardless of where you come from or what language you speak medicine unites us all,” said Commander Doctor James Aggrey-Orleans, Ghana Armed Forces. Aggrey-Orleans is the MEDREX program director for Ghana and is in his fifth year serving in this capacity.

“The MEDREX program is important to Ghana because it allows our medical staff to work with our partners from the U.S. where we share and learn from each other,” he added.

During the CDE, African partners divided into small groups with their U.S. state partners and engaged in tabletop discussions to refine plans for next year’s MEDREX season. The State Partnership Program is a U.S. Department of Defense joint security cooperation program which began in 1993. Administered by the National Guard Bureau, the program links a state’s National Guard with the armed forces of a partner country in order to build long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships. Through SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-society relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic and social spheres.

The SETAF-AF CDE collaboration resulted in seven MEDREX events scheduled to execute in FY24 in Angola, Burundi, Chad, Ghana, Senegal, Rwanda and South Africa. The event concluded with a closing ceremony and served as a testament to the growing cooperation between participants in addressing healthcare challenges on the African continent.

(Photo Credit: Photo illustration) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — The Army Maternity Uniform Pilot Program, also known as “Rent the Camo,” provides eligible female Soldiers stationed in the continental Unites States with free maternity uniforms.

The pilot program is available to officers and enlisted service members in all three components of the Army.

“This program is going to help give [Soldiers] the one-stop shop they need,” said Maj. Irma Richards, Army Logistics, troop support. “By streamlining the process to where they only have one person to deal with, which is the MUPP representative, that eliminates the back and forth a female Soldier has going to several locations to obtain her uniforms.”

In June 2020, Congress passed the “Rent the Camo: Access to Maternity Wear Act,” which directed each military service to establish a pilot program for issuing and recovering maternity uniforms to pregnant service members.

The Army started their program in October 2022 with two active-duty installations and the Maryland Army National Guard before expanding to all installations in the continental U.S. in May. Pilot participation is not available overseas at this time.

The initiative is volunteer based. Once a member reports a pregnancy to their unit, the command may offer the opportunity to use the program. Then the Soldier works with her installation representative for direct online ordering.

The Army also incorporated new developmental items into the pilot; the Army physical fitness uniform – maternity, the tan maternity T-shirt, and the nursing T-shirt. These items are only available in limited quantities.

Each member receives five maternity T-shirts and three sets of the operational camouflage pattern maternity uniform. Pilot uniforms are delivered directly to the service member and will be kept during the duration of the pregnancy. The uniforms will be retained by the service member for up to 15 months from the time they are received.

The program saves Soldiers hundreds of dollars on uniforms.

Each installation representative receives feedback from the volunteers and passes that to program leadership. So far, 204 participants have volunteered.

The initial response from Soldiers has been extremely positive, Richards said.

The pilot will run until fiscal year 2025 or when the service reaches 1,200 participants in the program.

At the end of the pilot, the information gathered from volunteers will be used to create courses of action and recommendations for Army senior leaders to determine the best way forward.

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — Capt. Elizabeth Dupont, U.S. Army South G3/5 planning officer, has battled her whole life for what she wanted: her athleticism, her education and her military service. But all the challenges she faced to forge her life couldn’t compare to the trauma of losing her only child.

Despite all of the adversity she encountered, Dupont credits her family, upbringing and Hispanic culture for her ability to continue moving forward in life and persevere through it all.

A farmer's daughter

“I was born in San Juan, Texas which is near the border,” said Dupont. “My mom had me with a midwife and then crossed to Reynosa, Mexico, and that's where I was raised.”

Her mother, who had U.S. residency, crossed the border to give birth to Dupont and give her U.S. citizenship, which was a privilege her older siblings didn’t have.

The daughter of a family of farmers, Dupont is the fifth of seven siblings. She described her upbringing as humble with her mom cooking whatever vegetables they grew in their fields, and they wouldn’t often have meat.

Capt. Elizabeth Dupont, U.S. Army South G3/5 plans officer, stands in a field of vegetables on her family farm in Reynosa, Mexico, January 1, 2019. Dupont grew up in Reynosa, Mexico where her family would grow various vegetables. “I would go to school from 8 a.m. until noon, and after school and all day on the weekends I would go to work with my dad,” Dupont said. “Different vegetables, different seasons, selling the produce, we would work all year round.” (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

“So, you get what you get,” she said as a matter of fact. “My siblings and I shared beds and there was no air conditioning in our house, but we didn’t know any different.”

From a young age, Dupont said her father instilled an unwavering work ethic in her and raised her to have values that she would later come to find mirrored the Army Values.

She helped her father work the land, becoming disciplined as well as physically and mentally tough.

“I would go to school from 8 a.m. until noon, and after school and all day on the weekends I would go to work with my dad,” she said proudly. “Different vegetables, different seasons, selling the produce, we would work all year round.”

She looked at manual labor as a competition with her siblings, vying to be the best worker among them.

“Out of all of my sisters, my dad would wake me up because I wouldn’t complain,” Dupont bragged. “I mean my sisters would work, but they would get tired. I just wanted to beat them and show that I was able to do better than them in the field.”

That sparring spirit transferred over into athletics, where even after a long day of school and work, Dupont said she would find a way to play sports with her friends.

She said they play any sport they had the resources for, playing baseball or simply racing each other on foot. Of all the sports they played, she loved soccer the most.

“We would come home from work around 7 p.m., and right after that I would play soccer with my friends,” she said. “I was the one that had the ball, so they would always come look for me to play.”

Dupont said she would do everything possible to play sports or compete, like wear shorts under her school uniform just in case her friends wanted to play soccer, or even run track in her bare feet.

“My friends found out I was good at track, but most of the time I only had my uniform and girly shoes,” Dupont claimed. “So, I would just remove my shoes and run barefoot. Obviously, I was the only one who ran barefoot, but I was competing and winning!”

Moving to the U.S.

As Dupont grew older, three of her older sisters decided to move to the U.S. to attend school and work. At 14 years-old, Dupont had an opportunity to follow in their footsteps and moved to Edinburg, Texas.

“I arrived in December, in the middle of the school year, so they dropped me back one year, and then they dropped me another year because I was still learning English,” she admitted. “So, I started in eighth grade.”

Despite the two-year scholastic setback, Dupont said she took everything in stride and kept rolling along.

She became a freshman in high school and luckily had her sister, who was a senior, to help her navigate attending school in another country.

Dupont said, along with her sister's guidance, her involvement in high school sports was a huge help for her adapting to life in Texas.

“Sports got me through the challenge of adapting to American culture, because I was able to connect with other students through my athleticism,” said Dupont.

First-generation university graduate and ROTC

After overcoming the language barrier and culture difference of moving to the U.S., she decided she wanted to pursue a college education.

She saw an opportunity to pursue her passion of coaching with a degree in kinesiology and pay for her education through the U.S. Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

“I saw being an officer as simulating coaching but in a different spectrum,” explained Dupont. “I didn’t want to be a normal Soldier, but rather coach the Soldiers.”

She noted that she experienced barriers due to her race, ethnicity and accent, with other cadets criticizing her pronunciation and doubting her abilities, but when it came to the physical and mental aspect of training in the ROTC program, she said she was second to none.

Dupont admitted that her humble upbringing came as an advantage especially during the field training exercises.

“I talked to most of the other cadets and most of them said they had an easy life, but I didn’t and I’m proud of that,” remembered Dupont. “We got MREs and everyone was like, ‘what is this?’ But I just took what I could get, and when we didn’t have air conditioning, I didn’t make it a big deal’”

Dupont graduated at the top of her ROTC class and became the first in her immediate family to receive a college degree with both an associate and bachelor’s degree in kinesiology and was commissioned in August of 2018 as a second lieutenant.

She went on to attend the ordnance Basic Officer Leader Course at Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia and was stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas for her first assignment as platoon leader of the fuel and water platoon with 501st Brigade Support Battalion, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division.

Unimaginable loss

Dupont met her husband, Capt. Keith Dupont II, in October of 2018. They eventually wed and decided to start a family.

In May of 2021 their son, Keith Dupont III, was born with a strong personality from the start, said Dupont, and she felt the purest love she had ever known.

“He was truly a baby that could light up any room with his smile and laughter,” Dupont said. “He was attentive and had a curious mind, but sleeping was not his priority for fear of missing out.”

But one night when he was about three months old, her son suddenly stopped breathing.

“He started having breath holding spells, and his whole body would just turn blue or purple,” said Dupont with tears in her eyes. “I knew CPR and stuff so the first time it happened I started doing it, and he just gasped for air and came back.”

Dupont and her husband brought their son to several specialists to understand and treat the symptoms as the spells worsened in severity and became more frequent.

“I started to know when he was going to have the episodes, because as soon as he would start to get bothered he would have one,” recalled Dupont. “I would already be standing by the oxygen mask.”

She said that after months searching for answers, doctors diagnosed their son with Gaucher disease.

According to the National Library of Medicine, Gaucher disease is an inherited genetic disease that affects various organ systems and tissues, including the central nervous system. There are three types which vary in the age of onset and which bodily systems they affect.

There is no cure for any of the three types, but there are treatment options for types one and three. The Dupont's son had type two, which has no treatment.

Over the course of 17 months Dupont said their son’s heart stopped 12 times, and each time they were able to bring him back with CPR.

But in January of 2023, their son passed away at 20 months old.

“When he passed we were in acceptance,” she said solemnly. “We were hurting, but we knew it was best for him to not suffer anymore.”

Coping and the future

Through all of the trauma and caring for her son, Dupont was able to complete the Captain’s Career Course and promote to the rank of captain.

She still remembers the pain of losing Keith III but is finding ways to cope like talking and spending time with her husband and seeing a behavioral health provider.

“It's quite a sensitive topic still since it just recently happened, but my husband and I pull through every day,” Dupont expressed with hope. “We kind of find that little peaceful moment with a workout or going out to see a movie.”

On top of finding peace, Dupont said that putting life into perspective is important to pushing through trauma like she has experienced.

“All of this has made me stronger in the sense of just looking at things more positively,” she said. “I'm just taking it day by day, because no matter what life throws at you, you just have to adapt, continue training and just continue going.”",

NAIROBI, Kenya – Representatives from U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) and several partners nations met with exercise planners from the Kenyan Defence Forces to conduct the mid planning event for exercise Justified Accord 2024 (JA24) Sept. 11 - 15, 2023.

JA24 brings together service members from the U.S., Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Somalia, Djibouti and the U.K. Key highlights include a multinational live-fire field training exercise, counter-improvised explosive device awareness and combined company-level assault activities.

One of the driving factors for a successful exercise is trust among partner forces. The mid planning event allows multinational planners to sit down with each other and develop that necessary trust by working through all the details together.

The training portfolio has expanded significantly from a tabletop exercise with limited participants just a few years ago to over a thousand service members from approximately 20 nations converging in Kenya for JA24.

The exercise is scheduled for late February to early March, 2024.

Each iteration, planners continue to include progressive and innovative elements into the exercise scenario, reflecting the most pertinent issues impacting East Africa.

""It's exciting that this year's exercise will include a course discussing partner nation gender focal points through the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) initiative,"" said U.S. Army Maj. Teisha Barnes, a civil military operations officer with SETAF-AF. ""In meeting with my KDF counterpart, Kenya has a significant interest in promoting the role of women in military service.""

Along with the WPS exchange, an AU staff officer course, a command post exercise and defensive cyber course will heavily engage participants in crisis response operations. The classroom-based portion takes place simultaneously with maneuver elements out in the field.

A key objective during JA24 for the KDF is to enhance their ability to conduct training in an austere environment, while integrating their joint and interagency forces. To that end, this year's exercise will be hosted at a new Kenyan venue designed at doing just that.

Working together with the Kenya U.S. Liaison Office (KUSLO), KDF planners recommended the brand new, U.S.-built Counter Insurgency, Terrorism and Stability Operations Center (CITSO) as the primary location for field training exercises at JA24.

""CITSO allows the KDF and partner forces to meet several training objectives, realizing the potential for this new institution to support peacekeeping operations in the region,"" said U.S. Air Force Maj. Scott Gregory, U.S. Embassy Nairobi KUSLO officer. ""The location is remote and has enough training area to support simultaneous maneuvers from multiple units.""

JA24 will also feature a multinational air advisory exchange where partner nations will share best practices related to crisis response. The goal is to build, sustain and expand relationships and the capabilities of partner nation air forces.

Together with U.S. Navy-led activities in Mombasa, this year’s Justified Accord has expanded into a joint multinational, combined event. The exercise is poised to increase joint readiness in preparation for an actual disaster or crisis response.

Selebi-Phikwe, Botswana — In a demonstration of international cooperation, the U.S. Army’s 2nd Security Force Assistance Brigade and the Botswana Defense Forces joined forces for rigorous training at the Mantswe a Ditschwene range here, Sep. 18, 2023. Amidst this austere environment, SFAB advisors and BDF soldiers worked to improve their proficiency at small-unit tactics.

The 2nd SFAB served as advisors for the BDF as they took part in a five-week Urban Combat Leadership Course (UCLC). This course consists of mainly small unit tactics training, with a focus on leadership development, casualty care, marksmanship, and close quarters combat training. The course culminated in the rugged terrain of Mantswe a Ditschwene range, with the BDF participants taking part in squad and platoon missions to include platoon raids and room clearing operations.

The collaboration marks yet another milestone of continued partnership for the 2nd SFAB, U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) and the BDF, a partnership founded on shared security interests and the pursuit of regional stability.

“Advising our partners at the tactical level on tasks such as room clearing, platoon raids and operations orders establishes foundational proficiencies that enable a more capable and professional force,” explained Sgt. 1st Class Stephen Patterson, 2nd SFAB maneuver advisor team sergeant.

The 2nd SFAB, charged with advising and training allies and partner forces in Africa, brought its many collective years of experience to the table. In adherence to Army tradition and doctrine, American instructors and their Botswana counterparts meticulously drilled soldiers in small-unit infantry tactics.

“We recognize the pivotal role that African nations play in promoting stability and security on the continent. Our partnership with African military forces is a testament to our shared commitment to peace and prosperity,” added Capt. Phil Cavanagh, 2nd SFAB maneuver advisor team leader.

The vast, unforgiving landscape of the Mantswe a Ditschwene Range posed unique challenges for the training unit. Soldiers had to adapt swiftly to the challenging terrain, where unpredictable weather and limited resources mirrored the conditions they might encounter in real-world missions.

""This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to strengthening alliances with our partners in Botswana. By honing their skills, we are not only preparing the BDF for any challenges they may face but also solidifying the bonds of friendship and trust between our two nations,” said Cavanagh.

""We value the enduring relationship between our countries,” said Maj. B. Selepeng, the officer-in-charge of BDF soldiers. ”This training will undoubtedly enhance the capabilities of our soldiers, allowing us to better serve our nation and contribute to regional security.""

Botswana's position in Southern Africa places it at the crossroads of various regional dynamics. It shares borders with South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, making it a critical point of contact with neighboring nations. This geographic centrality enables Botswana to monitor and respond effectively to regional security threats, including violent extremist organizations.

The 2nd SFAB is regionally aligned with U.S. Africa Command and is under the operational control of SETAF-AF. This mission in Botswana is one of many which 2nd SFAB executes on the African continent, maintaining periodic presence in up to 15 African countries. Engagements such as this underscore the importance of partnerships where global challenges require collective responses.",

Daniel Mitchell, US Army Garrison Rock Island Arsenal commander and Command Sgt. Maj. James Brown, exercise with children at the Rock Island Arsenal Child Development Center in Rock Island, Illinois on April 4, 2023.

WASHINGTON — The Army has now staffed more than 70% of its total child development center work force, bringing the service closer to fulfilling its quality-of-life pledge to provide better care for military families, an Army leader said Tuesday.

More incentives for CDC workers led to the spike in the hiring of more Army childcare workers, after sitting at about 63% earlier this year, said Lt. Gen. Kevin Vereen, Army deputy chief of staff for installations.

In October 2022, Army leaders promised to bolster staffing at CDCs to improve the quality of service and to raise enrollment. Vereen said adequate childcare ranks as one of the top concerns of Soldiers and spouses.

“[CDCs] are important because we know families want to have safe, secure childcare facilities for their young ones so they don’t have to worry about what’s happening to them while they’re at work,” said Vereen, speaking during an online broadcast Tuesday.

As part of a 2022 Department of Defense mandate, the Army offered CDC employee applicants 50% off childcare fees at CDCs for their first enrolled child. Former Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston said last year that 100% of CDCs had previously operated understaffed, prompting the service to set a goal of fully staffing 90% of childcare centers.

“We are coming off a pandemic. We have a lack of workers not only across the childcare enterprise, but across almost every enterprise in the U.S.,” Vereen said. “We are in this mad push for talent. We are in the same pool of pulling for young, qualified people who want to serve long term not only in the Army, but in childcare.”

Army leaders said last year that adequate child care also plays a critical role in recruitment and retention. Additionally the service has funded 15 new CDCs over the past four years, Vereen said. Many CDCs across the Army extended their business hours in 2022.

In addition to childcare centers, the Army addressed housing concerns both for residents in the barracks and Army housing. Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth pledged to invest $1.5 billion in Army-owned housing and another $3.1 billion in privatized housing.

To gain a better understanding of housing concerns, Vereen has toured installations across the Army, most recently at posts in Alaska and at Fort Carson, Colorado, in August. There, Vereen met with junior Soldiers and commanders to gather feedback, with most of the conversations centering on housing and barracks conditions.

“Soldiers won’t complain,” Vereen said. “They’re folks on a mission. But we also know as leaders, we want to do everything we can to take care them.”

Barracks at Fort Carson will be renovated for the first time since 2000, with upgrades that include more living space for junior Soldiers and adding kitchenettes for enlisted troops.

Vereen inspected recently renovated Army housing, as well as units that still require more upgrades.

“We’ve been able to invest quite substantially in barracks,” Vereen said. “We’re not done yet. We have a strategy and this is [Wormuth’s] strategy to invest over $1.5 billion over the next 10 years in barracks.”

“I think we’re seeing the [results] and we’re excited where we’re going. We’re in the long game when it comes to infrastructure requirements.”

Finally Vereen praised the efforts of military spouses for not only supporting their military member but advancing their careers. Vereen said many spouses have taken advantage of internships and fellowships, including the 12-week paid DOD College Acquisition Internship Program.

Vereen said adding professional development to spouses’ resumes helps potential employers know that military spouses have extensive training and skills.

“It’s showcasing the talents of our spouses,” Vereen said. “They’re not a hiring risk because they’ve had multiple jobs over a small period of time and in some cases, they couldn’t control it; the Army caused a family to move.”

The Army and DOD has taken measures to help relieve spouses of hefty relicensure fees as spouses can now collect up to $1,000 in reimbursements for license and certification costs during a permanent-change-of-station move. The Army recently changed the application procedure so that spouses can more easily apply for seven different professional license and certification exam registration fees.

The service expanded its noncompetitive hiring authority for spouses with the DOD Military Spouse Employment Partnership, to connect spouses to 610 employers. More than 258,000 spouses have been hired.",

WASHINGTON — On a summer morning in 2022, Kaileen Santos met with her supervisors in a Pentagon office. The staff sergeant considered leaving the Army to pursue a career in law enforcement or work for the government.

Maj. Josefina Martinez and Lt. Col. Izabella Lundy saw her as a Soldier who could innovate and thrive in challenging environments, and they didn’t want to let her go, so they encouraged her to apply for the Army’s Green to Gold Program, an initiative that provides enlisted Soldiers a means to earn a college degree and an officer’s commission while remaining in the Army.

“I [saw] the strength and motivation to do more for herself and her daughter,” Martinez said.

Santos applied for the scholarship with Martinez and Lundy’s encouragement and was accepted into the Green to Gold Program in December 2022.

Santos, the first member of her family to join the armed forces, will study health systems management at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte this fall. She will continue to receive her current pay, a stipend, basic allowance for housing and basic allowance for subsistence, which will help pay for tuition, textbooks and rent. Her Post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefits she is saving for her daughter’s education.

Santos will attend ROTC during the school year and a cadet summer camp between her junior and senior year.

“I never thought I'd get this chance or opportunity,” she said. “The changes that it’s going to make in my life — in my daughter’s life — it’s such a great feeling.”

Hometown hard knocks

Santos’ soft-spoken demeanor masks a tough interior from growing up in a rough neighborhood in southern Massachusetts.

New Bedford, a small coastal city settled on the Acushnet River along Massachusetts’ south coast, attracts tourists for its architecture and colonial history. But its gothic and federal-style buildings and the charming ambiance of its downtown hide a dark turmoil in its lower-income neighborhoods.

The town grew into a hotbed for gang activity, with 11 known street gangs, including the Latin Kings. In 2021 the city reported that 20% of its residents lived below the poverty line, with more than 80% classified as economically disadvantaged.

Youth in New Bedford often become addicted to narcotics, and some turn to prostitution.

“You walk down the street, and you see girls getting sold,” she said.

Santos’ mother Maria, a Honduran immigrant from San Pedro Sula, settled in New Bedford in the early 2000s. Santos lived with six siblings in the family’s modest house on the city’s west side. Her mother ran a Spanish grocery store which she has owned for 20 years.

Some of her classmates fell into a life of crime or joined a gang. One of her peers became pregnant at 12 years old. Santos saw several of her friends fall into the web of substance abuse, and many were absent from school. A male friend who fell into depression later committed suicide.

Santos admitted she didn’t focus on academics as a teen.

“I didn't really see a purpose in school when I was 18,” she said. “I was … naive and immature.”

Fortunately, Santos met retired Lt. Col. Kevin McGovern, an advisor at her school’s JROTC program. McGovern acted as a mentor not only to Santos but to her siblings. He saw potential in Santos and encouraged her to enlist in the Army and leave New Bedford.

“He tried to keep me on the straight and narrow,” Santos said. “He always kept an eye on me [and] encouraged me to do better.”

After graduating from New Bedford High School in 2012, Santos saw the Army as a path out of her hometown.

Life change

Santos enlisted and received a job as a human resources specialist, and the Army assigned her to Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt, Germany. She found Schweinfurt to be a beautiful, vibrant city and a stark change from her life in New Bedford.

“It really opened my mind and showed me that there’s more to life out there,” she said.

An assignment at Fort Knox, Kentucky, followed her tour in Germany, where Santos met and married her daughter’s father. At Fort Knox, she weathered the most tumultuous period of her life from 2015 to 2016, when she went through a divorce and became a single mother.

Santos eventually adapted to raising her daughter alone while thriving as a Soldier. She had successful stints at Fort Meade, Maryland, as a drill instructor, and then in her current position at Army headquarters.

Santos took college courses sporadically in her first years in the Army, but at Fort Meade, 1st Sgt. James McKay encouraged her to dedicate herself fully to her studies. She later began exploring leadership opportunities, including warrant officer options and commissioning opportunities.

Becoming a mother also changed her, and she became fiercely protective of her daughter, a seven-year-old who loves swimming, karate and gymnastics. Santos even became PTA president at her daughter’s school.

She also excelled in her duties as a Soldier. At Fort Meade, her commander selected her to compete in the 53rd Signal Battalion’s Best Warrior Competition in October 2018.

For the competition Santos ran kettle bell runs, performed simulated first aid and competed against five male counterparts in wooded areas north of Baltimore.

Santos was selected by the Department of the Army for special duty as a drill sergeant at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, before her assignment at the Pentagon.

“The Army’s definitely helped me find direction in life,” Santos said. “It’s always given me a goal to work towards.”

Under her wing

In her first 11 years in the Army, Martinez made a name for herself as an energetic NCO, climbing through the enlisted ranks quickly.

Martinez and Santos’ careers converged in Washington in 2021, when Martinez was the assistant executive officer for Director of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, and Santos served as the executive assistant and human resources NCO.

Martinez saw a bit of herself in Santos during their time at the Pentagon. Like Santos, Martinez left home at 18 and eventually landed a position as a senator’s office manager on Capitol Hill. But later, Martinez divorced her husband and had to adopt to life as a single mother.

Martinez enlisted in the Army in 1995, eventually finding her niche as a career counselor. Then she reached a crossroads in her career. Martinez found she adapted well to the Army structure and lifestyle, but decided she could better serve the Army, and care for her family, as an officer. She commissioned in 2006.

Now in her 50s, Martinez took the younger Santos under her wing, teaching her the importance of working collectively in the Office of the Director of Army Staff.

Santos learned quickly. Working in the same building as the Army’s top general officers didn’t faze her, and she became a trusted assistant of Piatt. Santos never let her career aspirations interfere with her role at Army headquarters, often redoubling her efforts after taking time off.

“She just instinctively knew what she was doing,” Martinez said. “She was always polite; she was just ahead of the game.”

Santos saw how the bonds she formed with her mentors — officers and senior NCOs — influenced her career and her life. She remembered how Capt. Jason Selby, company commander, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 19th Engineer Battalion, shielded her from unnecessary hardships at Fort Knox.

And she recalled the efforts of Martinez and Lundy to encourage her to apply for the Green to Gold Program. She wants to do the same for another Soldier and hopes to one day become a company commander.

“Staff. Sgt. Santos is a dedicated Soldier who is talented and committed to service in the Army,” Piatt said. “She is example of selfless service, and it has been a pleasure having her serve on my team.”

“[Santos’] accomplishments and potential to lead our Soldiers has risen to the level that is characteristic of a commissioned officer,” said Deputy Undersecretary of the Army Mario Diaz, a former Army officer and West Point graduate. “I am confident she will continue to be successful.”

Story by: Carlos Cuebas, Fort Buchanan Public Affairs Officer

FORT BUCHANAN, PUERTO RICO- Service members, civilians, and family members conducted a road march around the perimeter road here on Sept. 9 as part of the Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, to honor the 9/11 victims by carrying non-perishable food on their rucksacks.

""This anniversary also serves as an opportunity to encourage citizens to pay tribute to the victims by participating in good deeds, contributing to food drives, helping refurbish homes in their communities, or doing something to support and honor veterans, soldiers, military families, and first responders. It is a time to remember by serving,"" said Col. Charles N. Moulton, Commander of Fort Buchanan, the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean region.

Before departing for the road march, Fort Buchanan Department of Emergency Services members conducted a bell ringing ceremony to honor the first responders and how their courage embodies the spirit and resilience of our nation.

Brig. Gen. Carlos Torres-Febus, Puerto Rico’s National Guard Land Component Commander, led the Puerto Rico National Guard formation during the road march.

""9/11 will live in our memories forever. However, some soldiers in this formation were very young that day. Others were not even born. That is why we cannot let this anniversary pass without reflecting on and teaching our children about what happened that fateful day and the freedom we still enjoy despite the terrorists' efforts,"" said Brig. Gen. Torres-Febus before the road march started.

At the end of the 4-mile road march, the service members quickly emptied their rucksacks into pre-established containers. Quickly, Maj. Joseph Okpe, and Staff Sgt. Juan Merced, from the Fort Buchanan Religious Support Office, led a convoy to deliver the recollected food to the Puerto Rico Food Bank in Carolina.

""This is a great way to honor the spirit of service of all those victims of 9/11. That is what we are doing here, remembering their sacrifice, and serving others,"" said Maj. Okpe.

According to the Puerto Rico Food Bank officials, the food collected during the road march will make a huge difference to many local families.

""You have just delivered over 2,600 pounds of food, equivalent to over 2,200 servings, that will feed over 177 families from Puerto Rico for a week. Thank you to the military personnel, civilians, and families at Fort Buchanan for this great donation,"" said Mari Jo Laborde, Executive Director of Puerto Rico Food Bank.

According to the Puerto Rico Statistics Institute, food insecurity is a social problem in Puerto Rico that prevails in many sectors of the population.

CASERMA EDERLE, VICENZA, Italy –The Vicenza Health Clinic had the honor of hosting U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Raymond Scott Dingle on Sept. 12, 2023 for this second visit to Italy since taking command of U.S. Army Medical Command in 2020. Dingle, the 45th U.S. Army Surgeon General, and commanding general, U.S. Army Medical Command, toured the clinic and recognized exception staff during his visit.

The primary focus of his visit was to underscore the importance of teamwork within the medical community, particularly in light of the ongoing transition of medical treatment facilities from MEDCOM to Defense Health Agency, and the roll out of MHS Genesis, the military’s new U.S. military’s new electronic health record system.

In an interview with Ashleigh Fields in July, Dingle said, “The greatest lesson that I learned through my military journey has been the importance of teamwork. The success of any individual, organization, or team is based upon the collective synergy of them working together or with others.”

Dingle took a personal interest in addressing the staff's concerns about the transition process. He highlighted the close partnership between the Defense Health Agency and MEDCOM. The transfer of Army hospitals to the DHA is designed to create a more integrated health care system, improve patient outcomes, and enable the readiness of the Army to support the Joint Force. Teamwork is vital to provide excellent healthcare to our servicemen and women.

Dingle also took the opportunity to recognize excellence at the VHC. He issued well-deserved coins to both Soldiers and civilians, in acknowledgment of their outstanding contributions.

Mr. Del’Antony Campbell, patient advocate at the Army Health Care Center Vicenza, was instrumental in organizing Dingle’s latest visit, having been present during the previous visit in 2021. With Dingle's upcoming retirement, Campbell was able to express his gratitude before the departure.

“We extend our heartfelt thanks to Lt. Gen. Dingle for his invaluable service and dedication to the U.S. Army medical community,” said Campbell. “As he embarks on his well-deserved retirement, we wish him the very best in all his future endeavors.”

215,215.0,215.0,ALFS 24 planning underway in Zambia,https://www.army.mil/article/270300/alfs_24_planning_underway_in_zambia,"Military planners for U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), visited several sites in Zambia Sep 18-22, 2023, for the African Land Forces Summit (ALFS) Initial Planning Event. The planning event is part of ongoing preparation for ALFS 24, scheduled for April 2024.

ALFS is a weeklong Chief of Staff of the Army event that hosts leaders from more than forty African countries for training and partnership-building with U.S. Army leaders. Last year ALFS took place in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. ALFS 24 marks the return of ALFS to southern Africa for the first time since 2019 when the event was held in Botswana.

The initial planning event sets the stage for SETAF-AF and Zambian planners to work together to build the event schedule, develop the ALFS 24 theme, and invite experts and leaders to present topics. In the months leading up to ALFS, planners will continue to meet with Zambian officials and businesses to tour potential venues, culturally significant locations, and other facilities to select locations for the training event. Planners gather information such as costs, building capacity, security, and connectivity capability.

International military engagements branch chief for SETAF-AF, Lt. Col. Robert Miller, is the lead planner for ALFS 24. Miller said that the event is the second of four planning meetings in Zambia to prepare for the summit. The first visit, the Pre-deployment Site Survey, took place in June.

""We are excited to have ALFS 24 in Zambia,” said Miller. “We were able to spend some time with our Zambian counterparts at ALFS 23 in Abidjan, and that allowed us to get to know our Zambian partners and start the planning process for ALFS 24.”

“Now that we are here on the ground in Zambia with our host partners, we are getting into the finite detailed planning for ALFS 24,” said Miller. “I know this is going to be a fantastic event.”

ALFS is hosted annually by SETAF-AF to bring together military leaders from the U.S. and Africa to discuss capabilities, build partnerships through face-to-face interaction, and discuss issues the partner forces face on the African continent.

(Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON ­­— Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo said that the Army has taken the next steps in the development of its signature modernization programs. While he didn't say whether the service could fulfill its pledge to deliver 24 of its priority systems in the hands of Soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2023, he added that the service has achieved significant momentum in reaching its goals.

“Ultimately, we’ll get to a point where we can see everything fully fielded,” said Camarillo, speaking during a conference in Arlington, Virginia on the afternoon of September 6. “We have an incredible track record of success … I really think we’re seeing a bit of a renaissance in terms of our ability to stick the landing on these programs.”

Camarillo said the service currently has entered the initial, low-rate production phase of the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle; formerly known as the Mobile Protected Fire Vehicle. The M10 Booker will help light combat forces identify enemy weapons systems from farther distances and provide greater survivability for Soldiers in combat brigades.

The Army awarded the $13 million contract for the M10 Booker to Indianapolis manufacturer Allison Transmission. The branch also announced Wednesday that it will move forward with the M1E3 Abrams Main Battle Tank modernization program which will be more agile and lethal than the previous Abrams tank model. Soldier feedback and years of testing contributed to the development of the M1E3.

In August, the Army announced that it awarded two contracts for the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle, formerly known as the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle. The agreement with Michigan-based companies American Rheinmetall Vehicles and General Dynamics Land Systems includes the design and prototype phases of the five-phase program. The XM30, which will eventually replace the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, provides greater maneuverability and survivability than the Bradleys.

In June, the Army successfully fired a Tomahawk missile from its mid-range capability system, showcasing the full operational capability of the MRC.

Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo said that Army Futures Command has made significant strides in changing requirements to achieve rapid prototyping for the Army's priority modernization programs. (Photo Credit: Screenshot image) VIEW ORIGINAL

As leaders build toward the Army of 2030, AFC commander Gen. Jim Rainey has also worked towards setting the foundation for the Army of 2040. Army leaders said in March that the service must foster a greater understanding of future threats and technological change to prepare for that initiative. Among those efforts will be exploring how artificial intelligence and robotics can be incorporated into the service’s infantry and armored brigade combat teams on the future battlefield.

During last year’s Project Convergence, the Army’s series of joint multi-domain experiments, participants used air and ground robotic vehicles during experiments at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. In one of the tests, engineers flew a pilotless UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter.

“We’re looking at our operating concept,” Camarillo said. “How does that guide and frame our thinking about how our units are designed and the capabilities they’ll employ in the future battle space? One example that [Rainey] talked a lot about is human and machine integration. How do we incorporate them more organically in ways that we haven’t quite thought of or experimented with?”

Camarillo added that AFC has explored how long-range precision fires, the Army’s top modernization priority, impacts requirements for Soldier protection in the future. He said that AFC will continue to search for ways to incorporate autonomous systems, including the Autonomous Vehicle Transport System. This system will allow U.S. forces to maintain a higher operational tempo while providing greater force protection and sustainment.

Army engineers at the Aviation and Missile Center at Redstone, Alabama built the Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher to navigate on rough terrain. The 36,000-pound vehicle can be operated remotely and will provide Soldiers added firepower and longer sustainment on the battlefield.

The Army plans on expanding the scope and scale in the 2024 iteration of Project Convergence. During the last series in October 2022, the Army included participation from allies Australia and the United Kingdom and employed multi-domain operations over greater distances than the previous iteration.

Earlier this year, Army Futures Command announced that it would schedule more experiments throughout the year instead of hosting a series of demonstrations once annually. The Army will host Project Convergence 4 in spring 2024.

Camarillo praised the efforts of Rainey, who has led the Army’s modernization efforts since succeeding acting AFC commander Lt. Gen. James Richardson in October 2022, as well as the progress of AFC.

“We’ve begun to develop momentum on the modernization side,” Camarillo said. “Whether it's programs that have gone from prototyping to production, or it's systems that are very quickly developing prototypes that we can put them in the hands of Soldiers.

“I give AFC a lot of credit for finding ways to work very effectively with the program executive offices … changing the requirements process … and enabling us to begin that rapid prototyping.”

The Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa held their annual 9/11 memorial ceremony to commemorate the lives lost during the tragedy and highlight the importance of keeping the memory of 9/11 alive on Sept. 11, 2023 at Camp Lemonnier.

More than 100 service members from across Camp Lemonnier stood in formation to pay tribute. Distinguished guests including Djibouti Mayor Said D. Muhommud and Mario Fernandez, U.S. Chargé D’Affaires to Djibouti, were also in attendance.

“We must never forget the legacy of that September day,” said U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Jami Shawley, CJTF-HOA commanding general. “And let us hope that the legacy of that day is of a world drawn together in a common cause for freedom and for peace.”

CJTF-HOA service members who lived in New York during the attacks were invited to speak about their experience of the attacks and the impact it made on their lives.

U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Tommy Trejo, CJTF-HOA communications senior enlisted leader, was a student in middle school when the Twin Towers fell. On that day he was inspired to join the military and his calling led him to eventually enlist in the New York National Guard in 2007.

Since the he’s supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and now CJTF-HOA, which was established in October 2002 to counter transnational terrorist threats in the Horn of Africa.

“This task force was a direct result of the September 11th attacks and I’m proud to be serving here as not only a soldier, but as a New Yorker,” said Trejo.

In August 2001, a month before the attacks, U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Matthew Blake, CJTF-HOA director of human intelligence and counterintelligence, got a job as a law enforcement officer in the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York City. When he first heard about the attacks, Blake was a firearms instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia over 800 miles away from his hometown.

“I'll never forget. I was out on the range when I got my first alert text. My initial thought was it was probably just some young pilot who accidentally clipped the tower trying to show off. After a couple of minutes my alert beeper went off again. That’s when I realized our country was under attack,” said Blake.

His initial reaction, like millions from around the nation and the world, was one of shock. Upon arriving home Blake, a fifth-generation New Yorker, saw law enforcement, civilians, and service members come together like he’d never experienced before.

“Every person working out there remembers the sights, the smells, the sounds. But we also remember the resilience of our New Yorkers, of our American citizens, and of our partners and allies from around the world,” said Blake.

Twenty years removed from the attacks this unity is still present. Blake made it his personal goal to do his part in never allowing the memory of 9/11 to die out, this goal has led him to CJTF-HOA.

“Here today, we have Americans from all parts of our beloved country, we have our partners and allies from many parts of the world, and no doubt we have folks standing among us that were not even born when 9/11 happened,” said Blake. “Together we stand here in solidarity, all doing our small part in never forgetting.”",

FORT BUCHANAN, PUERTO RICO- Members of Fort Buchanan's Directorate of Emergency Services and the U.S. Army Reserve-Puerto Rico 1st Mission Support Command conducted an active terrorist threat training exercise on Aug 30 here.

The exercise evaluated the installation's response to an active shooter situation at the 1st Mission Support Command headquarters, and a suspicious package at the Army and Airforce Exchange System. The exercise aimed to sustain the high level of readiness of emergency and safety personnel assigned to the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean.

Members of the Homeland Security Investigations agency participated in the exercise as advisors.

During the exercise, residents and visitors on and near Fort Buchanan heard warnings over the ""giant voice"" system, sirens, and detonations and saw emergency response vehicles and personnel in action.

""An active shooter attack can occur anywhere, and we must all be prepared. We all play a vital role in preventing these situations,"" said Hector Herrera, Army Counterterrorism Operations Specialist at Fort Buchanan.

The military command increased the Force Protection Condition Level (FPCON) to Delta level as part of the drill.

There are five levels of FPCON: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. The levels increase from Normal's lowest condition to Delta's highest and most restrictive condition. FPCON Delta led to the closure of all gates for a period of time.

""It is critical for the Fort Buchanan community to participate in exercises like this Antiterrorism drill to ensure we are prepared for any scenario at the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean. We hope it never happens, but we are prepared to deal with it quickly if it does. We thank every member of the Fort Buchanan community and the surrounding communities for their patience during the event,"" said Col. Charles N. Moulton, commander of Fort Buchanan.

As the Department of the Army's center of gravity in the region, Fort Buchanan serves a diverse military community comprised of approximately 15,000 Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard soldiers, Marine Corps Reserve, and the Navy's Operational Support Center personnel.

The installation also offers critical services to the civilian population of the Department of Defense, veterans, retirees, and their families, as well as more than 30 federal agencies located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden presented Larry Taylor, a Vietnam War Army helicopter pilot, with the Medal of Honor during a ceremony at the White House Sept. 5, 2023.

The president upgraded the Silver Star award that Taylor originally received for his heroic actions rescuing a four-person patrol team in 1968.

“When duty called, Larry did everything to answer,” Biden said. “Because of that, he rewrote the fate of four families for generations to come. That’s valor. That’s our nation at its very best.”

Taylor, a Chattanooga, Tennessee native, joined the Army to continue his family’s tradition of military service. His great-great-grandfather fought in the Civil War; his great-uncle fought in World War I; and his father and uncles fought in World War II.

He commissioned through the Army Reserve Officer Training Program at the University of Tennessee in 1966. He volunteered as an armor officer before quickly switching to be a pilot, flying some of the Army’s first AH-1G Cobra attack helicopters.

After qualifying as an Army aviator, he was sent to Vietnam in August 1967 to serve with D Troop (Air), 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 1st Infantry Division. A distress call came into his unit late at night, June 18, 1968. A long-range reconnaissance patrol team of four Soldiers was surrounded and in danger of being overrun.

Taylor and his co-pilot had two minutes to fire up their Cobra and head out into the darkness. They only knew the general direction of the team. They were unable use the lights on the helicopter because they would give away their position and the position of the patrol team.

“I didn’t think I was ever going to find them,” Taylor recalled.

The reconnaissance team was hunkered down behind a cart path. They were on a mission in southern Vietnam to track North Vietnamese troop movement when they noticed a large enemy force positioned around them. They tried to escape the same way they came but were quickly surrounded.

Their only option was to take cover and prepare for the fight they knew was coming, said Dave Hill, rear gunner on the patrol team.

The team radioed for air support, which arrived not long after. As Taylor and his co-pilot flew overhead, they made radio contact with the men on the ground.

Taylor asked the patrol team to mark their location with flares so he and another Cobra crew could differentiate them from the enemy.

“We knew we would be discovered at some point because we were surrounded,” Hill said. “We popped the flares, and all hell broke loose.”

Bullets and rocket-propelled grenades started flying, some hitting the embankment in front of the Soldiers while others flew over their heads. Seeing enemy muzzle fire, the two Cobra gunships started making attack runs using their mini-guns and aerial rockets. According to reports, both helicopters took on intense ground fire from the enemy.

Each member of the ground patrol team engaged the enemy force with more than 600 rounds of ammunition, claymore mines and grenades. The grenadier of the unit had 75 rounds for the M-79 grenade launcher. After 35 minutes of fighting, they were nearly tapped out.

Both Cobras were close to being out of ammunition as well and running low on fuel. Thinking quickly, Taylor radioed the patrol team with a rescue plan.

He told the other gunship to fire its remaining rounds along the eastern flank of the patrol team. He would fire his remaining rounds along the western flank and then use his landing lights to draw the enemy’s attention.

He told the patrol team to reposition their claymore mines to the northeast and southeast. When the two Cobras made their attack runs, Taylor instructed the reconnaissance team to fire the mines and run to the nearby rice paddy clearing.

“That will give 'Charlie' something to think about,” Taylor said recalling his plan.

They all executed, and the patrol team met Taylor’s helicopter at the extraction point. The gunship was a two-seat aircraft with no room for passengers. It touched down under intense fire, and the Soldiers climbed under the helicopter onto the rocket-pods and landing skids.

Taylor immediately took off and got the helicopter out of firing range. He then dropped the patrol team off at a nearby safe location. Before the Cobra took off again for its return flight to base, the four Soldiers looked up at Taylor and all saluted.

“[Taylor’s] innovation was well beyond the call [of duty], as was his courage,” Hill said. Asked what chance of survival the team had without Taylor’s actions, Hill responded empathically, “absolutely zero.”

Taylor served in Vietnam until August 1968, flying more than 2,000 combat missions and taking enemy fire 340 times. It wasn’t easy but throughout the war Taylor never lost a man, he said.

“You do whatever you can to save the lives of the people you’re trying to rescue,” he explained. “Today, I’ve become lifelong friends with several of these people.”

Hill is now one of those people. Having not seen each other since that fateful night in Vietnam, they finally met at a long-range reconnaissance patrol reunion in 1999. They’ve been friends ever since and take turns attending their respective unit reunions.

The eight soldiers involved in the battle received several awards, including a few Silver Stars. Hill and a several others thought Taylor had done more to distinguish himself that night.

""Larry not only did his job, he went way above and beyond his duty at great risk of life,” Hill said. ""It was a failure at the time to adequately recognize his valor, his courage, his dedication, and we were determined to turn that around.""

The group contacted a congressman in Tennessee and started the process for nominating Taylor for the Medal of Honor. After more than seven years of work, they finally proved, with witness statements not previously seen, that Taylor deserved the military’s highest honor for valor.

“That’s the ultimate,” Taylor said of receiving the Medal of Honor. “You can’t get any better than that. I’m thankful that we were able to get the [Soldiers] out that night, and all four of them became lifelong friends.”

During his time in the Army, Taylor received more than 50 combat decorations, including the Silver Star, 43 Air Medals, a Bronze Star and two Distinguished Flying Crosses. He finished his military career as a captain and returned home to Tennessee where he has lived ever since.

A Patriot’s Day parade is scheduled in Chattanooga to honor him, Sept. 17, 2023.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Army Special Operations Command welcomed Ellsworth “Al” Johnson, a 100-year-old World War II Army veteran, into the community by presenting him with an Army Special Forces’ tab and a Green Beret during a ceremony at an assisted living center in Zeeland, Michigan, Sept. 1.

Johnson was recognized for his contributions during the war while serving in an Office of Strategic Services’ operational group, a precursor to Army Special Operations, and became eligible for the honor after an update to the Army awards regulation in 2019.

“We honor Mr. Johnson today as we look back at our roots and legacy in Special Operations,” said Brig. Gen. Lawrence Ferguson, 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) commanding general. “We talk a lot about people and warfighting in the Army, and when you look at Mr. Johnson and his time, it’s clear to see that although many years have passed, those two concepts are still with us today.”

During WWII, the Office of Strategic Services was an intelligence agency for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The command formed several small self-sufficient groups composed primarily of Soldiers that would enter enemy territory to perform missions and gather intelligence.

Johnson, an Army medic, volunteered to join the command and was placed in the French operational group following training. His 25-man team parachuted into France behind enemy lines in August 1944, just prior to the Allied invasion of southern France.

Their mission was to capture a hydroelectric plant and harass the German army while gathering intelligence for the unit’s headquarters in London. The team, given the code name “Patrick,"" spent nearly a month in France working with a French underground group.

The unit successfully captured the plant and the nearby town of Eguzon. They continued to torment the German army as it retreated through southern France.

Following this tour, Johnson volunteered to serve in China where he provided medical care and trained Chinese troops in airborne capabilities. He served as an advisor to a Chinese commando unit and parachuted with them during an attack against a Japanese-held town.

Johnson survived the battle and returned home to Michigan at the end of the war in 1945. The Office of Strategic Services disbanded that October.

“[Johnson] laid the groundwork for what we are today,” said Maj. Gen. Patrick Roberson, U.S. Army Special Operations Command deputy commanding general. “Everything that he did in 1944 — we model ourselves on in our training and the operations that we conduct. It’s our origin story.”

During the Korean War, U.S. Army leaders wanted to create an unconventional warfare unit to deal with guerrilla forces. Rather than start from scratch, they used the operational groups of the OSS from WWII as a model for the new unit structure.

This structure carried over in the formation of Army Special Forces under the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Division in 1952.

Surrounded by his extended family, Johnson was honored nearly two months after his 100th birthday.

“I’m overcome by the emotion but proud to be here today,” he said.

UNDISCLOSED LOCATION, AFRICA– Dump trucks kick up bright orange soil as they rumble past termite mounds and low-lying shrubs. Dust plumes rise from an excavator as it fills up a long line of trucks. Some of the dirt will fill up barriers, other dirt will be used to fortify targets on a training range, and still, more of it is being relocated to provide drainage for rain.

After a long day, the Soldiers responsible for these tasks are covered in the same orange dust that marks their trucks, a testament to their hard work. They try their best not to track it into their tent, letting the wind carry the orange off their boots and wet wipes to knock the dirt off their skin.

The Soldiers are part of the 294th Engineer Support Company, Missouri National Guard, currently providing support to the Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa.

“If they need a new road cleared out, then we’re there. If they need some [barriers] to be built, then we got it,” said Spc. Jared Alverson, 294th ESC horizontal construction specialist. “Our responsibility here is just to be ready and get jobs done fast while being as available as possible for the larger mission.”

The 294th ESC provides construction and maintenance capabilities to outstations and remote locations across the continent, giving friendly forces a launching point wherever it may be needed.

Aircraft swiftly and discreetly drop 294th ESC Soldiers off at their target location with their tools and supplies, and then the teams get to work. Their horizontal construction team moves dirt and rocks to flatten areas in preparation for structure specialists. They can also build up barriers and control points to begin securing a location.

“We can do various earth-moving operations, such as extending outposts and building new structures,” said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Caleb Cantrell, 294th ESC horizontal team noncommissioned officer in charge of projects.

The Soldiers possess a wide range of skills, encompassing everything from electrical technicians to plumbers to heavy equipment operators. Many maintain active careers in carpentry or as skilled tradesmen in their civilian capability, bringing outside experience and skills to the mission. Depending on the needs of the location, they could be driving forklifts, filling sandbags, or building guard towers.

The ability to construct and maintain infrastructure at forward operating locations is critical to the success of CJTF-HOA operations in the Horn of Africa, where security may be required to support the goals of African partners and friendly forces.

“This is the hardest working crew I’ve ever had the pleasure of serving with over here,” said Cantrell. “Some days are 18-hour days, but they’re still willing to go the extra mile.”",

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait – United States Army Reserve unit, 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command, and U.S. Army unit, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command completed a successful handover of responsibilities that culminated with a Transfer of Authority ceremony following a transition period known as relief in place at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, on Sep. 2, 2023.

1st Theater Sustainment Command deputy commanding general, Brig. Gen. Maria A. Juarez, along with 143d ESC Command Sgt. Maj. Ricardo N. Saunders, officially cased the command colors and transferred the unit’s mission to the 13th ACSC. The color casing ceremony signifies the end of the unit’s mission to provide sustainment support for Operation Spartan Shield in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.

As Juarez and Saunders cased the 143d command colors, 143d ESC Higher Headquarters Company (HHC) command team, Capt. Marlena Janes and 1st Sgt. Jacob Webb, simultaneously cased the company guidon.

Upon the 143d ESC command team’s completion of casing its respective colors and guidon, the incoming 13th ACSC command team uncased the colors and guidon for their command.

In attendance were distinguished guests, the commanding general of 1st Theater Sustainment Command, Brig. Gen. Eric P. Shirley; senior enlisted advisor to 1TSC Command Sgt. Major Albert J. Richardson, Jr., U.S. Embassy- Kuwait, Charge d' Affaires James Holtsnider, Task Force Spartan command team, and the Area Support Group – Kuwait command team.

Shirley, reviewing officer of the ceremony, opened with congratulatory remarks to Juarez and the 143d ESC “Just as the 143d ESC epitomizes the continued and vital contributions of Army Reserve forces in support of our Warfighters in theater, the incoming 13th ACSC represents that seamless integration between our components. No longer is there any distinction drawn between Active, Guard and Reserve Soldiers when it comes to supporting the mission.”

Following the commanding general’s remarks, Juarez rose to speak. “In this ever-changing theater, our role as a sustainment force requires that we find a way to support the Warfighter, regardless of terrain or obstacles, wherever they operate. This is absolutely a ‘no fail’ mission,” she stated.

Juarez spoke of the many accomplishments of the 143d ESC and thanked each section for their resilience, commitment, and unwavering support in the mission's success.

13th ACSC commanding general, Brig. Gen. Sean P. Davis ended the ceremony with acknowledgments, “We have been training for this for over a year. I have the utmost confidence in our Soldiers’ abilities to excel during this mission.” He continued, “This was the best RIP/TOA I have seen in over 20 years, thanks to the 143d.”

The 13th ACSC, based in Ft. Cavazos, Texas, enables the III Armored Corps by serving as the primary sustainment headquarters for all sustainment efforts. On order, the 13th ACSC is prepared to deploy and provide command and control of multinational and joint theater distribution, theater opening, and reception, staging, and onward movement in a multi-domain battlefield in support of the full range of military operations. This will be the 13th ACSC’s third rotation in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility since 2014.

1st Theater Sustainment Command is America’s only permanently deployed Sustainment Command in the Middle East that works alongside host nation allies and regional security partners to provide Army, Joint, and multinational sustainment solutions in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to deliver predictive and precise joint logistics, human resources, finance, health service support, and contracting capabilities to set and sustain the theater for multi-domain operations in competition or crisis.",

Soldiers endure discomfort and pain for many reasons. They may do so as part of their wartime duties or in training. Everyone reaches a point where they choose to quit or drive on. Military awards – particularly badges – are earned, not given. Each course or task demands some level of sacrifice.

Many service members particularly value the chance to earn a foreign award. No badge is worn by as many U.S. servicemembers though as the German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge – GAFPB.

My introduction to the badge came as a 19-year-old draftee serving in the German Air Force, Luftwaffe, after graduating from Berlin’s John F. Kennedy School. This opportunity presented itself to me courtesy of my German mother. My American father was a U.S. Army JAG officer attached to the U.S. embassy in Germany at the time. I recall that the sewed-on GAFPBs adorning my basic training instructor’s uniforms served as a symbol of their competence and professionalism. Everyone in my unit wanted a chance to prove themselves and receive the badge.

My understanding of this particular award would evolve. I would earn, and then encounter, this badge throughout my career.

The badge in German is formally called the, “Abzeichen für besondere Leistungen im Truppendienst.” This term more accurately translates as, “award for special performance in military service.” In U.S. military service, we refer to it as the German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge, but it is officially the German Armed Forces Efficiency Badge.

Army Regulation 600-8-22, Military Awards, stipulates that foreign decorations will only be presented by a designated representative from the awarding nation. As such we work with our German partners as part of each event, and they generate and sign award certificates. Army Regulation 600-8-22 also includes the German Armed Forces Efficiency Badge as a named foreign badge specifically authorized for acceptance and wear by both enlisted personnel and officers.

A U.S. Army commander may also approve the wear of the foreign badge. Many units publish memorandums that authorize acceptance, retention and wear of the badge or use the DA Form 4187.

Events required to receive the GAFPB include completing various sports exercises including a shuttle run, flexed arm hang, and a one-kilometer run. Service members must also pass a first aid exam and demonstrate proficiency in their chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protective equipment. Pistol marksmanship is also key, with shooters required to engage three targets using five rounds. Most events conclude with the required ruck march or the challenging 100-meter swim and uniform doff.

German service members wear the badge on the left breast pocket of their utility and service uniforms, while U.S. Soldiers may only wear it on their Army Service Uniform coat and shirt and Army Green Service Uniform coat. Soldiers may only wear one foreign badge on their uniforms, centered or aligned with the right edge of unit awards or nameplate, above the right pocket and unit awards.

The West German Bundeswehr established the award in 1971, and service members of all branches may earn the badge. It is an award of the Federal Republic of Germany’s Bundeswehr and is available in three steps, or levels: gold, silver and bronze. Interestingly, the German military places more value on gold than we do in the U.S. military. U.S. O-1 rank is gold across all services and branches, while O-2 is silver. German officer rank is silver, while all general officer ranks are gold. As such the gold GAFPB is more difficult to earn than the silver or bronze.

The badge prominently features the Bundesadler – the federal eagle - surrounded by a wreath. It’s interesting and relevant that Germany and the United States of America share an affinity for the same bird and use it as national symbols.

After I left the German military, I attended university in the U.S., enlisted in the Army Reserve, and was later commissioned as a Regular Army officer. During the Basic Officer Leaders Course, German liaison officers detailed to the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence offered another opportunity to earn the GAFPB. I witnessed hundreds of young U.S. Army military police second lieutenants earn their badges.

Some years later, I was assigned as provost marshal to the 2d Cavalry Regiment based in Vilseck, Germany. I again saw our formations regularly host German partners during various GAFPB events. Units and individual soldiers drew close to German units and service members.

Last summer I was the officer in charge during a large GAFPB event held at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. We worked closely with German service members assigned to the German Armed Forces Command in Reston, Virginia. and the defense attaché staff detailed to the Federal Republic of Germany’s embassy to the United States. We hosted over 300 service members during the event.

I recently attended the 3d U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) GAFPB event. Historic Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall served as a backdrop for the competition. Abutting Arlington Cemetery and a stone’s throw from the Pentagon, the installation is also very close to the German embassy in Washington D.C.’s Foxhall Village neighborhood close to Georgetown. The defense attaché staff again took time to run over 250 service members through each event. This time I covered the event as a public affairs officer.

Supporting GAFPB events is both time-consuming and expensive for German service members and their commands. Each GAFPB event may take two or three days – not including travel. This takes leaders away from their missions and staff out of their offices. We must acknowledge the sacrifices they make as well.

So why do we go through all this effort to earn a badge? It's great training. Each event builds teams and camaraderie. Individuals reach their limits – and push past them. The badge is a visible symbol of an enduring partnership.

Over the years, I watched men and women fight through pain, fatigue and doubt. This year, a young soldier marched the soles off his feet, his boots red with blood and skin sloughing off. He made it past the ruck march. I’ve watched well-prepared swimmers cramp up in the pool, sink to the bottom, yet manage to remove their uniform blouse and trousers to complete the swim. I’ve seen senior leaders compete alongside their young soldiers, earning a badge - and respect - after over 25 years of service.

What I enjoyed seeing most, though, were the conversations and insights shared between allied service members before, during and after a GAFPB event. The briefest conversations between the Germans and our troops sparked interests that led to much greater understanding.

German Navy Rear Adm. Axel Ristau, the German embassy’s defense attaché, emphasized moral and physical fitness after the latest GAFPB. He also highlighted the alliance between the two countries. “It’s a visual sign of our outstanding bilateral cooperation, and we both, the Americans and German soldiers who earn this badge, can be very proud.”

Ristau earned his badge in 1987. He marveled at how this award binds two nations together. “It’s a sign of a transatlantic link. I wear, and my comrade here, wears the same badge on a military uniform.” He told me this as 213 U.S. servicemembers, their friends and families celebrated their achievement in Fort Myer’s Conmy Hall, its massive display screen showing enmeshed German and American flags braced by the gold, silver and bronze GAFPBs.

While not as far removed from earning my badge as Ristau, I also appreciate its importance and feel the same way. What at first to me was a badge worn by my respected instructors and superiors in the German military, has now, as a U.S. Army officer, become that symbol of proficiency and of true German-American partnership.

FORT BUCHANAN, PR — A pilot program, spearheaded in Puerto Rico, called Operation Connect the Dots provided Soldiers interested in increasing their general technical (GT) scores with two weeks of training on arithmetic reasoning, vocabulary, and paragraph comprehension, July 31 – August 11.

Around 45 Army Reserve Soldiers were the first to go through the program, part of the Army's more extensive Basic Skills Education Program — generally only available for those on active duty.

Sgt. 1st Class Nicholas Rice, 166th Regional Support Group's H2F System Manager, says the Basic Skills Education Program is designed to help soldiers who may have yet to obtain the ASVAB score they wanted upon entering the service.

However, with Operation Connect the Dots, Reservists now have access to the same education materials as their active duty counterparts, according to Connie Schauer, the 88th Readiness Division education services specialist.

""The Reserves Soldiers don't have the same opportunity as the active duty soldiers many times, and this gives them a chance to further their career,"" said Schauer.

Operation Connect the Dots was initially developed to fill crucial warrant officer slots; however, it became clear that other Soldiers could benefit from the training. The course was expanded to include Soldiers looking to become commissioned officers or reclassed to different military occupational specialties.

""It took me three years to get the program started,"" said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Taj Keeler, a property accounting technician with the 166th Regional Support Group. ""Readiness is usually based on metrics such as IWQ [individual weapons qualification] and collective training, but a shortage in retention and recruiting allowed us to showcase the talents we have organically in our division.""

Sgt. 1st Class Rice added that the course was established to further their education for the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery throughout the BSEP and provide them education through the Holistic Health and Fitness system.

""What we saw internally is that a lot of junior enlisted soldiers who took the test were in high school and may not have established strong English language skills, and therefore, the test isn't necessarily indicative of their current capabilities,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Rice. ""So, we wanted to align their current capabilities with future opportunities.""

The program was designed to follow the Holistic Health and Fitness system, which focuses on five domains to build the overall readiness of Soldiers. These domains include physical, mental, nutritional, spiritual, and sleep readiness.

""Using all five domains to build a basic foundation assists Soldiers in their learning and study habits,"" said Chief Keeler. ""This way, Soldiers are in the best state of mind and have ample time to study.""

Of the 45 students enrolled, 37 could increase their score above 110, and seven Soldiers increased their line scores to change their military occupational specialty.

""We saw incredible results; 82% of the Soldiers ended up getting a GT score of 110 or higher, and the overwhelming feedback from the Soldiers is that it helped change their life, said Sgt. 1st Class Rice. ""The H2F and BSEP made that possible.""

Several students shared their thoughts after the program.

""I saw this as an opportunity to do something better and to improve my score to get more opportunities,"" said Private 1st Class Jenifer Restos, 420th Quartermaster Company. ""I can be an officer, or I can reclass. I can do better with this higher score, and anything can come out of this.""

However, improving their scores was one of the many benefits of the course.

""I feel like I can do anything; whatever I put my mind to, I will accomplish it,"" said Spc. Jomar Gonzales, from the 215th Military Police Detachment. ""It feels great to be a part of this. I hope this happens more; this is going to help a lot of people.""

While the idea is, at the end of this course, each of the Soldiers would increase their GT score, Sgt. 1st Class Rice affirmed they would leave knowing the brigade cared about them and provided a system designed to improve them and their families.

Throughout the two weeks, the participants were encouraged to wear civilian clothes. Chief Keeler said this provided a more cohesive learning space where ranks were not a factor.

""So many Soldiers have barriers going into training; I wanted to appeal to their human side,"" said Chief Keeler. ""This way, they would be open to building better relationships with their classmates.""

The most crucial factor to consider is how this program can be viewed as a retention tool for the Reserves.

""These soldiers are the future and will help fill your ranks,"" said Schauer. ""If you don't challenge them, you'll lose them. If they're not being challenged, they're not going to stay. This is a way to help them jump-start their career.""

Chief Keeler estimates that at least 40 participants will be able to fill some of the critical slots in the unit. He says that by investing in them, they can see what they can achieve.

With Lt. Gen. Jody J. Daniels' focus on shaping tomorrow. Chief Keeler offers his perspective on the initiative.

""Shaping tomorrow by focusing on current soldiers,"" said Chief Keeler. ""These Soldiers will most likely be in front of the formation of incoming Soldiers in 2030. We need to continue to build them up so that the new Soldiers are coming into a safe environment, free of SHARP, EO incidents, and IG complaints. Giving them the tools to give back that's the overall goal of Operation Connect the Dots.""",

JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, Va. — With family, friends and members of the Army’s Military Police Corps in attendance, Lt. Gen. Donna Martin, Army inspector general, awarded Capt. Luis R. Avila the Order of the Marechausse, silver, during a ceremony at the Memorial Chapel on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Aug. 23.

The award is one of the highest honors given to a military police member by the Military Police Regimental Association, and it recognizes a degree of professionalism, high standards of integrity and morality and esprit de corps.

“I can’t think of a more deserving Soldier and member of our regiment to receive this honor,” Martin said. “Today, we are here because the impossible was made possible with faith, family, courage and prayers.”

On his fifth combat deployment in December 2011, Avila was leading his company from the 720th Military Police Battalion on a search and rescue mission in Afghanistan when a 600-pound improvised explosive device detonated underneath his vehicle, splitting it in half, Martin explained.

The explosion killed three of Avila’s Soldiers and left him severely wounded. He lost his left leg, suffered two heart attacks and two strokes, and a lack of oxygen caused brain damage. The injuries he sustained left him almost completely paralyzed.

Two weeks after the attack, he arrived back in the U.S. in a coma and on life support. His family would stay by his side morning and night, continuing to have faith that he would recover. They prayed and started playing some of his favorite music in the hospital room.

“During those dark days, the family remained steady in their faith in God, and in Luis’ will to survive,” Martin explained. “When their faith was tested, they turned to music.”

Miraculously, Luis’ facial muscles began to twitch, and he eventually woke up from the coma after 40 days. However, he couldn’t eat, speak or see for more than three years.

Luis and his family never gave up hope, and they continued to play music. He even used music therapy as part of his rehabilitation.

“I think what has been very important going through my husband's road of recovery has been his courage and discipline to do things,” his wife Claudia said. “Since the day that he was capable of listening and understanding, he has been working on how to get better.”

He has taken on the challenge of recovery with the help of the medical team at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and the support system around him.

""It takes a strong family to endure hardship,"" Martin said. ""I can attest that the Avila family is the strongest family I've ever had the honor to know.""

With that support and through years of rehabilitation, Avila has regained some movement in his hands, leg and part of his speech. He now sings at many events throughout the National Capital Region.

He performed on television during the 28th National Memorial Day Concert at the U.S. Capitol in 2017 and during the Joint Chiefs of Staff change of command ceremony in 2019. He also sang twice during his Order of the Marechausse award ceremony.

“It's an extreme honor to receive this award, and I am extremely grateful for my [military police] brothers and sisters that have supported me along the way,” he said. “We really appreciate all you do for us, your service and sacrifice to our nation.”

The Military Police Regimental Association established the Order of the Marechausse in 2000 to recognize exceptional dedication, competence and contribution to the regiment. The award is presented in either gold, silver, bronze, or steel, based on the impact and years of service to the regiment.

Today, there are nearly 500 recipients of the silver medal.

“Capt. Avila is truly a role model for all Soldiers, peers and subordinates alike,” Martin said. “I know I speak for all of us here today when I say that the Military Police Corps Regiment is blessed to have you, Luis, as a member of our family.”

Avila continues to recover from his injuries. He has completed four Army Ten-Miler races on a bike with his son, finishing in first place in his category one year, and has won multiple gold and silver medals at the DOD Warrior Games.

She helped at least 70 enslaved people escape through the route of the Underground Railroad. (Courtesy Photo) (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — Harriet Tubman etched her place in history while traversing long distances and guiding runaway slaves to freedom.

But historians also credit the Maryland native as being the first female to lead a combat regiment when she spearheaded a Union Army raid during the Civil War.

To honor Tubman’s contributions to the U.S. military and her lifetime achievements, the Army Surgeon General and Army Chaplain Corps hosted a ceremony in Washington Wednesday to pay tribute to the woman who freed at least 70 slaves while making about 13 trips back to Maryland 170 years ago.

“When Harriet Tubman was making her mark on our world, people likely didn’t really see her,” said Maj. Gen. Deb Kotulich, Army Recruiting and Retention Task Force director. “She was able to slip in and out spaces often unseen because those around her didn’t expect her to have to ability to do anything out of the ordinary.”

“But she was … helping our military, saving lives and ultimately impacting the course of the U.S. Army’s fight against the Confederacy.”

On June 2, 1863, Tubman led 150 African American Union Soldiers in the Combahee Ferry Raid, an operation that rescued more than 700 slaves according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Wednesday’s ceremony celebrated the operation’s 160th anniversary this past summer, and next month will mark 174 years since Tubman made her escape to freedom.

Tubman served as a nurse and Union spy, using her navigation skills that she developed during her time travelling on the Underground Railroad. Tubman, already familiar with the terrain and clandestine activities in the region, helped the Union with raid planning and went on reconnaissance missions.

Tubman’s abilities helped educate future generations of Soldiers on the importance of battlefield sustainment. The Military Intelligence Corps inducted Tubman into its Hall of Fame in June 2021.

“She knew the field, she knew the environment, and she knew what was happening in the world where she conducted her operations,” said Maj. Gen. Heidi Hoyle, acting deputy chief of staff, logistics.

In 1865, the Army’s 12th Surgeon General, Joseph Barnes, appointed Tubman as nurse matron at Fort Monroe’s Colored Hospital in Hampton, Virginia. Tubman also travelled to Florida to treat and cure Union Soldiers with cases of dysentery, an infection of the intestines. Tubman used natural herbs to cure the Soldiers of the ailment, which became one of the leading causes of death during the Civil War.

A skilled cook, Tubman voluntarily baked goods to give Union troops energy while also preparing meals for the injured and the hospital staff. According to the Fort Sam Houston Museum, a young Tubman learned to bring food into the field while helping her father, an enslaved forester.

“I have no doubt that she heard all her life with a small stature and being a woman and an African American, what she could not do,” Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Scott Dingle said. “But Harriet did not let that stop her … because she knew based on the rooting and the word of God, that she had a mission in this world.”

Tubman earned a distinction for her field prowess before the Civil War began. After a June 1858 meeting in Niagara Falls, Ontario, abolitionist John Brown nicknamed her “General” Tubman, impressed by her bravery.

Tubman herself was born into bondage in Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Although she eventually escaped slavery on an arduous, 90-mile trek to Philadelphia, she returned to her home state again and again to liberate family members.

Although she stood only 5-foot-2 and suffered from headaches and narcolepsy, Tubman navigated her way through forests and rugged terrain to guide slaves to Northern states and Canada. While enslaved, an overseer threw a metal weight that landed on her head, causing her to suffer from hallucinations for the rest of her life.

During her night rescues of slaves, Tubman eluded men on horseback while traversing the countryside on foot.

“She was illiterate, so she couldn’t read the signs or which way to go,” Dingle said during a ceremony attended by Tubman’s great-great-great grandniece, Ernestine Wyatt. “But she had an invictus spirit.”

A devout Christian, Tubman turned to her faith to preserve through the most difficult times. Tubman managed to evade capture while leading slaves out of captivity said Col. Karen Meeker, MEDCOM command chaplain.

“Her faith was everything,” Meeker said. “It gave her the strength to overcome all the things that she faced in her life. It gave her a mission, a very high calling.”

Dingle said Tubman learned to overcome her small stature while cutting wood during her years in bondage.

“The physical labors prepared her to be the ‘Moses’ of the underground railroad – to lead in the harshest winter at times,” Dingle said.

In addition to her time at Fort Monroe, Tubman also served as a nurse in Washington D.C. and Beaufort, South Carolina. The Army lauded her Wednesday for her contributions to Army medicine, her missions as a Soldier and being a freedom fighter.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – The 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, hosted this year’s largest Army counterintelligence exercise July 8-21, 2023 to increase proficiency through realistic scenario-based training.

Vigilant Defender 23 holds the distinction of being the first ever counterintelligence battalion echelon culminating training event conducted, and the largest counterintelligence focused exercise ever under U.S. Army Reserve Command. Approximately 200 personnel participated, of which about 120 were counterintelligence agents.

Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, and surrounding San Juan provided the perfect backdrop for the exercise. As the only federal military installation in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, the 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) leveraged locations and trained in an environment with deep Hispanic and Latin American cultural ties.

The unit’s training objectives included completing realistic, full spectrum counterintelligence operations in scenario-based exercises that replicated real world conditions. Planners focused the exercise design on notional support to theater level intelligence support. The unit tailored counterintelligence training around conducting operations in a true Spanish language environment. This allowed counterintelligence agents and analysts to work with interpreters and overcome language barriers which enhanced realism.

Lt. Col. Cope, 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) commander emphasized the importance of training in Puerto Rico. “The predominant language here is Spanish, it's good for our agents who do not speak Spanish to come here and try to operate and navigate through this area.” He believes that the realism will serve agents well. “This makes them more adaptable and resilient to different environments.”

The Army Reserve’s 1st Mission Support Command supported training. Aside from coordinating world-class facilities on the installation, their Soldiers served as exercise role players. 1st Mission Support Command is headquartered on Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.

Cope singled out Col. Carlos Caceres, commander of the 1st Mission Support Command. “Without his full support, I don't think this exercise would have been at this level.” Cope added that Caceres’ personal involvement proved invaluable. “He brought in all his local contacts with the state police, Army Reserve, National Guard, FBI. He invited whoever was out there to come meet with us to discuss our event.”

Vigilant Defender 23 tested and validated the battalion’s ability to operate in a multi-component and interagency environment. 18 units and organizations participated. Army units came from across all three components. Multiple federal partners also participated and provided input.

U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command supported the exercise with participants and evaluators. Leaders acknowledged the close and growing relationship between the 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) and U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command. The battalion leveraged Counterintelligence Command’s real-world expertise to enhance the exercise’s realism.

Maj. Dan Burnett, 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) operations officer described the intricacies of coordinating such a complex event. “The real challenge in the reserve component is always conducting properly planned resourced and executed training. The Interrogation Group, and the Military Intelligence Readiness Command, all the way up to U.S. Army Reserve Command, did nothing but support this exercise.” He also acknowledged the Southeast Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center that dispatched numerous additional evaluators.

Burnett added that he believes all the effort was worth it. “We feel that this is a challenging exercise that is pushing the limits of our agents and analytic elements. And we really think that this is going to be a tremendous, memorable growth opportunity for all parties involved.”

The exercise task organization established field offices that reported to a regional headquarters. Each field office included a staff supporting a Special Agent in Charge (SAC) and military intelligence analyst support.

The robust exercise white cell scripted detailed scenarios designed to facilitate counterintelligence operations task training and evaluation. They also closely managed role players and coordinated observer controller – trainers. It took almost 8 months to write the scenarios, injects, and prepare supporting materials.

The 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion staff completed a staff exercise during Vigilant Defender 23 and received a 1st Army, U.S. Forces Command, external evaluation.

Col. Brent Stalder, Interrogation Group commander and Cmd. Sgt. Maj. Alexander McMillan, Interrogation Group command sergeant major, flew in to observe training and hosted a town hall July 14 in Fort Buchanan’s Ramos Hall.

Counterintelligence agents also conducted Threat Awareness and Reporting Program (TARP) training for individuals and units on Fort Buchanan. TARP is a counterintelligence agent led live-event annual training requirement for all Department of the Army personnel.

Many counterintelligence agents received a tier II certification in line with the Military Intelligence Training Strategy (MITS) through their participation in the exercise. Will-train Soldiers also received valuable experience as a precursor to the Counterintelligence Agent Course - CIAC.

Burnett sees the exercise as a model worth emulating. “We really hope that Vigilant Defender becomes the flagship counterintelligence event on an annual basis. We want to continue to partner and link together the active and reserve components for our mutual benefit.”

752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, is based at Fort Meade, Md. and supports U.S. Army Forces Command units, while providing support to U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command. Counterintelligence units are capable of detecting, identifying, neutralizing, and exploiting foreign intelligence activities, international terrorists, insider threats, and other foreign adversaries. The overall counterintelligence mission involves protecting the U.S. Army and DOD’s strategic advantages.

On a rainy Monday morning, 57 U.S. Army Soldiers started a weeklong journey in pursuit of a special honor.

For only the second time, the Army Reserve hosted an event for candidates of the Expert Soldier Badge, held Aug. 14-18, 2023, at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. Members of all three Army components (active duty, Army Reserve and National Guard) were invited to participate.

Earning this badge is no small feat. Soldiers must complete a variety of mental and physical challenges, and any slip up could mean going home.

Of the 57 candidates this year, only 16 remained at the end, standing tall as their shiny new badges were pinned to their uniform.

“I'm very happy,” said Spc. Dominic Chrisostomo, a member of the 1224th Engineer Company, part of the Guam National Guard, upon earning the badge. “I'm happy that I stayed in. I continued mission. I kept going and didn't let anything get me down, and I just kept moving forward.”

Throughout the week, these candidates had to complete tasks — 30 in total — related to weapon systems, medical and patrol knowledge. With only a single no-go allowed per day, the pressure was on.

Surprisingly, anticipation was one of the hardest parts of the event, according to Pfc. Tyson Clark, U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne).

“Especially when we're going through the lanes, the medical lanes, patrol lanes,” Clark said, “like trying to lay in bed at night, and you've got all these different tasks going through your head, and you can't sleep because you're stressed out.”

Clark was one of three Soldiers to earn the Straight Edge title, meaning he was perfect in every task.

“I guess I got lucky,” Clark said of the achievement. “I didn't mess up any of my tasks, but yeah, it was a wild ride.”

The ESB is open to all Soldiers (noncommissioned officers, warrant officers and officers) who are not serving in the infantry, special forces or medical branches and who demonstrate individual abilities to perform basic Soldier tasks.

Chrisostomo appreciated the chance to become reacquainted with those tasks after a couple years of focusing on his military occupational specialty.

“Being here, it kind of brings us back to pretty much our infantry side,” Chrisostomo said, “where we get tested upon this: patrols, the weapons, the medical. It brings back our level 10, and it ensures that we're still experts in our fields.”

More than just another decoration to wear on their uniforms, the badge represents the trials that candidates have overcome to show their expertise.

“It's a way to show other people the profession that we're in,” said Lt. Col. Joseph Proctor, 863rd Engineer Battalion commander. “When you're in any type of profession, you have to show other people what to aspire to. It's something that shows those who came before who's now and who's coming next.”

By earning this badge, Soldiers join an elite group and are then able to become graders at future events, passing on their knowledge and help to Soldiers.

When asked about coming back to help, Clark said he would be interested.

“I know it was very challenging for the graders, especially being here over a month,” Clark said, “even longer days than we had to endure. But I think it'd be a really cool experience to come back, train other Soldiers and help them experience the same thing and to also earn their badge.”

In addition to the tasks, Soldiers must also complete an Expert Physical Fitness Assessment, day and night land navigation, and a 12-mile ruck march. Failure to pass any of these requirements results in disqualification for the badge.

When asked if there was anything else to say, Proctor shared his appreciation for how the event was conducted.

“I think I did the math,” Proctor said, “and it was almost a one-to-one ratio of cadre and support staff to each one of us, if not more.”

Such individual attention is “a testament to what the U.S. Army is willing to put into the training that they did,” he continued, “and it's a testament of the Soldiers’ and staff's willingness to support our training. I wanted to say thank you to them.”",

U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael E. Langley, U.S. Africa Command commander, visited Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti on Aug. 16, 2023, as part of his official visit to the East Africa region.

During his visit, Langley patched Soldiers of the 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, South Carolina National Guard, to commemorate the unit's service in a combat zone in support of the Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa mission. After the patching ceremony, Langley shared some words of advice and encouragement with the Soldiers.

“Our service members are consummate professionals and perform incredibly well during their assignment here in the Horn of Africa,” Langley said. “Visits like this allow me to thank them for their service and physically show them that this command team supports their dedication to duty.”

The patching ceremony was just one part of Langley’s visit. He also met with Djiboutian President Guelleh to explore ways to enhance the partnership and cooperation between the United States and Djibouti.

The delegation went over a variety of topics, including economic development, regional defense and security, and the fight against terrorism.

“We discussed how we can work together to achieve our common security goals and expand our partnership,” said Langley. “Given our diplomatic, defense, and development engagements – what we call ‘Three Ds’ – in the region, the U.S. and Djibouti share aligned security and prosperity goals.”

Langley noted that Djibouti is a key U.S. partner and vital to regional development and establishing peace and stability.

“Solutions to these colossal problems must be a shared burden, with African nations at the helm of concerted international efforts and a U.S. whole-of-nation contribution that produces sustainable outcomes,” said Langley.

President Guelleh and Langley also talked about the numerous security challenges facing the region and about Djibouti’s various contributions throughout the region.

“Under the leadership of President Guelleh, Djibouti is playing an essential role in achieving peace and stability,” said Langley. “The country is contributing to peacekeeping and counterterrorism efforts in Somalia.”",

WASHINGTON — To better address obstacles facing female Soldiers serving in special operations units and to retain its top talent, Army Special Operations Command outlined 42 recommendations in a study released Monday.

The research’s findings will guide USASOC in optimizing female warfighters while noting their physical and anatomical differences.

“It is not about providing accommodations for women,” said USASOC Command Sgt. Maj. JoAnn Naumann. “It's providing tools that allow women to maximize their performance and continue to serve at all levels and across time.”

During the yearlong study, researchers found that 44% of the female Soldiers surveyed said they experienced equipment-fitting challenges relating to body armor, helmets and ruck systems. The problem can impact women’s abilities to perform basic Soldier maneuvers and skills.

Female Soldiers also reported that the time they spent planning pregnancies negatively impacted their careers, leading to Soldiers scheduling childbearing around career milestones or avoiding pregnancy entirely, according to the 106-page report, titled, “Breaking Barriers: Women in Army Special Operations Forces.”

Researchers held more than 40 focus groups and interviews with women and men from across the force. The study focused on the areas of equipment fitting, childcare, gender bias, social support, sexual harassment, pregnancy and postpartum, and morale and wellbeing. Retired Lt. Gen. Francis Beaudette, former USASOC commander, initiated the 2021 study, which had more than 5,000 respondents. Additionally, the survey addressed other concerns including challenges of small-statured Soldiers and access to healthcare.

The study also explored attitudes towards females serving in combat and special operations units. The survey results showed Soldiers had a favorable view of women serving in special operations units with no reported decline in morale. About 72% of women and 64% of men surveyed said they would support their daughter joining Army special operations units.

According to findings, 80% of men reported that gender-related concerns had no impact on their decision to remain in special operations forces. Researchers found most gender-biased comments and attitudes during the study came from senior NCOs, indicating a difference in generational views, Naumann said.

“Although disappointed by some of the findings and comments in the study, we are committed to addressing these issues with candor and transparency,” Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, USASOC commander wrote in the report’s introduction.

“To change culture takes time,” Braga added. “We have to be better — we must be better.”

The Women in ARSOF Initiative outlined three lines of effort to address the hurdles: mentorship and sponsorship, health and readiness, and modernization.

For mentorship and sponsorship, units can create a “culture of excellence” through education and accountability, said Lt. Col. Rachel Cepis, the director of the Women in ARSOF Initiative. For example, the Army can host more educational forums where Soldiers can learn how to schedule duties around breastfeeding or deal with postpartum related issues, as well as women’s health and nutrition.

Survey participants that have had children listed the top five postpartum challenges: (1) depression, stress, and anxiety, (2) inability to perform to the same level as the unit, (3) lactation, (4) maternity leave, and (5) diastasis recti abdominus.

Focus group participants said they experienced hardship finding adequate care during and after pregnancy. Soldiers also voiced concerns about pregnancy hindering career progression and having adequate breastfeeding locations, as well as convalescent leave following miscarriages.

The 10th Special Forces Group at Fort Carson, Colorado began a female mentorship program, while the 3rd Special Forces Group and 528th Sustainment Brigade at Fort Liberty, North Carolina, plan to establish a similar initiative at each battalion headquarters. The 528th Sustainment Brigade also hosts monthly engagements with female Soldiers.

“We're looking at it holistically. I'm excited to see the growth of women in our formation in all positions,” Cepis said. “And I'm thrilled that we're looking at ways to help them perform at their maximum potential.”

“This is about driving change and making ultimately, ARSOF and the [Defense Department] better,” she added.

In the second line of effort, health and readiness, USASOC partnered with Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick, Massachusetts to study physiological, metabolic and psychological responses during and after completion of extreme and prolonged training. USASOC has also submitted four topics to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services 2024 research solicitation: (1) women’s physical and physiological characteristics of elite female warfighters, (2) pregnancy and postpartum impacts on readiness, (3) long and short-term impacts of intentional dehydration, and (4) endocrine adaptations of female warfighters.

Cepis said USASOC is working with the Army, SOCOM, and academic partners to study the effects of menstrual cycles on female warfighters and ways to maximize performance. USASOC plans to examine sicknesses and illnesses that females suffer in the field and explore how to avoid musculoskeletal injuries related to female anatomy differences, she added.

Finally in modernization, the study recognizes the anatomical and anthropometric differences between men and women and Army Combat Capabilities Development Command [DEVCOM] at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland will be modernizing dress and duty uniforms as well as body armor that better fits the varying body types and sizes.

USASOC has done limited user assessments with the Army Modular Scalable Body Armor, a lightweight, adjustable bulletproof vest, and the Army Integrated Helmet Protection System, a multi-faceted head gear, which consists of protection and retention systems, a helmet cover and hearing protection.

The Women in ARSOF Director has partnered with DEVCOM to better develop items ranging from pregnant female service uniforms to female urinary devices.

USASOC founded the Women in ARSOF Initiative to specifically study female-modernization challenges while advising Army and SOF senior leaders. ARSOF also began publishing a newsletter series, created an online platform and developed a portal site to keep Soldiers updated on the study findings and ongoing efforts.

“I have never felt so heard and understood in my career until [the newsletter] started being published,” wrote a 25-year-old Soldier who has spent five years in special operations forces.

USASOC, headquartered at Fort Liberty, North Carolina, trains, equips and educates special operations units in support of the joint force.

CHICAGO – The Chicago Cubs honored Capt. Michael Ariola, a public affairs officer assigned to the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, during their Military Salute at the Crosstown Series versus the Chicago White Sox, August 16, 2023, at Wrigley Field.

Ariola was born in Chicago and raised in south suburban Darien and Downers Grove. He credits his family’s tradition of serving in the Army with his decision to join the Army.

“Both of my grandfathers served in the Army during World War II,” he said. “My maternal grandfather served as an air traffic controller in the Army Air Corps in the European Theatre and my paternal grandfather served in the Armor Corps in the Pacific Theatre.”

When the time came to serve, Ariola enlisted as a commissioned officer candidate and attended Basic Combat Training and Officer Candidate School at Fort Moore, Georgia. He received his commission as an Armor officer.

“I decided to become an armor officer because I wanted to serve in combat arms. Being part of a tank crew was very appealing to me, “said Ariola. “Maneuvering in a tank during training is very exciting and in a combat scenario, an Abrams tank provides substantial protection and tremendous firepower.”

On active duty, Ariola was stationed at Camp Casey about 40 miles north of Seoul, South Korea for two years.

“I served as a tank platoon leader and executive officer with the 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Brigade Combat team,” said Ariola.

Ariola left active duty after sustaining an injury and transitioned into the Individual Ready Reserve. During that time, he worked on his master’s degree in international affairs at the University of California, San Diego.

“Near the end of my degree program, I received several phone calls from the Army Reserve asking if I would like to join an active Army Reserve unit. I missed the camaraderie of military life, so I accepted a public affairs position with the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command,” said Ariola.

A job he finds highly rewarding with the flexibility to serve part time while pursuing a full-time career.

“I enjoy being a public affairs officer because I find it very rewarding to tell the Army Reserve story. It’s an honor to highlight the accomplishments of the disciplined, motivated, and patriotic men and women of the United States Army Reserve, while helping to improve awareness of the Army’s presence, mission, and commitment to the American people,” said Ariola. “Being a public affairs officer allows me to work with diverse civic groups, local and national media organizations, sports teams, local governments and educational institutions.”",

WASHINGTON — The Army took its next step in bolstering its top modernization priority with a successful launch of the Tomahawk missile from its mid-range capability prototype system on June 27, showcasing the potential of its newest, ground-based missile launcher.

Soldiers from the 1st Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington and Sailors from the Navy Program Executive Office Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons Office took part in the joint, live-fire exercise that demonstrated the system’s full operational capability. Earlier this year, the Army fired an SM-6 missile from the mid-range capability. The launches occurred at undisclosed test sites.

The Navy uses the Tomahawk, an intermediate-range, subsonic, cruise missile to strike targets from 1,000 miles away and can switch destinations in mid-flight.

The Army eventually plans to field an MRC battery which will be assigned to a strategic fires battalion under a multi-domain task force. The battery’s prototype design consists of four launchers and a control center.

Soldiers contributed to the design and testing of the Mid-Range Capability weapon system, which the Army will use to augment its long-range, precision fires capability.

“From the start of the [Mid-Range Capability] program, Soldiers and Sailors have collaborated to provide the Army with this important capability,” wrote the Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. “Soldiers have consistently participated in each phase of the development, training and testing of the MRC and continue to provide useful feedback.”

The MRC system will eventually support the joint, multi-domain mission. The SM-6 missile can engage multiple threats including terminal ballistic missile defense, anti-air warfare and anti-ship strike roles.

Improvements by near peer adversaries in their long-range artillery systems present possible threats to U.S. forces. The Chinese military has leveraged unmanned aerial vehicles or UAV, to produce precision munitions and greater target acquisition.

The Army made long-range precision fires its top modernization priority to upgrade and bolster its artillery and missile systems while developing hypersonic weapons and long-range cannons.

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO CAMP BULLIS, Texas – U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers assigned to the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater), Military Intelligence Readiness Command, conducted a variety of military intelligence exercises and other training as part of Rapidly Engaged 23, July 8-28, 2023.

Exercise Rapidly Engaged 23 was the culmination of over a year of planning and preparation. It provided Soldiers the opportunity to refresh their military skills in a simulated deployed environment.

“This was a great opportunity for us to test our skills, work together, and learn in a safe but challenging environment,” said U.S. Army Reserve Col. Ronald Bahl, commander of the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “There are very real applications for all the training we conducted. It was important that we take this seriously and make the most of it.”

U.S. Army Reserve Col. Melissa Adamski, the Military Intelligence Readiness Command commander, visited Camp Bullis, Texas, where she was able to connect with Soldiers, engage, and review lessons learned with the participating units. It was a unique opportunity for the Military Intelligence Readiness Command to gather knowledge that will be used in planning future annual training events.

Bahl relinquished command of the brigade to U.S. Army Reserve Col. Frederick Turner at the conclusion of Rapidly Engaged. Col. Adamski presided over the change of command ceremony. “I am taking command of a great organization with great Soldiers ready to keep learning and improving their skills,” said Turner, incoming commander of the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater).

Turner has had a distinguished military career including both active duty and reserve time. He joins the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) after departing his previous post where he served as the chief of the Intelligence Security Cooperation and Engagement Division at U.S. Africa Command.

During the training exercise, Soldiers were put through various simulated situations. They had to perform their assigned duties to accomplish their mission. Soldiers were trained on intelligence tasks, maintenance operations, and combat casualty care.

Soldiers assigned to 383rd Military Intelligence Battalion (Theater Support) and Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) set up and maintained TROJAN based communications during the exercise. Working together, both units maximized their efforts and completed their mission objectives, giving them an edge for future training and real-world operations.

The realistic training environment facilitated the cooperation between the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater), U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), and the U.S. Army Northern Command (NORTHCOM) G2. Soldiers participated in synchronized intelligence, communications, and security operations intended to build future cooperative capabilities.

“It is incredible seeing the whole brigade coming together as one,” said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Broday Winton, a human resource specialist with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “Being able to function and operate as a team in an environment where you have multiple things going on at once and still completing all your tasks was a great feeling.”

A training highlight was the Combat Casualty Care Course (C4). 23 Soldiers participated and completed the 4-day long course.

“It was a great experience being able to get this quality training alongside my unit,” said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Ashley Bailey, a signals intelligence analyst assigned to the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “I loved how everyone was so willing to help, teach and mentor me on a broad set of topics I didn’t know a lot about.” This was Bailey’s first battle assembly and annual training with a reserve unit after returning from her 7 month-long advanced individual training (AIT).

Besides intelligence and training operations, mechanics put in effort to boost the overall readiness of the brigade’s equipment. “It was amazing seeing our maintenance Soldiers at the motor pool working hard every day,” said U.S. Army Reserve Capt. Jose Lucio, commander of Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “These Soldiers completed over 100 work orders during the exercise and were able to exponentially increase our overall readiness for future operations.”

The 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) is a multi-component unit that provides information and intelligence support to Army and joint forces to support the range of military activities in Northern Command's area of operations.",

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army combined the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center with the Australian Combat Training Centre for a one-of-a-kind collaboration during Talisman Sabre 23 in Townsville, Australia earlier this month.

The merged training center, led by Australia, tested nearly 10,000 troops from multiple partner nations during a 10-day field training exercise.

""Big exercises like this are where we can induce the fog and friction of stress,” said U.S. Army Col. Bryan Martin, Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center operations group commander. “[They are] the closest we can get to actual real combat on our respective combined forces, so that when that day comes, that they're trained and they're ready.""

The scenario called for the joint force to protect a chain of islands from an invading large hostile nation.

The enemy force, which was made up of service members from the participating countries, was given tasks and could make decisions to achieve their mission.

This allowed commanders to train their forces in a scenario and environment that could be encountered in the Pacific.

""This activity that's occurring here is just the richest, most immersive and most realistic, no-consequence training environment that we can possibly create,"" said Australian Army Col. Ben McLennan, Australian Defence Force's Combat Training Centre commander.

This was the first time the U.S. Army merged combat training centers with a partner nation.

Soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division combined with service members from Germany, Indonesia and Australia to form a task force under Australian command to expel the enemy force.

During the training, there was also a virtual portion. This allowed commanders to handle simulated battles, as well as having to deal with electronic warfare and cyberattacks.

“The Australian Army hasn’t participated in something of this magnitude since 1918,” McLennan said. “It’s energizing to be involved in an enterprise enabling the best of our teams to reach their highest performing potential.”

This was the third and final training rotation of the year for the JPMRC.

JPMRC was established nearly three years ago to provide realistic training opportunities for U.S. service members and partner nations in the Indo-Pacific. It’s the first new combat training center outside the continental U.S. in 50 years.

The center executes three training rotations annually, one in the terrains of the Hawaiian Islands, one in Alaska’s extremely cold weather, and one at a satellite location of an allied or partner nation in the region, such as Australia.

The rotations are run by the 196th Infantry Brigade, the training support brigade in the Indo-Pacific, with support from the 25th Infantry Division and the 11th Airborne Division. The training is a joint venture with participation from every U.S. military branch. There is also involvement from multinational partners including Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia.

Each exercise is built upon a multifaceted simulation. This system incorporates real-time feedback by employing virtual and constructive effects across multiple levels, which immerses participants in a comprehensive training environment.

“This allows us to keep trained and ready forces available and forward in the region,” said Gen. Charles Flynn, U.S. Army Pacific commander, during a media roundtable earlier this fiscal year. “It allows us to generate readiness in environments and in conditions that we’re most likely to operate in … It allows us to rehearse with a number of joint and multinational partners.”

Each fall, the team holds the first rotation of the year in Hawaii to train in jungle warfighting. They use the entire island chain with fictional battles taking place simultaneously in multiple locations.

The second rotation takes place in Alaska in the spring. This is an artic-focused training exercise. The final rotation is held in the summer at a satellite location like the one used during Talisman Sabre in Australia.

These joint service/multinational training rotations help strengthen partnerships and build on their combined defense capabilities.

""The landpower network is a key component in the security architecture that helps keep the Indo-Pacific region safe, free and open because it protects national sovereignty — something that’s very important to each of our allies and partners,” Flynn said. “The interoperability and close relationships we build while training together within the landpower network is a key advantage in competition and, if necessary, in conflict.”

CASS LAKE, Minn. - What started off as just another routine annual training event here quickly developed into something much more for one Army Reserve Soldier, who found herself on the front lines of saving lives in a real-world situation that she won’t soon forget.

“It was surreal, it was unexpected,” said U.S. Army Reserve Spc. Ana Baker, a healthcare specialist, assigned to the 399th Field Hospital, 803rd Hospital Center, 804th Medical Brigade, 3rd Medical Command.

Baker was here with her unit conducting a real-life medical assistance mission with the local civilian community providing no cost dental and medical care as part of an Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) mission. The IRT was part of Operation Walking Shield, a joint medical assistance operation with the Minnesota Army National Guard.

""The Innovative Readiness Training missions provide patient care to select communities within the United States,” said Capt. Jamie Eastman, company commander, 451st Medical Detachment, 405th Field Hospital. “They are not only a benefit to those communities in need, but also to the Soldiers who are involved in providing care by helping them to maintain proficiency in their medical skills.”

During the community mission, the Emergency Medical Services provider for the region offered ride-along shifts in their ambulances to the Soldiers who are healthcare specialists. This provided an opportunity for the Soldiers to gain civilian EMS experience in addition to performing their primary IRT mission.

“EMS ride-alongs and hospital clinical experiences are vital for ensuring proficiency of U.S. Army medical providers,” said Eastman. “Many National Guard and Reserve Soldiers have a civilian medical career to maintain proficiency, but not all have the capability. Training opportunities like this ensure Soldiers are ready to respond when the mission calls.”

It was on one of these ride-alongs that Baker’s otherwise normal day would quickly change into one filled with excitement and drama. “I was scheduled to go with the ambulance crew for a few hours that afternoon,” said Baker, who had never been in an ambulance before. “I had heard Soldiers who had gone earlier in the day talking about how it was boring and that nothing had happened, so I took a book to read expecting to have plenty of down time. About 20 minutes into the shift the EMTs (emergency medical technicians) got a call and they just said, ‘we gotta go’. I just thought, oh my goodness what is going on.”

Within moments the ambulance roared to life. With the siren blaring and emergency lights flashing, Baker and her EMS crew quickly made their way to the scene of a motor vehicle collision that had left a pregnant mother and her three young children in desperate need of emergency trauma care.

“I was riding in the back of the ambulance on the way there and I was nervous and excited and wondering what to expect,” said Baker. “I managed to put on my reflective vest and gloves and was just watching the EMTs and following their cues.

When we stopped, I could see a car that had ran off the road and had slammed into a tree backwards. There were several people already on the scene, and one of them, a bystander, handed me an 18-month-old boy, who had been involved in the collision. I took him into the back of the ambulance where I helped take his vital signs and assess him for injures.”

Soon another child from the accident would be brought into the ambulance as well. This time it was a two-year-old girl who had a large bump on her forehead.

Baker, who has a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications and psychology, spent the next hour on the scene with the children, doing her best to keep them calm and entertained while the responding emergency medical personnel called for a life-flight helicopter for the mother. Eventually the children would be treated and released to family members on the scene.

“It was an unfortunate situation, but it’s real life, and sometimes bad things happen in real life,” said Baker, a native of Jamaica. “I learned a lot from this experience. I saw how the EMTs approached the scene, how they interacted with the patients and young children and how they had a special approach to dealing with people in a situation like that to help them not only physically, but emotionally as well.”

Baker remembered how her Army medical training had helped prepare her for the stressful situation. “In our initial training we had a civilian instructor that would shout at us and really put a lot of added stress and pressure on us,” she said. “I see now why he did that. That added level of stress in my training helped me be calm during this real-life situation.”

Not only did those on the scene witness Baker’s calm demeanor and helpful medical expertise, but she also made an impression on her superiors.

""Spc. Baker is a passionate and motivated Soldier in our field hospital,” said Eastman. “Her drive and character were put to the challenge during this motor vehicle collision, where she was able to provide patient care in conjunction with the EMTs from the Leech Lake Ambulance. We are proud of her and the service she provided to the community.""

Looking to the future, Baker says she is hoping to get promoted soon, and is looking for an opportunity to deploy. “I want to deploy and see what that’s like,” she said. “While I’m serving in the Army Reserve I’ll continue to look forward to my annual training and just soak up as much information I can.”

She also plans to take additional classes to help her prepare for a future leadership role.

With her unit training complete and the incident now a memory, Baker reflects back on that incredible day. “I was in the right place at the right time,” she said. “It opened my eyes to a lot of things, and it’s an experience I’ll definitely remember for years to come.”",

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Army is working on a new Antiterrorism Strategic Plan that is scheduled to roll out this fiscal year.

The plan, which is being coordinated with the Department of Defense, will update policy, training, exercises and how the Army analyzes and shares information about terrorism.

“The threats we faced 20 years ago aren’t the threats we face today, nor are they the threats we will face in the future,” said Maj. Gen. Duane R. Miller, Army provost marshal general. “Our adversaries are constantly evolving with the use of technology to identify vulnerabilities. It’s through this strategic plan that we hope to address any vulnerabilities and any threats we may face in the future.”

The program will help put Army civilians, contractors, Soldiers and their families on common ground with the service’s antiterrorism goals and objectives moving forward, he added.

The Army’s Antiterrorism Division worked with multiple federal organizations, including the Department of Homeland Security, as they developed the antiterrorism program. This allowed them to share information on best practices and emerging technologies that could pose a threat.

Training, education and awareness remain the key elements in the service’s efforts to prevent terrorism at home and overseas, Miller said.

“The more aware our community members are, the more likely we are to obtain advanced warning to defend against terrorist attacks,” he said. “Constant vigilance, timely threat reporting, knowledge of antiterrorism prevention measures and Army leadership advocacy are vital to sustained prevention.”

August is dedicated as Antiterrorism Awareness Month to educate members of the Army on the threat and provide information on how to prevent acts of terrorism.

“Soldiers who are aware of the risks and who report concerning behavior can help prevent threats from impacting the local community,” he said. “Don’t be a bystander. Do your part as a member of the team.”

According to Miller, the fight against terrorism has shifted in recent years from terrorist groups overseas to individual domestic terrorists fueled by extremist ideologies.

To combat the evolving threat, the Army has updated the antiterrorism program and continues to look for ways to improve protection efforts. The service is continuing to field and expand the capability of the Joint Analytic Real-time Virtual Information Sharing System.

JARVISS is a desktop and mobile application that pulls information from more than 80,000 sources to give commanders real-time data on potential threats, so they can make informed decisions.

Along with advances in technology, the Army and the National Guard continue to conduct annual exercises to stay ready. The Ohio National Guard held their emergency response exercise in April with support from local emergency services.

The exercise evaluated how the responding agencies can affect control and containment of the situation as well as the effectiveness of the facilities’ response capabilities.

National Guard units from 12 states along with multiple federal and local agencies completed an emergency response exercise at the Anchorage Fire Department Fire Training Center in June. The training is designed to maintain readiness, validate response procedures and collaborate with partners.

These efforts, along with others throughout the service, allow the Army and local partners to stay vigilant in the fight against terrorism.

“We must understand the threat and be prepared to prevent any impact on Army readiness,” Miller said. “We’re confident the outcomes from implementing the strategy will align policy, training, doctrine, partnerships and information sharing to meet the challenges of terrorism over the horizon.”

Army personnel can report suspicious behavior to their chain of command or submit a report online through INSCOM's iSALUTE form.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than 30 U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group (NE-MARSG) and the Western Medical Area Readiness Support Group (WE-MARSG) downtrace units, Army Reserve Medical Command; have been sent to the National Capitol Region (NCR) in support of the NCR Low Density Medical Skills Sustainment Training, August 6-19, 2023. Additionally, a subset of U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers under 807th Medical Command (Deployment Support) and 3rd MCDS echelons have joined their AR-MEDCOM brethren to augment the mission.

Also known as the NCR 68-Series operation, the NCR LDMSST is a twelvefold and collaborative effort between the three aforesaid USAR medical commands to provide medical caregiver, laboratory, and logistical support to Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, the DiLorenzo Pentagon Health Center (DPHC) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).

""The mission of the AR-MEDCOM Soldiers is for them to backfill on shortages that the training facilities have, which is very large,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Master Sgt. Dexter Hilliman, the senior logistics noncommissioned officer of the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group (NE-MARSG), Staten Island, New York; and the coordinator/noncommissioned officer-in-charge of the National Capitol Region 68-Series operation. ""With all of these (Military Occupational Specialties) being available, and from the two or three training meetings that we have here, they gave us a list of MOSs and the amount of Soldiers that they help with. We were able to fill 80 percent of that on our first rotation, and we will fill over 90 percent on the second rotation because we have a lot more Soldiers that came in than the first rotation.""

U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Alex Steward, a combat medic assigned to the 7457th Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Richmond, Virginia, said that although he has civilian job experience in emergency room settings, the real-world training environment in the DPHC presented him with new insights.

""As a junior-enlisted Soldier, it helps humanize some of the upper-ranking people,"" Steward said. ""Before here, I had very little experience with high-ranking officers and high-ranking senior enlisted. So to be able to take care of them is a lot more helpful to make me be able to understand that they are also people. I mean, they have rank and they have been in the military longer than I've been alive, but it is good to be able to (get) experience and talk to them.""

In adherence with the ""tough, realistic training"" doctrinal mantra of the Army Reserve, training participants attain the dual benefit of working in real-world environments whilst improving upon their knowledge and skill sets.

""What I like to call this mission is the National Capitol Region's strategic partnership,"" said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Dominic Payne, the deputy commanding officer of the NE-MARSG. ""When you call it a strategic partnership, that means that both sides are getting everything done better. And when we talk about realistic training, you cannot get more realistic than actually working at an (Military Treatment Facility), at a warehouse, or at a clinic providing support in whatever area that it might be to all of the components and probably the civilian or retiree personnel that go through those facilities.""

""That's as real world as it gets, and with the possibility of a large-scale military operation where we will probably be integrating with a lot of MTFs across the board, this type of partnership is going to be critical for us to be able to operate efficiently because we are going to get the most up-to-date training from MHS Genesis, and they'll be able to work those systems as well as any other logisitics systems that they have out there in order to do their mission,"" said Payne.

Despite the short-term duration of the Army Reserve medical Soldiers at the NCR training sites, their presence has nonetheless been a significant force multiplier to Active Component service members.

""This is 100 percent important for them to be here to look at our equipment and do maintenance on our equipment because without them, we cannot do anything,"" said U.S. Army Sgt. Cynthia Jarvi, an animal care specialist of WRAIR, Army Futures Command. ""We're going to be deadlined basically... and the animals would be in danger and the people would be in danger, so it is 100 percent important to have the (medical logistics specialists) around so we can get this equipment maintained and serviced properly. With them doing what they just did, that 100 percent makes our mission become even better.""

Lastly, Hilliman attributes a large portion of the mission actualization to AR-MEDCOM's Operations, Plans and Training (G-3/5/7).

""I have to thank the AR-MEDCOM G-3/5/7 for putting this together,"" Hilliman said. ""I will mention Maj. Quentin Stewart and 1st Lt. Knakita Cruz, as they were very, very instrumental in making this a success. No way that myself or my co-leader, Sgt. 1st Class Alexander Jordan, would have been able to do this on our own.""

“Contact! Contact!” Soldiers yell out to each other as they begin to take simulated fire from up the hill.

It is was part of a week-long training event for the 204th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade at Camp Williams, Utah. They call it “annual training,” but this is hardly routine. More than 250 Soldiers are involved to help get the 204th MEB ready for an upcoming mobilization to Africa.

To be ready, they have to get back to basics. That means lots of review and practice of squad tactics and individual Soldier skills.

“The Army identifies when you get mobilized what they want you to accomplish,” said Capt. Timothy Klase, the training officer for the 204th. “It's what we call the army warrior tasks and battle drills and that’s what we needed to do.”

Each Soldier had to complete around 70 individual tasks. They included operating a radio, applying a tourniquet, land navigation, and tactical movements. Soldiers participated in small group instruction, then demonstrated their ability to perform each task individually during the first two days of training.

“Then you compile all of those warrior tasks into battle drills that progress and build on each other,” said Klase. “You might start filling (programming) an individual radio on your own, then it will progress to utilizing that radio in a squad formation that's under attack.”

During training, the Soldiers encamped in an area called the “One Station Unit Trainer” (OSUT). The OSUT has a half a dozen classrooms, a bivouac area, and lanes to test Soldiers on their skills.

One of the lanes required squads to react to a near ambush. Lane observers gave each squad an order. Then the squad would organize and plan the mission according to what they had learned in the classes.

Most of the Soldiers participated last week to conduct five days and nights of intense training. The event, however, had been building for months.

“We started setting up six to eight months ago in order to develop the scheme of what the commander wanted,” said Sgt. 1st Class Ian Moffat.

Moffatt is a construction engineer with 189th Combat Arms Training Brigade, First Army. It’s an active duty unit based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord whose job is to train other units getting ready for deployment.

“The commander tells us exactly what his priority mission-essential tasks are and then we align that with the actual mission that the unit is going to do,” said Moffatt. “Once the commander agrees to it, we design training for the unit.”

In addition to classes for all of the individual tasks, the final plan included four combat scenarios, night driving, and land navigation.

During the land navigation lane, Soldiers were given a map and a compass and had to locate four unique points spread out across several square kilometers. They had to do it once in the daytime, and once again at night with low visibility.

Klase and Moffatt were part of a small team to develop the plan in its early stages. That team grew as the training date approached.

By the time of the training event there were around 70 Soldiers in support of those getting trained. Those getting ready to deploy were grouped into 15 squads, each with an officer and a noncommissioned officer in charge.

Every Soldier, regardless of rank, role, or experience, had to complete the same training before they can mobilize. It’s a way, say leaders, to ensure that everyone has mastered the basics.

“You just don't know what type of battle we're going to be in, so you have to really prepare for really anything and everything that comes your way,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Garrett Whatcott.

Whatcott is currently serving as the command sergeant major for the 625th Military Police Battalion, which is part of the 204th. He has deployed twice but said it’s always good for Soldiers to refresh their battle skills.

“These are perishable skills,” said Klase. “Some soldiers may have just done this last month at basic training but others of us haven't deployed in a while so it may have been 10 years since we last did this.”

Pvt. 1st Class Adan Patino is one of those Soldiers who had recently done it. A signal operations specialist assigned to the 217th Brigade Signal Company, he is only a few months out of basic training.

“Even though we are all assigned different [jobs] it's still important for us to know how to maneuver through any situation. So, we have to keep good skills in case we're needed out on the field,” he said.

The 217th is a subordinate unit of the brigade and will be deploying too.

“We’ll probably have to [set up retransmission stations] for our antenna out away from the base so it's important for us to know how to how to maneuver,” added Patino.

The 204th will join with Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), headquartered in the Republic of Djibouti.

“At the very bottom line we are Soldiers,” said 1st Lt. Laura Roberts, a cyber warfare officer assigned to the 204th. “If things hit the wall, then you know we will have to revert back to some of these basic tactics.”

Roberts was a squad leader during the week-long annual training.

“We might not be doing these specific things during our mobilization but it's good to know that we can support each other and be prepared to support the mission,” she said.

The brigade’s mission in Africa includes operations to enhance partner nation capacity, promote regional stability, and dissuade conflict.

CJTF-HOA is critical to U.S. Africa Command's efforts to build partner capacity to counter violent extremists and address other regional security partnerships, according to the task force website.

“The point of this is is when we go downrange the Army trusts that we're Soldiers first and that we can execute basic soldier tasks,” said Klase.

For many of the Soldiers, the battle training is as much about team building as anything else.

“These warrior tasks build the team so you can better prepare yourself to react to any type of situation that you may have,” said Whatcott.

While they were not in classes or on the training lanes getting evaluated, Soldiers spent time with their squads rehearsing movements and getting to know each other better.

“It’s just fantastic bonding,” said Roberts. “You know these people are going to be at your left and right downrange. “I couldn't have had a better squad so honestly they led themselves for the most part.”

“It's been a really good experience. It’s been a lot of one-on-one conversations a lot of training everyday just to prepare for when we're actually getting graded,” said Patino.

“Ultimately I want to be a member of a team too,” added Klase. “After I spent so much time on the training plan I had to hand it off to someone else to execute so I could be that member of the 15-man squad actually operating on the ground,” he said.

“It's a great team-building experience. We need this before we get deployed to build that team cohesion,” said Whatcott.

The 204th will continue training specific to the requirements of the Africa mission until the deploy next Spring.",

FORT BUCHANAN, Puerto Rico – The readiness of soldiers is essential to not only the unit but the U.S. Army Reserve as a whole.

Special events arranged by the 1st Mission Support Command help soldiers remain seasoned in their respective Military Occupational Specialty.

Lt. Col Heath Dickinson, Staff Sgt. Darian Vigo and Sgt. 1st Class Marangelie Ramos discuss the ""Operation Trazando Camino"" and why it is essential in the talent retention mission.

Staff Sgt. Vigo explained that the event targets all personnel wanting to further their careers. However, it focuses on those in excess positions in the unit manning report of their respective units.

""The purpose, first and foremost, is to provide career enhancement opportunities for soldiers in excess positions that don't have a clear career path,"" said Lt. Col. Dickinson. ""We're offering MOS reclassification opportunities to enable them to move into a MOS with upward mobility, and that they can pursue promotions.""

According to Lt. Col. Dickinson, the operation broadens noncommissioned officers' experiences by also offering broadening opportunities such as to become a drill sergeant, instructor, or controller trainer.

As Sgt. 1st Class Ramos stated, these broadening opportunities can provide other enhancement skill sets that will set soldiers up for success.

""We hope that it will lead them to consider broadening assignments, which helps them develop,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Ramos.

Lt. Col. Dickinson reveals that this will benefit the talent retention mission since they have one of the highest levels of volunteerism in the Army Reserves.",

WASHINGTON — The Army unveiled an engraving that honored the efforts of a Vietnam War veteran who led an inexperienced, outnumbered South Vietnamese company to victory nearly 60 years ago.

The service added Col. Paris Davis to the granite wall bearing the names of fellow Medal of Honor recipients at the National Museum of the U.S Army Wednesday.

“I am overwhelmed by what has happened today,” Davis said after the ceremony.

Davis’ actions in June 1965 not only assured U.S. forces a pivotal victory but prevented three American Soldiers from being captured.

President Joe Biden awarded Davis the Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony on March 3 and the Defense Department later inducted Davis into its Hall of Heroes March 6.

“It’s from your life … that this nation remembers you, honors you and owes you,” said Army Director of Staff, Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, who hosted the ceremony. “By making history, you have given peace to a nation that did not appreciate you nor appreciate the Vietnam War and from an Army that often did not see you as equal. And inside you weren’t equal; you were better.”

June 18, 1965, Davis, three Special Forces troops and a South Vietnamese company faced a large North Vietnamese force near Bong Son, Binh Dinh Province. Despite suffering several injuries, the 5th Special Forces Group armor officer continued to fire upon the enemy and engage in hand-to-hand combat.

Amid enemy rounds, then-Captain Davis rescued three injured U.S. Soldiers from enemy fire. Davis then refused medical evacuation and instead oversaw the transportation of the wounded troops.

“Throughout the day Paris Davis distinguished himself with bravery above and beyond what is humanly possible,” Piatt said. “Paris simply would not allow the enemy to win. He refused to fall and refused to let his team fall.”

Davis, one of the first Black Special Forces officers in the Army, continued to direct air and artillery fire upon the enemy. Davis’ efforts helped stop the South Vietnamese force from being overrun.

Davis thanked his friends, fellow veterans and family who stood by him until he received the nation’s highest military honor. The Army previously awarded him a Silver Star and Purple Heart.

“The power to do what you did is hard for even other Soldiers to understand,” Piatt said. “We admire your actions. The world has benefited from your deeds.”

In his remarks, Davis emphasized the importance of showing kindness and empathy to those who cannot help themselves or may be physically limited such as the disabled.

A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Davis attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He commissioned into the Army in 1959 and graduated from the service’s ranger and airborne schools in 1960.

Davis deployed first to Korea and then Vietnam in 1962 before being selected for Vietnam again in 1965. Davis went on to serve 26 years before retiring from the Army in 1985.

After the ceremony, Davis, his daughter, Regan Davis-Hopper, and his friends and family walked the garden grounds and looked upon his name and other recipients on the plaque.

This year’s NOVA conference consisted of nearly 100 different workshops where Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program professionals heard firsthand from subject matter experts who shared lessons learned and best practices.

NEW ORLEANS, La. – “This type of training conference is important for Army SHARP professionals because it expands our network and resources on a national level. When assisting Soldiers serving on active duty, in the reserve, and in the National Guard they are not always in one location,” said Sgt. 1st Class Joel Perkins, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, 157th Infantry Brigade. So being able to call upon a network of advocates whom we have met at the conference to help us in times of need is of great benefit to us.”

The Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program is designed to prevent the occurrence of sexual harassment and assault, provide victim advocacy to ensure prompt and sensitive care for victims, and encourage reporting of all occurrences by providing reporting options.

Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocates from across the U.S. Army attended an annual training conference hosted by the National Organization for Victim Assistance in New Orleans, July 31 – August 3, 2023.

NOVA is a nonprofit organization committed to the recognition and implementation of victim rights and services. In 2003 NOVA established the National Advocate Credentialing Program. Army SHARP professionals receive training certified by the NACP and are credentialed through the DOD Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program.

SARCs serve as a point of contact to coordinate sexual assault victim care. They track the services provided to victims starting from the initial report of a sexual assault and ensure that victims receive appropriate and compassionate care to overcome trauma.

The VA provides essential support and care to the victim to include providing non-clinical information on available options and resources to assist the victim in making informed decisions as they progress through resolution and healing. The VA maintains communications and contact with victim as needed for continued victim support.

“As Victim Advocates, we walk the victims through the process and ensure they have access to the resources they need. We put them on a path to feel like themselves again, and reclaim their voice,” said Sgt. 1st Class Stephanique Jones, Victim Advocate, 2-364th Training Support Battalion, 5th Armored Brigade.

Army SHARP professionals expressed the value of networking with the other approximately 2,000 victim assistance professionals in attendance at the event.

Staff Sgt. Chastity Caldwell, Victim Advocate, 3-313th Logistics Support Battalion, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, shared her thoughts on the value of the NOVA event.

“Attending this event allows us to meet with other professionals outside of the military who have had experiences that we might not normally encounter in our organizations. Connecting with those individuals provides us with knowledge that we might not have been taught in the Army schoolhouse and better prepares us to assist Soldiers in navigating them through those situations,” said Caldwell.

This year’s NOVA conference consisted of nearly 100 different workshops where Army SHARP professionals heard firsthand from subject matter experts who shared lessons learned and best practices.

“The face-to-face interaction with the presenters during the sessions has been fantastic. There is so much knowledge to draw upon, across a wide spectrum of topics, such as advocacy and trauma care,” said Sgt. 1st Class Leticia Rodriguez, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, First Army, Division West. “A venue like this gives you the opportunity to tailor your training to fit your interests and role. This training helps you build your knowledge base to be a better advocate and then teach others what you have learned here.”

Throughout the four-day training conference, Army SARCs and VAs emphasized the importance of seeking help for those who have been victimized.

“For Soldiers that have been sexually assaulted, more than anything else, seek council,” said Master Sgt. Alaine Latoya Gilpin, Victim Advocate, 4-409th Brigade Support Battalion, 4th Cavalry Multi-Functional Training Brigade. “Find the grit and courage to get the services you need. Do what feels most comfortable to you. For instance, the Army gives victims the option of restricted or unrestricted reporting. Some Soldiers do not feel comfortable informing their chain of command and having an unrestricted case, so Soldiers should use the options they feel are the best fit for them.”

Filing a restricted report allows Soldiers to confidentially disclose a sexual assault to a SARC or VA without notifying the command or law enforcement. Soldiers can change a restricted report to an unrestricted report at any time.

Filing an unrestricted report allows for an official investigation, command notification, and reporting to law enforcement. An unrestricted report can be made to a SARC, VA, law enforcement official, a commander or health care personnel.

Throughout the event, Army SHARP professionals further stressed that victims of sexual harassment and assault in the military have options for seeking help.

“Understand that you have the option go to any Sexual Assault Response Coordinator or Victim Advocate within the Department of Defense to get help. It does not matter what service the SHARP professional is with. We are all credentialed the same and we will take those reports and get the servicemembers the help that they need,” said Sgt. 1st Class John Sydnor, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, First Army, Division East. “If you don’t feel comfortable with the people where you are, then you can go to another place.”

If you are a victim of sexual assault in the military and need assistance, call the DoD Safe Helpline: 877-995-5247.",

WASHINGTON — While on his way to Australia for exercise Talisman Sabre 23, 1st Lt. Jared McCully, transportation officer with the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary), found out he was invited to a local black-tie charity event.

He, alongside a few other U.S. service members and an Australian counterpart, were to be guests at the mayor’s annual banquet.

The team had not come prepared for such an event.

“Of course, when you’re limited to what you can pack in your duffel bag, a tuxedo isn’t what you anticipate bringing,” he said with a laugh. ‘We didn’t want to offend anyone by declining the invitation because we realized we were the only ones to get the guest of honor invite.”

In the small coastal town of Bowen in northeast Australia, finding appropriate attire for everyone invited would prove challenging. That’s why McCully’s commander left it to him.

I’m known as the guy who deals with the unique challenges, he acknowledged.

He went to work and found out the closest place to rent what they needed was almost three hours away. With no time to lose, he and a few other Soldiers hopped in a car and made the successful journey.

Not long after, he was sporting his tuxedo and meeting members of the community.

“It’s one of those things, where you don’t think while doing a mission in a small town in Australia that you’ll get sent to the black-tie charity event,” he said.

This was just one event in what turned out to be an action-packed exercise that he won’t soon forget.

After graduating from the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps at Gettysburg College, Pennsylvania in 2019, the Canton, Ohio native knew he wanted to work with Army watercraft. This capability allows combat forces to move equipment and sustainment supplies from sea to shore.

He specifically sought out the 7th Transportation Brigade and has worked there since joining the Army. For the last year, he has been in the role of port location analyst.

He goes to desired training locations months in advance and scouts to see if the area’s infrastructure and community support are compatible for joint logistics over-the-shore.

JLOTS is an operation that allows vehicles and equipment to move from sea to shore in remote environments that don’t offer port access. It gives the Department of Defense a way to continuously provide support and sustainment for troops over a long period of time.

“I see logistics over-the-shore as being a very essential program for the DOD,” McCully said. “This is going to be one of those tool sets that provides us with the adaptability to access places that not many other forces in the world have access to and to also sustain ourselves.”

Planning for the JLOTS operation at Talisman Sabre 23 started almost 14 months ago. After working with the Australian Defence Force, talking with subject matter experts, and having U.S. Army divers survey the possible locations, the team received approval to conduct operations at Kings Beach in Bowen.

McCully and the team working JLOTS arrived in Australia weeks before the kickoff of the exercise. They quickly started setting things up.

JLOTS is a 24/7 operation with the crews working in 12-hour shifts. Much of the work is done at sea when weather permits. The team must receive the equipment, label it and prep it for the move.

“There is a lot of work being done behind the scenes,” he said.

Being one of the senior members of the operation, McCully, who is also the JLOTS project manager, is often tasked with helping solve problems as they arise. He is also the one who gets to brief and escort distinguished visitors to explain the operational capabilities.

“Most people don’t know what Army watercraft are,” he said. “Trying to get stakeholder buy-in and support from external organizations has been one of my key focuses during this exercise.”

He met with community leaders, U.S. and Australian senior military leaders, congressional staff and Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth.

Prior to the secretary's arrival, McCully learned he would be promoting to captain and saw the dates would coincide with the visit. He connected with her team to see if she would lead the ceremony for him and other service members promoting or reenlisting.

She agreed, and they worked it in as the culminating event of her time at JLOTS.

“It’s one of those fun stories that I’ll get to tell for the rest of my life,” he said.

McCully not only engaged with senior leaders during the exercise, but also with the local community. U.S. service members participated in several community engagement events while in Australia.

They visited local schools, community job fairs and attended the occasional banquet. These engagements provided opportunities to build strong bonds with the community and Australian partners.

“This has probably been one of the best training areas we have ever been to,” he explained. “I want [the community] to have a positive impression of us. We’re not here to take advantage of the resources. We’re here to call this a second home for a little while, even if it’s just for a few months.”

McCully said he made lasting memories while exploring Australia and working with his teammates to display the JLOTS capability.

After more than a month of preparation and days of execution during the exercise, the team was able to bring equipment ashore using a causeway ferry. The harsh weather conditions prevented the team from using their preferred method of a trident pier, an 1,800-foot floating bridge that connects ship to shore.

“It’s not every day the mission you’re doing is arguably the most important mission in the Army,” he said. “Expeditionary logistics is not designed to be easy, but we are here with our partners to take on a mission many would shy away from.”

That event was the culmination of more than a year of planning and weeks of work for McCully and the team. The job he accomplished during that time did not go unnoticed by those around him.

“Jared was instrumental to the success of the JLOTS mission across a variety of facets,” said Col. Samuel Miller, commander, 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary). “From the early stages of operational planning, to coordinating with stakeholders on numerous key leader visits, Jared took the initiative far beyond what you would expect of a junior officer.”

Now, as the exercise ends, planning will start for the next JLOTS in the Indo-Pacific in 2024.

CAMP ATTERBURY, Ind. — Approximately 160 U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from the 7212nd Medical Support Unit, Rochester, Minnesota; the 7215th Medical Support Unit, St. Louis, Missouri; and the 7405th Troop Medical Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota performed medical and dental validation for active duty, National Guard, and Reserve component Soldiers that took part in Mobilization Exercise Level III, or MOBEX III, as part of Operation Pershing Strike 2023 in Camp Atterbury, Indiana, July 10 to August 5, 2023.

MOBEXs are annual training exercise of varying levels to assess all Mobilization Force Generation Installations and their capabilities in deploying troops en masse.

""What we are training for currently is for in case we have a large-scale mobilization operation, or LSMO,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Arvie Webster, a family nurse practitioner assigned to the 7453rd Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Mesa, Arizona, and the officer-in-charge of the Army Reserve medical task force.

""So, if we have to deploy a bunch of forces all at once, we got to make sure that they are medically cleared as well as hitting these other training points, whether it is training that they going to do when they are deployed and also getting them ready and their families ready,"" said Webster.

Despite just three days of reception, staging, onward movement and integration, Soldiers from both MSUs and the TMC processed and supported the large-scale influx of active duty, Guard and Reserve Soldiers prior to and during their MOBEX III engagements.

""We also got 1,500 Soldiers through the soldier readiness processing portion, medically and dentally ready,"" Webster said. ""The troop medical clinic also saw over 275 Soldiers. What (U.S. Army Medical Command's) standard is that they want to make sure that we can get at least 40 Soldiers in an hour through soldier readiness processing, but what we've actually done in this exercise is we exceeded that goal.""

Eric J. Holcomb, 51st Governor of the State of Indiana, officially recognized the 7212nd MSU's prodigious efforts in exceeding that standard.

""Some of the units were so impressed with the care that we provided that actually the unit was awarded the Indiana Commendation Medal,"" Webster said. ""So it was a huge success, this whole entire exercise.""

During periods of downtime, many of the medical Soldiers pursued cross-training opportunities and other learning experiences.

""When we only had one or two patients in the TMC, we would also do training with the providers for the different specialties that they had so we could get specialized training, and everybody loved it,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Ariel Yuzenko, a combat medic assigned to the 7239th MSU, Chattanooga, Tennessee and cross-level augmentee for the 7405th TMC.

""We did sutures one day, we did different types of IV on another day, and then different draws and injections. It was constant learning, and it made a big difference on how everybody here in the TMC enjoyed being here,"" said Yuzenko.

Although the medical task force is comprised of Soldiers indigenous to their units as well as cross-level augmentees, they nonetheless established and maintained unit cohesion throughout MOBEX III.

""For the most part, everybody worked well together,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Alicia Wheat, an automated logistical specialist assigned to the 7215th MSU. ""We were able to do all stations like dental, (automated neuropsychological assessment metrics), the medical portion, labs, immunization and periodic health assessments.""

Due to her positive experience in working with Army Reserve medical Soldiers, Wheat said that she is inspired to pursue military occupational specialty reclass into a practical nursing specialist.

""It's been honestly really wonderful to be here and actually have this experience and see how it works and see what I have in store once I actually reclass,"" Wheat said.

Lastly, Webster said that the rapid-fire transition between the walk-crawl-run phases would have not been possible without the groundwork laid by Active Guard Reserve, or AGR, Soldiers involved in the planning and development process.

""A large component of this is our AGR Soldiers that are consistent for us, so even though leadership may change during yearlong planning, those AGR Soldiers are a constant and gave us the whole entire backbone to make this a successful operation,"" Webster said. ""AGR Soldiers should have a huge shout-out to how much of an intricate role they play and how they lay the foundation work for us so we're able to go in and do our jobs.""

""If you think about all of those different Soldiers from all different areas, and how they were able to flow together and make such a successful mission, it's amazing. It just shows the dedication and professionalism and the subject matter experts and knowledge that they bring with them,"" Webster said.",

WASHINGTON — A panel of Army senior leaders will select 12 Soldiers and civilians to learn the intricacies of cyber strategy and policymaking.

As part of the service’s broader effort to retain and recruit its top talent, the first annual Secretary of the Army’s Cyber Strategic Seminar will give participants the rare opportunity to receive exposure to top Army and government leaders.

The proposed activities in the nine-month session include meetings with officials from across the federal government, industry and academia, and practical exercises with Army senior leadership. The dozen finalists will also brief Army senior leaders at the conclusion of the program.

The seminar, jointly administered by Army Principal Cyber Advisor Michael Sulmeyer and Army Cyber Command commander, Lt. Gen. Maria Barrett, will also help identify and train the Army’s top talent in cyber security.

“What we're looking for is to develop leaders who have a particular aptitude for cyber-related issues,” Sulmeyer said. “And hopefully, they will use this program to increase their awareness and creativity around how cyber operations fit into multi-domain operations, [and] how cyber operations can inform operations in other domains.”

As the Army competes for top talent in cyber security, the seminar will showcase career opportunities in the field.

The Soldiers and Army civilians will discuss topics that include weapons systems security, intelligence support to cyber functions, the defense industrial base and acquisition support to cyber operations. Participants will gain an understanding of partnerships with foreign allies to defend and secure critical data, as well as meet with leaders in cyber security across government, the private sector, and academia.

The dozen selectees will include Soldiers in the grades of sergeant to sergeant first class, warrant officer 1 through chief warrant officer 3, and first lieutenant to major, and civilians GS-9 through GS-13. Finalists must have a minimum secret clearance and be available to attend all sessions of the seminar.

The group will meet monthly for a different activity planned by Army Cyber Command. The application period began last month and ends Aug. 11. The participants will be announced at the Association of the U.S. Army annual meeting in October, with the seminar set to begin shortly after.

The search will not be limited to individuals in cyber or tech-related positions. Soldiers and civilians in all military occupational specialties and career fields can apply.

“What we wanted to do is to identify the Army's top talent across enlisted [Soldiers], warrant officers and civilians and provide a way to broaden their exposure to strategic policymaking, to be able to take them to different venues,” said Sulmeyer, who previously served as senior policy advisor for U.S. Cyber Command. “Our hope is that [the seminar] is a tool not just to develop their careers and make them into even stronger Army leaders, but also to retain them in the force.”

Cyber and data centricity have increasingly become important factors in multi-domain operations. Secretary Wormuth has prioritized recruiting Soldiers with expertise in the field.

“[Secretary Wormuth] has placed such a premium on strategic recruitment and retention,” Sulmeyer said. “[The seminar] was a way that she thought the Army could lead in identifying our top talent and giving them exposure to strategic cyber issues.”

Interested Soldiers and civilians can apply at the Secretary of the Army's Cyber Strategic Seminar SharePoint. Candidates must self-nominate to apply but will need a supervisor endorsement if they are selected for an interview. Finalists will be selected based on an interview and written application.

By Capt. Carl Amolat, 1st TSC-OCP Safety Officer

During the 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command’s deployment in Kuwait, the Safety Office of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command Operational Command Post noted an uptick in sports-related injuries.

Several sports injuries involved overly ambitious physical training goals and wildly ambitious strength and conditioning plans as root causes. The saying “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” readily springs to mind.

Prior planning is that preventative measure. What goes into it is a realistic understanding of one’s capabilities, limitations, and environmental and work conditions. Factors such as age, injury history, sleep schedule/hygiene, acclimatization, and physical training history all play into developing the starting point.

Having established this starting point and knowing the desired goal makes planning for said desired goal a lot more accurate. This is where consistent and balanced effort over time comes into play. Sgt. Maj. Shannon Thornbury, 143d ESC Support Operations Sergeant Major, a kinesiologist in civilian life, has these focal points for balanced strength and conditioning plans:

Aerobic. The core of any fitness program should include some form of continuous movement. Examples include swimming, running, and dancing.

Strength. These exercises help increase muscle power and strength. Examples include resistance training, plyometrics, weightlifting, and sprinting.

Calisthenics. These moves are usually performed without gym equipment using large muscle groups. They’re done at a medium aerobic pace. Examples include lunges, situps, pushups, and pull-ups.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT). This type of exercise includes repetitions of short bursts of high-intensity activity followed by low-intensity exercises or rest periods.

Boot camps. These are timed-based, high-intensity circuits that combine aerobic and resistance exercises.

Balance or Stability. These exercises are designed to strengthen muscles and improve body coordination. Examples include Pilates, tai chi poses, and core-strengthening exercises.

Flexibility. These exercises help muscle recovery, maintain range of motion, and prevent injuries. Examples include yoga or individual muscle-stretch movements.

It is possible to combine one or more of these areas in a training session, i.e., purely aerobic work such as 10-20 minutes of swimming following a strength training session without overstraining. However, This requires some experience and being aware of one’s limitations.

It seems contradictory to intentionally look away from the type A personality impulse to precisely do that. However, an injury that either sends a Soldier home early or puts that Soldier on a limited duty profile for a lengthy period is ultimately not a prudent risk.

It may be frustrating, and daresay discouraging, to watch younger, stronger, and fitter Soldiers move heavier weights, run faster, and play harder on the sports pitch. However, bear in mind it took a fair amount of consistency on their part to get to that point.

Suppose one is starting from a previously sedentary lifestyle before mobilization. In that case, it will be a recipe for injury to copy training programs used by the more athletic Soldiers previously mentioned.

It requires a certain degree of self-discipline to train consistently, day in and day out, and trust the training process without a bit of envy of more physically capable peers. But consistency gets sustainable results and avoids or mitigates injuries. Small, continuous improvements add up over time.",

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait -- “Maximum disclosure, minimum delay.” Like a prize fighter sparring in the gym, this is something that is pounded into service members studying to become public affairs mass communication specialists at the Defense Information School to remind themselves to provide the American public unclassified information about the U.S. Military and its activities. Aiding the public affairs office, unit public affairs representatives (UPAR) are non-public affairs Soldiers identified to increase public affairs (PA) capability across the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility (USCENTCOM AOR). On July 25, 2023, U.S. Army Central (USARCENT) public affairs Sgt. Maj. Jeremy Bunkley held a UPAR Brief to inform UPARs of their responsibilities and capabilities, at Camp Buehring, Kuwait.

“Due to the distributed nature of forces throughout the CENTCOM AOR, the role of the UPAR is imperative in assisting higher echelon PA in telling the holistic public affairs and CENTCOM story,” said Bunkley. “Public affairs officers (PAOs) and noncommissioned officers (NCOs) are assigned at the brigade level and higher. Because of this, the role of the UPARs is extremely important at the battalion level and lower, as they serve closely with battalion commanders as lower-level subject matter experts on PA plans and policies, gather video and photography to create public affairs communication products, and conducting media opportunities at the battalion level.”

Army Regulation 360-1 defines the PA Program as the guide to conducting public communication strategy for information, command information, leader engagements, and community outreach activities directed toward both the external and internal publics with interest in the Department of Defense. PA policies and principles apply across the range of military and peacetime operations and states the guidelines for UPARs.

UPARs serve closely with battalion commanders as lower-level subject matter experts on PA plans and policies on embedding the media, engaging the local media, and conducting media opportunities at the battalion level. Commanders appoint a UPAR to any unit that is not supported by a designated public affairs officer.

“During my time in public affairs, our field has constantly been understrength,” said California Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Lani Pascual, the public affairs operations NCO, assigned to 40th Infantry Division, Task Force Spartan. “UPARs make a huge impact by augmenting our collective efforts. They are the on-ground experts who are embedded and can cover their unit's missions.”

Pascual added that the PA mission is information-based and to be successful they must connect to Soldiers and glean their stories. UPARs can share the experiences of the Soldiers they serve with that the public affairs office may not have the opportunity to know.

Prior to being appointed a UPAR with 642nd ASB, Spc. Courtney Scholl, a human resources specialist and UPAR, assigned to HSC, 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, had not used a professional camera but was happy with the opportunity and personal growth that she found.

“I had never done something like this before,” said Scholl. “This was my first time using a professional camera and taking photos. I soon began to enjoy this extra duty that I had along with my everyday tasks. As the UPAR for my battalion I hope to broadcast all that Soldiers are doing in hopes for other people to understand what Soldiers do, their impact on the mission and the Army as a whole.”

Army Reserve 1st Lt. Larry Subramanian, a transportation officer assigned to 382nd Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, wanted to attend UPAR training because he wanted to share the experiences of his unit with like-minded Soldiers.

“I witness great work achieved by the CSSB team to support our units daily,” said Subramanian. “UPARs give us an opportunity to provide to our higher commands, allies, families, friends and the American taxpayer exposure to our day-to-day work and we are appreciative of what they do.”

USARCENT operates under the values that people, partnerships, readiness, and innovation are the best way to sustain and improve the operational practicality that leads to mission success.

“Ultimately, teamwork and information sharing are key,” said Bunkley. “…especially for the Soldiers who are new to the UPAR responsibilities. We wanted to bring them together to share the USARCENT commander’s public affairs campaign plan and discuss the ways in which they can best support that and their own commander’s communications objectives. This is an important additional duty, and we want them to know that as public affairs practitioners, we are here to help them succeed… this was a great turnout, and it shows how important winning in the information environment is to our commanders across the USARCENT footprint.”",

CAMP ATTERBURY, Ind. – It’s a recipe for cooperation when active Army, Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers train together in a challenging environment. Add some Indiana heat and you have Pershing Strike.

“Pershing Strike is a yearly exercise that’s led by U.S. Forces Command and executed by First Army. It’s really to test the Mobilization Force Generation Installation’s ability to conduct large scale mobilization operations in support of large-scale combat operations, “said Col. Troy Mills, Commander, 157th Infantry Brigade, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “The active and reserve component bring in expertise in their fields based on Military Occupational Specialty or branch, as well as being the subject matter expertise for that MOS. We provide that relevant training to the National Guard and reserve component units as they come through Camp Atterbury.”

One of those units is the Kentucky National Guard’s 2113th Transportation Company based in Paducah, Kentucky.

“We made it through the train ups and evaluations here at Camp Atterbury as a more cohesive team,” said 1st Lt. Hope Smith, Company Commander, 2113th Transportation Company, Paducah, Kentucky. “Probably the most effective training the unit received was the convoy training.”

Convoy training was one of the training opportunities Soldiers conducted and were evaluated on, under the watchful eyes of the observer coach/trainers.

“We will be checking on safety. Making sure everything is safe,” said Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Nicodemus, OC/T, 1-290th Transportation Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “One of the biggest things is that Soldiers know how to conduct proper reporting procedures and make sure they have the correct protective equipment before they go on the convoy.”

Before the convoy left, Nicodemus checked on communications between the trucks.

“If they don’t have communications, that’s a concern to me,” he said.

Part of the training focused on dealing with civilian protestors.

A Soldier who participated in the convoy, Staff Sgt. Brent Cope, 88 Mike, Truck Driver, 2113th Transportation Company, Paducah, Kentucky, said the training provided Soldiers with a shift in thinking about how to react to protestors that they might encounter.

“One of the key factors is everybody has the mindset that we’re still in Iraq and Afghanistan. When we were briefed on the convoy, we were told to treat the protestors like civilians,” said Cope. “Be kind and polite and treat them like neighbors, not (threats). Know the country you are going to be in. Customs and courtesies go a long way.”

“It’s all about getting (repetitions) and sets before they get into theater. The Soldiers are getting the opportunity to haul supplies,” said Col. Timothy Starke, G-3, Kentucky National Guard, Paducah, Kentucky. “It’s great to be able to do it at Camp Atterbury. We see Pershing Strike as a great opportunity for our unit to be validated here. As part of the foundations of training, the most important units are led by staff sergeants. They need reps on communications and Soldier skills. We must be able to operate de-centralized.”

Helping Soldiers identify areas for improvement and maintain good practices is the job of the OC/T.

“We are not here to point out their flaws. We are here to have them self-identify. What we mean by self-identify is to learn how to do better and succeed in the mission,” said Staff Sgt. Jessica Ecker, OC/T, 2-338th Training Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “It’s also to identify what they did well and continue to include that in the mission.”

Ecker, a medical logistics Soldier with 14 years of Army Reserve service, values her role as an OC/T.

“I like being an OC/T because I’m integrated with so many different military occupational specialties. It helps me grow as a Soldier,” Ecker said.

Army Reserve Soldiers assigned to the 157th Infantry Brigade conducted annual training while operating as support elements to Pershing Strike. They practiced skills such as firing the 50 Caliber machine gun.

“I’m firing the 50-caliber machine gun for the first time,” said Sgt. Devon Diel, 25 uniform, Systems Support Specialist, 3-411th Logistics Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “I’m working with my assistant gunner who lets me know where the targets are and how to adjust my weapon.”

Spc. George Cooper, 91 Bravo, Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic, 3-411th, (LSBN) Camp Atterbury, Indiana helped feed the ammunition and assisted Diel with targeting.

“It’s fun to shoot. The range instructors give us guidance on how far out the target is and how to adjust fire,” said Cooper, who served four years on active duty and is completing his first year as an Army Reserve Soldier.

“It’s an adjustment being an Army Reserve Soldier compared to active duty,” Cooper said.

Soldiers also practiced land navigation using a magnetic compass.

“It’s good Soldier training. It’s a relief from paperwork and meetings. It’s nice to do something fundamental,” said Capt. Robert Duncanson, Assistant S-3, 3-338th Transportation Support Battalion, Blacklick, Ohio. “As an OC/T unit, it is essential to be solid in the fundamentals in order to give good feedback to the units we are training.”

Duncanson, a public affairs student at Ohio State University, touched on what his service is like in the Army Reserve.

“What I really appreciate is the camaraderie and professionalism of the Army Reserve Soldiers that I work with,” said Duncanson. “It’s reassuring to have so many leaders who can work independently and accomplish a task on short notice.”",

Gen. Ronald Blanck, left, pins on brigadier general rank on Mack Hill, center, during a promotion ceremony.

WASHINGTON — More than 50 years ago, former Surgeon General Ronald Blanck received a harrowing introduction to the Army.

Then a young military physician, he deployed to the central highlands of Vietnam in September 1968, treating Soldiers on the front lines.

Blanck, like many of his peers at the time, volunteered for the mission in the days before the U.S. military began drafting young men to serve in the Vietnam War. During the conflict, Blanck focused primarily on preventative care: immunizations and vaccinations.

“Vietnam kind of shaped my view of the military,” said Blanck, 81. “That loyalty, selfless service … it really meshed with the way I wanted to practice medicine.”

For 14 months Blanck treated Soldiers, sometimes tending to the wounded in the field in the Vietnamese towns of An Khê and Buôn Ma Thuột. He often had to adapt to the challenges of the environment.

Blanck, one of the first doctors of osteopathic medicine to serve in the Army, recalled one instance when members of a firing battery became ill from drinking contaminated water. He built a makeshift medical bay in the dining facility, setting up beds and inserting IVs into the arms of the Soldiers. He also treated the Vietnamese people for bubonic plague.

After Vietnam, Blanck completed his medical residency, that included time researching tropical diseases in Malaysia. Now board certified in internal medicine, Blanck decided in 1973 that he wanted to make the Army a career.

In the three decades that followed, the native of Ephrata, Pennsylvania would rise to numerous leadership positions including commanding Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and eventually becoming the Army’s 39th Surgeon General from 1996-2000.

Blanck, who retired as a lieutenant general in 2000, recently reflected on the evolution of the Army Medical Corps, which celebrated its 248th anniversary Thursday. He said that the Corps has shifted from a physician-centric focus to an emphasis on the collective efforts of the nurses, medical technicians, pharmacists and social workers. The Army Medical Corps includes 4,000 physicians that specialize in various disciplines in clinical, research and operational medicine.

“The physician is critical to most of the care provided, but does so now as a contributing part of the team, listening to others in the team, and together coming up with the best solution for a patient,” Blanck said. “That's the evolution going from a medical corps being physician centric to now much more of a team effort. Someone once told me, medical care today is a team sport.”

While the Army’s Medical Corps and military medicine cover trauma, orthopedics, and intensive care, one aspect of its services often gets overlooked. Blanck said preventative care, like the services Blanck provided to Soldiers in Vietnam, plays a critical role in disease prevention.

“Trying to keep Soldiers … healthy to fight is the first and foremost and part of our job,” he said. “And it’s to take care of those who are injured or wounded. So it’s evolved into something that really takes all of use working together.”

At Walter Reed, one of the nation’s largest military medical facilities, Blanck founded a Gulf War veteran’s treatment center built in 1993 specifically to treat Gulf War Syndrome, an unknown illness that causes muscle and joint pain, dizziness and memory lapses. The facility later became a deployment health center.

“We would work with people and say, ‘Hey, we know you're sick; we acknowledge it; we don't know what it is. Now, let us help you deal with your symptoms, pass the PT test,” Blanck said. “That was a monumental effort and meant a lot of people could continue to function instead of having depression, sitting at home or being discharged from the military.”

Blanck became the first assistant dean of students at Bethesda’s Uniformed Services University, an institution chartered by Congress, and he also held teaching positions at Georgetown, George Washington and the Howard School of Medicine.

As chief of Army Medicine at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, where each of the medical residents he trained successfully passed their board exams. In addition to serving as a resident at Walter Reed, Blanck also commanded both the U.S. Army Berlin Hospital and the Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center.

After his appointment as the Army’s highest ranking medical officer, Blanck instituted changes that still influence Army medicine today. He made education and medical training a higher priority and assured that qualified physicians and doctors were appointed to critical positions in the field. During Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, the Army saw even greater emphasis on readiness and training.

Blanck redefined the area of responsibility of the Office of the Surgeon General and opened the position to more career fields, allowing nurses and others the opportunity to eventually serve as surgeons general. In 2012, then-Lt. Gen. Patricia Horoho became the first nurse and first woman to serve as surgeon general.

Blanck also started what would become an eight-year process for the then 91B combat medics to become 68W combat medic specialists, resulting in better trained and highly skilled medics. Under the new military occupational specialty, all 68W medics qualify as emergency medical technicians and received training in advanced airway skills. Combat medic specialists now must recertify every two years to keep themselves MOS-qualified.

Retired Army Medical Command Sgt. Maj. Walt Scott said Blanck created a welcome workplace during his time as surgeon general. Blanck approved an enlisted master’s program, allowing senior non-commissioned officers the opportunity to attend graduate school.

“Lt. Gen. Blanck is a leader that was always forward-thinking, approachable, has a wildly great sense of humor, and [was] a professional that always has time for you,” Scott wrote. “Lt. Gen. Blanck created an environment where Soldiers and employees would run to him, not away.”

Blanck closed some hospitals while retaining the same number of staff, he said. Blanck added more medical personnel to larger hospitals including what is now Fort Liberty, North Carolina and Fort Moore, Georgia.

“We were running hospitals where they should have been clinics, and we were running clinics where there was no justification for having … care available,” Blanck said. “So I closed some hospitals, downsized some others, not people, I kept the same number of people.”

“You need to have patients coming into our facilities for us to take care of them, which is how we stay current; how we continue to practice and [be] ready for deployment,” he said. “And if you don't have those patients, then you're not training for deployment. You're not emphasizing readiness.”

During his tenure as Army surgeon general, Blanck worked closely with the surgeons general of the Navy and the Air Force and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs to establish lifetime TRICARE for veterans, including those over 65.

Blanck said that he remains against reductions in military medical care. He said cutting services at Army and military hospitals and treatment centers has sometimes sent patients to civilian care. Patients should be brought back to the direct care system, Blanck added.

FORT BUCHANAN, Puerto Rico—Standing in formation at an assembly hall filled with over 300 guests were the leadership and soldiers of the 166th Regional Support Group, 210th Regional Support Group, and the Caribbean Readiness Group, representing over 4,700 soldiers assigned to the 1st Mission Support Command.

Various distinguished guests were in attendance, including the Hon. Omar J. Marrero Diaz, the secretary of state of Puerto Rico; the Hon. Luz Arce, the former senator for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the Hon. Nellie Gorbea, the former secretary of state of Rhode Island.

As well as high-ranking officials such as Maj. Gen. (Retired) Felix A. Santoni, the emeritus civilian aide to the secretary of the Army for Puerto Rico, Brig. Gen. (Retired) Fernando Fernandez, the former 1st MSC commanding general, and Gen. Raul Rodriguez, the commander of the 103rd Sustainment Command, eagerly gathered to witness the exchange of leadership from one commanding officer to another in a traditional change of command ceremony on July 30, 2023.

For this occasion, the official party consisted of Maj. Gen. Robert D. Harter, the 81st Readiness Division commanding general, Col. Carlos M. Caceres, the 1st MSC outgoing commander; and Col. Carlos E. Gorbea, the 1st MSC incoming commander.

Once the sound of Ruffles and Flourishes was completed, Chaplain Capt. Farlin Reynoso led the invocation, bringing people of different faiths into a moment of reflection—afterward, the master of ceremony, Maj. Kathryne Iaccuzi recognized the devotion and loyal support of the 1st Mission Support Command soldiers and their families.

With ceremonial precision, 1st Sgt. Osvaldo Morales marched forward and requested permission to post the colors, to which Col. Caceres loudly responded: Post the colors!

With the color guard marching in perfect unison, the master of ceremony narrated the history of the 1st Mission Support Command, reminding the audience of the rich legacy of the federal organization.

Consequently, the official party stepped forward and rearranged themselves to initiate the transfer of authority. Command Sgt. Maj. Michael P. Meunier II passed the colors to Col. Caceres as his last official act as his command sergeant major.

In the same manner, Col. Caceres presented the colors to Maj. Gen. Harter relinquishing his command and showing gratitude for the opportunity to lead and serve the soldiers of the 1st MSC.

Finally, Maj. Gen. Harter passed the colors to Col. Gorbea, entrusting him with the responsibility and care of the command as the new commanding officer for the 1st MSC.

""By authority of paragraph 2-2D, AR 600-20, the undersigned assumes command of the 1st Mission Support Command, effective July 30, 2023,"" declared Maj. Iaccuzi. ""Signed, Carlos E. Gorbea, colonel, United States Army Reserve, commanding.""

The colors, now under Col. Gorbea's care, were passed back to Command Sgt. Maj. Meunier as a symbol of trust as he will now serve as the senior enlisted leader and advisor to him.

As the transfer of authority was completed, Maj. Harter approached the podium to deliver his remarks. He emphasized the milestone and relevance of the Army Reserve organization in the region.

""What do we have in the 1st Mission Support Command?"" Maj. Harter asked. ""Around 71 units, thousands of soldiers spread across Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands not only providing warfighting support in defense of the Nation but also, providing support during emergencies and natural disasters.""

Afterwards, Col. Caceres delivered his farewell speech, reflecting on the shared accomplishments and expressing profound admiration towards the 1st Mission Support Command and its members.

""Commanding the 1st Mission Support Command has been an amazing experience, and it is hard to say goodbye,"" said Col. Caceres. ""As the saying goes, times fly when you are having fun, and for Sonia (Col. Caceres' wife) and I, it truly feels like it was yesterday since we arrived because it has been a gratifying experience.""

Col. Caceres, a military intelligence officer, assumed authority of the 1st Mission Support Command on October 16, 2021. His awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary and Service Medal. He is married to Sonia Caceres and has two daughters, Veronica and Valerie.

Lastly, Col. Gorbea gratefully accepted the responsibility of leading the organization, highlighting his vision and commitment to fulfilling his commanding officer role.

""The 1st Mission Support Command has an honorable legacy hence moving on to the future, I would like to maintain its ability to provide combat-ready soldiers to deploy across the world,"" said Col. Gorbea. ""I believe the 1st Mission Support Command has much to offer the world.""

Col. Gorbea is married to Andrea Hermann, and they have two children, Stella and Rafael Gorbea. He was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He graduated from Princeton University in 1998 with a Bachelor Degree in Mechanical and Aerospatiale Engineering. He possesses a Master of Business Administration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Doctoral Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Munich Technical University.

WASHINGTON — Only 43 days separate the creations of the Continental Army that was formed by the original 13 American colonies and the Army Medical Corps. That short period of time speaks to the importance the corps plays in the mission of the Army.

Several current and former Medical Corps officers shared their thoughts on the corps, their careers and providing health care.

“Military medicine is invaluable to the security of this nation,” said retired Maj. Gen. Jeff Clark, former chief of the Medical Corps. “We in the Medical Corps are a part of an overall team that together is able to provide world-class health care.”

Since July 27, 1775, Medical Corps officers, previously referred to as surgeons, have provided a continuity of care to veterans, military members and their families.

Today, more than 4,000 physicians form a corps of 40 specialties in three main areas: operational, clinical and research medicine. These Soldiers do everything from surgery to vaccine research to delivering babies.

Helping service members bring new life into the world is where Lt. Col. Haroon Samar, family physician, got his start.

As a resident at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center on Fort Cavazos, he helped a young military family during the pregnancy of their first child. The couple trusted him so much they asked him again to help deliver their second son a year later.

“It was really an important time for me to be truly appreciative of the opportunity to be a part of such big moments in their lives,” he said. “I think those moments left an impression on me because I realized just how much trust these young families and these Soldiers put in me. I did my best to learn and grow from that and be as good a doctor as I could be.”

Army physicians go through years of medical school and training to take care of patients. The amount of work can be demanding, but can also fuel their passion.

“I loved everything about it,” said Lt. Col. Elizabeth Polfer of her time on surgery rotation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “The long hours didn’t bother me because I enjoyed everything I was doing.”

Medical Corps officers enter service at the rank of captain and can take many paths in their careers. They can stay in a specialty field or bounce around between different areas.

Clinical medicine provides care on military installations. Operational medicine supports Soldiers in the field, while academic and research medicine focuses on education, training and research at Army medical centers and laboratories.

This flexibility to pursue different avenues allows Medical Corps officers to gain valuable experience.

“I think that is what the Army continues to do and probably does better than any other job, is to just enrich you with job opportunities for growth development and leadership,” Samar said.

Medical Corps officers have made significant impacts on health care throughout history.

Maj. Jonathan Letterman started the first Ambulance Corps to help wounded Soldiers on the battlefield during the Civil War. Maj. Walter Reed led experiments in the early 1900s that discovered the link between mosquitos and yellow fever. During WWI and WWII, Maj. Gen. Norman T. Kirk organized new treatments for amputees.

In the early 2000s, retired Lt. Gen. James Peake led a study to improve battlefield survivability. The study showed most patients were dying before they reached a hospital from either blood loss or compromised airways.

The study led to increased general training and the creation of the Combat Lifesaver Course where Soldiers learn how to apply tourniquets and insert a common airway.

“Soldiers who receive CLS training are better equipped to provide critical medical care when it’s needed,” said retired Maj. Gen. George Weightman, former chief of the Medical Corps Branch. “Commanders can rest assured that their troops are prepared for any situation that arises.”

While advances in medicine and ways to treat patients continue to evolve, the basic function of the Medical Corps remains the same.

“The privilege of serving two professions simultaneously — arms and medicine — being patient-focused, knowing that’s why we are important to the team, does not change even though the world around us changes and what the Army is asked to do changes,” Clark said. “I think those fundamentals are enduring.”

The Army Medical Department consists of the Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, Medical Specialist Corps, Veterinary Corps, Army Nurse Corps, Army Dental Corps and the Civilian Corps.

These groups, along with Enlisted Medical Corps, work together as a team to deliver care to patients around the world.

“I came to Army Medicine because the Army gave me a chance to pursue a dream to be a doctor,” Samar said. “I’ve stayed for as long as I have because I got the chance to a part of a wonderful team. That has kept me in this long and I’ll continue serving because the Army continues to surround me with awesome people.”

The Army recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of TRADOC and FORSCOM. (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — This year marks 50 years since the founding of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and U.S. Army Forces Command.

“TRADOC today is not exactly like the TRADOC established in 1973, but throughout that time, the command has persevered as an organization and fulfilled its numerous missions — especially training” said Britt McCarley, TRADOC chief historian, who has been with the organization since 1988.

TRADOC and FORSCOM were founded during World War II as one organization known as the Army Ground Forces. When formed in 1942, the Army Ground Forces was the largest training organization ever established in the U.S. with 780,000 troops, which peaked at 12.2 million Soldiers by July 1, 1943.

After several reorganizations, Army Ground Forces finally settled into the two organizations they are today: TRADOC and FORSCOM. TRADOC and FORSCOM’s split 50 years ago came from a need to support two separate missions.

“TRADOC recruits and trains the next generation of Soldiers — develops adaptive leaders, helps modernize the force and shapes the culture of the Army. TRADOC was born out of innovation and that is still our mission today,” said Gen. Gary M. Brito, commanding general, TRADOC. Brito added that TRADOC provides institutional training throughout a Soldier’s career.

“TRADOC is improving our Army’s ability to fight and win large scale combat operations through the conduct of multi-domain operations.”

In addition to recruiting, training and education, TRADOC also establishes standards and drives improvement in the Army wherever it can. Whereas FORSCOM’s mission is to train and prepare the force to be globally responsive to build and sustain readiness for commander requirements.

“For me, the most rewarding part [of working for TRADOC] is the chance to be part of an organization that contributes to the common good of the United States,” McCarley said. “Defense of the nation is fundamental to the life of any country, and the opportunity to contribute to the larger American defense mission is the most rewarding part of my civilian service.”

On average, TRADOC trains more than 750,000 Soldiers and service members every year in its 32 Army training centers.

“I could not be more honored to serve with the dedicated team of civilian and military members, who support our Army mission every day,” Brito said. “But this 50-year anniversary isn’t TRADOC’s alone — it carries added significance to the Army as it is also the anniversary of U.S. Army Forces Command and the all-volunteer force. I look forward to our next 50 years and what the future has in store for our great Army.”

GEORGETOWN, Guyana – As the Caribbean-focused multinational exercise, TRADEWINDS 23, hits full stride in Guyana, a team of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and Dominican Republic instructors traveled by land and sea to various training sites to speak about humanitarian law, human rights and Women, Peace and Security (WPS).

SOUTHCOM Human Rights Coordinator, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jose Rodriguez said the promotion of human rights is a major objective of TRADEWINDS and the principles that the team covered was a crucial aspect to interoperability.

“Respect for human rights is consistent with democratic values, so we promote those values that unite us and strengthen our partnerships,” said Rodriguez. “We have common threats in our [region] and we have to face them bilaterally and multilaterally. Respect for human rights is a part of that interoperability.”

More than just a human rights training, TRADEWINDS is an annual SOUTHCOM sponsored, joint, combined, multinational and interagency exercise designed to strengthen partnerships and interoperability, increase all participants' training capacity and capability to mitigate, plan for and respond to regional crises and security threats.

Dominican Republic army Col. Juan Perez Richiez, instructor at the Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law School in the Dominican Republic, said in order to achieve these training objectives, it is necessary to have a mutual understanding of how to legally and ethically operate during peacetime and war.

“When we are talking about international humanitarian law, we are talking about the law of armed conflict, and that is something every soldier needs to know and needs to learn during peacetime,” exclaimed Perez. “So then, when he or she is at war, in combat, they know what they can or can’t do.”

Perez went on to say that he has been working in the field of human rights for over 20 years all across Central and South America and the Caribbean and said he has seen a positive change in the preservation of human rights.

“I really think teaching human rights is not only my obligation, but it’s one of the best things I could do with my life,” admitted Perez. “I’ve seen that many armed forces had no or very little prior knowledge of human rights, and after these trainings,…human rights have been preserved at another level.”

A common theme throughout the training was that equality is a crucial aspect of human rights, and the WPS initiative works to promote gender equality and increase the meaningful participation of women to prevent conflict and maintain peace.

SOUTHCOM’s Gender Advisor, Jennifer Typrowicz, said gender integration in defense forces is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do.

“The SOUTHCOM WPS initiative is a priority, and we implement some sort of WPS training in everything that we do,” affirmed Typrowicz. “We have seen [defense] forces in [the SOUTHCOM] area of responsibility start to include more women.”

Typrowicz came to Guyana for TRADEWINDS 21 to instruct WPS training for its inaugural inclusion in the exercise, and she has observed an increased awareness and effort from the Guyana Defense Force (GDF) to integrate women into more roles in their military.

“When I was here in 2021, I walked around and not many people knew what WPS was, and since then we’ve seen them change policies,” claimed Typrowicz. “They now have women that are able to serve at the border which wasn’t something that was happening in 2021.”

Typrowicz said she believes the leadership support is imperative to accomplish change, and the GDF Chief of Staff, Brigadier Omar Khan, confirmed his endorsement for more women involvement in the force.

Khan requested that SOUTHCOM hold a WPS training for the GDF senior leaders in the days before TRADEWINDS 23.

“Military leaders have to take a lead in women’s integration in the whole spectrum of governance, including the security force,” said Khan. “The WPS initiative has a correlation in that the more we behave as responsible men and shape our male youth, we will have a better society, and part of that is respecting women, understanding their needs, and how we need them whether in the public sector, the private sector or the security sector.”

According to Guyana Defense Force Maj. Jaime Castello, lead planner for TW23, this is the second time in three years that Guyana has hosted Tradewinds and there was a great national, regional and international effort put into ensuring the exercise came to fruition.

“Now, after months of planning, extensive coordination and tireless organizing we have finally arrived at this momentous occasion,” said Castello. “The planning committees, logistical teams and those involved have worked tirelessly to produce a plan … and design realistic scenarios that will challenge, inspire and foster growth among the participants.”

These plans will achieve the goals of the exercise as well as improve interagency interoperability according to the U.S. Ambassador to Guyana, the Honorable Sarah-Ann Lynch.

“The goal of this exercise is to improve the security responses of participating Caribbean nations and focus on skills building in interdiction, security and interagency cooperation,” said Lynch. “Participation of intergovernmental organizations such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Regional Security System, the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security, and Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency are especially crucial to the success of this exercise.”

The Tradewinds exercise has been held annually since 1984, only missing one year in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the goals of enhancing the collective ability of participating nations’ defense forces to counter regional threats and conduct humanitarian aid/disaster relief operations while developing strong relationships and reinforcing human rights awareness.",

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait – On June 15, 2023, Soldiers with Charlie Company (C Co.), 142nd Division Sustainment Support Battalion (DSSB), a unit subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade, conducted convoy training at Camp Buehring, Kuwait, utilizing a Reconfigurable Vehicle Tactical Trainer (RVTT).

RVTT is a system that enables, using electronic vehicles and weapons, within a simulated environment with a 360-degree virtual landscape. It allows Soldiers to interact with the simulated environment by utilizing electronic vehicles and weapons such as a .50-caliber machine gun and a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV), which the C Co. 142nd DSSB Soldiers utilized during their training.

Crews of three Soldiers—with one evaluator occupying the fourth seat in the HMMWV—utilized two available RVTT trailers to conduct the training while 1st Lt. Christopher Niarchos, commanding officer of C Co. 142nd DSSB, and Staff Sgt. Gregory Schwartz, the senior gunner with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 382nd Combat Support Sustainment Battalion, provided radio communications inside a nearby trailer simulating an operations center.

Niarchos served as the mission commander in the simulation, asserting that the training significantly honed his radio communications skills. He also expressed confidence in his company’s increased adaptability and readiness for future vehicle-related missions.

However, he was quick to credit Schwartz for significantly enhancing the effectiveness of the training program.

“Units need supplies, and transportation Soldiers are responsible for delivering those supplies,” Niarchos said. “If you are moving supplies, you need to be able to protect those supplies, and so it’s great to have help from someone with extensive experience in gunnery to help with training.”

Schwartz gave directions via radio to truck commanders, who then relayed the direction to the driver of the electronic vehicle.

Strong sergeants like Schwartz lead their teams toward mission success by instilling a culture that shuns the concept of failure.

Pvt. Brianna Meza, a motor transport operator with C Co. 142d DSSB, who served as a gunner during this exercise, said that the leadership at the training helped her emerge from the new experience of convoy gunnery with confidence in her ability to communicate effectively with her crew and protect the convoy.

Guidance was not solely confined to the ranks of the mission commander and senior gunner but resonated through all team levels.

Leadership and mentorship extended to the participating Soldiers long before the gunnery training.

Staff Sgt. Michael Barrientos, a motor transport noncommissioned officer with C Co. 142nd DSSB, who served as his crew’s truck commander, recounted his mentorship of a junior Soldier in his unit, Pvt. Shane Merrigan.

Barrientos played an instrumental role in guiding Merrigan toward a more collaborative approach to his tasks. This evolution unfolded gradually, with Merrigan’s transformation becoming increasingly evident throughout the training.

During this specific exercise, Barrientos observed a notable change in Merrigan’s approach. Merrigan embraced collaboration and emerged as an integral part of the crew, a testament to his growth and Barrientos’ successful mentorship.

Strong sergeants, such as Barrientos, prioritize comprehensive readiness, encompassing not only their troops’ physical and mental well-being but also their gradual development into collaborative team players through dedicated mentorship and guidance.

Strong sergeants, of course, make strong Soldiers.

Merrigan articulated the core tenets of leadership intrinsic to his role as a gunner, emphasizing that his top priority is to ensure the safety of his crew and the convoy.

“I need to make sure that whatever cargo we are delivering, or whatever personnel we are delivering, is safe,” Merrigan said. “And so it is my job to keep my eyes open—stay alert, stay awake and keep everyone safe.”",

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait -- The 369th Sustainment Brigade (SB), Task Force Hellfighter, cased their colors, and the 371st Sustainment Brigade (SB) uncased their colors during a transfer of authority (TOA) ceremony at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, July 3, 2023.

The ceremony signified the end of the duties and responsibilities of the 369th SB, New York Army National Guard, commanded by U.S. Army Col. Seth Morgulas, and the assumption of those duties and responsibilities by the 371st SB, Ohio Army National Guard, commanded by Col. Michael Burgett.

In attendance were distinguished guests U.S. Army Reserve Brig. Gen. Maria Juarez, deputy commanding general of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command - Operational Command Post and Command Sgt. Maj. Ricardo Saunders, command sergeant major of the 143rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command.

Juarez, conducted the transfer of authority ceremony.

Juarez said that Morgulas and Command Sgt. Maj. Curtis Moss, the senior enlisted advisor of the 369th SB, achieved repeated mission success in the complex United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) area of responsibility with successful command of 2,800 Soldiers spread across 32 locations.

“The Hellfighters significant achievements and numerous and seemingly endless showcase of an impressive skillset and endless dedication will without question have a lasting impact on the future of our partners in securing their borders, deterring aggression and stabilizing the region,” Juarez said.

The 369th SB provided command and control of five direct reporting battalions, achieving mission success while running dynamic distributed mission command in support of Combined Joint Task Forces - Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Spartan Shield.

Morgulas said that while the Hellfighter Soldiers who served in Kuwait from late 2022-2023 did not endure combat conditions comparable to the original Hellfighters—where Sgt. Henry Johnson fought against a German raiding party during World War I—but none the less planned, coordinated and executed missions that made history.

“I’ve been assigned to many units and worked with many great teams during my 31 years of service, but I’ve never worked with as amazing a group of Soldiers as the Harlem Hellfighters,” Morgulas said. “Hellfighters, your dedication and ability to rise to any challenge has been truly inspiring.”

The 369th SB cased their colors, and their subordinate units—the 369th Special Troops Battalion, Headquarters and Headquarters Company 369th SB, 187th Signal Company—did the same.

Casing and uncasing colors is a military tradition that originated centuries ago so Soldiers could recognize and follow their units into battle.

The 371st SB, and their subordinate units, uncased their colors as they began their new mission.

Burgett kept his remarks brief. He thanked the Hellfighters for making the transition easy and said the 371st SB Sustainment Warriors would carry on the sustainment mission.",

CHICAGO – The rock group Boson has a phrase ‘It’s been such a long time’ in their 1976 song titled Long Time. And it could not be truer for a man who began his military career as a student at Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida.

On June 21, 2023, 19,000 baseball fans cheered for U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Brian Dunn, at the Chicago White Sox stadium, on a night that recognized Dunn, along with U.S. Navy Veteran Monica Urbieta who was honored as the “Hero of the Game’ for her service on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. George Washington in the Persian Gulf.

“So that was pretty impactful,” said a clearly elated Dunn. “(What an honor) by the White Sox organization, with my family here on Pride night with my husband, Mike. And to have someone that I served with come up and say hi filled me with a lot of gratitude.”

Before walking to the mound, Dunn exchanged greetings with fellow Army officer, retired Maj. Kelvin Pickens, whom he worked with at Fort Sheridan. Pickens currently works instant replay for the Chicago White Sox.

“When I joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. in 1993 there was an outright ban on service members that identified as (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning),” said Dunn. “Now 30 years later, the military has full support of our LGBTQ service members. The military’s view of our LGBTQ service members has come a long way. I’m very proud to wear my uniform and to be honored here for my military service on Pride night.”

Dunn’s husband, Mike Graves, was equally proud watching from his seat.

“It was a surprise but it’s a great thing. He really deserves it,” said Graves, a Navy veteran who served four years as a Torpedoman’s Mate on a ballistic missile submarine. “He’s a great representative for the Army. He is providing a service above and beyond and he does it happily.”

Ron Skarbek of Wilmette, Illinois, and a White Sox fan, said “It brought chills to me,” as he watched Dunn being applauded by the fans.

Like Dunn, Skarbek started out in ROTC at college and served as an Army officer from 1972 to 1976.

“I was a military police officer. Most of my time was stateside at Fort Gordon, Fort Benning and the Presidio,” said Skarbek.

Throughout history, LGBTQ Soldiers and civilians have bravely served and defended the country, often despite personal challenges and barriers to service.

Before he was assassinated, President John F. Kennedy spoke about diversity during a commencement speech at American University on June 10th, 1963.

“Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal,” he said.”",

Military Intelligence Readiness Command Soldiers and family members attended a Building Strong and Ready Teams event held June 23 – 25.

Building Strong and Ready Teams is a command directed, chaplain led, community partnered effort that strengthens spiritual readiness for Soldiers of all ranks and their families. This program was previously known as Strong Bonds.

The MIRC’s event took place over a weekend which allowed entire families to attend.

Chaplain (1st. Lt.) Carlos Joel Venezario served as an event organizer and presented materials in many of the small group settings. “The Army’s goal here is to provide tools and resources to build ready teams by maintaining the support that Soldiers have back at home. Being able to feed that and strengthen that is what's very important.”

Venezario explained that while the program has a spiritual component, no sessions are mandatory.

He also touched on what others believe they know about Building Strong and Ready Teams events. “I definitely like to address the stigmas people may have about these weekends. A lot of people think that these events are for people with broken marriages, or broken families. And that is not the case. Sure, people may need some help, or maybe need some resources coming in. But the majority of people coming here, they're not broken. They're people who want tools to better themselves.”

Venezario’s wife, Kendra Adams-Venezario, also helped lead the event. “This program contributes to the longevity of careers and the resiliency of families. You know, the military has one of the highest divorce rates in the country. The struggle that comes with moving so often and being separated from your support group and, all of that, it's trying on anybody.”

Adams-Venezario is working on a master’s degree in dispute resolution and has received training from the Army. This was the second time Adams-Venezario assisted in leading an event.

Her background and experiences as a military spouse informed her perspective and enhanced implementation of the program. “We're teaching active choices. That's all rooted in psychology. The course was written by a licensed psychologist and Family Therapist, the information that's included in it is all supported by psychological and scientific research. We talk about the impact of these things on marriage and the types of tools that work, the things that you do that harm your marriage and the things you can do that heal it.”

Nine couples attended the event. The program also included hotel lodging, childcare and meals. Venezario-Adams touted the event design. “Being able to provide that kind of support for families, and to give them the opportunity to spend time together, and to improve their relationships with one another, I think, is really beneficial.”

Spc. Anna Negm, a budget analyst working in the MIRC G8, attended with her husband Mike and young son. Negm agreed that the event provided value for her family. “It's a perfect setup, because as a lot of people who are here, we are also busy. This is a great way for us to spend our weekend while we do something for us as a couple. And yet we have our child here who's having a great time with his friends. And then we reunite and still have that family time during the weekend. It's perfect.”

Mike added, “We were able to check so many boxes, and attend this training really for a happier, healthier home. It's going to benefit all of us. We wouldn't have been able to attend without the childcare provided.”",

CHICAGO – The Chicago Sky Women's National Basketball Association team honored U.S. Army Reserve Maj. Tiesha Stephens for her military service during their Juneteenth observance home game verses the Indiana Fever at Wintrust Arena, June 15, 2023, in Chicago.

Stephens, who serves as a human resources officer for the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, received a plaque by the team mascot “Sky Guy” during the “Military Moment of the Game” for her outstanding commitment and service to the country.

Following her on-court recognition in front of thousands of roaring spectators, Stephens reflected on being publicly honored at the game.

“It was a great honor to be recognized during the Chicago Sky’s Juneteenth Game with my daughter present,” said Stephens. “Representing the Army during this holiday was a heartfelt privilege, and we truly enjoyed the experience.”

Juneteenth National Independence Day commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. While the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Lincoln, legally freed slaves throughout the Confederate States on January 1, 1863, Texas resisted for two years until U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger led an advance force of 1,800 men from the XIII Corps to the port city of Galveston, Texas.

Granger assumed command over the Military District of Texas, and issued General Order No. 3 on June 19, 1865, formally enforcing provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas for the first time. Juneteenth is celebrated on the anniversary of the order and derives its name from combining June and nineteenth. Juneteenth officially became the eleventh United States federal holiday in 2021.

Stephens, joined the Army in 1997 and received her commission through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. She has mobilized in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

Stephens’ awards include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Army Achievement Medal, among many other awards, throughout her years of service.",

JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST, N.J. — Reserve members from the U.S. Army and Air Force spent the last week training at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey for the 2023 Inter-Allied Confederation of Reserve Officers, or CIOR, military competition being held in Helsinki, Finland.

The competition, known as Milcomp, is a pentathlon designed to challenge reserve members from across the alliance physically with a focus on military skills, according to the CIOR website. The categories

include pistol and rifle shooting, an obstacle course, utility swimming (with obstacles), and military orienteering often referred to as land navigation.

“Those five skills translate to a regular Soldier and how a Soldier in everyday life can succeed,” said Staff Sgt. Daniel Kelley, international marksmanship coach and Olympic orienteering coach for the team. “We have young people here learning very valuable life-skills.”

Kelley added that this week was all about getting the competitors in the right mindset while becoming proficient in each category.

“This week has been long and hard,” said 1st Lt. Brianna Mirmina, a first-year competitor and Bethany, Connecticut native. “It’s been challenging but a great experience.”

Many members of the Army Reserve began training in early May, while trials week started June 12 and ended June 17 with individuals being placed on their respective teams.

“It has been super busy and a lot of hard work,” said Staff Sgt. Gavin Hopler, from St. Louis, Missouri and CIOR Milcomp rookie. “I think it’s really helped us hone our skills and set us up for success.”

Next stop is Sweden for one more week of training, then to Finland for the three-day competition.

“I expect them to represent the United States very well,"" said Command Sgt. Maj. Russell Moore, CIOR pistol coach. “They’ve put a lot of effort into it, and hopefully they can translate that into a good outcome.”",

WEST POINT, N.Y. -- U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from both the Army Reserve Medical Command and the 3rd Medical Command (Deployment Support) were dispatched to the U.S. Military Academy to provide real-world medical support and advisement during the Summer Leadership Experience 2023 here, June 3-9 and June 10-16, 2023.

Held twice every year at the prestigious West Point academy, SLE delegates cadets into the role as cadre and support staff to lead and guide potential cadet candidates throughout the course.

""The Summer Leadership Experience is a program led by the Directorate of Admissions where we send in 1,100 rising high school seniors and give them a one-week exposure to the U.S. Military Academy in academics, physical training and military training,"" said U.S. Army Col. Peter Mack, Directorate of Admissions Medical Officer at West Point. ""It allows them to see if the academy life would be like for them.""

To ensure minimal hospitalization and attrition reduction of cadet candidates due to injuries and illnesses, West Point leadership always incorporate Army Reserve medical Soldiers and equipment for every SLE session.

The pilot program for Army Reserve medical support during SLE resulted in over a 90 percent decrease in hospitalization for cadet candidates.

""We went from sending 110 cadet candidates to the hospital for simple things such as headaches, sprains, bumps, bruises, and contusions,"" Mack said. ""When medics started treating that, that number dropped that we sent to the hospital from 110 down to 10. Afterward, we expanded the program to bring nurses and medical providers.""

According to U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Francis Deravens, a combat medic assigned to the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group, Staten Island, N.Y., him and other Soldiers work tirelessly and expeditiously to maintain the status quo.

""Overall, we are a Level 1 real-world clinic just providing simple aid,"" Deravens said. ""Anything from dehydration to if someone needs to get transported to the hospital. As of (five days into the SLE events), we have seen around 60 individuals - a mix between candidates, cadets and also staff. At the end, we typically see about 100 people in the end of one week for various reasons.""

Aside from the benefit of the partnership between West Point and the Army Reserve, this experience has also been conducive to medical Soldiers in the upkeep of their skill sets and aptitude.

""It has been a really good experience, as this is the first time that I've done any true medical coverage since Advanced Individual Training,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Zachary Epstein, a combat medic assigned to 451st Medical Detachment, a 3rd MCDS unit out of Hartford, Connecticut. ""We've seen all sorts of different injuries and illnesses, from bumps and bruises to twisted ankles to anxiety effects. So it has been good, especially working closely with the providers.""

Furthermore, cadet candidates obtain a greater understanding of what medical Soldiers can provide in both the training and operational environment.

""The exposure to the Army Medical Department is incredible, no matter what branch that they go into; whether it is Combat Arms, Combat Support or Combat Service Support, they are going to be dealing with medical in any operation that they do,"" Mack said. ""So they get to see this firsthand, and can see what the medics can do to keep their Soldiers in the fight rather than evacuating them to a higher role of care and losing them for training and for any military operation. It enhances the mission, and it is a force multipler and this has been an incredible experience for them.""

The next iterations of SLE are currently slated for June 1-7/June 8-14, 2024. Nonetheless, Army Reserve medical support will remain an integral component of SLE preplanning and execution.

""We can't live without Army Reserve medical support,"" Mack said. ""It makes this program safe, it makes it run very smoothly, and it also helps enhance the training because we can keep Soldiers in the fight and allow them to continue training without them going to the hospital.""",

U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade conducted a relationship-building, information-sharing dialogue that commenced on May 31, 2023.

The dialogue signified a historic milestone. For the first time, U.S. and Israeli forces came together to share knowledge and respect for the handling of fallen warriors.

This successful convoy allowed the U.S. Army to set up the Mobile Integrated Remains Collection System (MIRCS) in Israel, showcasing its capabilities and presenting a robust, streamlined and dignified system for handling fallen warriors.

According to U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Yensy Carty, 673rd Quartermaster (QM) Company mortuary affairs team noncommissioned officer in charge, the MIRCS provides a solution to the challenging task of adequately collecting, preserving and transporting the remains of fallen warriors on the battlefield.

The system offers a respectful way to manage remains through state-of-the-art preservation technology, advanced collection equipment, identification and documentation, the preservation of personal effects, tracking and reporting, as well as religious sensitivity.

The 673rd QM, an Army Reserve unit based out of Delaware, demonstrated the solemn and meticulously choreographed ritual, known as dignified transfer, to the Israeli military personnel. It is a process filled with respect and honor, symbolizing the U.S. military’s gratitude for the ultimate sacrifice made by fallen warriors from the U.S. and those from partner nations.

U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Gabriel Montalvo, with the mortuary affairs team, said it is a real honor to demonstrate the values associated with the ritual given to each fallen warrior and show allies that this is the respect their service members receive.

“What my team and I provide is a respectful preparation for the last goodbye of a family to their fallen warrior,” Montalvo said. “The process allows a family to have closure with their service member.”

The Israeli military personnel shared information about burial traditions with U.S. Army personnel by showing a traditional, kosher wood casket.

According to Jewish tradition, man is created equal. Therefore, he is equal in death, which is why Rabbinic authorities recommend using simple caskets that reflect this democracy and prevent the unnecessary expense of elaborately adorned coffins.

The sharing of burial traditions between Israeli and U.S. military personnel was more than an exchange of customs. It revealed mutual respect and understanding for every individual’s equality and inherent dignity, both in life and death. This recognition extends beyond burial rituals, influencing a broader cooperative relationship between the two nations because allies and partners enable strategic readiness.

Capt. Amanda Longoria, the officer in charge of the 673d QM mortuary affairs team, said it was essential to learn about Israel’s needs regarding interacting with U.S. mortuary affairs.

“The U.S. and Israel are going to work more together in the future,” Longoria said.

“I feel honor, empathy and compassion for what I do,” Montalvo said. “And I feel honored sharing what I do, and I would gladly share my experience with partner nations again.”",

U.S. Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade conducted a convoy to Israel on May 30, 2023, to participate in a mortuary affairs subject matter exchange with the Israeli Defense Forces.

Spanning hundreds of miles with challenges such as heat temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the journey of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command into Israel ensured that a new chapter of collaboration and mutual learning unfolded.

The convoy centered around the transport of the Mobile Integrated Remains Collection System, a crucial tool for handling mortuary affairs on the battlefield, which rested on the M1075 Palletized Load System, a truck-based logistics platform.

Louisiana National Guard Spc. Emmanuel Moore, a wheeled vehicle mechanic with the 3673rd Support Maintenance Company, stressed the importance of this exercise.

“Transporting the MIRCS allows us to check our movement processes,” Moore said. “Moreover, carrying out this operation with Israel strengthens our relationships and mutual understanding.”

Allies and partners enable strategic readiness—the Army’s ability to mobilize, deploy and sustain forces in large-scale combat operations.

According to Fleet Master Chief Derrick Walters, Senior Enlisted Leader, there are currently 21 countries under the purview of U.S. Central Command—with Israel being the most recent addition.

“It’s a growing process as we envelop Israel in USCENTCOM as a regional partner,” Walters said. “This is critically important for regional security and stability.”

Indeed, external readiness constitutes a crucial factor in the success of these operations. Collaboration with allies like Israel is instrumental in accomplishing a mission’s immediate objectives and laying the groundwork for strengthened international relations and future joint efforts.

This exercise also demonstrated the importance of interoperability between the U.S. and its allies. The smooth transition of the MIRCS into Israeli territory, and the subsequent discussions around mortuary affairs, were made possible by clear communication, understanding of respective military protocols and mutual respect between the U.S. and Israeli forces.

Without clear communication and shared readiness, the complexities of border crossings and customs procedures could have led to challenges and misunderstandings of customs procedures.

The result could be an investigation or confiscation of essential items, causing substantial mission delays or even loss of crucial supplies hindering the actual setup of the MIRCS, and potentially altering the course and outcomes of the mission.

Due to the cooperation, understanding and respecting custom regulations, these challenges were prevented.",

“The Feldjaeger is a first-class organization,” said Brig. Gen. Vance Kuhner, deputy commanding general of the 200th Military Police Command. “They add muscle and competence that our alliance requires to thwart aggression from anyone who wants to destroy freedom, democracy, law and order.”

“Today was so complete,” added Brig. Gen. Kuhner, who, as a civilian, serves as the northeast Special Agent in Charge for United States Customs and Border Protection. “Appropriately, we started our day by solemnly remembering our German military police who gave their lives in service. We need to remember them as we as allies serve and protect our citizens.”

The pageantry also amazed Brig. Gen. Kuhner. “The parade was splendid, and that Bundeswehr band [the Heeresmusikkorps Hannover] is the absolute best military band I’ve ever heard.”

The Feldjaeger’s demonstration of law enforcement and tactical support proved they can bring lethal force to any nefarious actors who dare attempt to interrupt route security.

Orchestrating the entire event was Brig. Gen. Sandro Wiesner, commander of the Bundeswehr Military Police Command.

“It is no coincidence that so many companions from the political sector, military, police, and civilian partners from Germany and abroad, active duty and reserve personnel, the German Military Police Association, and retired personnel and friends of the German MP are going to celebrate this special day in Hannover with the rest of us,” said Brig.

During the ceremony, Brig. Gen. Wiesner quoted 19th-Century Prussian field marshal Helmuth von Moltke, stating, “When one issued an order to a Feldjaeger, one was safe.” Brig. Gen. Wiesner further metaphorized, “In our house the lights are on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days all year long. We are and will always be highly responsive.""

“The 200th Military Police Command looks forward to more training opportunities with the military police commands who serve countries dedicated to protecting freedom from tyranny,” added Brig. Gen. Vance Kuhner. “Just as a football team doesn’t meet in the locker room right before the big match, our military forces ought not meet moments before crisis. We should train together, and we will continuously train together so that together we can defeat our adversaries.”

“We thank Brig. Gen. Sandro Wiesner for his leadership,” added Brig. Gen. Kuhner. “We met great Military Policemen this week from Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Lithuania, Austria and the Netherlands who are dedicated to preserving law and order. We stand shoulder to shoulder with them.”

Brig. Gen. Vance Kuhner, deputy commanding general (support) for the 200th MP CMD, was charged with overseeing the command during the exercise. According to Kuhner, the three top areas of focus for the unit were deployability, alliance and partnership, and the rule of law.

“Our staff exercised their ability to talk to our allies and partners along with our higher headquarters [during this CPX],” said Kuhner. “In doing so, the staff learned a lot about itself. We learned some new areas that we must focus more on, but we also learned that we could do it. We are ready, we're relevant, and we're ready for the future.”

Since many soldiers in the command work in policing in their civilian lives, the transition to a military police mission was somewhat seamless. This exercise included planning considerations of law enforcement, rear area security, and detainee operations missions. Furthermore, the exercise challenged the command to integrate functional skills from medical, chemical, engineer, information operations, public affairs, to civil affairs.

“This gave our headquarters staff as well as one of our subordinate brigades (300th MP BDE) the opportunity to come and participate in a larger exercise that included our multinational partners, as well as U.S. Army Europe and Africa staff, and to inject ourselves into not only the planning process, but the execution of working as a theater level military police command,” said Col. John Dunn, chief of staff of the command.

“This was the first opportunity that we had, as a military police command, to participate in a command post exercise of this level,” added Dunn. “It really gave us the opportunity to exercise our staff functionality, with higher headquarters as well as our subordinate units, our sister units to our left and right, and our multinational partners.”

Kuhner told the command staff during the exercise as a teaching moment that it’s not enough to do just policing anymore. On the battlefield, a variety of scenarios may play out at any time, and the command must be ready to step up. The CPX was an opportunity to train for a variety of possible real-world scenarios.

""We worked first on getting the [battle drills] right, and once we got it right, we worked on speed,” said Kuhner. “Our ability to get the products out, get the coordination done, work with our down trace brigades, making sure that they're doing what needs to be done to support to the [Combined Forces Land Component Commander], I really saw nothing negative. I saw really nothing that I would say we weren't ready to do. We're ready to do all of it.""

Sgt. Maj. Anthony Kresta is the operations noncomissioned officer in charge for the command. He called enlisted personnel “the glue that holds the staff together,” ensuring continuity between staff sections.

“Having the opportunity to come here to the European theater to train with our U.S. counterparts, as well as our multinational partners, has been one like I've never experienced in my nearly 40-year career,” said Kresta. “This unique opportunity has given us the ability to train as staff, and especially from the perspective of our enlisted soldiers and our noncommissioned officer corps, an ability to demonstrate to our staff officer members of the team that we are full force multiplier when it comes to the operations of our command post.”

The CPX, part of DEFENDER 23, was a computer-assisted exercise designed to build V Corps’ ability to conduct operations throughout Europe in a multi-corps, multi-national and multi-domain environment. This exercise took place June 5 to 14 and included approximately 2,000 personnel from USAEUR-AF, V Corps, as well as 1,000 multi-national personnel from five allied and partner countries that include Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, Netherlands and Romania.

MARTINSBURG, W.Va. - Three West Virginia National Guardsmen participated in the Women in Strategic Intelligence Seminar in Doha, Qatar, May 14-18.

Maj. Taylar Belfield and Tech. Sgt. Victoria Bagley, both assigned to the 167th Operations Support Squadron, and 1st Lt. Abbey Welborn, 111th Engineer Brigade, joined servicemembers and civilians from the Qatar Armed Forces, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Army Central and U.S. Air Forces Central for the event.

The three women presented information in their respective areas of expertise at the seminar.

Supporting the Department of Defense Women, Peace, and Security Strategic Framework and Implementation Plan, the seminar increased understanding of how strategy drives intelligence gathering, analysis, product development and decision making.

The seminar also provided an opportunity to build relationships between the West Virginia National Guard and the Qatari Armed Forces, partnered through the National Guard Bureau’s State Partnership Program.

The first day of the seminar focused on topics specific to women in, and working in support of, the military. The next three days, participants discussed intelligence topics, followed by a practical exercise on the final day.

“The experience of meeting these ladies who are trailblazers in their country, they’re very impressive women, it was the best all-around [temporary duty assignment],” Belfield said of engaging with the nearly 30 Qatari women who support the Ministry of Defense as civilian intelligence analysts.

The biggest takeaway for Bagley was the common ground they found with their Qatari counterparts as discussions bounced between personal and professional topics.

“We think we are so different based on culture, but there are so many similarities, especially when you’re focusing on gender. As soon as kids or family is mentioned, everyone wants to share their personal experiences,” Bagley said.

She noted the support the Qatari women have from their male coworkers, who recognize their value and see the unique perspective they bring to intelligence analysis.

“Qatar is forward-leaning in the Middle East when it comes to women and the workplace, and I think there’s so much value in having them as a state partner,” Belfield said.

The West Virginia National Guard and Qatar have partnered since 2018 through the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program. West Virginia Guard members helped their Qatari military partners prepare for and execute the FIFA World Cup in 2022. Most recently, West Virginia National Guard and Qatari military leaders met in Doha for a State Partnership Program engagement in March.

The 268th Inland Cargo Transportation Company, from the 1st Mission Support Command, undergoes extensive training for an upcoming deployment. Since 9/11, nearly 100% of the Army Reserve units in Puerto Rico have mobilized and deployed as a member of the Joint Force.

Recently, the transportation unit completed Operation Tin Man at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, where the soldiers were responsible for managing equipment at the Central Receiving Shipping Point and moving it to the Gulfport by operating tactical vehicles.

Here at Camp Shelby, the CRSP yard is divided into three areas of operation the storage, holding, and ready line.

""As an 88H, a cargo specialist, my duty was to load and unload 20-foot containers from platforms with the RT240 at the CRSP yard,"" said Spc. Hector Martinez.

The Kalmar RT240 Rough Terrain Container Handler is one of the many tactical vehicles used in the armed forces to handle standard shipping containers and is considered the backbone of military logistics.

The 88Hs performed single stacks of the containers at the designated ready line. Then the Palletized Load System cargo transfer team unloaded the container to the PLS so the 88Ms could transport it to the final destination, explained Spc. Martinez.

The 88Ms is the military occupational code for motor transport operators, according to Sgt. Jonathan Collazo, performing real-life missions during annual training, enables the Army Reserve soldiers to train on different aspects of transportation.

The motor transport operators conducted convoy operations, equipment movement, preventive maintenance checks, and inventories.

""The mission was an opportunity for the soldiers to gain more experience and proficiency in their MOS,"" said Sgt. Collazo.

The Army Reserve soldiers fostered a culture of learning among each other, enabling the young soldiers to build their expertise; consequently, the transportation team could safely move over 400 containers, concluded Sgt. Collazo.

Operation Tin Man enabled the Army Reserve soldiers to be mission ready as they managed and transported the equipment, ensuring delivery was made on time and in good condition.

The Army Reserve forces in Puerto Rico have become an essential part of the total force, with streamlined, deployable forces and citizen Soldiers who embody the warrior mindset and spirit.",

Travel is a routine part of the 787th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion’s training, but this time the journey will take it overseas.

The Army Reserve unit, based in Dothan, Ala., departed its headquarters Sunday morning, June 4, 2023. A handful of family members and friends said their farewells outside the building as their Soldiers loaded on buses to leave at dawn.

The battalion had prepared for its European deployment since before November. Command Sgt. Maj. Clint Halstead, the unit’s senior NCO, said morale rose when the unit learned its new missions would mainly involve convoys and moving supplies – reflecting its normal transportation work.

“It was intensely motivating,” he said. “When a mission set is put in front of you, all that training is more inspiring because you’re going to a real place.”

The initial trip on June 4 took the unit to Fort Cavazos, Texas, for the pre-deployment process. From there, the 787 CSSB will travel to support Operation European Assure, Deter, Reinforce. Many of the Soldiers have never served outside the United States before; those who did shared their personal experiences and advice with the others as they prepared for departure.

Sgt. 1st Class Phillip Rogers, the first sergeant, has deployed three times to various countries – Iraq, Afghanistan and Jordan. He said it will be important for the troops to keep in contact with their friends and families, maintain their finances, keep in touch with their personal spirituality and communicate with their leadership.

“If they don’t do it, they end up keeping to themselves,” Rogers said concerning communication. “They end up in a place where they’re in a rough spot … We can’t help them when we don’t know.”

This will be the first deployment for Staff Sgt. Devon Fields, a petroleum supply NCO, who said he was excited to finally go overseas.

“It’s been a long time coming,” he said. “It’s not easy leaving my family for this amount of time, but my wife understands this is a requirement and has the support she needs.”

Fields has a form of support he’s taking with him – his twin brother, Staff Sgt. Tyawan Fields. The brothers joined the Army together and went to basic together. Now they serve in the same unit and will be able to experience Europe at the same time.

Previously, they both tried to get on multiple deployments, but Tyawan, a transportation management coordinator, managed to go first and was sent in 2021 to Kuwait. While they talked by phone throughout that time, both agreed being there for each other in person will be an improvement.

“Going through it together makes it easier,” Tyawan said.

His wife, Jakelia “GeGe” Fields, said even though he just got back last year, she is now better prepared for the family hardships that come with a deployment – such as him missing the milestones their children will go through during the year.

“I think it’s going to be a little easier,” she said. “I know what to expect and what not to expect.”

Some Soldiers felt the same way. Spc. Jose Martinez, a communications specialist, previously deployed to Kuwait and Iraq. He said he was more relaxed about deploying this time and was glad he was going with the 787 CSSB.

He said his fellow troops have a sense of pride about using their skills for the missions they’ll be conducting.

“Being able to apply it for the Army overseas gives you a sense of accomplishment,” Martinez said. “A lot of them are excited for it – doing their job on the daily.”

The unit itself has a long history of doing its job and has been in Dothan in various forms since 1968. It went to Afghanistan in 2003 and supported Operation Inherent Resolve with a deployment to Iraq and Syria in 2018.

Maj. Hugh Carswell, the battalion executive officer, led a farewell ceremony the day before the unit left. He expressed confidence in the troop’s abilities, noting that the experienced Soldiers will help the newer ones.

“I think we have leadership in each section to fulfill the mission,” he said. “They know what their role is and they know what they’re doing. They have the confidence to get the job done.”

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait - U.S. Army sustainers with the 1st Theater Sustainment Command’s Operational Command Post provided logistics support to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility during the bilateral military exercise held between the U.S. and Israel militaries known as Juniper Caracal 2023, held in May 2023.

The Juniper exercise series, including Juniper Oak 23-2, and Juniper Falcon 23-2 which were completed in earlier this year, are designed to enhance interoperability between both nations’ militaries and ensure U.S. and Israeli forces are ready and prepared to respond to any contingency, particularly those involving ballistic missile defense or crisis response.

Col. Gerry L. Jackson, 1st TSC alternate command post director, explained how this exercise demonstrates the long-standing commitment and cooperation between Israel and the United States.

“Our partnership with Israel is key. The Juniper Caracal exercise helps strengthen our partnership and our working relationship with Israel,” said Jackson.

The exercise was planned by members of both the 1st TSC and IDF and consisted of participants from the 673d Quartermaster Company mortuary affairs team and the 730th Quartermaster Company transportation team. These teams conducted a convoy operation and a demonstration of combat readiness by showcasing the capabilities of a mobile integrated remains collection system.

The MIRCS is a self-contained shelter with four main areas: a receiving and processing area, a refrigerated storage area for remains, an administrative area, and a storage section for operational supplies. It consists of all components necessary to deploy, move and operate in support of a full spectrum of military and peacetime disaster support. It can be transported via land or by air.

Sgt. Maj. Lachelle Wiggins, the Juniper Caracal noncommissioned officer in charge, said that she was pleased with the success of the exercise.

“As we build our partnership with the IDF, it is these positive interactions that generate readiness and build trust in our capabilities as technically and tactically proficient professionals,” stated Wiggins.

The Juniper exercise series serves as an opportunity for U.S. military personnel and the IDF to exercise together and to learn from one another. JC23 represents another step in the deliberate and strategic relationship between the U.S. and Israel and contributes to overall regional stability.",

CHICAGO – Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs honored U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Amrit Sandhu, of the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, during a Memorial Day home game versus the Tampa Bay Rays at Wrigley Field in Chicago, May 29, 2023.

A nationally televised game with 38,163 in attendance, Sandhu was publicly honored on the field for the game’s “Military Salute”. He was presented with an official game ball by the Cubs organization and received a standing ovation from tens of thousands of spectators.

Recognition for Sandhu came in conjunction with multiple Memorial Day honors at Wrigley Field, including the unfurling of a large American flag that covered the outfield section, a moment of silence for our nation’s fallen heroes, and a spotlight honor to a “Gold Star” Marine family.

Sandhu was joined by his two sons, Timur (12) and Edward (8). It was their first MLB baseball game.

Sandhu immigrated to the United States from Gurdaspur, Punjab, India in 2008. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve in September 2015 as a Financial Management Technician, and in January of 2017 Sandhu was sworn in as a United States citizen. He is currently serving as Budget Analyst for the 85th USARSC, headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois, outside Chicago.

Reflecting on his 8-year career in the Army Reserve, Sandhu noted he “loves to wear the uniform, and to be a part of a strong team in the U.S. Army.”

“I plan to extend my contract – I’ll feel like I’m missing something if I don’t,” said Sandhu.

Sandhu also elaborated on the feeling of receiving the honor at the game.

“Here today at Wrigley, it feels very special to be supported and respected by the crowd. I appreciate the opportunity to be honored on this special day – Memorial Day,” Sandhu said. “My boys will have a unique memory for the rest of their lives. Every kid wants to be out on that field, and they made it out there.”

Sandhu took the field, along the 3rd base line in the second inning, just prior to the Cubs batting. As Sandhu appeared on the Wrigley jumbotron in left field, and broadcast nationwide, Timur and Edward remarked “It feels pretty cool to see dad get cheered by the crowd, and to see him up on the big screen”.

From his vantage position a few feet from the Chicago Cubs dugout, Edward later noted “I bet I’m better at baseball than they are”. Edward plays grade school baseball.

Many spectators were displaying their support for members of the military during the Memorial Day game at Wrigley. One spectator, John, wearing a camouflage Army baseball cap and dog tags, said he was honoring his parents – both World War II Army veterans that served in hospitals and treated Soldiers coming back from the Pacific.

“It’s incredible to see the Cubs honor Sergeant Sandhu on the field,” said John.

As the game neared its end, Timur said he wanted to play baseball with his dad when they got home. While enjoying a ballpark hotdog a few feet from Chicago Cubs’ Miles Mastrobuoni’s 3rd base position, when asked if he was going to play with the baseball the Cubs gave him, Timur remarked “No, I’m saving that”.

The Chicago Cubs defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 1-0 in the 9th inning.",

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. – Soldiers assigned to the 85th U.S Army Reserve Support Command joined their local communities to honor service during the Memorial Day weekend, May 27-29, 2023.

The Rolling Meadows Memorial Day parade brought together veterans, local residents, first responders and military personnel to share in the remembrance of fallen heroes.

As in many communities across America, residents and veterans young and old stood silently to listen to Lt. Col. Brian Dunn, Assistant Chief of Staff G-1, 85th USARSC, speak at the Veterans Memorial Carillon Monument on the cost of freedom and what Memorial Day means.

“Since the founding of our Nation, more than 42 million Americans have stepped forward to serve this country, and more than a million have died so their children and future generations could live freely,” said Dunn.

“They came from across our nation and every walk of life. Each different, each an individual who made a choice, yet all shared the same dream of freedom that gave birth to our nation and carried the light of liberty to millions across the globe.”

Marine Pfc. Walter Sanojca of Chicago was one of them. Killed during fierce fighting at the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945.

A loss felt to this day by his niece, Lara Sanoica, Mayor, Rolling Meadows, who reflected on the meaning of Memorial Day.

“For me, personally, (Memorial Day means) my great uncle, Walter Sanojca, who died in the Battle of Okinawa,” she said. “It impacts families for generations. It’s very important we have this day. I continue to serve by running for office. I want to make sure his sacrifice is not forgotten.”

While Rolling Meadows paid homage to fallen service members, the Chicago Cubs baseball team held a recognition during their Saturday evening game, later that night, to honor military service through local serving service members. A cheering crowd of more than 36 thousand Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball fans honored Brig. Gen. Richard Corner, Commanding General, 85th USARSC, during the second inning of their game with the Cincinnati Reds.

“It was an awesome experience,” said Corner. “The crowd and the gratitude people have.”

Cubs’ fans enjoyed watching him too.

“I think it’s fabulous. Our nephew is in the Army at Fort Bragg, North Carolina,” said Michelle Dixon of West Dundee and a Cubs spectator. “To see the general (Corner) honored is great. To see that he is having a successful career and serving his country.”

On Monday, area residents watched the 104th Annual Memorial Day Parade and Ceremony in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

Corner and retired Sgt. Maj. Dennis Koski participated in the parade waving to the crowd as they passed by in an Army style jeep. Following the parade, Corner delivered the keynote speech for the ceremony.

“We can never replace our fallen heroes. We can never repay them. But we can always remember. Words cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage,” Corner said. “We only hope that every day we can prove worthy not only of their sacrifice and service, but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones that they left behind.”

The local mayor added a new discovery on a fallen veteran from the community.

“Arlington Heights is a very special place especially on Memorial Day,” said Mayor Tom Hayes, mayor of Arlington Heights, Illinois. “Our 59th hero is Private John Sieburg.”

It was only recently discovered Sieburg was one of Arlington Heights fallen heroes dating back to the Civil War.

Private Sieburg served with the 8th Illinois Cavalry Regiment as a dispatch rider carrying critical messages between military commanders.

He was shot through his hip, knocked from his horse and died October 12, 1863.

Nadine Lussman traveled from her home in Switzerland to pay tribute to her great granduncle.

“It’s very moving for us that John Sieburg now has a place in Memorial Park in Arlington Heights, his ancestral home,” she told the Daily Herald newspaper. “He’s come home in a way.”

Katie Stack, the widow of Marine Lance Cpl. James Stack who served with 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, reflected on the memory of her husband. He was killed by a sniper in Sangin, Afghanistan back in 2010.

“I want my husband to be remembered as this goofy, loving, charismatic man who loved his daughter and me beyond anything in this world,"" said Stack. ""Every single moment he came home he was so excited to see her and sit next to us from all the time he was away. He loved his job. We came first, but his job came second. I want him to be remembered as a hero who fought for this country.”",

Missions are not always executed with full capabilities. As a result, commanders will often accept prudent risk where necessary to ensure the mission is completed. When gaps need to be filled, commanders may choose to exercise talent management from within their ranks. That happened to be the case with the generator subject matter expert, Spc. Alexander Darrow.

Darrow, a deployed Reserve Soldier and the only tactical power generation specialist assigned to 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command, works on a power generation system in Jordan with purpose and passion.

As a tactical power generation specialist, Darrow has supplied the power needed to run virtually every aspect of activity on the air base. In addition, Darrow’s job supports the unit by providing power for equipment that is required to accomplish the mission. The power supply provides the air base with electricity, heat, and air-conditioning, allowing the alternate command post to communicate with the operational command post.

Darrow has worked on power generation supplies for almost three years in the Army. However, he began working on wheel bearings with his grandfather around the age of 8, leading to his knack for fixing things. His prior maintenance experience and advanced individual training from the Army make him a true subject matter expert.

Since arriving in Jordan, Darrow has performed maintenance and repairs on transmissions, small engines, small all-terrain utility vehicles, skid-steer loaders, power-generation equipment, and associated equipment in mobile and stationary power plants.

“I’ve been working on prime equipment since I’ve been out here,” said Darrow, explaining how the tasks are outside his military occupational specialty. “But in actuality, a generator is a generator. So I’m just really happy to be out here supporting the mission. I feel like I’m making a difference.”

143d ESC Headquarters & Headquarters Company Commander Capt. Marlena Janes said, “Sending a junior Soldier to a pretty remote area to run the generators without a noncommissioned officer is a risk.” However, sending Darrow on the solo mission led to successful operations on a remote air base because of the amount of equipment he could troubleshoot, order parts for, and fix as parts came in. “I would absolutely do it again.”

Commanders’ ability to accept risk and empower junior leaders such as Darrow provide real-world scenarios for Reserve Soldiers to hone skill sets in a mobilized environment. These opportunities encourage not only professional development but leadership through empowerment. As a result, leadership, training, and experience gained through military service are second-to-none.",

As an Army Reserve Soldier and an Army Civilian, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Christopher Mondi embodies the limitless possibilities of the Army slogan, “Be All You Can Be,” by bringing skill sets from both worlds to a deployed environment.

Mondi serves as a food service technician, deployed with the 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command in Jordan, and an Army Civilian logistics management specialist for a quartermaster company. His training has led to opportunities to travel, experience other cultures, and serve a greater purpose abroad.

“What brought me here was taking accountability of the property on base, visiting the first field fielding team in theater and making sure everything is going alright with them, as well as key leader engagements with the Jordanians,” Mondi said.

Previously, field feeding teams did not come into the theater. “The mission has changed, as far as the requirements,” Mondi states.

In 2015, the Combined Arms Support Command unveiled a consolidated field feeding company concept, where food service specialists are consolidated into a single company within sustainment brigades.

In doing so, units can request a field feeding capability to support operational requirements, much like they do with other sustainment requests and other combat service support functions, if required.

The 564th Quartermaster Company is the first field feeding team to report to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. “They are their own team. They don’t have a first sergeant and a commander. They are all they have, and they fall in under a sustainment brigade for support,” said Mondi.

“It’s great to be here and be able to work with these young Soldiers. As [the Army] has gone through the years, we haven’t always had 92Gs that were cooking. So it’s nice to see them out in the field and doing the job that they came to join the Army for.""

The U.S. Army is committed to building high-performing and cohesive teams in an inclusive environment to accomplish its mission. Soldiers like Mondi continue to demonstrate that the Army builds leaders and provides them the opportunities to be influential advisors to peers and leaders around the world.",

FORT POLK, La. — The United States and Colombian armies are continually looking for ways to further strengthen the already rich partnership they share. The latest example of this comes as an infantry company from the Colombian Army was embedded with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, alongside U.S. Soldiers from the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade, during a recent Joint Readiness Training Center rotation at Fort Polk, Louisiana.

“The importance of this JRTC Rotation with the Colombian Army is two-fold; it helps the Colombian Army understand a new operational environment including how to operate in large scale combat operations and it builds readiness for the U.S. Army,” said U.S. Army Maj. Joseph Macchiarella, U.S. Army South Colombia foreign area officer. “3rd Brigade, along with the 1st SFAB, were able to train on their critical task to integrate allies and partner nation forces into operations as well as identify gaps in capabilities which will need to be addressed in the near future.”

When asked about the importance of military partnerships like that between the U.S. and Colombian armies, Col. Richard Taylor, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division commander, discussed how strategic friendships and partnerships are the bedrock of any large organization.

“We know that the U.S. Army does not operate alone; every opportunity to serve alongside our partner forces is a chance to strengthen bonds and establish trust,” he said. “Both traits are crucial for interoperability and ultimately allows us to jump, fight and win on the hardest day of ground combat.”

Taylor also commended the professionalism demonstrated throughout the rotation saying, “The soldiers and leaders of the Columbian army are disciplined, lethal and highly competent. Our paratroopers gained knowledge from serving with them throughout the rotation.”

Though there are several challenges presented anytime two nations’ armies operate alongside one another. Consistent, realistic training builds an understanding that can ease those concerns should this partnership be put to the test in a real-world operation.

“There are still many challenges to achieve interoperability, but combat training center rotations are the perfect scenario to identify shortfalls and work to find an immediate solution,” said Macchiarella at the conclusion of the rotation. “There were many lessons learned by all participants, and now the challenge remains on how to improve before the next big event.”

The military partnership between the U.S. and Colombia has been longstanding and in recent years the two nations began working together toward a common, more optimistic goal.

“Since 2021 the U.S. and Colombia have had a process of preparation and training a unit from the army with the goal of working up to a battalion level in order to improve and achieve true interoperability,” explained Colombian Maj. Gen. Alvaro Vicente Perez, deputy commander of the Colombian Army. “We started in 2021 working together at the platoon level and during this JRTC rotation we trained together at the company level.”

Training at the company level as opposed to the individual squad or platoon level provided a greater understanding of each other’s capabilities and tactics during a large-scale combat operations type of environment.

“The most important thing about training like this, after talking with our soldiers, is the opportunity to interact, train with, and understand the capabilities of other armies like the United States and see operations from another point of view,” continued Perez.

In addition to this U.S.-hosted JRTC training rotation, Colombia played host last fall to U.S. Soldiers from both the Illinois and Georgia Army National Guard during Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 which was a two-week training exercise at Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia. The exercise included a Women Peace and Security panel discussion during which senior leaders from both armies shared experiences and ideas on furthering the roles of women in security efforts in their respective countries.",

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – On a bitterly cold, desert morning at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, U.S. Army South Soldier, Sgt. Aaron Thomas, a geospatial plans and analysis team leader in the 512th Engineer Detachment, stood nervously on the starting line of the Bataan Memorial Death March on March 19, 2023.

“I knew it was gonna be challenging, and I didn't want to fail,” Thomas said with uncertainty. “But hearing stories about how bad it was for other people, you know, I kind of let that weigh on me. The furthest I had rucked during my training was only 10 miles.”

According to The Bataan Memorial Death March website, the event is a 26.2-mile ruck march to remember the roughly 75,000 U.S. and Filipino service members who became prisoners of war (POW) in the Philippines during World War II and were forced to march approximately 65 miles through the jungle to confinement camps by their Japanese captors.

Thomas held his detachment’s guidon, but a friend suggested he put it in his 35 pound ruck sack. Instead, he chose the challenge of carrying it the distance and listened to the memory of his older brother’s voice telling him not to take the easy route.

“Whatever it is that I’m doing, it’s the memory of my older brother’s voice telling me not to quit that has always been there to get me through the tough times and tough decisions,” he admired.

Thomas, from Las Vegas, New Mexico, is no stranger to long journeys carrying either a mental or physical weight, or both. Though his family members all found various levels of success in life, through determination and resilience he was the first to earn his high school diploma.

Thomas noted that he was held back a grade twice in high school and enrolled in a dual credit program in order to graduate on time, forcing him to attend night classes at a community college just outside of town. This challenging time of his life was compounded when he broke his foot in a skateboarding accident and was forced to use crutches to get around. One night during class, a blizzard rolled in, his phone died and he was unable to call for a ride home.

“I just started walking with my toes exposed out the end of my cast,” recounted Thomas. “The snow was so bad that I couldn’t see the light poles, I fell a couple of times, I had to hop a cattle fence, and I kept thinking I needed to move faster because if I kept shoveling all this snow into my cast, I’m going to get frostbite. It was the worst three miles of my life.”

Thomas said he reminded himself why he was going to school in order to keep motivating him to keep moving forward: to set an example for his younger siblings.

“Walking back through that snow, I was thinking, like, why am I suffering,” he remarked. “But I thought that if I didn’t change something, my little brothers and my little sister were just going to live the same sad story and drop out. I wanted to break that cycle.”

Thomas pushed through the snow that night and moved on to graduate, even achieving an associate's degree and a certificate in welding. His younger siblings moved on to graduate as well, with one of his brothers getting two degrees and becoming a pastor, his other brother joining the U.S. Navy and his sister becoming a sous-chef.

Thomas thought back to that turbulent, stormy night during the cold morning of the Bataan Memorial Death March and was enkindled.

“I thought about how I had already walked through a blizzard, and that was way worse than the morning of the march,” he claimed.

Even with his previous experiences and the training for the march, Thomas said he had doubts and reflected on the few people who doubted his ability to complete the 26.2-mile course. But he looked at the other competitors and listened to the story of the Bataan POWs who marched more than double that amount with a determination to finish.

The event began and Thomas stepped off on the long trek, befriending a fellow Soldier and finding motivation in his age.

“The first several miles were uphill and I walked with a 57 year old Army Lieutenant Colonel who had served 11 years in the Marine Corps before switching to the Army,” he said. “Seeing him out there gave me a lot of inspiration, because if he can do it at his age, I can do it at 33 years old.”

He used that inspiration when fatigue set in around the halfway mark of the course.

“I definitely reached muscle failure a few times, just every muscle wanting to give up,” he revealed. “Being out there alone at times was the biggest challenge though, but I met a lot of cool people along the way. Some stranger even gave me a shot of pickle juice which helped me a lot with cramping.”

Thomas said his favorite part of the event was the views of the mountains, hills and desert, but they were starkly different from the views during his past marches as a civilian. He found more influence from other times he had to carry heavy weight on long marches with dreary city views.

After he earned his welding certificate, he found a welding job in Los Angeles, bought a car and moved out to California. But an unfortunate event led him to seek change.

“I invited my friend to come visit me out in California, and one night I lent him my car,” he remembered. “He parked it on the street during a street sweeping day and it got towed and impounded.”

Thomas said he found himself on a five mile walk everyday to and from work, but this time he carried a heavy load.

“I didn’t have a secure place to keep my tools or welder at the job site, so I put all my tools in a backpack and carried my welder,” he remarked. “It sucked, and it dawned on me that I could be getting paid to do this and have other benefits in the Army. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Thomas said he took inventory of what he was fighting for in his life: a meager wage, a tiny apartment and a job with no benefits. He knew he was cut out for something different and decided to enlist in the Army as a geospatial engineer.

Back on the Bataan Memorial Death March course, as his muscles failed him and his hands swelled, he remembered the contrast between his past and his present. He also remembered he was trying to set an example as a leader for the Soldiers he was leading back at his unit.

“They may not be my little brothers and sisters, but I treat them like they are and I lead by example,” he said with gratification. “I feel like if I can do stuff like the Bataan at 33 years old, it should be a walk in the park for some of these younger Soldiers.”

Thomas ran the last few miles, fighting to the very end. As he approached the finish line, he was surprised to see a couple faces he recognized.

“I was thinking, that old guy over there looks familiar,” he said with a grin. “ It was my dad and then I saw my mom. My dad was still hooked up to his oxygen tank, so I knew his journey to the finish line was probably a lot worse than mine. That moment made me really appreciate the people that I have in my life.”

His dad, Keith Thomas, a disabled Navy veteran whose service was cut short when he was struck by a tractor-trailer, claimed that it was a challenge to make it to the event, and it almost didn't happen because of icy roads.

“We wanted to surprise him and cheer him on, but we had some severe weather come through,” said his dad wearily. “We told him we wanted to come down there but because of the weather, things had changed. He had no idea we were going to be there, and we were in the perfect spot as he was coming around the corner to the finish.”

His dad expressed that it was an absolute joy to see his son cross the finish line.

“It was an apex moment in my life to see him and see what he had accomplished, because it was a grueling course,” his father said with warmth in his voice. “Some of the things he has done in the Army give me a whole new respect for his service and for the Army.”

The pride his parents feel for their son’s accomplishments carry over to Thomas as a feeling of self-assurance.

“I don't think there's anything that I can't do, and I haven't failed myself yet,” he said with satisfaction. “Maybe one day I'll get to that point where my body fails me, I mean, I can't say that'll never happen. It just hasn't happened yet, and I don’t expect it to happen any time soon.”

Thomas said he did a 12-mile ruck march with his Soldiers less than a week after completing the Bataan Memorial Death March in preparation for the Norwegian foot march later this month.",

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — After more than five months of planning, U.S. Army South hosted their inaugural Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Symposium in downtown San Antonio, Texas on Feb. 22 and 23, 2023. Representatives from 16 Central and South American and Caribbean partner nations participated in panel discussions, question and answer sessions, senior leader discussions, and a presentation on the overall WPS framework.

“The United States Women, Peace, and Security strategy is a whole of government approach that guides our departments in implementing strategies that focus on the effects of armed conflict on women and girls,” said U.S. Army South Command Sergeant Major, Ronald Graves. “Symposiums such as this help to build and foster diverse teams of professionals and enable the opportunity for women to serve in leadership positions at all echelons.”

With each of the countries in attendance at varying levels of gender equality in their militaries, this forum served as a space to exchange ideas and best practices that have worked for each respective nation. During the discussions leaders vocalized the small wins that have gradually contributed to impactful changes.

“While this is the inaugural symposium, we are looking for more forums like this where military personnel from the region can get together and highlight WPS initiatives and the critical roles women in our militaries are playing,” said Cmdr. Judy-Ann Neil, Acting Inspector General of the Jamaica Defense Force. “Events like this give you an opportunity to hear from women in other militaries in the region and learn that despite the geographical and language barriers our challenges as being women in the military are really the same.”

One of the female leader’s attendees had the opportunity to hear from was retired Lt. Gen. Nadja West, 44th U.S. Army Surgeon General, who served on the panel centered on what it takes to build cohesive teams. During West’s panel she was asked how other countries can improve teamwork and ensure their voices are heard within their own militaries.

“The advice I gave was that actions speak louder than words, and if you’re seen to be able to do your job just as well as the Soldier next you, no matter what their gender is or whatever type of identifier that they have, that’s one way of breaking down those barriers and concerns about being a valuable member of the team,” West said.

West also took time to listen and appreciate what other women in the room had faced in their careers and how they overcame their own unique obstacles as women in leadership.

“It was really great to see women from other countries leading and serving in their militaries and coming together to try to determine how they can bring some of the lessons back to improve teamwork within their own militaries and their own countries,” she explained.

One thing that was evident throughout all the discussions was the common theme that the Department of Defense’s WPS Framework and Implementation Plan cannot be headed solely by women. Instead, it takes partnering with men in the profession of arms who are willing to lean forward, be open minded, and help implement positive changes that lead to stronger and more diverse organizations.

“I had the opportunity to hear the experiences of women who are pioneers in their countries' military services sharing experiences on the development of leaders,” said Brazilian Army Lt. Col. David Alencar who serves on the Brazilian Army Commander’s Personal Staff. “The experiences that were discussed make us reflect on the subject and drive us to want to implement these policies in our countries.”

Overall, everyone in attendance agreed that opportunities to discuss and further WPS strategies should happen more frequently.

“The decision the U.S. Army and participating armies have taken to have an event like this is great because these spaces give us the opportunity to continue enriching the subject of how to integrate women into security and defense,” said Ecuadorian Cpt. Elizabeth Munoz, Chief of Security and Accident Prevention for Army Signal. “I hope we can continue having these spaces so we can continue to have more and more women and men participate.”",

In 2000, the United Nations developed the Women’s Peace and Security (WPS) initiative fully recognizing the need for women to be included as a critical factor in achieving sustainable international peace and security. In full support of WPS, the Colombian army hosted a WPS panel discussion alongside U.S. Soldiers on Nov. 16, 2022 at the conclusion of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 at Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia.

Colombian army Sgt. Maj. Astrid Rubio Acosta, senior enlisted panel member and first female to hold the rank of sergeant major to serve in the Colombian army, used her opening remarks to provide words of encouragement to those in attendance speaking to the importance of setting goals and not allowing gender to get in the way of achieving those goals.

“Today, you must be fully convinced that you can do whatever it is you set out to do in your life,” she said. “It’s up to you to pave your own way and take your goals and find ways to achieve these goals.”

U.S. Army Maj. Kyle Ullmark, executive officer for the Illinois National Guard’s 2nd Battalion, 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, followed this by speaking to the importance leaders have in empowering their junior leaders and raising their confidence level to help them succeed both during their time in service as well as when they decide to move on to a new career outside of the military.

Colombian Women’s Day, which was celebrated just two days prior to the panel, is an annual celebration of women’s achievements in the country and recognizing women who serve as inspirations to the public. Commander of the Colombian National Army, Maj. Gen. Luis Mauricio Ospina Gutiérrez took a moment during his panel remarks to acknowledge one of his inspirations to continue serving.

“Sergeant Major Rubio, who is sitting on this panel with me, is one of the main examples that has been able to break the taboo of women serving in leadership roles as she is the first female to serve as a sergeant major in our army,” said Ospina. “It is because of her setting the example that new students at the NCO academy know now more than ever that anything is possible in their career.”

Leaders such Rubio and Lieutenant Katherine Romero, the Colombian army’s first female Huey II pilot who served as an aviation leader throughout Exercise Southern Vanguard 23, are certain to inspire soldiers for generations to come which many women did not have in the past.

U.S. Army Lt. Col. Michelle Martinez, Commander of U.S. Army South’s Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, recalled how her journey in the Army started with her having a small selection of female leaders to look up to.

“When I joined the Army 25 years ago, I did not think I would make to the position that I am,” she said. “Out of ten lieutenant colonels approximately four are selected for battalion command and of those four maybe one is a female but now the times have changed and the doors are open.”

Martinez continued by acknowledging how U.S. Southern Command’s Commanding General, Gen. Laura Richardson, is an inspiration and is paving the way for females serving in the Army today, including herself, to know that they can truly achieve anything they set their heart and mind to.

With more than 100 countries throughout the world including many who are not U.N. member nations currently having an implemented National Action Plan the importance of WPS on a global level cannot be overlooked and this panel is a small event that had a big impact on everyone in attendance.",

DORAL, Fla. — The U.S. Army South-led “Programa Integral para Suboficiales de Alta Jerarquía,” or PISAJ, concluded on Nov. 18, 2022, after 13 days of training, briefings from war-fighting functions and tours of facilities between Washington, D.C. and Miami.

“PISAJ is not just an exchange focused on personal development of the Colombian noncommissioned officers, but also the advancement of the entire Colombian NCO corps,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Ronald J. Graves, the U.S. Army South senior enlisted advisor. “It’s repetitive engagements like PISAJ that help us create a shared understanding through relationships and trust.”

With this iteration’s focus on modernization and leader development, 30 students and observers from both the Colombian and Mexican armies attended briefings from senior enlisted advisors from U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Defense Intelligence Agency, Women’s Peace and Security, Inter-American Defense College, Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation and other military organizations.

During the program, the class visited the Pentagon, the National Defense University, Special Operations Command South, Joint Interagency Task Force South, U.S. Southern Command and several other military facilities.

The impression this iteration of PISAJ has left on attendees will further progress their personal military development as well as the modernization of their militaries overall, said Colombian Army Sgt. Maj. Eli Mosquera Cruz.

“This experience with the U.S. Army has helped me better understand the role a sergeant major plays in developing individual soldiers and the army as an institution,” said Mosquera. “The wisdom gained and success we have achieved here is not only for the individuals attending but also for the sergeants major who will serve after us.”

One of the four female senior NCOs attending this iteration of PISAJ is the first female Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of Joint Chief of Staff of the Colombian military forces, Command Sgt. Maj. Consuelo Díaz Álvarez. She said every day her soldiers strengthen the capabilities of the Colombian NCO corps.

“Our sergeants major are leaving here stronger with wisdom and experience that will empower them to be better people and better leaders,” said Díaz. “Every day of PISAJ, we shared doctrine, reinforced our capabilities and learned lessons that will make us better advisors to the commanders of the Colombian army, and I know they will implement what they learned here to make our army stronger.”

Sgt. Maj. of the Colombian Army Mauricio Páez Acosta said the experiences and lessons learned during PISAJ are invaluable in providing a level of critical thinking necessary to lead soldiers.

“When a sergeant major comes to this program, they carry with them a different vision of how to lead their soldiers, facilitate the commander as well as how to influence the Colombian NCO corps,” said Páez. “As an advisor to the commander, we see things from a different perspective and we shine an opportunistic light on challenges he or she may face.”

Soldiers from the Illinois and Georgia National guard stood side by side with their Colombian Army counterparts one last time on the parade field of Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia during the closing ceremony of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23) on Nov. 16, 2022.

“I thank you for your professionalism, full dedication, and focused engagement throughout the week,” said U.S. Army South Commanding General, Maj. Gen. William Thigpen, as he spoke to the formation of more than 400 U.S. and Colombian Soldiers. “Our U.S. Soldiers participating from Georgia and Illinois National Guard were able to coordinate logistics, experience the rigors of Colombian Army’s training, and hone their squad and platoon level skills in Colombia’s challenging jungle terrain.”

Thigpen also took time to acknowledge Colombian Army’s Counternarcotics and Transnational Threats Command who trained alongside the U.S. Soldiers stating, “Your entire organization’s professionalism, tactical prowess, and enthusiastic approach to planning and executing this exercise was commendable.” He continued by saying, “I know your Army relies on your organization to conduct real-world missions every day, in a high-threat environment and the U.S. Army truly appreciates the opportunity to train with some of the finest Soldiers in this western hemisphere.”

Throughout the two-week exercise, U.S. and Colombian Army Soldiers used their previous training and experiences to collaborate and execute various situational training lanes including movement to contact, patrolling in dense jungle terrain, reacting to direct and indirect fire and medical treatment and evacuation techniques.

During the final day of training, Soldiers from both Armies put all they had learned to the test as the conducted a final combined assault operation which included an air insertion and navigating at night through the jungle during a torrential downpour.

Commander of the Colombian National Army, Maj. Gen. Luis Mauricio Ospina Gutiérrez spoke about the unique experience many of the Soldiers on the field had throughout the past two weeks and regarded the importance of the partnership that was further strengthened during ExSV23.

“I thank God allowing us to share this experience that enriches both of our nations capabilities,” he said. “The defense integration alliance with the United States of America is acknowledged as one of the most successful in the region and this training has helped to increase the level of training and interoperability of our Armies.”

The ever-increasing ability for the U.S. and Colombian Armies to work together through challenges was established during the Korean war and has garnered an increased level of interest in recent years.

“We have been developing this exercise annually alternating the headquarters between both countries,” he said. “It began in 2019 with the presence of a platoon from the South Carolina National Guard who trained alongside a platoon from the counter narcotics and trafficking brigade at this same facility and continued in 2021 when the counter narcotics and trafficking brigade conducted an exercise with the South Carolina National Guard at Fort Polk, Louisiana.”

The shared experience and insights that ExSV23 has provided for both Armies proves that this exercise was a success meeting all the training objectives laid out throughout the numerous planning conferences that led up to the past two weeks of execution.

Both Thigpen and Ospina concluded their remarks highlighting their eagerness to continue working together in the future at all levels and further building upon the already strong partnership the two Armies have established.",

CAMP SMITH TRAINING SITE, N.Y. – Forty-six 101st Expeditionary Signal Battalion Soldiers spent Oct. 24 to Nov. 7 ensuring their communications gear will keep Army command posts talking to each other when they deploy to the Middle East in 2023.

The Yonkers-based New York Army National Guard signal battalion will mobilize 344 Soldiers to deploy to Kuwait to support the Army’s Task Force Spartan Shield in August.

Before mobilizing, they had to ensure that the satellite communications equipment and other components of the battalion’s Warrior Information Network-Tactical system were working properly, according to Lt. Col. Paul Mulligan, battalion commander.

Mulligan said the 46 Soldiers who volunteered for the additional annual training spent two weeks identifying component and equipment shortages, updating software systems, ordering parts, and submitting work orders for items they could not fix.

“This event was crucial in identifying equipment issues so we can request resources to fix them,” Mulligan said.

The Soldiers worked on 126 pieces of equipment, including the communications systems, vehicles and generators.

The Warrior Information Network-Tactical system, or WIN-T, is the Army communication system of transmitters, receivers, routers, switches, modems and cables that allows Army units to securely transmit voice, data, text, video and graphic data.

Mulligan said the 101st can deploy 30 teams and equipment to link command posts from the battalion up to the theater level.

Along with making sure the equipment is working, the training also gave Soldiers a chance to learn more about the equipment, said 1st Lt. Manuel Baltazar from the battalion operations staff.

“This training is crucial to increasing our Soldiers’ readiness as operators for their equipment,” said Baltazar, a former enlisted Soldier who is deploying as the battalion plans officer. “They’re doing cross-training on equipment they have never operated before, so it’s helping really increase the unit’s knowledge overall.”

Army Spc. Domingo Perez, a New York City police officer in civilian life, said he appreciated the chance to learn more about the battalion’s systems while troubleshooting them.

Perez, a multichannel transmission systems operator and maintainer, said he was learning a lot about the Phoenix satellite terminals used to communicate over vast areas by digging into the technical manual, or TM.

“The TM is your best friend,” Perez said. “Go into it and learn the Phoenix, learn how to troubleshoot it. It is very productive.”

Pfc. Janaiya Alexander, a wheeled vehicle mechanic in the battalion’s Alpha Company, appreciated the opportunity to work on vehicles for an extended period.

“It’s great to have more than a weekend to work on the trucks and Humvees,“ Alexander said.

Mulligan said the next step for his Soldiers would be installing the parts that were ordered.

That gear will be used for the battalion’s pre-mobilization training and then packaged and shipped to Kuwait.

The Georgia Army National Guard’s Fort Benning-based Team 6120, Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 54th Security Forces Brigade, 648th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade deployed Oct. 30 to Nov. 18, 2022, to Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia to support and participate in Exercise Southern Vanguard 23.

Southern Vanguard 23 is an annual exercise conducted by U.S. Army South within the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility which trains units at the operational and tactical levels to increase coordination between the U.S. and Western Hemisphere forces, in this instance, Colombia.

A Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB) is a specialized United States Army unit formed to conduct security force assistance (SFA) missions: to conduct advise, support, liaise, assess operations at echelon to enable operations with allied and partner nations. SFABs are intended to reduce the burden of such operations on U.S. Special Forces organizations after extensive SFA missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, allowing them to focus on training and operating with allied and partner national elite units.

“Team 6120’s focus for Southern Vanguard is to increase Colombian Army’s capability and capacity to conduct mission command at the Battalion operational and tactical level,” said Maj. Chris Dumais, commander and team leader, Team 6120. “Our Advisor’s developed a Combined Staff training plan focusing on the NATO Seven-Step operational planning process and direct support during a Combined Task-Force exercise.”

As a result of the Advisor’s security force assistance effort to build the institutional knowledge for the Colombian Army to support future multinational, regional and combined/joint interoperability at the tactical level between Colombian allies and partner nations. Overall, in accordance with the Integrated Country Strategy of the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, the goal of Team 6120 is that U.S. forces are the partner of choice in future training and potential operations for the Colombian Army.

SFAB Team 6120 is a 12-Soldier team comprised of experts in maneuver, fires, intelligence, explosive hazards, and support who are embedded with the Colombian Army to increase their ability to work with U.S., NATO, and partner nations.

The primary focus of the SFAB’s during the exercise is to assist the Colombian’s ability to perform command and control duties of their force conducting operations throughout the exercise.

“Our combined level of experience working in forward environments and our level of training provide the Colombians with subject matter experts which improve their ability to focus their forces,” said Sgt. 1st Class Hector Umaña, operations noncommissioned officer, Team 6120.”

Additionally, the SFAB are validating the Colombian soldier’s communication plan at the tactical-level and utilizing new command and control devices such as the CivTak (Civilian Tactical Awareness Kit) to improve situational awareness of the platoon and squad leaders. The ability to understand and anticipate the operational picture assists leaders in understanding the operational picture and can exercise disciplined initiative in the absence of orders from higher.

“The ability to utilize the CivTak and validate their communication procedures ensure commanders at all levels have the proper information,” said Sgt. 1st Class Thomas Davant, fires support advisor, Team 6120. “It ensures they have a common operating picture.”

The partnership between the U.S. and Colombian Army dates back almost 70 years ago to the Korean War when the Colombian Battalion, (an infantry battalion of the Colombian Army that served under United Nations Command during the Korean War from 1951 to 1954) the first Colombian military unit to serve in Asia, was attached to the U.S. 7th Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Divisions under 8th Army. There we fought and sacrificed to defend the freedom of our ally. The Colombian Battalion suffered 163 killed in action, 448 wounded, 60 missing, and 30 captured over the course of the conflict.

One of the most important missions of Team 6120 is ensuring partnerships at the tactical level and improving relationships between the U.S. military and Colombian forces. Team 6120 has inserted members at the team-level of the Colombian Army to accomplish this.

“Colombian Soldiers are definitely interested in our operational experiences over the last twenty years, and we are learning how they operate in decentralized environments at the tactical level,” said Staff Sgt. Jose Hernandez, explosive hazards advisor, Team 6120. “They are some of the most professional and dedicated partner forces I’ve had the pleasure to work with.”",

Bilateral exercises are an important part of building relationships between nations and enhancing the abilities of partner nation armies to work together through various missions and problem sets. Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23), currently taking place at Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia, is U.S. Army South’s premier training exercise designed to accomplish these goals.

“The interoperability, opportunities and experiences for me and my guys can’t be understated,” said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Nate Myers, a squad leader assigned to 2nd Battalion, 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Illinois Army National Guard said when asked about the exercise. “An example of what we have learned is that here in the jungle terrain we have learned a lot from the Colombians on how to conduct operations from a different tactical formation than we normally do.”

Reciprocally, the Colombian Soldiers are taking full advantage of this learning opportunity ensuring they learn everything they can from their U.S. Army counterparts.

“The importance for us in this exercise is to have the opportunity to exchange knowledge with our partners in the U.S. Army,” said Colombian Army 1st Lt. Simon Mosquera who is working as an Observer, Controller and Trainer throughout ExSV23. “It also allows us to improve in our capabilities in order to save lives and defend our country.

The ability to share best practices for military operations between armies is invaluable for everyone involved but it is not the only thing taking place of value. The friendships and memories being made at the lowest levels are something that will be remembered far into the future.

Colombian Army Staff Sgt. Octavio Munoz, a platoon sergeant assigned to the BRNCA 1 Special Anti-Drug Brigade and Staff Sgt. Myers direct counterpart, talked about the friendships being made at the barracks when the Soldiers are resting from a long day of training. He said, “we have the opportunity to share with each other about our families including our parents, wives and kids.”

Munoz also talked about the U.S. Soldiers learning the traditional Colombian game “Rana” which involves tossing metal rings or coins into the mouths of frog statues from a short distance away. “At first they were not very good but each day they are playing with us in the barracks area and continue to get better,” he said.

“So far it’s been an excellent experience and everyone has been extremely welcoming and friendly,” explained Myers. “I think I can speak for the entire platoon when I say that since getting on the ground we have had the most friendly and welcoming environment and it has greatly contributed to our experience as well as our ability to train here together.”

When the Soldiers assigned to the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team eventually depart back to their home state of Illinois they will take with them knowledge, experiences and friendships that will last a lifetime with many of the Soldiers exchanging email address and have plans to stay in touch through social media in the future.",

More than 300 U.S. and Colombian soldiers stood tall in formation on the parade field of Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia, during the opening ceremony of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23). Exercise Southern Vanguard is U.S. Army South's premier annual training exercise taking place at the operational and tactical levels intended to increase interoperability between the United States and Western Hemisphere forces.

“Your role here in this exercise is the single-most important phase of building partnerships between nations.” said Brig. Gen. Rodney Boyd, Assistant Adjutant General for the Illinois Army National Guard, during his opening remarks at the ceremony. “Your work is what makes our militaries interoperable.”

He went on to explain some of what the Soldiers assigned to the 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Illinois Army National Guard and the 1st Battalion, 54th Security Force Assistance Brigade, Georgia Army National Guard can expect to experience working alongside their Colombian Army partners.

“Over the next week, the junior NCOs and company-grade officers will take the baton and develop the relationship between our two countries at the tactical level,” he said. “You will build deep personal connections as you conduct combined, company-level tactical operations.”

Brig. Gen. Fredy Coy, Colombian Army Chief of Staff of Operations, emphasized the relationship between the armies of the United States and Colombia and the history of their interoperability dating back more than 50 years ago.

“This relationship started a long time ago when we responded in Korea and conducted operations together,” he said during his remarks. “In Korea, this was the first time we were interoperable with our partner nations.”

While combined training exercises such as ExSV23 build upon the lethality, effectiveness and interoperability of all armies involved, the lasting friendships are equally important.

Boyd recalled his experience as a battalion commander training alongside the Ghanaian Army explaining that among his fondest memories are the friendships he made working alongside his Ghanian partners.

“To this day, I am in contact with a member of the Ghanian Army that I met during that exercise,” said Boyd. “Hopefully, you all will build similar memories over the course of the next week.”

Coy concluded his remarks by thanking the planners from both countries for developing and planning the exercise and by professing his hope that ExSV23 will be a great exercise for everyone involved.

As the ceremony ended, Soldiers from both Armies, instead of going their separate ways, lingered to discuss the training that lies ahead of them throughout the duration of the exercise.",

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — As she sat in her office reminiscing about her life journey to becoming a U.S. Army Soldier, Master Sgt. Kathryan Torres, U.S. Army South lead sexual assault response coordinator, shed a tear thinking about the recent passing of her father.

“My dad was the most inspirational person for me even though we didn’t always see eye to eye,” Torres said emotionally. “He came to California from Puerto Rico as a young man, barely able to speak English, to pursue his dreams.”

Her father’s adventuristic nature rubbed off on Torres who is the middle child of three sisters.

From Fajardo, Puerto Rico, Torres was interested in sports and being outdoors while her sisters were more concerned with making friends and going out.

“I just wanted to be outside, climbing trees, playing sports and getting dirty,” she said with a childish grin.

Between her father’s wanderlust and her mother’s stability, Torres had great yet opposite role models even though her parents divorced at a young age.

Her mother raised her and her sisters as a single parent and worked nights at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station while her daughters slept and as her mother slept during the day, Torres stepped in the caretaker role for her younger sister.

“My older sister went to live with our grandmother, so my younger sister sees me a lot like her second mother,” Torres said proudly. “I did a lot of the housework, yard work and by age seven I could cook a full course meal.”

Her parents put a huge focus on education in and out of the home. Her mother pushed for her daughters to speak proper English at home and her father pushed them to achieve a university education.

Torres graduated high school at 17 years old and got a scholarship for a university in Puerto Rico, but her father encouraged her to attend Mount Saint Mary’s University in California where he worked.

“Making the choice to leave behind everything and everyone that I knew and loved was very difficult, and I was very overwhelmed by the college culture,” said Torres. “It definitely was not what I expected, so I was there for about a semester before going back to Puerto Rico.”

When she returned to Fajardo, she found herself alone. Her sisters had moved, her mother had joined the Navy Reserves and relocated to Florida, and she had no other blood relatives in her hometown.

She began practicing cosmetology at a local barber shop and working as a manager of a grocery store, but after a few years she was unsatisfied with where her journey had taken her.

“Being back home, I wasn’t hanging around a good crowd,” she said. “People I knew and grew up with were getting locked up for drugs or crime or even getting killed. It was one of those moments where I looked around and said, ‘I have so much more to offer, so what am I doing here?’”

Torres said she always wanted to be an agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Drug Enforcement Agency or serve in the military. The fastest way for her to escape the bad situation she was in was to join the Army.

She enlisted as an Ammunition Specialist in September 2005, and shipped off to Basic Combat Training, or BCT, as soon as she could.

“After I graduated from BCT and Advanced Individual Training, my first duty station was Fort Carson, Colorado, and I got there in February,” Torres said anxiously. “I had never experienced winter, so I left Puerto Rico in a tank top, shorts and flip flops. Right before we landed, the pilot said it was nine degrees in Colorado Springs.”

Torres said she was blessed with patient leadership that gave her time to acclimate to the new climate and although it took her some time to get used to the very different weather from Puerto Rico, Torres quickly adapted to the military lifestyle.

Torres deployed to Iraq October of 2006 and then again June 2010, both in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Those deployments taught her a lot about the people she surrounded herself with.

“What I learned the most was that the people you need behind you in battle and in life are always going to be there whether it’s family or battle buddies,” she said. “You have to learn how to lean on them.”

Torres said her first deployment was very different from her second due to the arrival of her son.

“My first deployment I was on a forward operating base in southeast Baghdad, and my parents kept telling me, ‘Please don't go over there and be a hero,’ because they knew that is who I am as a person,” she said. “The second, I was on a personal security detachment so I was on the road a lot, but my son wasn't even two years old. So being away from him was really hard.”

Her son’s father was also deployed in Iraq at the time and contracted a severe case of meningitis. Due to security concerns in the region, she was not able to receive updates on his status.

“It was a lot to deal with on top of the stress of completing the mission,” Torres expressed. “I did a lot of meditating during that deployment, because I was the rear vehicle commander and when we went out the gates, my team needed me to be focused. I learned I could handle a lot more stress than I could have ever imagined and still perform under the pressure of combat.”

After her deployments, Torres went through the U.S. Army Drill Sergeant Academy in Fort Jackson, South Carolina to help transform civilian volunteers to become Combat Engineers.

During her time at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, she noticed something wasn’t right with her daughter.

“I was supposed to get stationed in Hawaii, but my daughter, who was about one year old, began regressing in her development,” she said. “I thought she might be autistic, and there was an opening at Army South on Joint Base San Antonio - Fort Sam Houston which is the main post for medical across all branches. So, I took the position, arrived here, and ultimately she was diagnosed with autism.”

Fortunately, she was able to get all the medical treatment her daughter needed, but Torres needed the support of her family once again as her mission required her to travel often. Her mother assisted with childcare as she traveled all over Central and South America and the Caribbean.

Torres was able to receive a compassionate assignment into her current position to allow for continued medical treatment for her daughter.

Through all of her assignments, deployments and missions, Torres attributes her triumphs and successes to the support of her family, friends and battle buddies. Specifically, her mother, Tammy, and her two sisters, Jennifer and Tamara, who stepped up to care for her children throughout the years and always pushed her to be the leader she was meant to be.

“I've always had an amazing support system back home from my family and friends and in the military as well,” Torres said with a smile. “When you have that, it makes all this pretty easy. I mean 17 years in the Army has gone by pretty quick, and the rest of my story is still being written.”",

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – U.S. Army South’s staff officers, noncommissioned officers and civilians had the opportunity to take part in the first iteration of the U.S. Army War College’s (USAWC) mobile Theater Army Staff Course Sept. 12-16. Participants ranged from those who arrived within the last two weeks to those who had been assigned to the headquarters for over a year.

The five-day course consists of over thirty briefings from USAWC faculty and included instruction from Army South directorate leads with the first block of instruction focusing on the history of Theater Armies.

“The Theater Army is an essential headquarters that the Army provides to the joint commanders, in this case [U.S.] Southern Command, in order to do all manner of functions that the Army provides to all joint commanders and joint headquarters,” stated retired Army Col. John A Bonin.

Bonin, a distinguished fellow of the Center for Strategic Leadership, elaborated on what makes the Theater Army unique.

“Unlike most Army headquarters it has at least two bosses,” he explained. “It has an Army boss, the Department of the Army, for resources, guidance and for supervision and Army functions, but they also support and work directly for a joint commander who are all four-star combatant commanders.”

Throughout the week, participants were given the opportunity to dialogue and query instructors on best practices when operating at this level of command.

Sgt. Maj. Juan Rivera, Army South G2 Sergeant Major, was thankful for the opportunity to learn from the USAWC faculty and senior Army South directorate leads.

“It allowed me to understand how my directorate integrates into the broader Theater Army mission as well as how we work with other directorates to meet the CG’s intent,” he said. “I also learned that it’s really hard for us to get resources so the job for the staff is to negotiate on behalf of the command to get the resources we need to accomplish our missions.”

The course was led by a senior mentor, retired Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, who provided critique and analysis throughout the day-to-day instruction.

“We want to help new members of the team understand what sort of organization they’re a part of, because there is always an assimilation process, and we can help accelerate that by giving them a better appreciation of the challenges and the requirements of that particular command,” emphasized MacFarland.

He went on to express the complexities facing Theater Armies today which include refocusing doctrine to large scale combat operations (LSCO) as well as gaps that Army South specifically has that are important to the overall mission of an Army Service Component Command/Theater Army.

He further explained that his team’s intent was to explore those challenges and help the Army South team begin the process of creating solutions for those challenges identified during the course.

MacFarland expressed how an economy of force theater like Army South, which is severely-resource constrained, requires creative and innovative thinking to accomplish the mission in front of them.

“The big challenge in this theater of operations is perhaps declining Russian influence but growing Chinese influence. This is our front yard and it’s important for us to continue to ensure that the western hemisphere remains an American hemisphere,” he said. “The key terrain here is obviously the Panama Canal, which is so essential to our war plans in the Pacific and Europe and the ability to shift resources between them. It was critical in the second world war, and it will remain critical throughout the 21st Century.”

MacFarland also discussed Army South’s role in the geostrategic balance of power within the region.

“We also need to make sure we don’t have any malign influence causing us problems in our front yard driving ever higher levels of migration, criminal activities, intelligence collection against us and destabilizing of our partner nations,” he said. “We must ensure, despite a scarcity of resources, none of that happens, and at the same time disrupt China’s plan for extending its Belt and Road initiative across the globe.”

Army South as an organization has evolved over the decades with roots stemming from the Caribbean Defense Command, U.S. Army Caribbean, to an eventual merger with Sixth United States Army in 2008.

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO - FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – The smell of food, sounds of music and traditional dancing were on display as the Soldiers and civilians assigned to United States Army South (ARSOUTH) officially kicked off National Hispanic Heritage Month on the morning of Sept. 16, 2022 with a celebration of culture in front of the headquarters building.

National Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated annually from Sept. 15 – Oct. 15 since it was expanded from its original week-long celebration by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. The mid-month start and end dates are significant to Hispanic heritage with five countries celebrating their independence on Sept. 15 along with numerous others throughout the date range.

“It’s important to celebrate all history and culture and our Army would not be what it is today with the contributions and successes of Hispanic Americans,” explained Sgt. 1st Class James Davis, U.S. Army South’s Equal Opportunity Advisor and National Hispanic Heritage Month celebration event coordinator. “Their contributions throughout history are found throughout the Army including right here at Army South, which can be seen in our Hall of Honor where we inducted retired Lieutenant General Marc Cisneros earlier this year.”

During his service, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Cisneros served as the commanding general of ARSOUTH and Joint Task Force Panama during Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 and 1990 which led to the successful capture of Gen. Manuel Noriega.

The theme of this year’s celebration is Unidos – Inclusivity for a Stronger Nation. According to the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) website, Unidos can be translated to mean “united,” “connected” or “close.”

“We are a multicultural Army made up of Soldiers from all backgrounds and walks of life, so I believe Unidos is a great word to sum up the celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month,” said Davis. “Throughout our Army and throughout Army South this concept is an important aspect of who we are, and it truly makes us a stronger more cohesive unit.”

Dr. Hector Martinez, guest speaker for the event said, “Hispanic cultures around the world are unique in their own ways but share a common core of similarities; a certain inner-pride in what it means to be Hispanic.”

He continued his remarks by recognizing two Hispanic American leaders, Medal of Honor recipient Master Sgt. Leroy Petry and community activist Lizzie Vasquez, and by challenging those in attendance to follow their lead and make a difference in their community whether they are Hispanic American or not.

With a month dedicated to celebrating the achievements, histories, contributions and cultures of Americans with Hispanic ancestry, ARSOUTH will benefit greatly by having a more profound understanding of the partner nations they work with on a regular, sometimes daily, basis.

ARSOUTH’s area of responsibility encompasses 31 nations and 15 areas of special sovereignty with almost 500 million people speaking over 100 different languages. Soldiers and civilians assigned to the command regularly travel throughout the region building and strengthening relationships with many of these countries promoting unity and cooperation throughout the Western Hemisphere.

“It’s good for non-Latin American U.S. citizens to know what their neighbors are like, what their culture and backgrounds are and to understand that the fusion of our culture brings about something beautiful,” explained Mexican American Maj. Teddy Villasenorloya, one of ARSOUTH’s Foreign Area Officers. “Whether it’s professional engagements or military engagements, we can go out there and make friends with everybody since we know each other’s backgrounds.”

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Representatives from U.S. Army South traveled to Honduras to lead a Central American Working Group meeting during a three-day event held from September 7-9, 2022.

The CENTAM Working Group includes armies from three Latin American nations: El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The event marked the third time all participating nations gathered to continue coordinating efforts for 2023 and proposing future events for 2024 through 2027.

Honduran Gen. Jose Luis Sauceda Sierra, Commander of Joint Doctrine and Military Education, welcomed all participating nations to the country and emphasized the importance of working together to increase capabilities.

“With this we become more efficient and perform better in all of the exercises, this way we would have better results allowing us to improve our capabilities to support our force and improve their professionalism,” said Sauceda Sierra.

Lt. Col Miguel A. Gonzalez, International Military Affairs Chief for Army South Security and Cooperation Division and the head of the delegation for the U.S. Army, thanked Honduras for their hospitality and highlighted the importance of the meeting.

“The purpose of the CENTAM Working Group is to strengthen the bilateral and multilateral relationship and develop capabilities of mutual interest to counter the proliferation of threat networks and respond to crises that threaten regional stability,” said Gonzalez.

After introductions, each army provided a brief overview of their operations and explained challenges they have faced during the previous year. In addition to the overviews, the working group discussed lessons learned from CENTAM Guardian 22 to help with the success of CENTAM Guardian 2023.

CENTAM Guardian is a multinational exercise designed to increase rapid response, security operations and strengthen hemispheric cooperation and collaboration, explained Marco V. Rosito, CENTAM desk officer in Security and Cooperation Division for Army South.

“We realize there are common issues affecting the region and if we address them together we would be more effective than addressing them as individual countries,” said Rosito.

The three-day working group closed with proposals, objectives and activities for support from now until 2027, and finished with the signing of the minutes signaling the commitment for the armies to continue cooperating.

“Through this event we support and cooperate with our regional partners to improve our border security efforts,” closed Gonzalez.

The next CENTAM Working Group meeting is the gathering of principals where they will review and approve the staff work and activities coordinated for the next year.",

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — Summer is here and it’s a busy time for U.S. Army personnel and families as they move to their next assignment. Despite domestic improvements regarding COVID-19, the pandemic still proves problematic in other parts of the world and continues to affect the shipping industry.

In response, the U.S. Transportation Command, U.S. Army and the Army Sustainment Command are working hard to continuously improve the permanent change of station process for its customers and family members.

“The pandemic has impacted all sectors of the global market. Ports, port agents, customs, trucking, rail and shipping are all part of those sectors that have been impacted by the pandemic, and they continue to see shortfalls in labor, drivers, material, fuel, increased operating costs as well as other operational resources,” said Col. Courtney Abraham.

Abraham serves as the director of the Army Personal Property Lead Element — or APPLE — and commander of ASC’s Joint Personal Property Shipping Offices-Mid Atlantic, or JPPSO-MA.

Located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, APPLE is the Army’s lead integrating organization in the Defense Personal Property Program and the collective Joint Enterprise. Its mission is to plan, manage and provide technical oversight to Army Personal Property Shipping and Processing Offices globally.

APPLE maintains operational control of both JPPSOs located at Fort Belvoir and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. JPPSO-MA is one of six Army-led shipping offices. This organization executes personal property movement services to authorized personnel within a specified area of responsibility. The JPPSO-MA supports shipments within portions of 12 states, including the Washington, D.C. area.

This PCS season brings many improvements compared to previous years, said Abraham. USTRANSCOM has adjusted domestic and international transit times to provide better predictability and expectation management for Soldiers and families for delivery of their household goods, he said.

“All overseas PCS locations could be impacted, no one greater than another,” Abraham said. “The Personal Property enterprise continues to monitor changes in the global supply chain closely and continually communicates with our industry partners in order to implement the best business practices to support our Soldiers and families.”

In late 2020, ASC began equipping units with tablets specifically to aid quality assurance inspectors in the field. “Quality assurance inspectors can perform operations and reporting while on the road, utilizing their WiFi-enabled tablets, mobile devices or hotspots,” Abraham explained.

Tablets allow inspectors to reach more customers in the duty day, as well as to immediately provide customers with resources, handouts and report findings into the USTRANSCOM system of record without having to return to a traditional office.

Additionally, the Army has a 75% onsite physical inspection standard by quality assurance personnel, surpassing the Defense Transportation Regulation standard of 50%. The Army currently has an 87% physical inspection rate, meaning an inspector has provided in-person representation at time of pack, pickup or delivery.

Abraham detailed the following changes to the overall PCS process that have been implemented since May 2021:

Improving inventories : “We are working with the moving companies to shift from paper copies of inventories and use electronic inventories to the greatest extent possible. This will provide an improved record of the household goods pack-out and the condition they were in when packed. This effort is to accelerate the inventory and accountability process of household goods, eliminate paper copy exchanges, and enable digital transmission and storage of the inventory records offering better services to members and families when moving. Electronic inventories will be mandatory in 2023.”

Also known as ‘spread dates,’ this refers to the seven-day window during which your moving company is required to pick up your shipment. This policy is designed to give you more control over requesting a specific date range to schedule your move.”

: “The moving company will identify points of contact and email the Soldier/family with that information to facilitate better communication before, during and after the move, improving the overall PCS experience.” Simplifying claims : “Created a standardized form to simplify filing an inconvenience claim across the DOD.

In the past, the threshold was 60% of the total shipment.”

: “Moving companies are already required to place seals on containers, but we’re adding a requirement that customers be notified if any seals are broken, that seals be replaced, and that these actions and communications are noted in the record.” Better communication : “Increased service provider availability by phone – added Saturday customer support requirement during peak of the relocation period; provider must return calls on same business day and wait times cannot exceed 20 minutes. Additionally, movers are required to provide customers a 24-hour notice of delivery and make two attempts to contact the customer, with each attempt at least six hours apart, before transferring the customer’s shipment to storage-in-transit.”

Simplified convenience claims processing; improved in-transit visibility; single point of contact with moving companies; and have choice to repair or receive repair costs for damages, including full replacement cost.”

process reduces travel payments to less than two days. The Basic Allowance for Housing rate is in effect at all 40 on-base Intercontinental Hotel Groups Army Hotel locations in the U.S. through the end of fiscal 2022.

IHGs have agreed to only charge Soldiers at their BAH rate when they must stay in temporary lodging for extended periods of time due to housing or household good delivery challenges.

MILPER Message 22-0045 (CAC-enabled): Allows commanders the flexibility to change report dates by 30 days either before or after the initial report date, or up to 60-day deferment working with the Installation Directorate of Human Resources to get approval.

Despite all these improvements and bearing aforementioned challenges in mind, Abraham said the Soldier still has much input regarding how successful a PCS can be. He recommended Soldiers always do the following to ensure their PCS goes as smooth as possible:

Once orders are received, visit the installation transportation office immediately to receive household goods counseling and complete shipment application(s).

Communicate challenges with chain of command early, so they can assist and work with the installation transportation office to identify all possible options to support the Soldier and their family; there are several choices available to Soldiers and families to support challenges during their PCS Move.

Provide feedback via the Customer Satisfaction Survey. As of May 15, all customers are now asked to complete a brief survey via text message regarding various milestones throughout their move — entitlement counseling, pack/pickup, delivery and claims.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas – U.S. Army South hosted component planners and military representatives from seven Caribbean and South American countries for PANAMAX 2022 Planning in Crisis (PIC) training here from 6-10 June, 2022.

PANAMAX 2022 is a U.S. Southern Command-sponsored, multinational annual exercise scheduled for 1-12 August, 2022 with a purpose of strengthening partnerships, enhancing readiness and improving interoperability between U.S. Armed Forces and partner nations. This planning event served as an opportunity to build upon the combined capabilities of planning and executing complex operations during the upcoming exercise.

“One of our number one priorities is always partnership,” said Maj. Gen. William Thigpen, commanding general of U.S. Army South and PANAMAX 2022 commanding general of multinational forces. “Although we come from different countries, different services and we speak different languages we’ve got to develop a very common framework and sight picture on how we see our planning process.”

Chilean Army Logistics Division Commander and Deputy Commanding General of Multinational Forces for PANAMAX 2022, Maj. Gen. Ricardo Stangher, said the PIC is an opportunity for all of the military branches of partner nation forces to practice the planning process and procedures together as well as share common doctrine.

“During this exercise, we have been able to engage with partner nations and their staff to exchange views and establish professional bonds which will carry forward in a future scenario that will require a multinational response,” said Stangher. “Training together in this PIC exercise brings us closer to having a greater certainty regarding the efficiency of the joint planning procedures that could eventually be applied in a situation that affects regional security.”",

It was February 2022 when Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Grinston announced that in conjunction with the annual U.S. Army Best Warrior competition the Army would also conduct the inaugural U.S. Army Best Squad Competition.

Throughout the Army, squads immediately began training hoping to be selected to represent their division in September with the goal of being recognized as the best squad in the Army.

For Staff Sgt. Reycel Dasher, an infantryman serving as one of the many noncommissioned officers on the U.S. Army South staff, this opportunity presented an additional challenge in order to compete, he didn’t have a squad to lead.

“I had very little time to prepare once I had identified my squad but the second I identified them we started training on EIB and ESB tasks,” he said as he explained that U.S. Army South doesn’t work in traditional infantry squads. “I immediately started doing PT with them and asking them general knowledge and it was different because they came from different backgrounds as far as how long they have been in the Army.”

Leading a squad is something Dasher has done in the past, so his experience helped gear his training and boost his confidence even though the squad was assembled from different sections of U.S. Army South.

“It was difficult because it was short notice,” explained Dasher. “I’m also the only infantryman in our squad and the rest of them are geospatial engineers that I don’t really work with.”

He further explained that working with new Soldiers happens regularly in a traditional infantry squad as Soldiers are promoted or are moved for various reasons. While working with newly assigned Soldiers wasn’t new to Dasher, this type of competition was new.

Not knowing what to expect in a squad-oriented competition made the first day a bit of a shock when the teams arrived and immediately took a written exam as individuals.

“Next time I will put a little more focus on practicing board questions since that is how this competition started out with a written test,” he said. “It had a lot of general knowledge but things you may not have thought about in a long time.”

Once his team got in the swing of competing, he felt better about the chances his squad had of not only competing well but potentially winning.

“So far, I think our squad is doing really good. It looks like we are killing it out there and at least with the ACFT I know we had a good squad average,” Dasher explained at the end of the first full day of competition.

With the rest of the competition remaining unknown he had one final thing to say when asked about how he was feeling.

“I’m just taking it as it comes and not trying to fatigue my body too much and I’m definitely having fun and I will definitely try to do this again in the future as a squad leader.”",

“If I was a civilian at the same timeframe my mom passed away, I would’ve acted out way differently than I would have now,” said White, an automated logistics specialist assigned to U.S. Army South. “As a civilian, I would have just not gone back to work at all. But with the military, while I was on leave people were texting me, ‘when are you coming back? We need help!’”

White was born in Korea where she spent most of her childhood. Oftentimes, she has been mistaken as Pacific Islander, but she was born to a Korean mom and a dad of Black and Native American descent.

Joshua White with their mother Kim Tongsun in Songtang, South Korea in 1993. (Photo Credit: Courtesy Photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

“I grew up in an Asian household,” said White. “Even though my dad was American, he speaks Korean.”

In 2012, White joined the Army National Guard at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania. In 2016 she began serving active duty and was stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Carson, Colorado; U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, South Korea; and completed a nine-month rotation in Europe.

“In Korea, all of my Soldiers were straight out of [advanced individual training] and never left their barracks, so I found ways to get them out, and I was their tour guide,” said White. “It felt good to do something like that because it reminds me of my mom who was like that. She was always happy and always helping people. So It makes my day when I know I’m able to help my Soldiers.”

White, whose goal is to become a warrant officer or a first sergeant, said being in the Army has given her purpose and drive and has taught her resiliency. She plans to serve every day carrying on her mother’s legacy and following in her footsteps.

“Even though my mom was really tiny, she has really big shoes to fill,” said White. “I feel like my mom was the perfect person, and people can’t be perfect. But, when everyone says the same thing about my mom and how she impacted so many people in her life, I want to do things for people the way she did.”",

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (May 23, 2022) - In recent years, Latin America and Caribbean countries have suffered major environmental disasters whether by torrential hurricanes or catastrophic earthquakes in the region, causing floods and landslides that left thousands of people displaced and a high human death toll. During a two-week period in 2020, Guatemala and Honduras were slammed by Hurricanes Eta and Iota which led U.S. Army South to deploy Soldiers to the region to assist in humanitarian assistance efforts.

As part of Army South’s mission to respond and be ready in disaster situations, the command facilitated the first-ever CENTAM GUARDIAN exercise held May 1-20, to build readiness, resilience and confidence across the Central American region.

“This exercise is an important opportunity to build the capacity of our armies and critical civilian support organizations,” said Col. Chip Karels, Army South G3/7 director of training and exercises (TREX). “Each of the three phases of the exercise were designed to build both capability and capacity from the tactical, Soldier skills level to multi-national disaster response.”

G7 TREX planners led the planning effort for CENTAM GUARDIAN 22, but Karels mentioned creating the exercise was an Army South team effort across the command with planners from other directorates providing crucial support in their areas of expertise.

Divided into three phases, CENTAM GUARDIAN consisted of a field training exercise (FTX), a humanitarian assistance and disaster response table-top exercise (TTX) and an operational command post exercise.

The FTX involved U.S. Soldiers from 7th Special Forces Group, Puerto Rico Army National Guard, and 60 Soldiers from the Salvadorian Army. The FTX consisted of basic Soldier skills including first aid, movement, land navigation, and basic rifle marksmanship.

“The multi-national nature of CENTAM GUARDIAN inevitably led to challenges based on competing requirements and the diverse areas of training within each event,” Karels said. “The support from the partner nations was excellent and it was only through their significant efforts that the exercise was able to succeed.”

Prior to the TTX, the participants received two days of academic classes to review their basic knowledge of urban search and rescue methodologies to prepare them for the disaster scenario.

“It’s not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’” said Jesus Escalona, Costa Rica Red Cross director of operations, expressing the reality of natural disasters which takes place in the region. For the TTX, the scenario involved an earthquake causing major damage in El Salvador; to include building collapses, trapped survivors and landslides.

“We’re evaluating the process for El Salvador to see how well they will do when their resources come to an end because of the damage,” Escalona said. “We want to see how they can get resources from Honduras and Guatemala, but in real life, it may be any other country that comes to their aid.”

He emphasized the responders must have interoperability between their nations when requesting for resources and quickly be able to navigate around “the bureaucracy and red tape” in order to get aid, equipment and other resources they need.

During the After Action Review several agencies noted deficiencies with plans, processes, and authorities within their organizations. They agreed to work the issues and test them at next year’s CENTAM GUARDIAN 23 exercise.

Evaluation from the academics portion and the table-top exercise provided Hernan Ramos, group leader, Search and Rescue Unit, Permanent Contingency Commission (COPECO) of Honduras, to reevaluate his organization’s practices on urban search and rescue.

COPECO is part of a Central American network of government disaster relief agencies known as the Coordination Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters in Central America.

“We are able to look at our current standard operating procedures, the equipment we have, and examine how we jointly work with another country in the event we would have to have a multinational response,” Ramos said. “An earthquake that happens in Honduras, for example, could have devastating impacts on our neighboring countries as well. This exercise allows for all the responders to speak the same language.”

With new members as part of the COPECO team, Ramos saw the TTX as an opportunity to stress those newcomers who have not yet participated in a real-life crisis.

“The objective is to give them a better understanding and some experience here, so when a real disaster happens, they’ll have some knowledge on the systems to react,” he said. “Those of us with more experience also get a chance to refresh and recollect best practices; and share our experiences with our new team members.”

According to Karels, the CPX was designed to develop collaboration and information sharing opportunities to combat against transnational organized threats. Honduras and Guatemala participated with brigade headquarters elements, with El Salvador worked at the battalion level.

The CPX was structured around a coordination cell manned by liaison officers from all three partner nation armies. Events were injected into a national headquarters, processed and then passed to the coordination cell. The coordination cell turned the data into information and passed it to the appropriate national headquarters to process for action.

The CPX and HA/DR TTX were supported by Soldiers from the 321st Civil Affairs Brigade and the 54th Security Forces Assistance Brigade.

During the closing ceremony, Brig. Gen. Lynn M. Heng, Army South deputy commanding general, praised the Salvadorans for hosting the exercise and highlighted the significance of the training.

“I thank our El Salvadoran hosts and everyone who has worked so hard bringing this exercise to life – it was truly a tremendous training event,” Heng said. “The importance of this cannot be overstated since most humanitarian missions occur on short notice and we simply never know when we could find ourselves working together in the future. Our ability to coordinate and respond collectively as a region to facilitate the timely arrival of humanitarian assistance will certainly support the effort to save lives and alleviate suffering.”

With the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season on the horizon, Ramos mentioned he was appreciative of the U.S. Army for coordinating CENTAM GUARDIAN 22. As he prepared for departing El Salvador back to Honduras, he felt his team benefitted from the training scenarios would be ready “if and when” a natural disaster strike.

“Having the U.S. Army coordinate this exercise is great, coming from a technical and economic stance, because the regional countries don’t have a lot of support,” Ramos said. “For us, having an ally that has the technical capability, financial power and experience in the field is a great help for us to strengthen our national capacity in terms of emergency management.”",

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — “In traditional military operations we need to be able to shoot, move and communicate. We need to identify key positions, know the terrain and know enemy capabilities. Cybersecurity is the same concept,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Luis D. Nieves, a U.S. Army cyber defender assigned to the U.S. Army 915th Cyber Warfare Battalion. Nieves was chosen as an Army expert during a recent cyber defense subject matter expertise exchange between the U.S. and Argentine armies.

Personnel from U.S. Army South coordinated this three-day exchange with the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Directorate to share how U.S. Army cyber defense plays a role in military operations and defense of the nation.

“We had U.S. Soldiers engaging with the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Division personnel at all echelons from strategic leadership, action officer to the analyst level,” said Sgt. Maj. Albert Dernberger, Army South Fires and Effects Directorate senior enlisted advisor. “It is a very collaborative environment when we talk about cyber and trying to figure out how the adversary maneuvers in that space, so we learn a lot from each other.”

Dernberger explained that we look at cyber partnerships as key players in developing a holistic defensive posture.

“Other countries see similar threats, together we can identify tactics, techniques and procedures of the adversary, and use those things to bolster our security, and in return we are providing that information back through various mechanisms so our partners can bolster their security as well,” he said.

Col. Luis P. Guimpel, director of the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Division led the Argentine army during the exchange and will also serve as the cyber operations cell lead during the annual PANAMAX exercise taking place at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, in August 2022. PANAMAX is a multinational exercise that provides training opportunities for nations to work together and build the capability to plan and conduct complex multinational operations.

“We have always been partners, and these events continue to build that partnership,” said Guimpel.

U.S. Army South has a long-lasting relationship with partner nation armies’ cyber communities of interest and work with cyber professionals in the region to build cybersecurity capacities and capabilities through exchanges, offering opportunities to participate in international cyber conferences and participation in cyber cells during multinational and bilateral exercises.

“We learned a lot about the Argentine army’s challenges with defending their military networks from cyber attacks, and we were able to discuss some of the shared challenges such as talent retention and organizational development,” said Dernberger.

As the exchange came to a close, Guimpel shared knowledge from one of his military professors during his time as a young army lieutenant.

“No one person or organization can know everything,” he said. “That piece of information holds true today, over 30 years later. It is imperative that we continue to come together and share information so we can continue strengthening our defenses.”",

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – U.S. Army South hosted the 7th annual Peru-U.S. Army Staff Talks at the U.S. Army South headquarters May 16-18 where delegations from the Peruvian and U.S. armies reviewed over 100 agreed-to-actions to take place over the next six years.

The U.S. Army Staff Talks Program serves as a bilateral forum for strategic-level discussion between respective armies to develop professional partnerships and increase interaction between partner nation armies.

“The staff talks allow us to, above all, establish mutual trust (and) to develop our intuitional transformation plan,” said Lt. Gen. David Ojeda Parra Peruvian Army chief of staff. “This is our third institutional transformation plan, which is the second transformation plan that has received support from the United States Army. That complements our efforts strongly because we are aiming toward the same goals, interests and shared values.”

During these talks, the U.S. Army works to develop activities with our partners in an effort to work together toward common goals. Agreed-to-actions can include anything from joint engineer projects, exchange programs between elite military schools, subject matter expert exchanges, doctrine exchanges, research and development cooperation and exercises.

“One of the engagements Army South is helping to facilitate between the Peruvian army and the U.S. Army Core of Engineers is a civil military emergency preparedness program,” said Maj. Allan M. Blair, U.S. Army South political-military plans officer.

“Support for emergency and risk management is one of the objectives we both want to achieve. We created the first multipurpose brigade, which has received support from Army South. The intent is to achieve a brigade-sized force interoperable with the U.S. Army,” said Ojeda.

Blair mentioned other efforts are underway for the next several years to include helping the Peruvian army modernize their doctrine and transform their human resources management systems.

As part of the Peruvian Army’s transformation plan, Army South G1 Director Col. Stewart J. VanBuren will lead a delegation from U.S. Army South along with senior members from the Peruvian Army’s Directorate of Personnel Resources to the U.S. Army Human Resources Command at Fort Knox, Kentucky.

“This engagement supports the Peruvian Army’s 13-year plan to completely transform the processes and products by which their Soldiers are managed, assigned, schooled, retained and retired,” said Lt. Col. Jason C. Atkinson, Army South chief of human resources, plans. “The significance of these activities is we apply the tenets of Lean Six Sigma and continuous process improvement to the Peruvian Army’s human resources doctrine, policies and methods. The end result will be an improved process management to better support interoperability between the United States and Peru.”

As a result of the staff talks, the Peruvian army also plans to participate as observers in Exercise Southern Vanguard in Colombia and Brazil. The Peruvian army also plans to conduct an iteration of the multi-lateral exercise in Peru in 2028.",

SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras – U.S. Army South finished a contingency command post (CCP) deployment exercise here on May 19, to increase readiness for upcoming contingencies in the U.S. Southern Command’s (SOUTHCOM) area of operations.

During the nine-day forward exercise, over 60 Soldiers from Army South, 470th Military Intelligence Brigade, 410th Contracting Support Brigade (410th CSB), and 56th Signal Battalion set up the CCP tactical operations center, tactical satellite communications, and participated in several operations and intelligence briefs with Army South, U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) and 410th CSB to rehearse their staff function as SOUTHCOM’s command and control element during contingency operations.

“There were metrics that [the CCP team] had to meet to ensure that they could deploy and be an operational command post in an austere environment,” said Brig. Gen. Lynn Heng, Army South deputy commanding general. “In the future, we will build upon that and bring in some more entities and organizations to build out our capabilities.”

Contingency operations are large-scale and require a coordinated U.S. government response, and training like this is key to ensuring that all participants are prepared in case a real-world crisis takes place.

The CCP will support SOUTHCOM, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), other federal agencies and non-governmental organizations during humanitarian crises, natural disasters and other contingency operations in the Caribbean, Central and South America.

“The BHA is the lead federal coordinator of international humanitarian response, and that means USAID has the mandate to assume that leadership position and determine the strategy and approach for U.S. government response of pulling in the relevant interagency support if required.” said Kaitlyn Neuberger, USAID’s humanitarian assistance advisor to the military at SOUTHCOM. “In order for the military to get involved the Department of Defense (DoD) must provide a unique capability or service that can’t be provided by civilian organizations.”

Neuberger went on to say unique and rapid DoD capabilities like air traffic control, transportation and civil engineering are most commonly necessary during natural disasters like the 2010 Haiti earthquake and Hurricanes Matthew and Iota.

Contingency operations are multifaceted, which is why the CCP trains and rehearses to deploy expeditiously. Maj. Sean Buchanan, CCP operations officer in charge, said there are communication and logistical requirements to accomplish mission success during humanitarian or disaster relief.

“This size element hasn’t deployed since the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and a lot of internal and external logistical coordination went into getting here and back for this deployment exercise, so it was a balancing act between the movement of equipment and personnel,” said Buchanan. “Once we were on the ground, we were able to integrate as a staff to get everything set up and establish communications within just over 24 hours of arrival.”

Setting up communications enables the joint task force commander to have situational awareness of what is happening on the ground and relay that information to all other entities involved.

Chief Warrant Officer Morgan McCarty, CCP network operations chief, said without having efficient communication between all agencies involved in a mission, they would not be able to have coordinated operations.

“We were able to set up many different levels and types of communications, such as commercial internet, virtual teleconferencing, radio, telephone and several others to provide communication between everyone involved in the operation,” said McCarty. “Our team did a great job of stress testing our network capabilities, rapidly troubleshooting and fixing any issues that arose during this expeditionary exercise, so we can successfully execute a contingency mission in the future.”

Another operational piece is logistics. In order to get DoD personnel and equipment to a contingency operation takes a lot of combined effort.

Lt. Col. Michelle Martinez, Army South G4 sustainment division chief, said the logistical requirements depend on the mission and what capabilities are already established at the location.

“A lot of what we need to logistically consider is based on where we are going and what type of logistical support is required, but we need to ensure all classes of supplies are provided, to include material handling equipment, air/ground transport, contract support, waste management, etc.” said Martinez. “We also work with engineers to get building material needed for building, establishing a secure perimeter, or other projects that may need to be executed during a natural disaster.”

Army South also coordinated with Army Support Activity (ASA) Soto Cano personnel to provide sustainment for the CCP staff.

“Our teams worked closely together to ensure access to facilities and support logistics,” said Col. Carl Hennemann, ASA Soto Cano garrison commander. “Events just like this help improve readiness and ensure, when requested, both teams are ready for a wide array of support to include disaster relief response.”

DAVENPORT, Iowa – As legendary poet laureate/pop artist Bob Dylan sang early in his career in the mid-sixties, “The Times They Are A-Changin’” and so agrees the U.S. Army Sustainment Command leadership regarding where its personnel may be going to work.

But what will the 21st century workplace look like at ASC, headquartered in Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois? Twenty-two years into this century, that question has not been definitively answered quite yet. But, with forward-thinking and knowing it can’t stay the same, ASC leaders are now exploring for possible answers.

Up until March 2020, the look and function of the workplace predominantly looked the same as the 20th century, except for newer high-tech equipment. That all changed, however, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the majority of workforce to telework.

Previously, only a few Civilians teleworked Army-wide. Telework was typically approved by management on a case-by-case basis, based on unique employee circumstances. What many thought would be a temporary change unfolded into Civilian and military personnel working from home full time. Only now, two years later, with COVID-19 deaths lessening, the workforce is being told it’s time to start coming back.

But, come back to what?

With that in mind, ASC personnel consisting of Matt Sannito, deputy to the commanding general, ASC; Col. Scott Kindberg, ASC chief of staff; Lee Hansen, ASC deputy chief of staff, G1 (Human Resource Management); and, Shannon Nielsen, general engineer, ASC, recently met with Rena Gainey, owner and creator of opportunities, of coworkqc, at her business office located in downtown Davenport, Iowa.

Gainey has nearly 30 years of experience as an executive coach and trainer in corporate leadership development with Deere & Company.

She is in the business of helping companies embrace the possibilities of how the 21st century can meet the needs of the current and future workforce in order to recruit and retain the best talent.

Coworkqc is a shared workspace and community center for entrepreneurs, freelancers, remote workers and startups. The motto of the business is “Work, Create, Collaborate.”

One thing is for sure, the ASC workforce will not continue to do business the way it did prior to the pandemic. A shared workspace in some form may be a good alternative to working full time inside the headquarter’s office space at the arsenal.

“We are a global business. Our personnel work in all corners of the world. Not a single Army Field Support Brigade is on Rock Island Arsenal,” Hansen pointed out. “In essence, this makes all of our AFSBs remote workers with Rock Island as their ‘home’ headquarters. Some will never set foot on Rock Island Arsenal, yet, they are able to accomplish the mission without being physically confined to Rock Island Arsenal.”

Hansen added that a distributed workforce is not a new concept. “We just need to take advantage of the opportunities the pandemic gave us and to move forward,” he said.

“The pandemic only accelerated the evolution by demonstrating, very rapidly, to a large number of supervisors, that teleworkers can sometimes be more productive than a worker confined to a legacy brick and mortar office,” Hansen explained. “The employees also realized a greater work/life balance can be achieved creating a win-win for both the employee and the headquarters. Even small quick tasks like being available to accept Amazon packages or walking [their] kids to/from the bus stop can go a long way in improving work/life balance.”

According to various internet sources, shared workspace or coworking is the situation in which several workers from different companies share an office space, allowing cost savings and convenience through the use of common infrastructure, such as equipment, utilities, receptionist and custodial services.

It is also similar to a flexible office space, which is a type of workspace designed to provide employees with a variety of different places and ways to work.

Unlike traditional offices with fixed and assigned desk positions, workers in a flexible office space can choose the area of the office that best suits the type of work they need to do at that moment.

Flexible workspaces can be easily rearranged to accommodate changing business objectives, or quickly scaled up and down to fit teams of different sizes. These kinds of dynamic office spaces are typically designed to be used in conjunction with flexible working arrangements to provide teams with the freedom to work where, when, and how they want, various internet sources stated.

There is also flexible working , which is a term used to describe any working pattern that falls outside of traditional office hours or locations. That can mean working in different spots around the same office, working from home, at a remote desk or working part-time or staggered hours.

Consequently, workers don’t have to stick to normal business hours or endure busy commutes. Instead they can manage their time and energy resulting in more creative work, as well as being happier and more productive than their office-bound colleagues, internet sources stated.

Flexible working gives the workforce the opportunity to work how they want and where they want, fostering a healthy work-life balance in the process. By choosing their own schedules, employees can work around obligations such as medical appointments and school drop-offs, while avoiding rush-hour traffic and packed buses and trains.

Kindberg said he wants ASC to be able to hire the best talent, which often is restricted because of the limited employee pool in the Quad Cities or hesitation to move to the area. For instance, Kindberg said he would like the ability to hire someone from New York City, but have them work remotely if that person desires and the mission supports it.

“We must evolve in our remote and telework posture in order to attract a greater depth of talent, and a diverse workforce moving forward,” Kindberg said.

“Overall as an organizational headquarters within the Army, we need to adapt and embrace our ability to mission command remotely, and this type of facility/environment is the way of the future,” he said.

“The global pandemic hastened employer’s willingness to embrace a distributed workforce and this two-year experiment proved to be a successful business model,” said Sannito, a member of the Senior Executive Service. “If we are going to continue to succeed in our missions and attract/retain the best workforce, we must embrace our changed business processes to match the new culture of the organization by offering a variety of working environments that ensures all employees thrive in the best setting for themselves.”

Hansen said he is aware that in order to compete with private businesses who have embraced more progressive work policies, ASC must adapt as well.

“ASC has already lost personnel to other units who have a more aggressive telework/remote work program. We will continue to lose personnel and will find it become increasingly difficult to hire replacement personnel if we are unwilling to fully support policies more in-line with other industries,” he said.

Nielsen, the general engineer, has a different perspective on changes to where and how the workforce may work.

“We have gotten creative in how we create relationships with our teams and our customers over the last two years. I see a collaboration working environment as a new tool for the workforce to use to continue to build on our skillsets,” Nielsen said.

“There is hard-fast criteria outlined in existing Army regulations on space allowances, as well as dynamic considerations -- like in union agreements -- that will need to be considered and incorporated into such a plan. When the time comes to create the product, it will be crucial to have a defined plan in order to meet the intent of the concept.”

Nielsen said from a space perspective, ASC must find what actions can be taken to be the most beneficial for employees to do their best work, what flexibilities can be offered, how to introduce these ideas to existing employees, and how those concepts can be incorporated into a plan that meets facility criteria codes/expectations.

As any ASC Civilian or Soldier knows, the parking lot is still pretty empty for the most part. But what does that mean regarding infrastructure of ASC’s headquarters?

“Workplace features, like chairs, furniture, and office equipment, are not currently being used to their maximum utility,” Nielsen pointed out. “By using shared spaces, like team rooms for groups coming to the office to collaborate on a hot project, we will foster those personal relationships in addition to saving money by occupying a smaller footprint.”

Nielsen added there are many base operation services that are currently underutilized, such as running the heat for an unoccupied floor or paying for janitorial services that are unnecessary in vacant areas.

“If we are to continue the trend of a hybrid work model by being in the office less than 40 hours per week, we can find financial savings in Army-provided utilities and lifecycle management,” she said.

Hansen explained that a shared workspace concept is no different than a college student occupying a study desk/space in the university library.

“The student would occupy a study table, study desk or meeting room based on their immediate needs. As their needs change throughout the day, so can their study/work location. The same thing can occur with our employees,” Hansen said.

While much discussion will be needed before anything takes root, Sannito said that change is inevitable.

“I am an absolute champion for a new framework that allows greater access to talent, lower costs, higher productivity and enhanced work-life balances by trusting our workforce to get the job accomplished,” Sannito said. “We can and need to be the leader regarding where work gets done.”

SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras — U.S. Army South Soldiers arrived here yesterday for a nine-day deployment exercise with more than 60 Soldiers to set up a contingency command post (CCP) in preparation for future forward operations in the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) area of responsibility.

A CCP is a rapidly deployable headquarters capable of providing Joint Task Force support designed to plan and conduct small-scale contingency operations.

“Our standard operating procedure is to go forward with wheels up within 96 hours of the initial deployment notification and be operational within 48 hours of landing in the country,” said Maj. Sean Buchanan, Army South CCP operations officer. “Once operational, we will work with the United States Agency for International Development and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance to provide situational awareness for the commander.”

This exercise was designed to rehearse the transportation of Army South equipment and personnel as well as test their capability to rapidly deploy the CCP in support of emergent SOUTHCOM requirements.

Buchanan said he is pleased with his team's performance so far.

“We have a lot of Soldiers who are new to Army South and the CCP, so there was some learning and discovery yesterday during the setup of the main tent,” said Buchanan. “But everything is going very well so far and we are ahead of schedule.”

Army South Soldiers will test and establish communications with Army South headquarters and SOUTHCOM.

Staff Sgt. Patricia Kimbrough, CCP communications and signal non-commissioned officer in charge, said her Soldiers remain prepared for CCP deployments.

“We train on setting up our terminals and testing our signals and communications once a month,” said Kimbrough. “So this exercise is an opportunity to validate our operations and troubleshooting.”

Kimbrough’s team can set up signal terminals and establish communications within two hours of landing in the country.

Preparation for a deployment of the CCP is an ongoing process. The CCP is a response team that reacts to several categories of contingencies, such as humanitarian missions and natural disasters.

1st Sgt. Richard Sosa, of the CCP mayor cell responsible for logistics and unit readiness, was able to get the unit administratively prepared to support the exercise. Sosa said previous exercises and rehearsals assisted in the successful execution of this exercise.

Over the last several months, Army South has conducted level 1 and 2 deployment readiness exercises (DRE) and a staff exercises (STAFFEX) to enhance and hone in on readiness and maneuverability of mission essential assets.

“We have to be ready and engaged at all times to respond to any contingency operations in our area of operation,” said Sosa. “The level 1 and 2 DREs helped us identify Soldier readiness, and previous STAFFEX helped us create a battle rhythm on how to approach the sustainment and logistics piece of this exercise,” said Sosa.

One of the Army South CCP’s most high profile deployments was in support of Operation Unified Response as part of Joint Task Force-Haiti following the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake that destroyed vast areas of the capital and left over two million people homeless on Jan. 12, 2010.

The efforts of Joint Task Force-Haiti contributed immensely to international relief efforts in the largest disaster response mission in modern U.S. military history, earning U.S. Army South the Joint Meritorious Unit award.

Army South and their assigned units consistently work to increase skills, abilities, and readiness to operate as a cohesive Army Service Component Command team in support of U.S. Southern Command.",

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Zoe Marie Kimbell Tompkins smiles and laughs before knife-handing her Soldiers into formation during a change of responsibility rehearsal on JBSA Lackland Air Force Base, March 17, 2022.

Kimbell, the operations non-commissioned officer in charge at 470th Military Intelligence Brigade, is originally from China. She does not know exactly where she is from because her parents abandoned her due to China's one-child policy. She said she was lucky to survive.

“In Chinese culture, males are favored because they carry on the family name and they stay at home and take care of the parents, and the female usually gets married and lives with the husband's family,” said Kimbell.

Thankfully, the infant Kimbell was found and taken to an orphanage where she spent the first year of her life. She then moved into the foster care system before finally being adopted by an American family at 18 months old.

“I was a lucky kid growing up because not everybody had the familial support I had,” said Kimbell. “My parents put in a lot of effort just to have me, and there was never any point where I felt that I was not a part of a family.”

Even with the love and support of her parents, Kimbell still struggled with her own identity. She identified more with her parents' Italian and Czechoslovakian heritage than her Chinese ancestry.

“The biggest thing that I struggled with was my own identity because, by DNA, I am Chinese, but I don't identify with that culture,” she said. “I was the only Asian kid at my school until high school.”

Despite this internal conflict, Kimbell did well in school and had several options set before her at graduation. Her only challenge was choosing a direction to take her life.

“When I grew up, I was a theater nerd, but I just wanted to do it for fun because I didn’t think it would be a sustainable career,” said Kimbell. “I realized I could go to community college and get my general education out of the way, but I didn’t have a major that I really enjoyed. Then, someone jokingly brought up joining the military, and I realized that was not a bad idea.”

Kimbell counted her blessings as she reflected on her life and decided she wanted to give back to her adopted country in any way possible. During her senior year of high school, she enlisted in the U.S. Army as a signal intelligence analyst.

As she climbed the ranks, Kimbell developed as a leader and was inducted into the Sgt. Audie Murphy Club, or SAMC, on Aug. 13, 2021. The SAMC recognizes non-commissioned officers for exemplary performance and leadership. Soldiers are nominated by company leadership to compete, followed by boards, essays and written exams testing Army regulations and leadership decisions.

“The whole process of competing for the SAMC was a learning [experience],” said Kimbell. “The biggest lesson I learned was that it doesn’t matter what your rank is or how long you have been a Soldier; being a good leader is about knowing your Soldiers and doing everything you can to help them grow and succeed.”

One of the most impactful things about leadership Kimbell has learned is her own self-awareness.

“Before I joined the Army, no one told me you don't always have to be the one talking,” she said. “Early on in my Army career, I thought one of my mentors was a jerk because he would always tell me to stop talking, but at one point, he told me, ‘You've got to calm down. We hear you, but you need to bring your energy down to your audience.’”

Kimbell said she learned from that mentor that a leader needs to be able to hold up a mirror, not just from a social standpoint, but also a leadership standpoint and make an honest — sometimes brutal — self-assessment.

As Kimbell continues to excel in her Army career, she attributes her success to her family.

“I had a come-to-God moment, where I realized that I got a pretty solid deal in that I have an amazing family with all the love and support that I could imagine,” she said. “In a way, serving my country was my way of saying thank you to my parents and the country that gave me a second chance.”",

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District has delivered an additional secure home for part of the Israeli Air Force’s fleet of F-35 fighter jets, with a small ceremony marking the completion of another Hardened Hangar project on site earlier this year in March.

The United States has partnered with Israel for several years on its F-35 program through the Foreign Military Finance, or FMF, program where the two nations partner on construction of strategic facilities.

“This project is a key element of the US-Israeli partnership to deliver a unique set of hardened hangars and operations facilities to house a squadron of F-35’s for the Israeli Air Force,” said U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District Commander Col. Patrick Dagon.

The project was the result of close partnership and coordination from beginning to end, with the Israeli Ministry of Defense providing the designs as well as local quality assurance specialists to complement the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contract and project management efforts.

The ability to resist against a variety of threats is a key component of this project. The project team worked closely with a blast designer to account for site conditions and other concerns to ensure every component of the facility, including utilities, storage, life support and more are designed to highest, state-of-the-art standards for rugged survivability against any threat.

In addition to security, functionality is key with the site enabling for the rapid deployment F-35’s at a moment’s notice as well as interconnectivity with similar facilities the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also working on in the country.

Israeli Air Force technicians began installing a secure communications network concurrent to final construction efforts so the site could be occupied immediately and begin supporting missions right away.

“Every Israeli Ministry of Defense and Air Force leader who speaks about this project explains how this is not a theoretical and potential need - but rather an immediate and critical part of their duty to provide protection to the citizens of their country against the constant threat from enemies in the region,” said Contracting Officer’s Representative Ben Diamond with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Israel Area South Resident Office. “When they speak I feel a sense of genuine pride in the outcome and appreciation for our efforts to deliver this asset to their security and defense and I feel humbled to be able to make such an impact.”

The work is part of a larger partnership between Israel and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that has been in place for decades, beginning in 1979 after the Camp David Accords. That historic agreement called for the U.S. to support construction of new Israeli facilities to replace its Sinai airbases abandoned as part of the agreement and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led that construction effort.

Since then the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has partnered with Israel on billions of dollars in construction efforts both through the Foreign Military Finance program as well as in support of similar agreements like the Wye River Memorandum geared toward encouraging peace in the region.

“Europe District is proud to continue supporting our allies in Israel through this strategic partnership of building facilities supporting regional security goals,” Dagon said. “These projects enable Israel to improve their defense capabilities and work toward common security goals while cementing cooperative bilateral military relationships.”

This latest F-35 project completed in Israel is not the first such hardened hangar project the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has helped deliver in Israel in support of the F-35 program and it won’t be the last. Work is already underway for multiple additional similar facilities to be constructed in the coming years as well as facilities to ensure their connectivity going forward.

Diamond looks forward to continuing to support the program as long as his assignment in Israel continues.

“There’s nothing as loud and motivational as the constant roar of the F-35’s taking off to remind the team on the ground the purpose of our dedication to the success of this project.”",

Months of Effort

It's no easy feat to get all that food prepared and shipped to service members across the globe.

DLA Troop Support started planning and preparing for this year's meal as early as March. A lot of the ingredients are at prime vendor locations by September, while the high-volume items, such as the turkeys and 131 tons of trimmings, start arriving overseas in October.

""The holidays will look quite different this year for everyone,"" said Army Brig. Gen. Gavin Lawrence, DLA's Troop Support commander. ""I'm proud that our workforce is doing everything possible to make sure our warfighters get a proper holiday meal, especially since many of us will not be able to be with our family and friends. We want to make sure they get that taste of home no matter where they are in the world.""

It's a mission the DLA has provided to field kitchens, dining facilities and galleys all over the world for more than 50 years.

""Our supply chain takes the holidays very seriously,"" said Army Col. Eric McCoy, DLA's Troop Support subsistence director. ""Our troops are far away from home, and they definitely look forward to this meal. Disappointing them is not an option.""

McCoy said most overseas locations received their supplies for the meals by mid-November.

DLA Troop Support supplies America's armed forces with $19 billion annually in food, uniforms, protective equipment and other vital items. A well-prepared Thanksgiving meal during a tough time of year is definitely something our troops can be thankful for!

WASHINGTON -- The Army plans to adjust how it promotes its noncommissioned officers that could impact Soldiers who are serving in combat, starting a family, or attending the non-resident Sergeants Major Course, said the Army’s top enlisted Soldier.

Starting Jan. 1, NCOs unable to complete the required professional military education, or PME, courses may qualify to be temporarily promoted from sergeant through sergeant major, said Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston during a media briefing Monday.

The temporary promotions aim to help an array of Soldiers who are either deployed, are pregnant or during postpartum, or attending the non-resident Sergeants Major Couse, Grinston said.

The promotions include both the pay and benefits expected from ranking up and will be in place until the rank is either permanent or expires, whichever comes first, he said.

The new policy will impact NCOs across the board, with changes starting in the January promotion cycle for all Army components.

Depending on the component, the fine print is different. For example, Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers must already be selected for or serving in the next higher-graded position vacancy to qualify.

All Soldiers, regardless of component, must also meet or exceed the cutoff score and sequence number for their respective ranks, according to a memo signed by Lt. Gen. Gary M. Brito, the Army’s G-1. In addition, they must be next in line on an approved order of merit list during fiscal year 2021.

Active-duty and full-time reservists will have no later than one year to complete their education upon redeployment. Traditional reservists will have 36 months from their redeployment date to complete their education.

The timeframe to complete PME is also extended for pregnancy and postpartum circumstances. Active-duty Soldiers and full-time reservists will have 24 months, and traditional reservists will have 36 months from the end date of their pregnancy-based profile.

“With this new temporary promotion [policy], we have the ability to have Soldiers starting a family being given the opportunity to be promoted with their peers and still get their professional military education after they complete their postpartum profile,” said Sgt. Maj. Mark Clark, the G-1 sergeant major.

Before the new policy, deployed Soldiers often had to request time-consuming exceptions to be considered for promotion without the required PME.

“This new policy doesn’t make [temporary promotions] an exception -- it makes it a standard,” Grinston said. “Those Soldiers, who are otherwise fully qualified, will be temporarily promoted with their peers. Everything will be streamlined.”

To understand the scope, around 300 deployment-related exceptions were approved in 2019, Clark said. But under the new policy, deployed Soldiers are no longer forced to deal with paper shuffling that may keep them from being promoted.

Those few hundred requests are based on a smaller operational tempo overseas. If the ops tempo grew back up to 100,000 or so deployed troops, Grinston said, “the requests for deployment-based promotions would be a lot higher.”

For pregnancy and postpartum circumstances, no such requests existed before.

In addition to deployments and pregnancy-related profiles, the policy also benefits senior NCOs enrolled in the non-resident Sergeants Major Academy, Grinston said. “So now non-resident master sergeants won’t have to wait to be promoted with their peers.”

Under the new policy, temporary promotions for senior NCOs will be based on non-resident course enrollment through graduation, following graduation of the resident course, to ensure they are eligible for promotion alongside their peers.

This will allow non-resident master sergeants to complete their course, while remaining eligible for promotion.

If a Soldier promoted with a temporary promotion is unable to attain their PME, like the Basic Leader Course, by the specified date indicated on their promotion order by either not attending or failing altogether, then they will be reduced to their former grade, he said.

If a Soldier is reduced to their previous grade, it doesn’t mean they will owe all the pay netted during their temporary promotion, Clark said. Their former rank will be restored with their original date of rank and effective date.

The updated policy is consistent with previously established changes for deployed Soldiers in the sergeant first class and master sergeant ranks, who, like with the latest changes, can be promoted if fully qualified on a fiscal 2021 order of merit list but lack the required PME.

Although the change comes amid an increasing number of new recruits, the SMA said, the change is less about keeping pace with a growing Army and more in-line with its top priority of placing people first.

At the end of the day, Grinston said, the temporary promotions are another way to “have the policies in place to allow our people to progress” through the ranks.

WASHINGTON -- Lily Palfrey knows her father's job is to look after his Soldiers, and she wanted to help him do just that.

Her father, Army 1st Sgt. Frank Palfrey, is the senior enlisted advisor for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade.

A year before her father deployed, Lily began planning to send care packages to each of the Soldiers in her father's company as part of a 4-H project (4-H is a youth development organization.)

Starting in September 2019, Lily collected donations, raised funds for shipping, held packing events, created 154 packages (24 more than her original goal), completed customs forms and created shipping labels with each Soldier's name on it.

Frank Palfrey who is the senior enlisted advisor for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, organized 154 care packages to be sent to her father's deployed unit.

She had to work with various people and organizations to get enough to send to all the Soldiers. When she found out some items couldn't be shipped, she donated them to veteran homeless shelters in her local area.

When the COVID-19 pandemic arose, Lily was forced to create a COVID-19 mitigation plan. This plan included a virtual presentation, which included videos from other military kids talking about what it was like to have a parent deployed.

Soldiers received the packages at their various locations in the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade's area of operations in the Middle East in October.

HHC mailroom clerks were awarded challenge coins for their efforts sorting and distributing all the packages to Headquarters and Headquarters Company Soldiers.

WASHINGTON -- The Army Talent Management Task Force will conduct a prototype of the Sergeants Major Assessment Program (SMAP) from November 14 – 18, 2020 at Fort Knox, Ky.

In conjunction with the Battalion Commander Assessment Program (BCAP) for Fiscal Year 2022, 32 sergeants major will participate in the prototype program.

The participants are under consideration in the Command Sergeant Major/Sergeant Major Evaluation Board for selection to battalion command sergeant major positions. The prototype program is voluntary and the results are non-binding.

BCAP FY21, which debuted earlier this year, assessed 750 officers who were competing for battalion command and key billets. The program incorporated a series of assessments, peer and subordinate feedback, an interview with an operational psychologist, and a double-blind panel interview. The results of BCAP helped the Army determine which officers demonstrated readiness for battalion command.

The sergeant major participants will take a series of assessments in line with the officer experience during the Command Assessment Program. This includes the collection of self, peer, and subordinate feedback, an APFT, cognitive and non-cognitive assessments, and an interview with an operational psychologist. The prototype will culminate in a double-blind interview between sergeants major participants and a panel consisting of nominative command sergeants major and senior commissioned officers.

BCAP FY22, is set to select officers for battalion command and key lieutenant colonel billets in fiscal year 2022. This is the second BCAP and comes two months after the Army’s first Colonels Command Assessment Program which selected officers who will command brigades and fill key general staff positions.

By the end of BCAP FY22, more than 1,800 majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels will have gone through one of the three command assessment programs. This year, BCAP will include officers from the Army Acquisition Corps. The Air Force and the Navy will also send officers to the program to help determine the suitability of a command assessment program for their respective services.

The Army Talent Management Task Force held the first Battalion Commander Assessment Program at Fort Knox in January 2020. The principals identified through the BCAP represent officers who possess higher potential for continued service and are more physically fit, better communicators and less toxic. A board of senior officers, brigadier generals and colonels, determined whether each officer was ready for command or not yet ready. During the first BCAP, 90 officers were determined not yet ready for command and 660 officers were slated as principals and alternates.

An officer’s selection as a principal or alternate for battalion command is based on the Centralized Selection List board ranking and their performance at the BCAP. When compared to the legacy Centralized Select List process, the BCAP resulted in a 34 percent change in officers chosen for command and key billets. Out of the 436 officers chosen for command and key billets, 26 legacy principals declined to participate in BCAP, 25 legacy principals were found not ready for command, and 99 legacy alternates moved up to become principals.

In September 2020, the Army conducted the first Colonels Command Assessment Program (CCAP) to determine readiness for command and strategic potential among officers eligible for O-6 level command and general staff positions. Results from the CCAP are forthcoming.

Since the Army began adopting transformational changes to the management of the Officers Corps, there has been a demand to apply lessons learned to new talent management programs for the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps. Other talent management initiatives in the preliminary stages of development for NCOs include the Army Talent Alignment Process and the First Sergeant Talent Alignment Assessment.

Dominate the information environment with weaponized truth

FORT HOOD, Texas -- In an overview into the contested information environment in Iraq and Syria, Col. Myles B. Caggins III will lead a Warrior’s Corner discussion with questions and answers at this year’s virtual Association of the United States Army 2020 Annual Meeting and Exposition Oct. 15, 1:15 p.m.

Caggins, who just returned to Texas from serving as the spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve, will discuss the information challenges faced by the 77-nation Coalition fighting to destroy ISIS, from not just terrorist organizations and state sponsors of terror, but major powers and occasionally, allies.

“It’s about relentless engagement,” said Caggins. “Dominate the information environment with weaponized truth. I want our adversaries to react to what we are doing.”

Caggins will also discuss some of the techniques developed by CJTF-OIR to cut through language and technological barriers and combat active enemy influence and disinformation operations.

To connect with audiences, the U.S.-led Coalition worked with security partner spokespersons in Iraq and Syria and often conducted press conferences and engagements in Northeastern Syria, Suleimani, Erbil, Kirkuk, Al Asad, and many other locations, working with Arabic, Kurdish, and Western media.

“The core audience was those who were affected by ISIS, and those threatened by ISIS or security forces fighting ISIS,” said Caggins. “We tried to inform and inspire, without offending anyone.”

The discussion includes critical questions for military leaders on the culture of communication, training, resourcing, and competing to win in the public information environment.

Maj. Gabriela S. Thompson, past Coalition media outreach officer, will participate in the discussion.

Those interested in participating in the discussion need to register with AUSA.

WASHINGTON -- Based on the current conditions in Afghanistan, the Defense Department expects there will be fewer than 5,000 U.S. military service members in that country by the end of November, said David F. Helvey, who is currently performing the duties of assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs.

""We've long maintained that our force presence in Afghanistan is conditions-based,"" said Helvey during testimony today before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, national security subcommittee. ""This August, the president [decided] that the conditions of Afghanistan were sufficient to reduce our force presence to between 4,000 and 5,000 by the end of November 2020.""

At that force level, Helvey said, the U.S. maintains an ability to conduct the core aspects of its existing missions in Afghanistan. One of those missions is to participate in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission, which is focused on training, advising and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. The U.S. also conducts a counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan that works with partners to mitigate terrorist threats there.

Right now, there are no orders to reduce the force presence any further, Helvey said, though there is planning to draw down to zero troops in Afghanistan by May 2021. But those plans can't be implemented unless the conditions of an agreement with the Taliban are met, he said.

""As [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo] said in Doha, the Taliban must uphold their counterterrorism guarantees to the United States,"" Helvey said. ""We also expect the Taliban to meaningfully participate in Afghan peace negotiations, and to do their part in preventing outside actors from negatively impacting the peace process.""

In late February of this year, the U.S. and the Taliban signed an agreement that includes, eventually, the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Since the signing of that agreement, the U.S. has reduced forces to 8,600. Part of that agreement also requires the Taliban to agree to no longer allow its members, or other groups, to use Afghanistan as a location from which to threaten the security of the United States or its allies.

Since the signing of that agreement on February 29, Helvey said, no U.S. military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan.

""Ultimately, what we want to be able to see in Afghanistan, is an enduring peace,"" Helvey said. ""In that type of environment ... the terrorist organizations, terrorist groups, will not be able to operate, will not be able to plan, will not be present. That's the focus, and we're looking to get the Taliban to adhere to its commitments.""

WASHINGTON -- Americans regard the National Guard as a United States-based force, but, in truth, it's hard to go anywhere in the world and not see a soldier wearing an Army National Guard patch.

Over the past few months, there were 77,000 Army Guardsmen and over 100,000 National Guardsmen on duty, Army Lt. Gen. Jon A. Jensen, director of the Army National Guard, said during an interview.

There are 335,000 Army National Guard soldiers in the 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia. Today, there are more than 22,000 Army National Guardsmen deployed as part of the warfighting mission for the joint force. This has been consistent since the early 2000s, the general said. ""As you look into the future, you know, we're going to continue to do that as the combat reserve of the Army and as an operational reserve,"" he said. ""But we'll also simultaneously always be that response back home, as well.""

The National Guard has personnel deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, Djibouti, Europe, the Pacific, Guantanamo and many other countries. State guardsmen also maintain contacts with many foreign militaries under the State Partnership Program.

But over the past months of this year, the National Guard has been ubiquitous: helping medical authorities combat COVID-19; working with civilian authorities to fight fires throughout the West; helping communities hit by weather events; and helping calm areas wracked by violence.

Early on, the guard was used to help civil authorities against COVID-19. ""We've still got over 18,500 Guardsmen in support of COVID-19 response with more than 15,000 of them from the Army Guard,"" Jensen said. ""I think we'll continue to do that mission, obviously, until the pandemic's over.""

To date, guardsmen have administered more than 8 million COVID-19 tests. They're also helping in long-term care facilities.

""Our logistics effort has been amazing, as well, with over 350 million meals that have been delivered and 12,000 tons of bulk food,"" he said.

When the virus first hit, there were concerns about medical facility space. Guardsmen worked with the Army Corps of Engineers to create alternate care facilities in major cities. ""Ultimately, we built a 15,000-bed capability that didn't exist prior to the pandemic,"" Jensen said.

The Guard has also been involved in contact tracing. That is, identifying those positive for COVID-19, then contacting those who had been in close proximity of the person with the positive case.

These missions will continue, and the guard will probably be called upon to help once a vaccine is developed and deemed safe. Jensen was clear that the guard has not been asked to do anything yet, but prudent planning requires consideration. The guard, with its all-terrain vehicles and helicopter assets, could help transport the vaccine to hard-to-reach places. Guard personnel could also help with the actual administration of the vaccine, if called upon.

""We all know that the key to this thing is going to be getting a vaccine and then getting the vaccine out to the population,"" the general said. ""We will be ready to do whatever is asked.""

And the guard is doing all sorts of other missions to support fellow citizens. The Army National Guard is actively engaged in fighting 76 wildfires in the West. This year is on track to be the worst fire season since 2003, officials said. In California alone, more than 900 National Guard personnel are helping state authorities and firefighting crews. Guard aviators rescued 159 civilians and are battling 23 fires that have burned nearly 2 million acres.

Guardsmen are also helping in Colorado, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Idaho and Utah. They are working on 53 fires that have charred over 830,000 acres.

The year is tough. In fiscal 2018, guardsmen helped with wildland fire suppression operations for 26 fires. Last year, it was for 12 fires.

The hurricane season is also at its height. There are still more than 3,000 soldiers in Louisiana and Texas helping the states recover from Hurricane Laura. Now, Hurricane Sally is threatening the Gulf Coast.

The guard also has about 2,000 soldiers supporting the Southwest border mission. ""And that mission will grow,"" Jensen said.

The National Guard was also called upon to help in the disturbances following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Jensen — who was the adjutant general of Minnesota before taking his current job — said he also noticed the calming effect of the guardsmen. ""I think the National Guard has gained a tremendous amount of public trust and confidence due to our overseas deployments,"" he said.

He also noted that guardsmen have been prominent in the COVID-19 response and other high-profile civil support missions dating to Hurricane Katrina. ""Whether it's hurricanes or wildfires or ice storms or COVID-19, I think there is just a great amount of awareness and appreciation for what the guard has been doing since 9-11, and what the guard has continued to do,"" Jensen said.

The final piece of that puzzle is the guard as part of the communities they serve. ""We're in over 2,600 communities across the country,"" he said. ""In Minnesota … our little motto [is] 'We live here. We work here. We serve here.' There's just a very strong community connection to the National Guard, and that when we come, we arrive in a non-threatening way. And I think I think that has been appreciated. And I think people have responded to that.""

WASHINGTON -- The June 3 revision of Army Regulation 600-8-10, which covers leaves and passes, is part of the largest update to Army military leave policy in more than a decade, said Larry Lock, chief of Compensation and Entitlements for the Army’s G-1 office.

“The new regulation encompasses recent changes in leave and passes, rearranges the sections to make it more user friendly, clarifies policy, and covers the new leave forms,” he said. “It also aligns the terminology more closely with” Defense Department Instruction 1327.06, or Leave and Liberty Policy and Procedures.

The result is a regulation that is more comprehensive and will reduce confusion, especially for Soldiers working in joint environments, he said.

The DOD Instruction covers leave and liberty procedures and sets a blueprint so the Army can be uniform with the other military services. Based on input from Soldiers, the Army took the opportunity to improve the Department of Army Form 31, or Request and Authority for Leave, and the DA Form 4179, or Leave Log.

“We’re an all-volunteer force since 1973, and to sustain our force we want to take care of our people,” Lock said. “One way to do that is to streamline the process for requesting leave, and enhance morale by encouraging Soldiers to take time off.”

Updated leave forms

Last updated in 1993, the time to update the leave form had come, he said, especially with so many changes to the regulation.

“To be a more usable form given changes in the types of leave, the Army updated the DA Form 31 to make sure commanders and Soldiers clearly understand what type of leave was chargeable and what type was non-chargeable,” Lock said. “Soldiers, Army leaders and commanders need to keep track of leave, for personnel reasons and for audit purposes.”

In other words, depending on the types of absence Soldiers request, they can now more clearly distinguish it as chargeable or non-chargeable on the leave form. Soldier feedback resulted in larger Leave Address, Remarks and Organizational Address fields. While it is not required by regulation, Soldiers can now enter three or more addresses where they expect to stay while on leave.

“We now have an improved process, and that has improved the DA Form 31,” Lock said.

The DA Form 4179, Leave Log, was also updated to help personnelists track the absences requested, approved or disapproved for Soldiers in their organizations.

Both the new DA Form 31 and the new DA Form 4179 are available on the Army Publishing Division website. All Soldiers are encouraged to always download the latest versions of the forms as improvements will continue to be made.

Parental leave

While new parents have been able to take advantage of the military parental leave policy, or MPLP, since last year. The revised AR 600-8-10 includes the MPLP, and further explains the policy. The leave policy associated with childbirth can be somewhat confusing, and the revised regulation helps Soldiers navigate through the different leaves, Lock said.

There are three different types of leave associated with the birth of a child: maternity convalescent leave, primary caregiver leave, and secondary caregiver leave.

New birthparents are authorized 42 days of maternity convalescent leave upon release from the hospital or birthing center. As this is convalescent leave, it is non-chargeable.

The primary caregiver, as designated by the Soldier, is authorized 42 days of non-chargeable primary caregiver leave that must be taken within 12 months of qualifying birth events, but it does not all have to be taken in a continuous block.

The secondary caregiver is authorized 21 days of non-chargeable secondary caregiver leave, which also needs to be used within 12 months of the qualifying birth and is not required to be taken in a continuous block. The regulation has full details and covers exceptions to the normal leaves.

Much of the MPLP was already in place and has not changed since last year’s policy, Lock said.

The Army is striving to help troops better understand their benefits, especially the young Soldiers who make up the majority of new Army parents, he added.

Previously, a parental leave of only 10 non-chargeable days was available for non-birthparents, and had to be used within 45 days after the birth. Now, secondary caregivers leave is a very significant leave change in support of family quality of life.

Other leave issues

Soldiers may request a non-chargeable absence to assist at major events for Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and similar groups. This was previously authorized by AR 600-8-10, but it now falls under an umbrella category that supports participants in competitive sporting and other events.

“The military is pretty arduous duty. Soldiers earn 30 days of paid leave per year, beginning with their first year on the job. No other American industry out there comes close to that,” Lock said. He suggests that all Soldiers should often check their leave balance.

“Every month Soldiers have the personal responsibility to verify the accuracy of their leave and earnings statements, which shows their balance, the amount of leave they used during the current fiscal year, and the number of leave days they will lose if they don't take it before the end of the fiscal year,” he said.

For eligible Soldiers, the Remarks section, beginning on Oct. 31 will state the maximum leave they can carry over at the end of the fiscal year, and when the ability to carry more than 60 days will expire. This should be checked every month, because leave usage affects the carry-over amount. Soldiers should not rely on Special Leave Accrual, which is restricted to a very limited number of cases and review at the Department of the Army level.

One of the biggest leave problems, Lock said, is getting Soldiers to take their leave.

“Soldiers are very dedicated to their jobs, to the point that they are reluctant to take leave,” he said. “It is good to know that they are really dedicated, but they also need to make their own well-being and their Families a priority. This will contribute to improved performance and increased motivation when back at work.

“At the end of the day, it’s up to Soldiers to track their leave,” he added. “It is a commander’s role to grant time off, when possible, but it is still the responsibility of every Soldier to manage their own leave.”

Commanders are responsible for having an effective annual leave program that provides Soldiers with the opportunity to take leave, to include an extended leave, during the year, operational requirements permitting.

AL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar (AFNS) --In a joint endeavor to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces and the people of Lebanon after a deadly explosion in Beirut, U.S. Airmen and Soldiers stationed in Qatar worked to load the first U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III with humanitarian aid, Aug. 6.

Personnel from the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, Air Mobility Command’s 8th Expeditionary Air Mobility Squadron and 816th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron on Al Udeid Air Base, and the Area Support Group-Qatar from Camp As Sayliyah worked to palletize food, water and medical supplies delivered to Beirut later that day.

“Support of this magnitude at such speed wouldn’t be possible without the joint effort of all members of Al Udeid Air Base, our U.S. Army counterparts at Camp As Sayliyah and our gracious Qatari partners,” said Brig. Gen. Daniel Tulley, 379th Air Expeditionary Wing commander. “In the wake of tragedy, it truly takes a combined effort to make the mission happen. We do this every day in Qatar, and that’s exactly what we are doing in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces.”

Soldiers from the ASG-Qatar at Camp As Sayliyah packed and loaded 11 pallets of humanitarian aid, which contained more than 28,800 military field rations, known as MRE or meals ready to eat, 11,520 bottles of water and two pallets of medical supplies and transported them to Al Udeid Air Base with support of a local Qatari transport company.

“In short notice, ASG-Qatar assembled Soldiers and limited contract support to quickly palletize 11 pallets to be flight-worthy; consisting of water, MREs and medical supplies,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Pura, ASG-Qatar director of logistics. “(I’m) truly grateful to the Soldiers and civilians who stepped up to support the mission. I appreciate our Air Force personnel support from AUAB, it’s nice to see a combined effort from all.”

Upon their arrival to Al Udeid, the pallets were received by Airmen from the 8th EAMS, and processed for loading onto a C-17 bound for Beirut.

“At a moment’s notice, our mobility Airmen and the global air mobility support system stand ready to take action in tough situations like the explosion in Beirut,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Nicholas Lee, 8th EAMS commander. “The 8th EAMS is proud to be able to answer the call to support the Lebanese Armed Forces and help those in need of supplies with rapid global mobility.”

(Photo Credit: Courtesy Photo, Defense Commissary Agency) VIEW ORIGINAL

FORT LEE, Va. – Commissaries worldwide are now selling reusable and disposable protective masks, the Defense Commissary Agency’s director of sales announced.

Two brands of masks, one reusable and the other disposable, became available to most stores worldwide in late June, said Tracie Russ, the agency’s director of sales. Commissaries in Hawaii are selling a reusable mask from a local supplier.

“The safety of our customers and employees is a top priority for the commissaries,” Russ said. “Providing these masks for purchase is one of many protective measures we’re taking to help reduce exposure to COVID-19.”

The following brands and types of masks are available for purchase in commissaries:

Hanes: 10-pack, reusable, adult size, 3-ply 100-percent cotton, washable up to 20 times

Midwesttrading: KN95 1-pack disposable mask and a 10-pack, 4-ply mask, fit adjustable, inner layer contains air filter

Puna Noni: (available only in Hawaii commissaries), reusable, 3-ply cotton/poly shell, removable felt filter

“Commissaries are selling masks to meet our customers’ needs, especially during this pandemic,” said LaRue Smith, a category manager. “We don’t want our customers taking an extra shopping trip for something they can get in their commissary and at a lower price.

“There is an expectation that the supplies will be plentiful in the future,” Smith said, “but at this time we ask our customers to limit their purchase to only what they will need so that the supply will be available for all of our customers.”

Since April 6, commissaries have required some form of face covering for their store employees, to comply with the April 5 Department of Defense directive mandating that standard for anyone entering military facilities.

By April 10, commissaries expanded the face covering requirement to include customers or anyone else entering a commissary. The DeCA guidance does not supersede the existing installation policies. It applies to all agency stores and other facilities worldwide where no local directive has yet been issued.

Since the start of the outbreak, most retail stores experienced a run on anything resembling personal protective equipment. In those days, the closest that agency stores had for PPE were disposable gloves.

Through May, glove sales increased by nearly 32 percent. In addition to sales of masks, commissaries have also increased its volume of disposable gloves and hand sanitizers.

Army Lt. Col. Angela Parham, DeCA’s director of health and safety, reminds customers that wearing PPE is only one part of the preventive measures required to help combat COVID-19.

“DOD’s face covering mandate aligns with CDC guidance to help prevent asymptomatic people, who may not know they’re infected, from spreading the virus to others,” Parham said. “Even when you wear a mask or other face covering, it is still important to practice good hand hygiene, social distancing and refrain from touching your face.”

Commissary customers should continue to refer to the federal government’s response to coronavirus, COVID-19 website and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Coronavirus site for updates and guidance regarding this virus. Updates related to the commissaries can be found on DeCA’s Coronavirus page.

Not rain, snow, sleet, extreme heat or even COVID-19 can stop the mail.

""There are 58 mailrooms here on [Camp] Arifjan alone,"" Army Staff Sgt. Robert Harris, the mail operations noncommissioned officer in charge for Task Force Spartan, said. ""We alone are responsible for 1,300 people.""

Harris and his team start their day at 8 a.m. and play a critical role in getting the mail to service members and civilians who serve Task Force Spartan, among other organizations.

""We start our day picking up the mail from the main mailroom,"" Harris said. ""The main mailroom sorts things out by the smaller mailrooms we have on post. Then we come and pick it up to sort it out by person.""

""When we arrive to pick up the mail, we never know how much there will be — could be just a few packages or over 200 packages,"" he continued. ""There was a short time when COVID really started shutting things down, and we didn't see much coming in, but that was a very short time.""

COVID-19 has affected the world and changed the way many businesses operate, so it comes as no surprise that it would affect mail delivery also.

""COVID only slowed down mail for a short time, maybe a week or so,"" Harris said. ""Getting mail to service members and contractors is of the utmost importance, especially during these times when people look forward to packages from home or something they've ordered like a book to help pass downtime.""

Receiving mail can help boost morale not only for service members and civilians overseas, but also for friends and family members who get mail from loved ones abroad.

""Sorting the amount of mail we receive sometimes can become overwhelming,"" Harris said. ""We have had to shut down the mailroom twice since being here. We never want to make that call, but when we get over five or six bins full of mail, it can be very difficult to get it sorted in time for pickup that day.""

There can be many reasons for mail to be delayed, especially due to the restrictions during a worldwide pandemic.

""Mail may be delayed sometimes, but my team and I make sure that when we get things in, we process it and update the roster as quickly as possible,"" Harris said. ""With so many things closed down because of COVID-19, mail is one of the few morale-boosting things left.""

Harris and his team work hard every day to make sure service members and civilians get their mail.

""At the end of the day, we are here to make sure people are getting their mail with as little delay as possible,"" Harris said. ""For some getting a letter or package from home can turn a bad day or week around.""

The soldiers of Task Force Spartan are being led by the New York Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division. The mission is a unique, multi-component organization, made up of active Army and National Guard units, rounded out by Army Reserve support units.

Through Operation Spartan Shield, Task Force Spartan maintains a U.S. military posture in Southwest Asia sufficient to strengthen defense relationships and build partner capacity.

WASHINGTON -- More than 200 enlisted Soldiers serving throughout the Middle East and Africa were slated to travel to Kuwait for the Army's Basic Leader Course in March. Then the military banned nonessential travel in response to the increasing threat of COVID-19.

""I found out I wasn't going to BLC the day I was leaving,"" said Army Sgt. Robert M. Raitano, the noncommissioned officer in charge of intelligence with the 207th Regional Support Group. ""My bags were packed.""

The three-week course is crucial for young Soldiers. It is the first official step in learning how to be a noncommissioned officer, and the class is required before they can be promoted to sergeant. Even if personnel can get a waiver while on deployment, they still are required to attend the school when they return to the United States.

Some Soldiers had waited for years for the opportunity to take the course. Army Sgt. Aquenda R. Roundtree, the operations noncommissioned officer in charge with the 248th Area Support Medical Company, said she had been trying to go to the school since 2017, but her transfers among various Georgia National Guard units derailed those efforts. The latest cancellation promised another long delay.

""I was, like, 'Wow – again?'"" she said, ""because they kept pushing it back.""

In April, the NCO Leadership Center of Excellence delivered a solution: an online version of the class supplemented by instructors stationed at each base. Despite the course being primarily online, the students were still required to lead physical fitness training while maintaining social distancing requirements.

The students' units provided the assistant instructors. At Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, the 207th Regional Support Group and the 248th Area Support Medical Company combined efforts to create a class for five students. Army Staff Sgt. Heather Bojarski, a small group leader with the U.S. Central Command NCO Academy at Camp Buehring, said other participants were spread throughout more than a half-dozen countries – all reporting back to the school in Kuwait.

The assistant instructors at Al Asad attempted to recreate a school environment as much as possible. They reserved a meeting room and had internet connections installed so the students could train together. The NCOs scheduled physical training sessions in the morning prior to classes and had the students march to meals together to practice drill and ceremonies.

""I was thinking we'd just be sitting there online all the time,"" Roundtree said. ""I didn't expect everything that happened.""

During class hours, students regularly responded to questions and reacted to each other's discussion points using their laptops. Outside of class, they had to prepare written papers and a public speaking presentation. Roundtree, who was the first student to serve as class leader, helped ingrain the standards and common procedures their group followed throughout.

""We always tried to stay ahead of the game,"" she said. ""Everyone was held accountable so nobody fell behind.""

Raitano, who said he originally joined the military five years ago with no specific goals in mind, said the class helped him clarify his understanding of leadership, followership and what kind of person he wants to be. He zeroed in on servant leadership, particularly after helping classmates with the required school tasks.

""It took constant hours of practice and preparation,"" he said. ""Being able to see results from that was very inspiring.""

Teamwork became essential as the students aided each other in their studies and practices for the practical exams. Students gathered after class hours to work on drills.

""We never really had a moment where we feuded or didn't agree with each other,"" Raitano said. ""We came together fairly well.""

Both Raitano and Roundtree, similar to others in their class, received their promotion to sergeant shortly after graduating.

""There were a lot of things I didn't know,"" Raitano said of the lessons he learned from the classes. ""There are things I will pick up and use in my day-to-day life.""

From her office in Kuwait, Bojarski said the remote class program has continued to be successful. According to the school, out of 201 students in the first class, 193 graduated in May. The second class started in June.

""I liked the challenge,"" she said of the emergency BLC. ""I liked that it tapped our resiliency….and it pushed me to think outside the box.""

The unique situation has led to the innovative use of technology in some cases. When one of the students was having trouble passing their physical resilience training drills, the assistant instructor used a video call to contact Bojarski and let her watch for issues.

""I could actually see what the sergeant was doing,"" she said.

Likewise, in subsequent BLC classes the school increased its use of the online Defense Collaboration System, which has increased the small-group leaders' ability to communicate with remote students every day.

""It made me more accessible to them,"" she said, noting it allowed them to problem solve together. ""That's what we're here for.""

ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. – For many Soldiers and their Families, spring and summer bring not just warmer weather, but new orders and permanent change of station moves. Although COVID-19 concerns have temporarily halted many but the most essential military moves, now is a good time to think about how to keep your current or future residence healthy and minimize housing hazard risks like lead or mold exposure.

“Residents should frequently inspect their homes and report or repair small issues and minor damages before they become major issues and large repairs,” said Vickie Hawkins, an industrial hygienist and chief of the Army Pubic Health Center Industrial Hygiene Field Services Division.

Hawkins and her APHC team provide installation housing managers with support in conducting inspections of Army Family housing, and remotely provide industrial hygiene consultation, report review, sampling interpretation, guidance and support for mold, lead, asbestos, and radon concerns.

Hawkins said the greatest risk for lead hazards in the home are lead paint in pre-1978 housing or if the parent has a hobby or job that involves lead.

Installations and Residential Communities Initiative property landlords must inform all new tenants of Army Family housing what is known about lead-based paint and lead hazards in their units. Installations must also provide residents with the EPA pamphlet Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home.

“In general, lead present in intact paint is not a hazard,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins recommends immediately reporting any paint damage or deterioration for repair. Paint on impact surfaces (windows, window sills, doors) and hand rails have the greatest potential to chip, flake, or create dust.

“Frequently wipe down these surfaces with a wet cloth and clean floors to reduce the potential of exposure to lead in the paint,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins explains paint can also be found on the exterior of the house and in soil around the home.

""Remove shoes or wipe soil off shoes before entering your house if you have concerns over lead in the outside,"" said Hawkins.

If a parent works or is involved in a hobby where they are exposed to lead, change out clothes and shoes before coming into the home, said Hawkins.

“Children are especially susceptible to lead exposure,” said Hawkins. “Talk to your medical provider about blood lead level testing if you have any concerns.”

Residents concerned about mold should focus on controlling moisture, which is the key factor in reducing mold exposure risks, said Hawkins.

“Frequently check your home for signs of leaks and water damage especially around plumbing, doorways, windows, and ceilings,” said Hawkins. “Also inspect your roof for damage. It is important to find the source of any leak or water damage and to make repairs immediately.”

If wet or damp materials are dried within 24-48 hours after a leak or spill happens, mold will not grow in most cases, said Hawkins. Regularly clear exterior drains and gutters on the home to prevent blockages that could cause water to enter the home. Ensure the drain spouts are extended 4 feet away from the house and the ground cover is graded/sloped so that water runs away from the house foundation. Keep air conditioning drip pans clean. When showering, run the bathroom fan or open a window. Use exhaust fans or vent appliances that produce moisture (stoves, dishwashers, clothes dryers, etc.).

For regional areas that may have more humidity or moisture in the air, Hawkins recommends using air conditioners and de-humidifiers when needed.

“It may be tempting to turn off your air conditioning while you are out of the house or on vacation, but in warm humid climates the air conditioning helps keep the humidity down inside your home, which reduces the risk of mold growth,” said Hawkins. “Address any visible mold growth promptly and speak with your medical provider if you are concerned that something in your home is making you sick or otherwise impacting your or your child’s health.”

Hawkins also has a few general recommendations, some of which come from her experience inspecting Army Family housing.

“During inspections, many homes were observed with the clothes dryer vent blocked with debris at the back of the dryer inside the home and at the outside exhaust pipe opening,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins recommends keeping the dryer exhaust free from any debris, including the pest-proofing screens covering these openings. Failure to keep these free from any lint or debris is a potential fire hazard and an efficiency destroyer. Residents should report any conditions related to clogged dryer vents to their housing management office.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recommends housing residents cover electric sockets, childproof cabinets and drawers, and put up gates or close doors where fall hazards are present. Store household chemicals and poisons out of reach of children and away from food, and frequently wipe down and clean children’s toys. Ensuring smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are properly installed is also important.

The APHC has webpages with resources and tips for homeowners in dealing with mold and lead in the home:

The APHC has also created the Housing Environmental Health Response Registry for residents who have any concerns about Army Family housing or related health concerns. They can contact the registry telephone number (1-800-984-8523; overseas DSN: (312) 421-3700) for more information on housing environmental health hazards, assistance seeking medical care for housing-related illnesses and concerns, and to have the U.S. Army Medical Command share their concerns with Army leadership. Contact care representatives are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. More information on the registry can be found at the Housing Environmental Health Response Registry site.

The Army Public Health Center enhances Army readiness by identifying and assessing current and emerging health threats, developing and communicating public health solutions, and assuring the quality and effectiveness of the Army’s Public Health Enterprise.

WASHINGTON -- Soldiers now have an added incentive to choose the personally-procured move, or PPM option, when moving to their next duty stations this summer.

Aside from limiting exposure to COVID-19, a revision to the Defense Department’s Joint Travel Regulations has increased the monetary payment to Soldiers who choose to move their household goods.

From May 26 through Dec. 31, Soldiers using the PPM program can receive a payment equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost the government would pay to move their items. When Soldiers choose the option, they shoulder the cost and responsibility of packing and moving their belongings themselves and the payment compensates them for those expenses.

The PPM program gives Soldiers an alternative to a traditional permanent-change-of-station move, where a government-contracted moving company ships their household goods to their new duty station.

With more Soldiers expected to make PCS moves during the latter part of the peak moving season, an updated policy couldn’t have come at a more opportune time, said Larry Lock, Army compensation and entitlements chief G-1.

While much of the country remains under COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, making a PPM might be the more practical option for some Soldiers and their families, he said. Safety restrictions vary by state and commercial movers will be heavily tasked, he added.

The change could help increase the number of PCS moves in what the Army’s G-4 predicts will be a busier moving season. Moving more Soldiers to their new duty stations helps the Army maintain readiness and meet its global force requirements, said Derrick Candler, chief of Transportation Policy Division, G-4.

“Industry may face challenges to support this huge increase during the summer season,” Candler said. “This initiative can help increase the number of moves to ensure our people can get to their next duty station as quickly as possible. This will have positive effects on the entire Army and DOD. The PPM also reduces the strain on families and moving companies.”

As part of the continued efforts to improve quality of life for its military families, the Defense Travel Management Office had pursued the change to ease the burden of families who prefer the PPM over a traditional move, Lock said. He added that PPM moves typically result in a cost savings for the government and the policy update will pass those savings onto the families.

In April, the DOD signed a $7.2 billion contract with a single company, New Jersey-based American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier Group, to move household goods for the military.

After Dec. 31, Candler said the policy will be re-evaluated in conjunction with each military branch on whether the reimbursable costs will remain at 100 percent or return to 95 percent.

The DOD has made monetary allowance payments of 95 percent for PPMs since 1998 when it bumped the sum up from 80 percent. Candler said that each service must collectively agree to make the change permanent.

“Now, we're hoping based on this change and the moves that take place during the summer, that we can justify continuing this,” he said. “All the services benefit from this increase.”

Lock said typically younger, single Soldiers, or young couples with no children choose the PPM option. Soldiers with more time in service and those with larger families often choose to have their household items shipped by a government contractor.

Also possibly boosting the number of moves this summer is a change to granting exceptions to policy for the COVID-19 stop-move order. Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy delegated approval authority for PCS moves, temporary-duty assignments, and military leave to the first brigadier general or Senior Executive Service officer in a Soldier’s chain of command.

Approval authorities may grant exceptions for Soldiers determined to be mission essential, for changes necessary for humanitarian purposes, and for extreme hardship.

Soldiers who fall under an exception must travel with printed copies of the approved exception to policy. Soldiers exempt from travel restrictions will be required to carry a memorandum signed by their supervisor that states the reason for exemption.

Soldiers and civilians enrolled in military education programs qualify as exempt from travel restrictions and do not require an exception to policy. These programs include officer training and education programs, non-commissioned officer professional development and specialty training programs and civilian training, education and development programs.

WASHINGTON -- Despite some delays in fielding necessary equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Army’s top enlisted leader believes the service will still successfully implement its new Army Combat Fitness Test.

Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston said Thursday he remains optimistic that most units will have the necessary equipment for the test by June, despite the impact of the virus.

Grinston said he has spoken to representatives at U.S. Army Materiel Command and the fielding process remains on schedule.

He also reminded Soldiers to continue physical training sessions from home.

There’s “no excuse not to do PT. And it's always a great opportunity,” he said during an online event, hosted by the Association of the U.S. Army.

Grinston said the ACFT is better suited for physical distancing than its predecessor, the Army Physical Fitness Test, as most of the exercises are done while safely distanced from others.

During the 2-mile run, for instance, a limited number of lanes can be made available to runners and the event does not need to be done in large groups. The hand-release pushups test requires another individual to properly count repetitions, but the tracking person can count at a 6-foot distance.

As of now, both ACFT and APFT requirements are suspended, pending further guidance. Soldiers can use their last APFT score to remain promotion eligible, and the Army extended the expiration dates of previous APFT scores.

When Soldiers eventually take the APFT again, large groups will also be prohibited from running the 2-mile run together. Soldiers counting repetitions on pushups during the APFT must also remain 6 feet apart. While taking the situps test, Soldiers can now use a heavy bar to hold their feet down instead of having another Soldier hold their knees, Grinston said.

“Do I think we're confident when we start the ACFT that we can do it given the conditions of a COVID-19 environment? Absolutely,” Grinston said.

Soldiers will also be required to wipe down each piece of exercise equipment with sanitizer after completing the corresponding test.

“If you touch the bar for your max deadlift, you wipe the bar down and then you move on to the next station,” Grinston said.

Virtual transition

Grinston lauded the efforts of Army recruiters who have turned to using online tools to contact potential recruits. He said recruiters have used tools that include FaceTime to secure contracts and commitments from recruits. He said that he still expects the service to meet its end-strength goals by the end of the fiscal year.

The Army started changing its recruiting strategy by loosening restrictions on social media use for recruiters and establishing an esports team. The service also established virtual recruiting stations. Grinston said many recruiters have adapted to using the virtual space so well, that he expects recruiters to continue to use online tools after the pandemic has passed.

“We really got ahead of this about a year ago when we started doing different marketing or doing things in the digital space that really led us up to [COVID-19 stay-at-home orders],” Grinston said. “And so when we did the brick and mortar closures, we already had some of the digital recruiting going on. Some of the recruiters just really took off.”

POINT MUGU, Calif. -- The Army is hunting for top talent to fill the ranks of specialized units for multi-domain operations, following the first one standing up last year in Washington state.

In 2019, a mixture of the Army’s space, cyber, and electronic warfare capabilities was activated as a cohesive unit called the Intelligence, Information, Cyber, Electronic Warfare, and Space Battalion -- or simply I2CEWS.

The battalion has become “the centerpiece of the Multi-Domain Task Force,” Gen. John M. Murray, commander of U.S. Army Futures Command, said Tuesday during the Association of Old Crows virtual EMS Summit.

Located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, the battalion combines non-lethal Army capabilities with kinetic capabilities, such as missile defense. The I2CEWS operates in support of U.S. Army Pacific, and AFC has “plans to stand up more as we begin to experiment with this formation,” Murray said.

The Multi-Domain Task Force is a model of how the Army envisions joint-warfighting on future battlefields against near-peer competitors, like Russia and China. Before the Army activates additional formations, though, Murray said it will first need the right talent to fill the ranks.

“The No. 1 thing is finding talent, and I'm convinced we have some of that talent already in our ranks,” Murray said. “And we're going to have to go into our recruiting pools to find some of that talent. The Army is already beginning to explore innovative ways in talent management.”

Some innovative talent management programs include the Assignment Interactive Module 2.0, or AIM 2.0. The information system is a way for officers to build detailed resumes and take part in a market-style hiring system for their next assignments as organizations post specific positions they are looking to fill.

Talent management will also be part of the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army, or IPPS-A, a web-based human resources system already adopted by the National Guard, that will soon integrate the Army's personnel, pay and talent management functions into one secure web-based application.

Much like how traditional battlefields will change under the information age, the Army will also recruit talent differently. For example, Murray explained, “Thirty-eight years ago, when I was offered a four-year Army ROTC scholarship, they couldn’t care less what I majored in.

“So, I picked the easiest major I could find,” he admitted. But today “we’re offering [cadets] a six-year scholarship to come out with a degree the Army needs, and if they can’t meet our requirements, then they’re not going to join the Army.”

The Army has taken other steps to attract and keep cyber talent, such as hosting cyber hackathons, boosting pay and incentives, and direct commissioning.

But “the most attractive way to retain our cyber warriors is the thrill of the mission. To be honest, [cyber warriors] are doing things they could not do outside the Army without spending time in jail,” Murray said, regarding cyber warfare missions.

Cyber warriors direct and conduct integrated electronic warfare, information, and cyberspace actions. They are responsible for the aggressive defense of Army networks, data infrastructure, and cyber weapons systems.

For Murray, who is responsible for leading a team of more than 24,000 Soldiers and civilians in the Army's modernization enterprise, helping shape the Army’s future force is personal.

The four-star talked about his eight grandchildren, especially one granddaughter who, he believes, will one day be ""an infantry commander wearing airborne and Ranger tabs."" It’s her generation he’s working for, he said, not “old Soldiers like me.”

Murray wasn’t the only one with that mindset.

“I use some of the same equipment my father used, and my nephews are now flying some of the same equipment that I flew,” said Lt. Gen. Neil Thurgood, director of hypersonics, directed energy, space, and rapid acquisition.

“We need our grandchildren to fly new and modernized equipment as we continue to go forward,” Thurgood added. “So to those of us that have aged a little bit in the process of our careers, it is personal, because we spent that time with our Soldiers, and we spent that time with our families.”

In the end, that's really what AFC and “the whole team, to include our acquisition partners, brings to our Army, delivering solutions that our Soldiers need when they need it,” Murray said.

“This is about our kids and our grandkids that will defend this great nation going into the future,” he added. “That's really what personalizes this mission for me, and that's a heavy rucksack to carry.”

FORT MEADE, Md. -- Security force assistance brigade Soldiers from the first-ever team to operate in Africa spoke of their recent mission Wednesday in training Senegalese soldiers on logistics support.

The discussion was part of a recruiting push to add more qualified Soldiers to the Army’s six SFABs, which are still hiring using virtual assessments and bonuses worth nearly $60,000 for in-demand career fields.

SFABs have previously deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, the latter of which is where the 4th SFAB will deploy this fall to replace the 3rd SFAB.

Upcoming missions will also include counter-narcotics advising in the U.S. Southern Command region, as well as others in the Indo-Pacific region and back to Africa, said Lt. Col. Kevin Field, the SFAB recruiting team lead, during a livestream on Facebook.

The SFAB mission is a re-focused train, assist and advise strategy that envisioned the specialized units in hotspots around the world.

Since they serve as permanent organizations, the units provide a more concerted effort than previous ad hoc advise and train formations, while also freeing up conventional brigade combat teams and Special Forces units.

“With the Army standing up the SFABs, it allows us to professionalize the delivery of the security assistance mission, because we have a dedicated force,” Field said. “That’s all they do. It also helps us preserve the readiness of our BCTs to respond to worldwide contingencies.”

African mission

In the first mission outside U.S. Central Command, the 1st SFAB’s Logistics Advisor Team 1610 traveled to Senegal in March to instruct its military personnel in preventative maintenance, vehicle recovery and motor pool operations.

While the training went well, team members said, the location still presented them with an unusual work environment.

Due to the reduced U.S. military presence in Africa, the team had limited tactical communications and quality medical facilities available to them, while they also had to work out of a hotel for three weeks.

“A deployment on the continent of Africa is much different than what most of us have experienced through deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq and brings about different challenges, especially for a small team,” said Maj. Michael Pachucki, the team leader.

One of the highlights for Staff Sgt. Braxton Pernice, the team’s maintenance advisor, was the vehicle recovery portion of the training.

It allowed the Senegalese soldiers “to put hands on their equipment and get familiar with how to utilize their recovery trucks,” he said. “Overall, it was a great training event and we learned a lot from them as well as they learned a lot from us.”

Pachucki, who also deployed with the 1st SFAB to Afghanistan in 2018, said his assignment with the brigade has been one of his most rewarding in his 15-year career.

“What I will promise you if you come to an SFAB,” he said, “is the opportunity to grow personally and professionally, work with great people, and receive individual and professional training opportunities not often seen in other units.”

Promotions, bonuses

Not only do SFABs have a unique mission, they also had higher promotion rates than other Army units last year, Field said.

Enlisted promotion rates from sergeant first class through sergeant major at SFABs ranged from 33% to 65%, compared to about 17% to 41% across the Army. On the officer side, promotion rates from major through colonel at SFABs ranged from 79% to 89%, compared to 21% to 67%.

“I will tell you that most of those individuals, they’re going to be promoted with or without SFAB in their files, because we are hiring highly-qualified individuals,” Field said. “That’s also another way the SFAB helps you get promoted, because you are being exposed to some of the top NCOs and officers in our Army from various [military occupational specialties].”

Some of the slots that SFABs are currently looking to fill include: military intelligence (35 series); unit supply specialist (92Y), fire support specialist (13F), signal (25 series); and combat engineer (12B).

As much as $58,300 is also being offered in selective retention bonuses for specialists through staff sergeants in the 35 series, as well as for information technology specialist (25B); military police (31B); and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialist (74D).

Even if an enlisted Soldier does not qualify for a bonus that Soldier can still receive a $5,000 assignment incentive pay.

Positions in the SFAB also count as a broadening assignment, providing tactical options for NCOs other than being a recruiter or drill sergeant.

“This gives you the same credit as doing one of those jobs, except that you get to stay and work within your MOS and be exposed to some of that same equipment,” Field said. “So, by time your time in the SFAB is complete and you’re rotating back to your BCT, you don’t need to be re-greened. You’ve been working in your MOS with Soldiers out there.”

WASHINGTON -- A new contract to facilitate the movement of household goods, an integral part of any move to a new duty location, is expected to make things easier for both service members and their families.

The U.S. Transportation Command awarded the contract to American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier Group Inc. on April 30. The first move under the new contract won't take place until February, Transcom's director of acquisition said at a news conference today.

""The ... contract is an important component of improving service members' experiences during the relocation process, and fundamentally restructures DOD's relationship with the household goods industry in order to improve access to, and management of, quality capacity to meet peak demand and enable the department to fix the accountability and responsibility lacking in today's program,"" Ken Brennan said.

The New Jersey-based business was chosen for the contract because the proposal the company submitted provided the best service for the best value for service members, Defense Department civilians and their families, Brennan said, adding that the carrier group beat out six other competing proposals.

Rick Marsh, the director of the defense personal property program at Transcom, said the new contract will bring great benefit to service members and their families.

Right now, he said, there's no single contractor the DOD uses to move household goods. As a result, he said, no portion of the industry is motivated to spend money to enhance the service they provide to service members and their families.

""There is ... no rationale to invest in quality suppliers and invest in your network,"" Marsh said. ""You can't forecast the work that you're going to perform. Our current model leads to using day laborers and other folks that maybe aren't as well-trained as moving professionals should be.""

By centralizing the work in one company, he said, DOD lets industry know what the demand is for household goods movement, and that allows for investment.

""They can hire and invest in very highly trained employees to come into service member homes to handle pack out or delivery,"" he said.

As far as accountability is concerned, he said, the department has more than 300 personal property offices at installations and another 42 shipping offices around the world that will have formally-appointed contracting officers and quality assurance evaluators.

""We're going to be working off of a centralized quality assurance surveillance plan to ensure we have accurate, rigorous oversight over the contract,"" Marsh said.

For families who have issues with their move, he said, there will be new avenues to rectify problems.

""I would say most of the issues that we have in our current program revolve around communication,"" he said. ""We're going to be able to bring tools to the table that we simply can't deliver today under the current program, to be able to put families in touch with representatives from industry faster — to make the claims process much cleaner, much simpler, and for them to be, to have it settled and to be made whole ... much faster than they are today.""

Currently, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many service members are unable to relocate as they might have expected during the summer months, while others will be allowed to move if granted an exception, Marsh said. For those who are allowed to move under such an exception, efforts will be made to protect both families and movers from COVID-19.

""In an effort to protect the force and deliver a safe moving experience to DOD families, DOD has directed a series of health protection measures for personnel moving during the stop-movement period,"" he said.

DOD has directed that industry personnel adhere to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's health protection protocols, Marsh said. That includes wearing face coverings, minimizing crew sizes, cleaning frequently-touched surfaces and practicing good hand hygiene while conducting moves in family housing.

Additionally, Marsh said, moving crews will need to verify the health of their teams upon arriving at military families' homes.

""When a moving crew arrives at the curb for a pack out or delivery, moving companies will present written verification that members of the crew have been screened for illness and will be properly equipped to adhere to these protocols,"" Marsh said.

If a family does have concerns about the health of the team that arrives to move their household goods, Marsh said, they are also empowered to ask those movers to not come into their home.

""If families aren't comfortable, they should stop work and reschedule their move,"" he said. ""A DOD representative will contact every DOD member during every move, in-person or virtually, to ensure protocols are being followed. And if something's not right, local transportation offices and the personnel's chain of command will get involved to make it right.""

WASHINGTON – The Army launched a new survey which allows Soldiers to voice their concerns directly and anonymously to Army leadership.

The Department of the Army Career Engagement Survey (DACES) is a survey for all Active Duty Soldiers. DACES replaces earlier exit surveys which were only given to Soldiers as they departed the Active Army.

DACES is a customized survey, with questions tailored to the individual Soldier based on their responses to previous questions. This reduces the amount of time required to take the survey by eliminating unnecessary questions. Although the current version of DACES takes around fifteen minutes to complete, future versions will take even less time, as DACES will ask more specific questions based on an individual’s demographics. During the survey, Soldiers will also be provided a chance to request more information about career opportunities or to be contacted for additional information.

Starting in May, Soldiers will receive a link in their email inbox during their birth month directing them to the DACES web page. In addition to an annual birth month survey, all Soldiers will be required to complete the survey as part of their out-processing requirements when they depart the Army.

The Army will use the results of DACES to inform retention efforts. DACES will help the Army create retention incentives and quality of life programs in order to retain talent. DACES will not share the results of the survey with a Soldier’s chain of command or personnel manager, allowing Soldiers to share information candidly.

The first surveys have already been sent. Users may only take DACES if they are using a DOD-furnished computer on a DOD network, if they are connected to a DOD network through a VPN, or if they are using CITRIX.

FORT CARSON, Colo. -- In a rare virtual ceremony, the Army’s latest security force assistance brigade to stand up officially activated Tuesday as it prepares to deploy to Afghanistan this fall.

The 4th SFAB, based at Fort Carson, is the fifth of six similar units to stand up after the Army activated the first one in 2018, as part of a re-focused train, assist and advise strategy that envisioned the specialized units in hotspots around the world.

The SFABs serve as permanent organizations that provide a more concerted effort than previous ad hoc formations, such as military transition teams or security force assistance advisory teams.

To create the previous units, the Army pulled from conventional brigade combat teams that then reduced their effectiveness.

“And though necessary at the time, all of this had a long-term, negative impact on total force readiness,” said Gen. Michael Garrett, commander of U.S. Army Forces Command. “Back then, we treated security force assistance as a peripheral task when, in fact, it is central to the National Defense Strategy and our Army’s mission.”

Since 2018, SFABs have deployed to assist foreign partners in Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Members of an SFAB train, deploy and redeploy together as part of an enduring group. After some time resetting back at home, the teams in that same brigade deploy again.

Security force assistance is far from a new concept, the general said, as today’s heritage can be traced back to the Military Assistance Command-Vietnam created in the 1960s for the war.

The general said there is now an increasing need for combat advisors, which free up BCTs to better prepare for large-scale ground combat with near-peer adversaries.

“They are Soldiers who can build teams, solve complex problems and succeed in uncertain environments,” he said.

The newest combat advisors have already learned specialized skills from the Military Advisor Training Academy, as well as advanced medical training; survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training; and foreign weapons training.

In June, the 4th SFAB is slated to conduct the next rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center in Fort Polk, Louisiana.

It will be “the first one out of the chute as we work to figure out how we maintain readiness as we adjust to the new normal,” Garrett said.

Brig. Gen. Mark Landes, commander of the Security Force Assistance Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, dialed in via videoconference for the ceremony, which had Garrett and a few others spaced 6 feet apart with the unit’s guidon inside a large conference room.

Landes called the ceremony “historic and atypical,” but noted that while the ongoing threat from the virus has changed how the Army operates, it has not changed its essence.

“COVID-19 has allowed us another opportunity to showcase our character, our capability and our adaptability,” he said.

The ceremony signified 4th SFAB’s transformation into a trained and deployable formation, he said, adding he was impressed with how much it grew since January 2019.

“Every person in the unity and victory formation was selected and relocated to the unit,” Landes said, referring to the unit’s motto. “Every pencil and piece of paper had to be obtained using systems and processes that also had to be developed and incorporated.”

The 5th SFAB, out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, will be the last SFAB to stand up, slated for this summer. The 54th SFAB, a collection of National Guard Soldiers from several states, activated in March.

With about 800 Soldiers, the 4th SFAB is scheduled to replace the 3rd SFAB to continue the mission in Afghanistan.

“These SFABs are advising, assisting and developing professional organized militaries that can fight for themselves,” Landes said.

Its commander, Col. James Dooghan, said he was confident that each advisor is fully trained and equipped with the best tools to tackle the challenge.

“We selected the right people in the right positions to be ready and effective in assessing, advising, mentoring and assisting our international partners,” he said. “We’re proud to officially announce our activation and we look forward to this mission.”

WASHINGTON -- Army researchers are working to rapidly develop and test experimental vaccines to combat COVID-19, Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy said.

The Army is also collaborating with the private sector and other government entities on 24 vaccine candidates, some of which are headed for human testing after having been tested on animals, McCarthy told reporters at a recent Pentagon news conference.

If history is any indicator of future success, there is reason to be hopeful. Being at the forefront of medical breakthroughs is nothing new for Army researchers:

Fighting Malaria

Due to their ability to carry and spread diseases such as malaria, mosquitoes are one of the deadliest insects in the world, killing an average of 725,000 people a year, said. Army Col. (Dr.) Deydre Teyhen, commander of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. That surpasses the combined annual number of deaths from combat (475,000), deadly snakebites (50,000), crocodile attacks (1,000) and shark attacks (10).

To reduce deaths caused by mosquitoes, WRAIR has acted on several fronts, she said: providing proactive medical diplomacy, delivering vaccines and vector control, and leading the world in malaria drug and vaccine development.

Fighting Multidrug-Resistant Infections

An antibiotic drug developed by Army researchers several years ago is now available to treat service members who have life-threatening, multidrug-resistant, or MDR, bacterial infections.

Arbekacin is a new antibiotic treatment for MDR infections. Those types of infections may complicate wounds suffered by soldiers in combat, said Army Col. (Dr.) Michael Zapor, an infectious diseases physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

""Of all the bacterial species found on the planet, relatively few are intrinsically multidrug-resistant pathogens,"" Zapor said. ""In Iraq and Afghanistan, the bacterium known as acinetobacter is one such MDR bacterium that has caused problems in our patient population.""

cinetobacter is commonly found in the water and soil of regions such as Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. Although it's intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, it's not especially virulent and generally not problematic in humans unless their immune system has been severely compromised or the bacterium is inoculated deep into macerated tissue, as would occur with massive open wounds resulting from battle injuries.

Infections caused by the bacterium were prevalent during the Vietnam War, he said. But at the time, antibiotics were usually successful in eradicating acinetobacter infections. However, over time, resistance emerged and antibiotics became less effective against many pathogenic bacteria, including acinetobacter.

Fighting Yellow Fever

A lot of service members were taken out of the fight in 1898 during the Spanish-American War due to yellow fever.

The Army created the Yellow Fever Commission, led by Army Maj. (Dr.) Walter Reed, which determined that mosquitoes were the carriers of the disease. The commission developed effective control programs to eradicate the mosquitoes.

Fighting Adenovirus

Acute respiratory diseases were fairly common among service members in the early 1950s. Maurice Hilleman, a microbiologist with the Army Medical Center's Department of Respiratory Diseases, discovered that the adenovirus was the culprit.

WRAIR created an adenovirus vaccine in 1956, just three years after its discovery.

WASHINGTON – The Army has resumed shipping recruits to basic combat training following a two-week pause to enact necessary COVID-19 mitigation efforts. More than 950 future Soldiers will begin pouring into initial training centers this week.

“We’re not changing, we’re adjusting, and continually adapting in the environment no matter where we are, because we need to train, fight, and win,” said Gen. Paul Funk, the commanding general of Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, regarding new BCT policies.

As hundreds of new recruits begin pouring into training bases around the force, health and safety measures are in place, officials said. For example, BCT and One-Station Unit Training are implementing social-distancing practices and plan to train “at reduced capacity,” officials said.

This means smaller elements, Funk explained. “That way if we have a [coronavirus] breakout, we can control it and move the smallest elements forward and continue to progress people through the training pipeline.”

Several other protocols and procedures are in place from the time recruits leave their hometowns to the moment they step foot on training soil.

For two weeks prior to their ship date, future Soldiers are screened for symptoms of, and possible exposure to, COVID-19 by their recruiters and then by Military Entrance Processing Station personnel, Funk said. Also, during this time recruits will isolate themselves at home to limit exposure to the airborne virus.

Once recruits show up to their assigned training center, they are screened again, Funk said.

Then for the first two-weeks after arrival, recruits take part in a modified training curriculum and have their health gauged daily.

Much of this time is classroom-based, held outside when possible, and recruits remain six feet apart. After 14 days – and if they are healthy – for the additional eight weeks of the 10-week schedule, recruits “hit the ground running,” Funk said.

The controlled monitoring phase will be a series of classes, which is an introduction to Army techniques that are normally scheduled anyway, he said. Classes include customs and courtesies, recognizing military rank, and preventing sexual assault.

The Army is also cautious about where future Soldiers arrive. Individuals from “low-risk” areas will ship to initial training bases, but “those who are in high-risk areas will be rescheduled for future dates,” according to a news release.

All four Army training centers have implemented these procedures “and they perform their conditions on the established procedures so when the recruits come in, we're making sure that we can form the safety bubbles necessary to get us through the training,” Funk said.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, they were placed on sterilized buses, seated in spaced-apart intervals, medically screened before departure and upon arrival, and accompanied by cadre members from Fort Jackson.

“We owe that kind of due diligence and commitment to our Soldiers and their parents, who send those same Soldiers to us each year to wear the cloth of our great nation,” he added.

These BCT changes are an example of how the Army is “adapting to the current environment, and adjusting the way it operates,” Funk explained. “Every day to fight our nation's wars, one of our greatest strengths has always been our ability to learn and adapt.”

Travel restrictions made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Defense Department providing leave leniency for service members who accrue too much leave and might otherwise lose it.

Each year, active-duty service members are granted 30 days of leave, but at the end of each fiscal year, they normally lose any unused leave exceeding 60 days. With the leniency granted due to the pandemic travel restrictions, service members can now accrue a leave balance of up to 120 days until Sept. 30, 2023.

Matthew Donovan, undersecretary of personnel and readiness, signed the authorization for that change April 16.

DOD encourages service members to take leave whenever possible; however, it's not always possible due to deployments and operational commitments, Pentagon officials said, though some extensions have been granted due to long deployments.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit service members particularly hard because many are not allowed to travel to see friends and loved ones who live many miles away — a big incentive for taking leave, Donovan said. Therefore, he continued, the restriction on the leave balance ceiling was relaxed.

""The department's actions to stem the spread of COVID-19 have significantly limited the ability of service members to take leave during this national emergency, and we know that leave is vital to the health and welfare of our force,"" Donovan stated in his memorandum.

For DOD's civilian workforce, Office of Personnel Management policy already makes allowances for leave accrual under exigent circumstances, such as COVID-19. All restored annual leave must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year ending two years from the year the annual leave was earned after the termination of the current emergency. The normal leave balance service members may carry over each year is 240 hours. However, more hours may be carried over during the current emergency.

Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper signed a memorandum today restricting all DOD uniformed and civilian personnel and their families from traveling to, from or through places identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's travel health notices as Level 3 COVID locations.

The memo is in effect until June 30, though that could change because reviews are taking place every 15 days based on CDC guidance.

The travel restrictions include permanent changes of station and all other official travel, as well as personal leave. Also, flights to or from non-Level 3 countries cannot transit through Level 3 nations.

As of today, the CDC website listed Germany, Italy, Qatar, Afghanistan, South Korea and Japan — countries where large numbers of service members are stationed — as Level 3 locations. Many other countries also are at Level 3.

Numerous exceptions to the travel ban have been made on a case-by-case basis, Donovan said at an April 18 Pentagon news conference, citing exemptions for medical treatment, personal hardship, separation and retirement.

""The coronavirus disease continues to present significant risk to our forces as the DOD considers domestic and overseas personnel travel,"" Esper stated in his memorandum. ""These movements present the threat of spreading COVID-19 within our ranks and communities. My priorities remain protecting our service members, DOD civilians and families; safeguarding our national security capabilities; and supporting the whole-of-nation response.""

This is not the first time extensions have been granted, officials noted. Special leave accrual of up to 75 days was granted during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, due to long or multiple deployments.

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army Public Health Center photo courtesy Getty Images) VIEW ORIGINAL

ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. – Following mandated stay-at-home and social distancing rules during the COVID-19 crisis is creating unique challenges for many individuals who are managing work, family and personal needs while still trying to stay healthy and not stress out or get too stir crazy. Health and nutrition experts at the Army Public Health Center have a number of recommendations to help keep you and your family on track.

Lt. Col. Leslie Roberson, a clinical psychologist and APHC behavioral health specialist, recognizes the challenges.

“Our family is spending more time together than usual due to COVID-19,” said Roberson. “Being together in close quarters can be challenging. Did I mention we are also sharing the internet with four teenagers and the internet is required for telework?”

Roberson recommends discussing daily work plans, especially when online meetings are occurring, so others in the household know when they need to be quiet.

“We have a freshman in the home and both my husband and I are teleworking,” said Sgt. 1st Class Sue Ellen Brown, the non-commissioned officer in charge of Pregnancy Postpartum Physical Training for Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. “A good strategy that has worked for us is to maintain a schedule and enforcing our timelines for workout, personal hygiene, lunch, break, and also balancing when our dog Elle wants attention and love.

Sgt. 1st Class Jonathan K. Settle, APHC Health Promotion and Wellness Directorate NCOIC, is adapting well to telework.

“Teleworking has made it possible to spend more time with the family. I am able to pause for short moments to regroup,” said Settle. “I still work the required hours but am able to space my time out through the day leading to a better quality of life.”

APHC experts say another strategy for maintaining good general health and managing stress while working from home is to maintain physical fitness levels. Personal physical training should include a balance of cardiorespiratory (endurance) exercise and resistance training. And you don’t need a gym to get it done. For example, the Army physical readiness training app also provides two weeks of PRT sessions that can be done with or without equipment. These resources can be found on the ACFT website at https://www.army.mil/acft/.

“Each morning before work begins, I try to incorporate walking the family dogs 15 minutes, and I also try and spend 15 minutes walking the dogs during lunch,” said Roberson. “I use a fitness tracker daily to monitor steps I've taken to make me be accountable. If I have less than 10,000 steps a day, I try not to go to bed until that goal has been met.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend that adults engage in 150 minutes per week of moderate activity (i.e. brisk walking, bike riding 10 to 12 mph) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week (jogging at 6 mph or biking at 14 to 16 mph) or a combination of both.

These workouts can also be conducted while following recommended social distancing guidelines, according to APHC experts. Cardiorespiratory training can be performed indoors on a treadmill, stationary bike, or stairs, or outside by going on a walk, run, or bike around the neighborhood. Large empty parking lots at a neighborhood school, church or shopping center may allow one to walk/run without any close contact with others. Make sure to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) at all times. If walking or running on trails, try to go during times when it is less crowded.

Brown also has a good workout routine.

“We are working out in the mornings with our teenagers; which relieves a lot of stress,” said Brown. “I also workout on Fridays with our P3T Soldiers via Facebook live, which has been a learning experience within itself.”

Another critical part of staying healthy is good nutrition, which is one leg of the Army Performance Triad of sleep, activity and nutrition. Staying healthy during “stay-at-home” requirements involve three key considerations: Eating a rainbow of eight servings of fruits and vegetables, eat a balanced plate, and hydrate with water throughout the day.

“We have made a conscious effort not to buy junk food and only keep healthy or semi-healthy food at the house,” said Brown. “We’re also cooking food at home to keep it healthy and attempting not to order out.”

The Army P3 nutrition webpage offers more ideas for creating the rainbow.

“The best thing to boost your immune system is to regularly eat a variety of foods with a focus on fruits and vegetables,” said Joanna Reagan, APHC registered dietitian. “Fruits and vegetables are extremely beneficial in disease prevention, making them nutritional powerhouses.”

Settle says he avoids stress eating by keeping healthy snacks around the house.

“We've never had many snacks in the house and when we do have snacks they usually consist of frozen grapes and chips,” said Settle. “When eating chips no one is allowed to eat out of the bag. All snacks are served in bowls to avoid eating the entire bag at one sitting.”

Eating a balanced plate is good for your immune system, said Reagan. She recommends focusing on nutrient rich foods while eating three balanced meals a day with healthy snacks. Key nutrients to help with immunity include Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, probiotic-rich foods, and omega 3-rich foods. Check out this P3 web page on supporting your immune system.

Staying hydrated throughout the day can also help boost immunity. This is also pretty easy to do when hydrating is as easy as a trip to the fridge.

“Set a reoccurring alarm on your phone to remind you to drink water at regular intervals,” said Reagan. “Add lemon or lime slices and fresh fruit to increase flavor.”

The last pillar of P3 is sleep. This can be especially challenging during this stressful time, but it’s important for a fit body and mind. Sleep experts recommend seven or more hours of sleep a night.

“Skimping on sleep could adversely affect your immune system, leaving you susceptible to illness, while sleeping longer may help you resist infections” said Dr. Sara Alger, a sleep research scientist in the Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. “Additionally, your brain and body require sleep to process what you have learned and experienced during the day and to aid post-workout muscle recovery. Also, getting a good night’s sleep helps with emotion regulation, which is important during this stressful time.”

Alger recommends setting a consistent bed and wake time and avoiding caffeine at least six hours before going to bed.

The final challenge of mandatory stay-at-home orders is in the name – social distancing. Plus, you’re stuck in your house alone, with family or maybe a roommate. How do you keep it fun and also stay connected with friends and family, whether across the country or a few miles away?

“I keep telling myself to stay in some type of shape mentally and physically because this will not last forever,” said Brown. “For my mental/spiritual state we are still attending church via Facebook Live, working out and keeping a routine at home. I also have personal time and family time.”

The internet makes it easier to stay connected, said Dr. Anna Courie, an APHC nurse and project officer.

“We maintain social connections by talking to friends on Facebook,” said Roberson. “We also make sure we call family and close friends weekly. For the upcoming Easter Holiday, we will FaceTime or Skype with family located in other states to wish them a happy holiday.”

Courie is also a big advocate for military families taking control of their needs and accessing those resources available in their communities.

“Army communities have a ton of resources available to support military families during difficult times,” said Courie. “You can access those resources via the Army Community Resource Guide.”

All Army families can download the CRG app via the iTunes/Google Play stores or access it at https://crg.amedd.army.mil.

Another resource promoting and sustaining healthy lifestyles during this time is the Army Wellness Center. AWCs offer a crucial link for health resources to the broader Army community. Local AWCs are providing a variety of services in an online format to continue their support of the health and wellbeing of active-duty service members, adult family members, retirees, and Department of the Army civilians. Services are free and this web page lists all AWC locations.

Settle says he likes doing puzzles with his daughter, playing card games, taking daily walks outside and listening to podcasts while doing mundane household chores.

“I lead a very boring and simple life but it makes me happy,” said Settle.

For more tips and strategies and maintaining your distance, but also your health, check out the Performance Triad Trending Topics page.

The Army Public Health Center focuses on promoting healthy people, communities, animals and workplaces through the prevention of disease, injury and disability of Soldiers, military retirees, their families, veterans, Army civilian employees, and animals through population-based monitoring, investigations, and technical consultations.

My mom and grandparents would be pleased with this honor of James,” said Richard Hanna, nephew of Ward. “We should all honor those who have served and are serving at home and abroad.”Ward was assigned to USS Oklahoma (BB 37) when it was sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor Dec. 7, 1941. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for remaining onboard and guiding his shipmates to safety with a flashlight.Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea, and other distinguished guests joined Ward’s family members at the Thursday ceremony.Franchetti presented Ward’s family with a replacement Medal of Honor medal, Medal of Honor Flag, and a copy of the citation prior to the ceremony.“On December 7th, 1941, our Sailors and Marines displayed unmatched resilience and heroism at Pearl Harbor,"" said Franchetti. ""Seaman 1st Class Ward is among these exceptional heroes and his actions that fateful Sunday morning are an inspiration to each of us. I am honored to see him properly laid to rest after these 82 years.”Ward was transported through the cemetery on a hearse-led caisson accompanied by the Old Guard and Navy Band.

On Feb. 22, 2022, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) announced that it had positively identified Ward’s remains on Aug. 19, 2021. As a symbol that Ward had been accounted for, a rosette now adorns his name in the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.Over 400,000 Veterans are buried at Arlington National Cemetery, with over 8,000 being World War II Veterans and over 400 being Medal of Honor Recipients.",
331,331.0,331.0,Wisconsin Man Sentenced to a Year in Prison for Violating the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wisconsin-man-sentenced-year-prison-violating-preventing-animal-cruelty-and-torture-act,"A Wisconsin man was sentenced yesterday to 12 months and one day in prison for violating the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act.

Kenneth J. Herrera, 40, of Soldiers Grove, had previously pleaded guilty for creating, selling and distributing an animal crushing video. Animal crushing includes burning, suffocating, impaling or causing the serious bodily injury of animals. The judge also sentenced Herrera to three years of supervised release and to pay a $5,000 fine.

In 2021, Herrera paid a videographer in Indonesia $100 for a video of a monkey being physically abused. Herrera sent specific instructions, which the videographer followed, asking that the monkey be picked up by the genitals using pliers and then hit on the head with a hammer. The videographer sent Herrera the video via an encrypted messaging application. The PACT Act makes it illegal to create or distribute depictions of animal crushing that will be sold or distributed internationally or between states.

“Animal crushing videos cruelly force animals into a cycle of fear, violence and death for personal gratification or profit,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “We are committed to aggressively pursuing and prosecuting anyone who engages in the creation or distribution of animal crush videos.”

“Video recordings of animal torture are cruel, inhumane and illegal,” said U.S. Attorney Timothy M. O’Shea for the Western District of Wisconsin. “Evidence shows that animal torture can be a precursor to other violent crimes. Our office will work with law enforcement, domestically and internationally, to investigate and prosecute all crimes of this nature.”

“The primary mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and our specific role in the Office of Law Enforcement, is to protect all wildlife from being unlawfully commercialized, in whatever form we find it,” said Assistant Director Edward Grace of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement. “The heinous crimes against wildlife that are centered in this investigation are an extreme example of that commitment. The success of this case is a direct result of our partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”

“The FBI stands resolute in our dedication to working with our federal and international partners to address animal cruelty violations,” said Special Agent in Charge Michael E. Hensle of the FBI Milwaukee Field Office. “We view the sentence handed down in this case under the Animal Crushing Statue not only as a measure of justice served, but also as a deterrent against future violations. We appreciate the opportunity to work with our partners at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Wisconsin on this investigation and will continue to rigorously enforce the laws designed to prevent such heinous acts.”

The FBI and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigated the case.

According to court documents, Armando Herrera, 43, of Miami, and his co-conspirators established companies in Florida, Texas, Washington, and California, which they used to sell and distribute adulterated prescription drugs, primarily HIV medications, to wholesale pharmaceutical suppliers. Herrera and his co-conspirators created false documentation to make it appear as though the drugs were acquired legitimately when, in fact, they were not. The pharmaceutical suppliers then sold the drugs to pharmacies, which dispensed the adulterated prescription drugs to unwitting patients. As part of the investigation, federal agents seized more than $1.5 million worth of adulterated prescription drugs from Herrera, including more than 16,000 tablets of adulterated and misbranded HIV medication.

Herrera pleaded guilty on Sept. 25 to one count of conspiracy to introduce adulterated and misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.

Dooley in Bridgeport to 144 months of in prison followed by a lifetime of supervised release, for attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), a designated foreign terrorist organization.

According to court documents and statements made in court, between August and October 2019, McCormick made several statements to others expressing a desire to travel to Syria and to fight for ISIS. In August 2019, McCormick stated to members of a Muslim community center that “we should support ISIS” and “jihad is the way to go.” In another conversation in October 2019, McCormick stated, “I gotta fight bro, because those people, Abu Masa and ISIL, they fought for me bro, I know it, I can feel it, in my heart. So it’s my time to fight . . . It just is what it is bro, it’s just my – it’s just my time to go bro.” When McCormick was asked to elaborate on where he would like to travel, McCormick responded, “I don’t know, I don’t know bro – it’s gotta be like Syria. Where ISIL is at….whichever place is easiest, whatever place I can get there the fastest, the quickest, the easiest, and where I can have a rifle and I can have some people bro. That’s what I need, I need a rifle and I need some people, I need Islamic law, I need, that’s what I need, because if I have these things, it’s gonna to be very hard to kill me.”

On Oct. 12, 2019, McCormick attempted to board a flight from Connecticut to Jamaica but was prevented by the Department of Homeland Security. McCormick subsequently told an individual that he wanted to travel to Jamaica, and then onward to Syria to join ISIS. He also indicated that he wanted to acquire weapons.

On Oct. 19, 2019, McCormick made a video during which he pledged allegiance to ISIS and its then-leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. Also on that date, he purchased a plane ticket from Toronto, Canada, to Amman, Jordan. On Oct. 21, 2019, McCormick was arrested after he traveled to a small private airport in Connecticut where he expected to board a plane that would fly him to Canada.

McCormick has been detained since his arrest. On Jan. 12, he pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.

334,334.0,334.0,Former Swiss Executive Pleads Guilty to Tax Fraud Conspiracy,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-swiss-executive-pleads-guilty-tax-fraud-conspiracy,"A Swiss national pleaded guilty today to conspiring to defraud the United States for his role in a scheme to help high-net-worth U.S. taxpayers conceal their income and assets in offshore accounts.

According to court documents and statements made in court, Rolf Schnellmann was the former head of Allied Finance Trust AG, a Zurich-based financial services company and a subsidiary of the Allied Finance Group in Liechtenstein. From approximately 2008 to 2014, Schnellmann and his co-conspirators defrauded the IRS by concealing income and assets of high-net-worth U.S. taxpayer-clients in undeclared bank accounts at Privatbank IHAG Zurich AG (IHAG), a Swiss private bank.

Schnellmann and his co-conspirators devised and implemented a scheme dubbed the “Singapore Solution” to fraudulently conceal the bank accounts of the U.S. taxpayer-clients, their assets and their income from U.S. authorities. As part of the scheme, Schnellmann and his co-conspirators conspired to transfer more than $60 million from the U.S. taxpayer-clients’ undeclared IHAG bank accounts through a series of nominee accounts in Hong Kong and other locations before returning the funds to newly opened accounts at IHAG in the name of a Singapore-based asset-management firm that a co-conspirator helped establish. The U.S. taxpayer-clients paid large fees to IHAG and others to help them conceal their funds and assets and evade taxes.

Schnellmann was arrested in August in Italy and extradited to the United States. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 19, 2024, and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, as well as a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Tyler Anderson, 30, of Dover, was charged with three counts of transmitting in interstate commerce a threat to injure the person of another. Anderson was arrested on Dec. 9, and he made an initial appearance in federal court on Dec. 11. On Dec. 14, the court released him on conditions.

“We have seen an increase in threats of violence against public officials and those seeking public office across the country, and I have made clear that these types of illegal threats undermine the function of our democracy,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “We will not tolerate illegal threats of violence directed at public officials or those seeking public office.”

According to the charging documents, Anderson sent a series of threatening text messages to three separate presidential campaigns going back to November. On Nov. 22, Anderson threatened to “impale” and “disembowel” one candidate. On Dec. 6, Anderson threatened a second candidate in a series of text messages, including that he would “blow” the ""head off"" of the candidate and conduct a “mass shooting.” On Dec. 8, Anderson threatened via text message that he would “blow” the “brains out” of a third candidate and “kill everyone” who would attend a then-upcoming campaign event.

Anderson faces a maximum of five years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000 for each charge. A federal district court judge will determine a sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

The FBI led the investigation. Valuable assistance was provided by the Dover Police Department and the Portsmouth Police Departments.

336,336.0,336.0,Nurse Practitioner Sentenced for $192M Medicare Fraud Scheme,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nurse-practitioner-sentenced-192m-medicare-fraud-scheme,"A Florida woman was sentenced today to 20 years in prison for her role in a scheme to defraud Medicare by submitting over $192 million in claims for genetic tests and durable medical equipment that patients did not need and telemedicine visits that never occurred.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Elizabeth Hernandez, 45, of Miami, signed thousands of orders for medically unnecessary orthotic braces and genetic testing for Medicare beneficiaries she never spoke to, examined, or treated. As part of the scheme, telemarketing companies would contact Medicare beneficiaries to convince them to accept orthotic braces and genetic tests and would then send pre-filled orders for these products to Hernandez, who signed them, attesting that she had examined or treated the patients. However, she had never spoken with many of the patients, and she often had others, including non-licensed individuals, sign her name to fraudulent orders. Hernandez also falsified information in the orders about beneficiaries’ symptoms and injuries.

During the period of the conspiracy, Hernandez ordered more cancer genetic tests for Medicare beneficiaries than any other provider in the nation. In 2020, when Medicare expanded its telemedicine coverage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hernandez also billed Medicare for thousands of telemedicine visits she never performed, routinely billing over 24 hours of telemedicine in a single day. Hernandez personally pocketed approximately $1.6 million in the scheme, which she used to purchase expensive cars, jewelry, home renovations, and travel.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Deputy Inspector General for Investigations Christian J.

The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s efforts to combat health care fraud through the Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program. Since March 2007, this program, currently comprised of nine strike forces operating in 27 federal districts, has charged more than 5,400 defendants who collectively have billed federal health care programs and private insurers more than $27 billion. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with HHS-OIG, are taking steps to hold providers accountable for their involvement in health care fraud schemes.

337,337.0,337.0,Pharmaceutical Company Ultragenyx Agrees to Pay $6 Million for Allegedly Paying Kickbacks to Induce Claims for Its Drug Crysvita,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/pharmaceutical-company-ultragenyx-agrees-pay-6-million-allegedly-paying-kickbacks-induce,"Pharmaceutical company Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Ultragenyx) has agreed to pay $6 million to resolve allegations that it caused the submission of false claims to Medicare and Medicaid, in violation of the False Claims Act, by paying for free genetic tests, plus a separate fee to receive test result information for marketing purposes, to collectively induce prescriptions of its drug Crysvita and referrals of health care providers (HCPs) to Ultragenyx for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of Crysvita.

Ultragenyx is a pharmaceutical manufacturer with a principal place of business in California that manufactures Crysvita. Crysvita is an FDA-approved drug to treat X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) in adult and pediatric patients six months of age and older. XLH is a rare inherited disorder characterized by low levels of phosphate in the blood, which can lead to weak bones and, in many instances, may require a genetic test to definitively diagnose.

Ultragenyx understood that, in some cases, a positive genetic test for a genetic mutation consistent with XLH would be required for an insurer (including Medicare or Medicaid) to pay for a patient’s prescription for Crysvita, or for a healthcare provider (HCP) to make a definitive diagnosis of XLH and prescribe Crysvita. Thus, Ultragenyx entered into an arrangement with a genetic testing laboratory (Laboratory), whereby Ultragenyx paid the Laboratory to conduct genetic tests — at no cost to HCPs or patients — and provide the results to the HCP. Ultragenyx referred to this program as its “sponsored” XLH testing program and Ultragenyx sales personnel discussed the XLH testing program with HCPs and delivered order forms for the tests to HCP offices.

Ultragenyx separately paid the Laboratory to provide the test results to Ultragenyx, including the name of the HCP who ordered the test, a de-identified patient ID number, the date the test was ordered and — once ready — the test result itself (collectively, Results Reports). Ultragenyx used the Results Reports, in part, for marketing purposes to find potential Crysvita patients and their HCPs. Until April 2022, Ultragenyx received Results Reports and disseminated this information to its sales force with instructions to make sales calls for Crysvita to HCPs who ordered a test or, in particular, who had a patient with a positive test result. Ultragenyx’s sales force followed up with HCPs regarding test results. The United States contends that, as a result of these actions, Ultragenyx caused the submission of false claims to Medicare and Medicaid by paying kickbacks 1) to beneficiaries in the form of free genetic tests to induce their purchase of Medicare or Medicaid-reimbursed Crysvita and 2) to the Laboratory for the Results Reports to induce the referral to Ultragenyx of HCPs to whom Ultragenyx could market Crysvita.

As part of the settlement, Ultragenyx admitted and accepted responsibility for certain facts providing the basis of the settlement.

“The department is committed to protecting the integrity of federal health care programs and the medical care received by their beneficiaries,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division. “A primary focus of this effort is the pursuit of kickback schemes that can allow third parties, such as pharmaceutical manufactures, to insert themselves into the doctor-patient relationship and potentially undermine the objectivity of treatment decisions by physicians and patients.

“Kickbacks, in whatever form, have no business in our federal healthcare system” said Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy for the District of Massachusetts. “We are always on the lookout for financial kickbacks that can improperly influence medical decisions, undermine patient care and cause waste to federal healthcare programs. As medical practices evolve, our office is committed to ferreting out improper financial kickbacks of any permutation.”

“Kickback arrangements designed to improperly influence medical decisions will always be an investigative priority for our agency,” said Special Agent in Charge Roberto Coviello of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “The goals of our continued enforcement in this area are to protect the integrity of taxpayer-funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and to curb schemes that can inappropriately manipulate the health care choices of patients and their doctors.”

“The FBI and its partners will not stand by when a pharmaceutical company illegally takes advantage of our health care system,” said Executive Assistant Director Timothy Langan of the FBI’s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. “Those who engage in activity that violates the False Claims Act must face the consequences of their actions. As we strive to protect the American people, we will not stop working to combat healthcare fraud.”

The allegations resolved by the settlement agreement were, in part, originally brought in a case filed under the whistleblower, or qui tam, provision of the False Claims Act. The case is captioned United States ex rel. Ruggiero v. Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Inc. (D. Mass.) (No. 1:21-cv-11176-ADB). The False Claims Act permits private parties to sue for fraud on behalf of the United States and to share in any recovery. The act also permits the government to intervene in such actions, as the government did, in part, in this case. Of the total $6 million recovery, approximately $5.8 million constitutes a recovery for Medicare and the federal share of Medicaid and approximately $200,000 constitutes a recovery for State Medicaid programs. The whistleblower will receive approximately $1.07 million from the federal portion of the recovery.

The government’s pursuit of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement can be reported to HHS at 800‑HHS‑TIPS (800-447-8477).

The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts, with investigative support from HHS-OIG and the FBI’s Boston Field Office.

This matter was handled by Senior Counsel for Health Care Fraud Augustine Ripa and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian LaMacchia and Diane Seol for the District of Massachusetts.

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.",
338,338.0,338.0,"Justice Department Secures Agreement with Tampa, Florida, to Resolve Discrimination Allegations Related to Its Parental Leave Policy",https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-tampa-florida-resolve-discrimination-allegations,"The Justice Department announced today that it secured a settlement agreement with the City of Tampa, Florida, to resolve the department’s lawsuit alleging that Tampa discriminated against its male employees who sought parental leave by denying them the same level of parental leave it offered to its female employees.

The alleged discrimination resulted in a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII is a federal statute that prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion and sex, including pregnancy policies, and prohibits retaliation against employees for opposing discriminatory employment practices.

“Providing paid parental leave to employees is a significant benefit that many families rely on so that they can take care of their children,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This agreement sends a clear message that in providing paid or unpaid parental leave, employers must guarantee that those benefits are provided without reliance on presumptions about which parent can be the primary caregiver. The Justice Department is steadfast in its commitment to enforce federal civil rights laws and ensure that employers provide all employees leave benefits without discrimination.”

“Employers must grant parental leave benefits regardless of sex,” said U.S. Attorney Roger Handberg for the Middle District of Florida. “The resolution achieved in this case is a demonstration of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s assurance to the community that employment discrimination based on a protected class, including sex, will not be tolerated.”

According to the complaint, the City of Tampa adopted a parental leave policy from February 2017 to December 2018 that in practice barred male employees from using up to 320 hours of parental leave available to female employees for the purpose of serving as “primary caregivers” of a new child. Instead, Tampa granted male employees only 80 hours of parental leave as “secondary caregivers,” even if they were actually the primary caregiver for the family’s new child. In the complaint, the Justice Department states that about 150 male employees were impacted by the parental leave policy and approved for secondary caregiver leave of up to 80 hours.

According to the complaint, at least 10 male employees formally requested primary caregiver leave and were denied the leave because of their sex, regardless of how much evidence they provided to Tampa to show that they were acting as the primary caregiver for the child, while others were discouraged from applying for primary caregiver leave by their supervisors or officials with the City’s Human Resources department. As the complaint states, men were consistently denied primary caregiver leave status, while Tampa regularly granted female caregivers the full 320 hours of primary caregiver leave.

Under the proposed consent decree, which is subject to court approval, Tampa will credit up to 240 hours of additional leave time to each of the male employees who would have taken primary caregiver parental leave if it had been available to them under the policy. Tampa will also pay the impacted employees collectively $300,000 in compensation. The consent decree also requires Tampa to adopt new policies and procedures, including a new parental leave policy that does not discriminate based on sex, and to provide its employees training on these new policies.

The United States’ complaint is based on a charge of discrimination filed with the Miami District Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) by one of Tampa’s employees impacted by the parental leave policy, Jeffrey Burger. The EEOC investigated and found reasonable cause to believe that Tampa violated Title VII. After unsuccessful conciliation efforts, the EEOC referred it to the Justice Department as an enforcement action.

“Parental leave policies should not reflect presumptions or stereotypes about gender roles,” said Director Tamra Schweiberger of the EEOC Tampa Field Office. “When it comes to providing leave for bonding with a new child or flexibility in returning to work from that leave, mothers and fathers should be treated equally.”

Trial Attorneys Jeffrey Morrison and Christine Dinan of the Civil Rights Division’s Employment Litigation Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Yohance A. Pettis for the Middle District of Florida handled this case.

The Justice Department’s lawsuit is part of a joint effort to enhance collaboration between the Department and the EEOC in the vigorous enforcement of Title VII. More information about the EEOC’s jurisdiction is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov. Additional information regarding caregiver discrimination is available in the EEOC technical assistance document found at EEOC Releases Information about Employment Discrimination Against Caregivers | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it will launch a new survey in January 2024 that will serve as a foundation for continued analysis of the capabilities and challenges of the broader U.S. semiconductor supply chain and national defense industrial base. The intent of the survey is to identify how U.S. companies are sourcing current-generation and mature-node semiconductors, also known as legacy chips. This analysis will inform U.S. policy to bolster the semiconductor supply chain, promote a level playing field for legacy chip production, and reduce national security risks posed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

“Legacy chips are essential to supporting critical U.S. industries, like telecommunications, automotive and the defense industrial base. Addressing non-market actions by foreign governments that threaten the U.S. legacy chip supply chain is a matter of national security,” said Secretary Gina Raimondo. “Over the last few years, we’ve seen potential signs of concerning practices from the PRC to expand their firms’ legacy chip production and make it harder for U.S. companies to compete. To get ahead of these concerns, the Department of Commerce is taking proactive measures to assess the U.S. semiconductor supply chain by collecting data from U.S. companies on the sourcing of their legacy chips. Government alone cannot create and sustain a robust supply chain – we need industry at the table. This survey will empower the Department with the data we need to inform our next steps in building strong, diverse, and resilient semiconductor supply chains.”

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within Commerce will launch the survey, which focuses on the use and sourcing of PRC-manufactured legacy chips in the supply chains of critical U.S. industries. The survey is a response to findings in a Congressionally-mandated report also released this week, which assesses the capabilities of the U.S. microelectronics industrial base to support U.S. national defense. That report was prepared pursuant to Section 9904 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.

Companies headquartered in the U.S. account for approximately half of global semiconductor revenue but face intense competition supported by increasing subsidies from foreign governments. The 9904 report recommends that the United States promotes a level playing field for semiconductor manufacturing in the United States through support for domestic fabrication, assembly, test, and package capabilities, continued protection of U.S. technology through export controls, and further assessment of potential non-market behavior. BIS completed the data collection in May 2023 and developed the 9904 report and recommendations in coordination with the CHIPS Program Office. The full study directed under Section 9904 is available on BIS’s website.",

Date of action: Dec. 8, 2023

Type of action: Order granting Department of Labor’s motion to intervene

Court: U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains, New York

Defendants: Berkshire Nursery & Supply Corp.

Rosa Contracting Inc.

Rosa Land Tech Design Inc.

Jesus Flores

Background: In October 2022, two employees sued their former employers in a private action for claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, as well as various state laws. The employers recently sought to depose the former employee plaintiffs. The department, which has its own pending litigation and investigation involving two of the private defendants, learned that the employers intended to interrogate the plaintiffs about their communications with the department. Because such inquiry could result in the identification of individuals who communicated or cooperated with department investigators, department counsel requested to attend the depositions and ultimately, filed a motion to intervene in the private suit to protect such privileged information. In particular, the government informant’s privilege protects the identities of individuals who communicate with the department.

Resolution: On Dec. 8, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the department’s motion to intervene in the private action so that the department could protect privileges such as the informant’s privilege. Since the court granted the motion to intervene, the department’s Regional Solicitor’s Office in New York has attended the depositions and objected to questions that may have elicited information that would reveal informants’ identities. The private litigation is ongoing.

Quote: “The U.S. Department of Labor protects the identities of workers who provide information to the department to the greatest extent possible,” said Regional Solicitor of Labor Jeffrey S. Rogoff in New York. “Our intervention in a private Fair Labor Standards Act action shows that we will take necessary steps to protect the confidentiality of those communications. We are pleased the court recognized the department’s interests.”

Significance: The procedural step of moving to intervene in a private FLSA action was taken to ensure that the identities of any informants who may have cooperated with the department during its investigation of Berkshire Nursery & Supply Corp. and Jesus Flores are not revealed, thereby protecting workers from unlawful retaliation. Notably, the court found that the department’s enforcement framework relies on its ability to protect the identities of informants, and that the department had a concrete interest in private proceedings where the identities of these informants could be revealed during the discovery process.

The department’s Wage and Hour Division’s White Plains office is currently investigating two of the defendants in the private suit: Berkshire Nursery & Supply Corp., a Patterson nursery and garden supply business, and its president, Jesus Flores. In January 2023, the department brought its own lawsuit against Berkshire Nursery and Supply Corp. and Jesus Flores, alleging that they had obstructed the department’s investigation and retaliated against employees, and successfully sought a temporary restraining order to immediately enjoin such conduct. Ultimately, the court entered a consent preliminary injunction, which is still in effect. Both the department’s investigation and its lawsuit are ongoing.

OSHA proposal seeks to update 1980s ‘Fire Brigades’ standard

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced that its Occupational Safety and Health Administration will publish a proposal in January 2024 to update an existing standard and expand safety and health protections for emergency responders, including firefighters, emergency medical service providers and technical search and rescue workers. President Biden is committed to protecting our emergency responders, the same way they protect us every day—and this proposed rule is a critical step to ensure their safety.

OSHA will issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to modernize the agency’s “Fire Brigades” standard — first published in 1980 — as its protections for a narrow set of industrial and private firefighters have become outdated.

Currently, OSHA regulations protect emergency responders’ safety and health in a patchwork of decades-old, hazard-specific standards. Not designed as comprehensive emergency response standards, they fail to address the full range of job hazards faced by today’s emergency responders. The newly named “Emergency Response” standard updates safety and health protections in line with national consensus standards for a broad range of workers exposed to hazards that arise during and after fires and other emergencies.

The proposal will include major changes for protective clothing and equipment and significant improvements in safety and health practices that the industry generally accepts as standard procedures.

“Emergency responders are critical workers in all of our communities, and they deserve protections that keep up with today’s industry practices,” said Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. “We are proposing much-needed updates that will expand protections for emergency workers and bring our standards closer to common industry procedures.”

The proposed rule requires employers to obtain baseline medical screening for all emergency responders and ensure continued medical surveillance for responders when they are exposed to the byproducts of fires and explosions more than 15 times annually. The proposal also includes a variety of other requirements to better protect both workers whose primary job is emergency response and those whose emergency response duties are in addition to their regular daily work duties.

Inspections resulted in 52 significant, substantial and 6 unwarrantable failure findings

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor announced today that its Mine Safety and Health Administration completed impact inspections at 14 mines in 10 states in November 2023, issuing 184 violations and one safeguard.

The agency began impact inspections after an April 2010 explosion in West Virginia at the Upper Big Branch Mine killed 29 miners.

To date, MSHA’s impact inspections in 2023 have identified 2,491 violations, including 706 significant and substantial and 52 unwarrantable failure findings. An S&S violation is one that is reasonably likely to cause a reasonably serious injury or illness. Violations designated as unwarrantable failures occur when an inspector finds aggravated conduct that constitutes more than ordinary negligence.

The agency conducts impact inspections at mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to poor compliance history; previous accidents, injuries, and illnesses; and other compliance concerns. Of the 184 violations MSHA identified in November, 52 were evaluated as S&S and six had unwarrantable failure findings. The agency completed these inspections at mines in Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

“The November 2023 impact inspection results show yet again the value of these inspections in identifying violations of mandatory safety and health standards,” said Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health Chris Williamson. “But it is troubling that the findings of November’s impact inspections closely mirror those of others in 2023.”

“The Mine Act makes clear that the ultimate responsibility for the safety and health of miners lies with mine operators. MSHA will continue to publish the results of impact inspections and urges mine operators to take proactive steps to make certain they are protecting miners from injuries or fatalities. We are all troubled by the mining industry’s trend of increased fatalities this year. MSHA has worked to leverage all the tools Congress gave the agency – outreach, education and enforcement – to protect miners and will continue to look for ways to work together with the entire mining community in reversing this trend,” Williamson added.

The Hazen Mine in Hazen, North Dakota, was among the mines MSHA inspected in November. Selected given its enforcement history, the mine is operated by North Dakota Proppant. The inspection identified 30 violations, including 10 S&S and five unwarrantable failure findings. Specifically, MSHA inspectors found the following conditions existed at the Hazen mine:

Failure to provide and maintain guarding around moving machine parts. Overall, inspectors cited inadequate guarding most frequently during this inspection. The lack of appropriate protection from moving machine parts can contribute to fatal mine accidents and disabling injuries to miners.

Failure to provide safe access to working areas was the second-most frequently cited violation during this inspection. These conditions exposed miners to potential fall hazards. Earlier in 2023, MSHA issued a safety alert regarding the dangers associated with working at heights. The agency continues to remind operators and contractors of best practices for preventing falls, such as designing an effective fall prevention and protection program as well as providing task training.

Other serious violations including housekeeping violations, lack of berms around water, and equipment defects that were not corrected in a timely manner.

343,343.0,343.0,Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Action to Increase Naloxone Access in Federal Facilities Across the Nation,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/12/21/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-increase-naloxone-access-federal-facilities-across-nation.html,"Latest action advances President Biden’s Unity Agenda efforts to beat the overdose epidemic,
continuing commitment to a whole-of-society effort to prevent fatal overdoses, reduce
stigmatization associated with addiction, and save lives.
Washington, D.C. – Today, in support of President Biden’s Unity Agenda efforts to beat the overdose epidemic, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) announced new guidance recommending that all federal facilities across the nation include overdose reversal medications in their safety stations on site. The recommendation will make life-saving medications like naloxone more readily available in case of an emergency situation.
“Far too many lives are being lost to overdose. Fortunately, we know what it takes to save people. Safety stations save lives,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We must continue to do everything we can to make sure the necessary tools are quickly and easily available so anyone can respond to an emergency situation - anytime, anywhere. It's about empowering everyone to play a role in saving lives when it counts the most.”
“Today, we are taking the historic step to recommend that every federal facility across the nation has lifesaving overdose reversal medications like naloxone on site,” said White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Dr. Rahul Gupta. “Under President Biden’s leadership, we have worked to make overdose reversal medication more accessible and available than ever before. These lifesaving medications should be as readily available as fire extinguishers or defibrillators in all public spaces, from schools, to housing communities, to restaurants, retail, and other businesses.  And now, as the nation’s largest employer, we are leading by example. President Biden’s Unity Agenda calls for all Americans to come together to beat the overdose epidemic, and the private sector has a critical role to play in saving lives and ending this crisis.”
“Saving lives is at the very core of the HHS Overdose Prevention Strategy and that’s why it’s so important for federal facilities to have naloxone and other opioid overdose reversal medications readily available,"" said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. “Taking this step ensures these lifesaving medications are accessible, and protects the millions of Americans that work in and visit these facilities every year.”
The updated guidelines expand the concept of an automated external defibrillators (AED) program by introducing the “safety station,” which would enable anyone located within a federal facility to access the necessary tools quickly and easily to respond to an emergency situation. Under the new guidance, anywhere that an AED was previously located can and should be converted to a safety station. Each safety station is recommended to include an AED and supporting equipment at a minimum. It is now highly recommended that each station also includes either a bystander-empowered opioid reversal agent or hemorrhagic control component, or both.
Expanding access to overdose reversal medications is a key part of President Biden’s National Drug Control Strategy - PDF, and the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action over the past three years to deliver on this priority. The Biden-Harris Administration has invested historic amounts of funding in the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant program for states and Tribes to make overdose reversal medications available to their residents at no cost. HHS’s Overdose Prevention Strategy, which is designed to address the overdose crisis by increasing access to the full continuum of care and services for people who use substances that cause overdose, including increasing availability of overdose reversal medications. Using federal SOR grant dollars, states have purchased nearly 9 million naloxone kits and helped reverse more than 500,000 overdoses. Earlier this year, the FDA also approved certain naloxone nasal sprays for non-prescription, over-the-counter use in March and July. Now, for the first time ever, naloxone is available for over-the-counter purchase at grocery stores and pharmacies across the country. Other opioid overdose reversal medications are also available with a prescription and may be covered by health insurers.
Today’s announcement also delivers on President Biden’s Unity Agenda, which focuses on issues where all Americans can come together and make progress for the nation. During his first State of the Union Address, President Biden announced beating the overdose epidemic as one of the four pillars of his Unity Agenda. Since then, the Administration has worked to strengthen not only the whole-of-government response, but the whole-of-society response to address this public health and public safety crisis head-on. Earlier this month, ONDCP, HHS, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) called on public health departments and health care systems to partner with housing providers, community development organizations, and other housing agencies to help expand access to naloxone and other life-saving overdose reversal medications in the communities they serve, noting the critical role housing providers play in ensuring that all public spaces have lifesaving medications on hand and people are prepared to use it. Last month, ONDCP and the U.S. Department of Education called on schools and educators to have overdose reversal medications on site and ensure their students and faculty are prepared to use it in the event of a drug poisoning or overdose to save lives.
As naloxone became available for over-the-counter purchase for the first time ever earlier this summer, ONDCP Director Dr. Rahul Gupta joined HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and senior HHS leadership for a live naloxone demonstration event to educate HHS staff and the public on the importance of increasing awareness, reducing stigmatization, and expanding access to lifesaving overdose reversal medications.
Over the past three years, the Administration has taken historic action to increase access to this lifesaving tool, including:
Convening U.S. drug manufacturers who have FDA-approved overdose reversal medication products to discuss ways to increase access and affordability to save more lives;
Launching a campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl and the lifesaving effects of naloxone with the Ad Council;
Facilitating the availability of naloxone to harm reduction organizations directly from manufacturers and distributors to support expanded public access to this critical medicine.
Supporting states through enhanced technical assistance, policy academies, and convenings to ensure existing State Opioid Response funds are used to saturate hard-hit communities with naloxone;

Washington, D.C.- Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announced the first updated guidelines for safety stations in federal facilities in the past 15 years. This expands the existing recommendation beyond automated external defibrillators (AED) to also include opioid reversal agents such as naloxone and hemorrhagic control such as Stop the Bleed® (STB).
Overdose reversal medications that can reverse an opioid-involved overdose, including a fentanyl-involved overdose, can be found in many schools, libraries, and other community institutions and should be readily available in and around federal buildings. Hemorrhagic control provides immediate post-injury care in the recognition and treatment of a bleeding emergency. Access to bleeding control equipment is beneficial to occupants of federal facilities.
“These updated guidelines are based on the best available science and represent a flexible and collective response as a federal family,” said HHS Assistant Secretary for Health ADM Rachel L. Levine. “An emergency can happen in any setting, including our workplaces. We all need to be prepared to save a life anytime, anywhere.”
“Today’s actions represent a federal partnership that not only provides the framework for expanding access to additional life-saving equipment in federal facilities, but also offers the acquisition resources to develop and maintain those safety stations,” said GSA Associate Administrator for Government-wide Policy Krystal Brumfield, the agency’s Chief Acquisition Officer. “These updated safety stations can make a critical difference, and help our workforce get home to their families if there is ever an emergency.”
The updated guidelines expand the concept of an AED program by introducing the “safety station,” which would enable anyone located within a federal facility to access the necessary tools quickly and easily to respond to an emergency situation. Under the new recommendation, anywhere that an AED was previously located can and should be converted to a safety station.
Each safety station is recommended to include an AED and supporting equipment at a minimum. It is now highly recommended that each station also includes either a bystander-empowered opioid reversal agent or hemorrhagic control component, or both.
The primary purpose of these guidelines is to provide a general framework for establishing a design process for safety station programs in Federal facilities. A secondary purpose is to familiarize federal agencies with the three modular bystander-empowered components and the essential elements associated with each component of such a program.
The design of a safety station program for any federal facility will be unique and depends on many factors, including the population demographics of the facility, the size and location of the facility and the surrounding area. These guidelines are intended to provide a foundation upon which individually tailored programs are established and maintained.
The safety station program is voluntary and not mandatory for federal facilities. The costs and expenses to establish and operate a safety station program are the responsibility of the federal agency or agencies sponsoring the program.

345,345.0,345.0,U.S. Department of Energy Top Clean Energy Accomplishments in 2023,https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-top-clean-energy-accomplishments-2023,"DOE Concludes 2023 by Celebrating Billions in Historic Clean Energy Investments, Successful Energy Cost Saving Programs, and Workforce Training Initiatives that will Boost our Clean Energy Economy 




WASHINGTON, D.C. — In 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) made monumental strides in advancing the clean energy goals of the Biden-Harris Administration. Through hundreds of funding announcements to make clean energy more accessible in every state, investments in scientific research, historic groundbreakings, and celebratory ribbon cuttings, DOE has been hard at work to combat the climate crisis, lower costs for American families, and pave a path for our clean energy future.Here are a few of our top accomplishments of 2023:  Launching America’s First Clean Hydrogen Hubs: In October, DOE announced $7 billion in investments to launch seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) across the nation and accelerate the commercial-scale deployment of low-cost, clean hydrogen—a valuable energy product that can be produced with zero or near-zero carbon emissions and is crucial to meeting the President’s climate and energy security goals. Funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the seven H2Hubs will kickstart a national network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers, and connective infrastructure while supporting the production, storage, delivery, and end-use of clean hydrogen. This transformative Federal investment will be matched by recipients to leverage a total of nearly $50 billion to strengthen local economies, create and maintain high-quality jobs—especially those that support worker organizing and collective bargaining—and slash harmful emissions that jeopardize public health and pollute local ecosystems. The states selected are West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, California, Texas, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and Montana.Making Historic Investments in the Grid: This year, DOE made the largest federal investment in the grid in history. Through more than $8 billion in grid investments including $3.5 billion to modernize and strengthen the grid through the Grid Resilience Innovation Partnership (GRIP) Program, $1.3 billion in transmission investments through the Transmission Facilitation Program that aims to add 3.5 GW of additional grid capacity and create more than 13,000 direct and indirect jobs, over $750 million in formula grants to states, tribes, and territories to boost grid resilience, and $37 million in hydropower incentives. These investments will help to ensure that the families can keep their lights on during and after extreme weather, wildfire, and natural disasters.Strengthening Commitment to Puerto Rico: From January through November, Secretary Granholm set out on a Community Engagement Tour, a series of town-hall style events coordinated with Hispanic Federation where residents and community members voiced the unique needs and priorities of their communities. During the Tour, Secretary Granholm visited nearly 20 communities in Puerto Rico, speaking to homeowners and community leaders about their clean energy needs. In July 2023, DOE announced the first funding opportunity under the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund for $450 million to support the installation of up to 40,000 residential solar and battery storage systems across Puerto Rico, with a focus on the most vulnerable households and communities. Building a Convenient and Reliable National EV Charging Network: In December, Ohio and New York marked the first states in the nation to open electric vehicle (EV) charging stations funded through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. These new charging stations will fill gaps in charging, add capacity, and boost the reliability of our nation’s fast charging network. Other new charging station launches will follow in 2024, with stations already under construction in Maine, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. In May, DOE, through the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, launched the National Charging Experience Consortium, a new effort led by DOE’s national laboratories works to rapidly develop solutions that ensure a reliable and frictionless charging experience for all Americans. The development and maintenance of a robust charging network will create jobs and stimulate economic growth in local communities, while public and private investments in EV charging infrastructure will catalyze technological innovation across multiple economic sectors.Lowering Costs for Americans:  The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program (EECBG)—designed to assist states, local governments, and Tribes in implementing strategies to reduce energy use, to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and to improve energy efficiency—made substantial progress through EECBG’s formula grant program, making $550 million available to more than 2,700 eligible states, local governments, territories, and Tribes. In addition, the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) Retrofit and Readiness team had a busy year in 2023, reviewing and approving over 160 State Plans and deploying $3.17 billion in WAP funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). In October 2023, DOE announced the launch of the Affordable Home Energy Shot™, a new initiative focused on the research, development, and demonstration of clean energy solutions to decarbonize and deliver energy and cost savings for affordable homes. The Shot will reduce the cost of energy-efficient retrofits in affordable homes by 50% and decrease residents’ energy costs by at least 20% within a decade.Prioritizing Environmental Justice: In October, DOE reached a significant milestone in its journey toward achieving a just and equitable energy economy—changing the name of the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity to the Office of Energy Justice and Equity to better reflect DOE’s commitment to energy justice and tackling the climate crisis through equity-centered solutions. This year, DOE, along with the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, launched the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program, which received more than 46,000 applications in its first month. This program, supported by the Inflation Reduction Act, addresses the need to expand access to cost-saving clean energy projects in underserved communities through a groundbreaking tax incentive for solar and wind projects across the country. DOE also invested over $75 million in Tribal communities across the nation, including Tribal Colleges and Universities, American Indian, and Alaska Native communities, to expand their access to clean energy technologies, reduce and stabilize energy costs, and improve Tribal energy sovereignty.Training the Next Generation of the Clean Energy Workforce: In June, DOE announced a $13.5 million investment, primarily funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, in 12 training partnerships to expand the solar energy workforce in underserved and underrepresented communities, as well as create career pathways with thousands of good-paying jobs. DOE also released $220 million for grants to support the training of a qualified and diverse clean energy workforce through programs including $150 million from the State- Based Home Energy Efficiency Contractor Training formula program prepares local and regional clean energy workforce professionals to decarbonize residential buildings through energy efficiency solutions and $40 million from the Energy Auditor Training Program which trains individuals to conduct energy audits of commercial and residential buildings to save customers money on their energy bills, and reduce pollution from building energy use. In conjunction with National Apprenticeship week, DOE also announced over $40 million for Industrial Assessment Centers and Building Training and Assessment Centers to expand training opportunities for in-demand, high-quality jobs while identifying opportunities for organizations to save energy, improve productivity, and reduce waste. Accelerating Domestic Manufacturing and Boosting Our Supply Chain: As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, DOE has been committed to supercharging domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. This year DOE made countless investments in our domestic supply chain including $5.5 billion to boost domestic production of advanced batteries, battery materials, and electrified vehicles; over $13 billion in Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program conditional commitments to support the advanced technology vehicles supply chain; $169 million to accelerate electric heat pump manufacturing at 15 sites across the country; and over $390 million to expand solar, wind, and vehicle technology domestic manufacturing.Leading in Scientific Advancements: As the world enters a new era of technology, DOE emerged as a key government player by launching a new departmental element, the Office of Critical and Emerging Technology (CET), to ensure U.S. investments in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, quantum computing, and semiconductors leverage the Department’s wide range of assets and expertise to accelerate progress in these critical sectors. DOE also enabled an AI non-production workspace known as the Discovery Zone. The Generative AI Discovery Zone is a sandbox environment to provide DOE AI researchers and developers a platform to experiment with Google’s Generative AI tools using public data. In November, DOE’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) team, led by researchers and computational scientists across eight DOE national laboratories, broke new barriers with The Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model Running on the Frontier Exascale System (SCREAM) which performed an unprecedented global climate model simulation on the world’s first exascale supercomputer, Frontier. This year the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Lab not only replicated but exceeded its groundbreaking fusion ignition of December 2022, when it produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it.Keeping DOE-Owned Lands Clean: In July, DOE announced the Cleanup to Clean Energy initiative, an innovative effort to repurpose parts of DOE-owned lands—portions of which were previously used in the nation’s nuclear weapons program—into the sites of clean-energy generation. Cleanup to Clean Energy will help achieve President Biden’s ambitious climate goals and the directive in Executive Order 14057 for agencies to use their properties for the development of new clean electricity generation.

346,346.0,346.0,Different faces but all suffering intimate partner violence,https://news.va.gov/126929/different-suffering-intimate-partner-violence/,"A preacher’s wife. A young mother. A soldier. These brave individuals joined a survivors’ panel to share their experiences and recovery stories during a Domestic Violence Awareness and Intimate Partner Violence Awareness summit sponsored by the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks.

According to recent studies, one-in-three women and one-in-four men in the general population report experiencing intimate partner violence. In addition, one in five women who experience intimate partner violence threaten, attempt or die by suicide. Related studies suggest Veterans of both sexes are up to twice as likely as non-Veterans to report experiencing intimate partner violence during their lifetimes.

“There were times I just wanted to give up and didn’t care anymore because I was so ashamed. I had guilt and felt so broken and betrayed by ones I loved,” said Tiffany, who was a victim of Military Sexual Trauma (MST) and intimate partner violence while serving in the military. “But I learned from my VA counselors not to judge myself by what someone else did to me. Trauma may happen to you, but it can never define you.”

“Relationships are at the core of everything.”

These distressing facts are why the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks and VA’s Suicide Prevention Office recently collaborated with several community partners on an initiative to educate and support both the survivors and perpetrators of this type of trauma.

“Relationships are at the core of everything,” said Andrea Predl, Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program coordinator. “Intimate partner violence can be different for different people. It can be verbal or psychological aggression, physical or sexual violence. It can also involve excessive control, coercion or stalking between former or current intimate partners.”

Pictured above, Predl (left) led a survivors’ panel sharing experiences and recovery stories during the Domestic Violence Awareness and Intimate Partner Violence Awareness summit.

Every VAMC has an Intimate Partner Violence Assistance program or coordinator

During Domestic Violence Awareness and Intimate Partner Violence Awareness Month, the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks held resource fairs, a White Ribbon commitment event and a summit in Fort Smith to bring awareness, education and resources to Veterans, family members and friends. During the summit, Mental health experts, community partners and survivors discussed warning signs, how to get help, available resources and recovery stories.

While intimate partner violence does not always lead to a mental health or substance use, studies have shown that those who experience it and other traumatic events are more likely to develop anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress, misuse substances and have thoughts of suicide.

“Every VA medical center has an Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program or coordinator who ensures that resources and services are available for Veterans and their partners who are impacted by IPV,” Predl said. “Many VA clinicians and staff have received specialized training related to IPV services and interventions, and are responsive and sensitive to Veteran-specific experiences that can negatively affect relationships.”

Finding support, tools and specialty care

A military combat engineer for 14 years, Tiffany contacted VA for health care and found the support, tools and specialty care she needed.

“VA care has drastically changed my life for the better. With programs like this and people on the other side helping you, I felt there was hope for me. For my fellow Veterans, I encourage you to be open-minded and want to change and heal. I am grateful and blessed because of VA. I am a survivor.”

If you are dealing with MST or intimate partner violence, talk to a VA social worker or health care provider, or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233 (SAFE) or TTY 1−800−787−3224.

347,347.0,347.0,Video: CPR training for caregivers,https://news.va.gov/126527/video-cpr-training-for-caregivers/,"The VA Caregiver Support Program (CSP) is on a mission to empower caregivers, equipping them with essential lifesaving skills in the form of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

In collaboration with the American Red Cross, CSP launched a Hands-Only CPR training video for caregivers, available on CSP’s national website.

“The Caregiver Support Program remains steadfast in preparing Veterans’ caregivers with CPR skills to act swiftly and effectively in the critical moments following a cardiac arrest,” said Colleen M. Richardson, executive director of CSP. “According to the American Heart Association, being trained to perform CPR can mean the difference between life and death, increasing the survival rate from around 10% to 40% or higher.”

To develop a network of caregivers who can respond effectively when every second counts, CSP is also collaborating with the Simulation Learning, Evaluation, Assessment and Research Network to train CSP staff in the American Heart Association’s Friends and Family CPR model. The pilot phase for this initiative is currently underway at four sites, with the overarching goal of nationwide implementation.

Why CPR training is important

The significance of CPR training cannot be overstated. The 2023 heart disease and stroke statistics show that among the over 356,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred, about 75% to 80% happened at home. When someone goes into cardiac arrest, every second counts. Caregivers trained in CPR can respond quickly and competently, increasing the chance of survival.

Learning CPR empowers us to take immediate action when a loved one’s life hangs in the balance. Proper training allows caregivers to administer those first critical breaths and chest compressions that can make all the difference.

Whether you prefer mastering life-saving CPR techniques through our comprehensive training video or find in-person sessions more effective, we have you covered. Contact your local CSP team to inquire about dates and times for our in-person CPR training sessions. Your journey to acquiring crucial life-saving skills starts here.

About CSP

CSP promotes the health and well-being of Veterans’ caregivers through education, resources, support and services. Every VA facility has a CSP team that provides valuable information about resources to help caregivers stay informed and supported as they support Veterans. More information can be found on CSP’s website and by contacting local CSP teams. To learn more, watch CSP’s SITREP podcast.",
348,348.0,348.0,"VA proposes fee process changes that would allow Veterans, their attorneys, claims representatives to receive fees or benefits faster",https://news.va.gov/127407/va-proposes-fee-process-changes-that-would-allow-veterans-their-attorneys-claims-representatives-to-receive-fees-or-benefits-faster/,"Today, VA proposed updating its fee process in the Federal Register on proposed changes that would allow Veterans, attorneys and claims representatives to more quickly receive their earned fees or benefits.

Veterans and the public have 60 days from today to submit comments on the proposed rule. VA will consider and address the comments in a subsequent final rule that may make these proposed changes final.

Congress authorizes VA to review whether a fee charged to a Veteran or survivor by an attorney or claims representative in a VA benefits case is reasonable. This proposal would ensure the timely resolution of fee disputes by establishing default rules for fee allocation in cases where fees may be payable to two or more representatives or to a representative whose assistance ended before VA granted the claim.

If no one disputes the default allocation, VA will release the fee per the default allocation. If someone disagrees with the default allocation, VA’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) would review the matter and decide on a reasonable fee. OGC’s decision remains appealable to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.

Nevertheless, all a Veteran would need to do to obtain an OGC determination on a reasonable fee is to file a request electronically or by mail with OGC. Visit the Federal Register to read the proposed regulation.",
349,349.0,349.0,FEMA Offers Workshop to Counteract the Effects of Climate Change,https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20231221/fema-offers-workshop-counteract-effects-climate-change,"Guaynabo, Puerto Rico – Landslides and coastal erosion were two of the most frequent impacts suffered by Puerto Rico's municipalities because of Hurricane María in 2017. These and other threats may worsen and increase as the effects of climate change continue to intensify across the Island.

To address this challenge, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), through its Community Assistance - Recovery Support Function (CA-RSF) unit, organized a workshop to advise municipal staff on new tools and strategies that can increase the resilience of their recovery projects by considering climate change variables in their jurisdictions. Emergency planners and managers, among other local officials from the municipalities of Bayamón, Cataño, Ciales, Dorado, Florida, Guaynabo, Manatí, Morovis, Orocovis, San Juan, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Vega Alta and Vega Baja participated in the event.

“Puerto Rico's recovery encompasses many complex and far-reaching issues. Being well educated about climate change will ensure that we are all informed and take timely action to prevent or reverse damage to the extent possible,” said FEMA Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator José G. Baquero.

The workshop brought together experts from the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez Campus (UPRM) Geology Department, the Caribbean Coastal Ocean Observing System (CARICOOS) office, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Adaptation Partnerships Program (CAP). Staff from FEMA's Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation programs provided information on opportunities available to fund projects that address current challenges.

Held in early December, this workshop is one of several that the federal agency organizes as part of the CA-RSF's Regional Recovery Focus Workshop, a recovery planning initiative that is carried out in all areas of the Bureau of Emergency Management and Disaster Administration (NMEAD) on the island. These workshops seek to provide information, answers and possible alternatives to specific problems identified by the municipalities in the event of a disaster. The workshop that took place recently in the municipality of Dorado addressed land use planning and management strategies to address landslides, coastal erosion and other threats associated with climate change.

Topics included how to update land use plans according to climate change and nature-based mitigation measures, an aspect that FEMA works on with applicant recovery projects.

Kenneth S. Hughes, a professor in the UPRM Department of Geology and coordinator of the Storm-induced Landslide Impact Dynamics on the Environment and Society (SLIDES-PR) project, said that “while most landslides are caused by gravity, they can also be caused by rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, groundwater pressure, erosion, destabilization of hillsides as a result of deforestation, cultivation, and construction, among others.” According to Hughes, this can be dangerous when they occur in areas where there are roads and even structures and residences, because of the speed and volume with which they occur.

“Hurricane María was an event that taught us what nature is capable of because all the areas in Puerto Rico that were already facing initial landslide problems became even more complicated. After that, around 70,000 landslides were recorded island wide. This opened a path to learn and prepare for future situations that are often unavoidable,” said the geology expert.

For Hughes, the first step to establish risk mitigation measures is to identify where the vulnerable points and areas are: to know the drainage at the site, the conditions of the infrastructure, where and how the road is built and the state of its drainage system, among other aspects. Mitigation measures will depend on the nature of the site or the construction of the structure or road.

He indicated that “in order to know in real time the possibility of a landslide occurring, the SLIDES project has so far installed 17 monitoring stations throughout the island to measure soil moisture, among other parameters that could help alert about imminent landslide conditions before the event occurs.”

For her part, Patricia Chardón Maldonado, deputy director and technical director of CARICOOS, pointed out that coastal erosion was already affecting the width of our beaches before the ravages left by Hurricane María in Puerto Rico. The hurricane's intense winds and strong waves caused what little sand there was on the beaches to be lost in deep water. Chardón, who is a civil engineer and expert in coastal erosion, explained that several scientific investigations on the island estimate that about one to three miles of beach width has been lost.

“This loss on our beaches is significant because our beaches are not very wide. However, there have been some that have recovered, but others have not because of the significant loss of sand, landslides, collapse of structures near the maritime-terrestrial area and poor planning in construction,” said the expert.

As for mitigation measures, Chardon said that it will depend on the area being worked on. More natural design measures can be used, such as coral barriers, dunes and measures to rehabilitate certain beaches through sand suction, among other options presented at the workshop.

“It is important to keep the economic aspect of the project in mind, but especially to keep the social aspect in mind when implementing any risk mitigation measures,” stressed the environmental expert.

Wanda Crespo, a climate adaptation specialist with NOAA's Regional Integrated Science and Assessment Program, urged local governments to incorporate climate change adaptation and mitigation measures when updating or revising existing plans, “to avoid the investment and time needed to develop new planning initiatives and thus shorten the implementation of recommended actions.” He indicated that it is better to plan “so as not to have to react later”.

At the conclusion of the event, invited directors and staff from the different units shared concerns and sought possible solutions to counteract the situation in their respective regions.

Some of the recovery challenges discussed in previous workshops include recommendations on how to manage deteriorated structures and encumbrances, bank erosion management through nature-based solutions, and storm runoff.

In 2024, FEMA's CA-RSF will continue to coordinate participatory mapping exercises and related efforts with those municipalities within NMEAD's Ceiba and Caguas Emergency Operational Zones.

Six years after Hurricane María, Puerto Rico has over $31.3 billion in FEMA allocations for nearly 10,900 projects that will help spur rebuilding.

Cash. ""Modern EPA-certified wood-burning appliances burn cleaner and produce less smoke inside and outside your home, meaning your family and neighbors have cleaner air to breathe. Further, efficient wood-burning appliances burn less wood, saving you both time and money.""Older or inefficient wood heaters emit greater amounts of fine particles and other pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), black carbon, and air toxics, such as benzene. If you smell smoke in your home or consistently see smoke coming out of your chimney, that's an indication that the heater is emitting harmful air pollutants. Exposure to fine particle pollution has been linked to asthma attacks, acute bronchitis, irregular heartbeat, heart attacks, and premature death. Indoor fine-particle pollution levels can affect both your lungs and heart. This may cause breathing problems and exacerbate pre-existing lung conditions. Communities already vulnerable and overburdened are particularly susceptible to indoor wood smoke pollution.Nationwide, there are about 14 million fireplaces, 12.5 million wood stoves, and 814,000 hydronic heaters (outdoor wood boilers) in use as primary or secondary heat sources. Many of these are older wood-fueled appliances that pollute more than newer units. Use of electric heat pumps is a more energy-efficient method to both heat and cool your home. Heat pump technology has improved in recent years and can perform well even in cold climates such as New England.The federal Clean Energy Tax CreditsExit EPA’s website for Consumers covers 30 percent of the cost of heat pumps, capped at $2,000 each year, but resets annually so it can be used for other projects.  In addition to new federal tax credits, the Inflation Reduction Act includes nearly $9 billion for states and tribes for consumer home energy rebate programsExit EPA’s website, including point of sale rebates focused on low and middle income consumers.

Through these programs, communities will be able to electrify home appliances and perform energy efficient retrofits, such as installation of heat pumps.EPA encourages the use of a heat pump as the primary source of heat. If there is a need for back up heating and you use a wood stove, EPA recommends using an EPA-certified woodstove. To upgrade an old wood stove, see the EPA-certified wood heaters listed at EPA's Burn Wise website. This database also contains information on pellet stoves that are typically the cleanest burning EPA-certified wood heaters and on hydronic heaters, which are generally much less efficient than EPA-certified wood stoves and may produce excessive amounts of smoke that can negatively impact local air quality in your community.Here are some tips from EPA for a healthier heating season:Outdoor fire pits and fireplaces are also popular during the fall and winter. While these fires are a source for cooking, warmth, and recreation, be aware that these are sources of air pollution that can affect the health of your family, neighbors, and community. Please check your local air quality at airnow.gov for steps to take to protect your health during air quality alert days.In addition to replacing older wood stoves with EPA-certified models or alternative heat sources such as heat pumps, EPA encourages the use of energy-efficiency incentives whenever possible. Funding assistance or rebates that support renewable energy and energy efficiency in New England, and across the country, can be found in the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & EfficiencyExit EPA’s website website.For more information visit EPA's Burn Wise website. ",

Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 491,100 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 37,800 criminal arrests, with more than 34,300 felony charges. In the fight against the fentanyl crisis, Texas law enforcement has seized over 450 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.

Texas has also bused:

Over 12,500 migrants to Washington, D.C. since April 2022

Over 31,200 migrants to New York City since August 2022

Over 25,300 migrants to Chicago since August 2022

Over 3,400 migrants to Philadelphia since November 2022

Over 11,800 migrants to Denver since May 18

Over 1,200 migrants to Los Angeles since June 14

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps created by the Biden Administration’s refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden’s open border policies.

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:

Governor Abbott Signs Historic Border Security Measures In Brownsville

On Monday, in front of the Texas border wall in Brownsville, Governor Abbott signed into law a transformative package of border security legislation passed during Special Session #3 and Special Session #4 of the 88th Texas Legislature.

""President Biden’s deliberate inaction has left Texas to fend for itself. Today, I will sign three laws to better protect Texas—and America—from President Biden’s border neglect,"" said Governor Abbott. ""These laws will help stop the tidal wave of illegal entry into Texas, add additional funding to build more border wall, and crackdown on human smuggling.""

WATCH: Texas Expands Migrant Border Strategy To Include Flights To Chicago

On Wednesday, Governor Abbott shared a video on social media announcing the expansion of Texas' border transportation operations to include flights to Chicago. Texas' first migrant flight departed El Paso on Tuesday, December 19 and arrived in Chicago that evening with over 120 migrants.

In April 2022, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to begin the voluntary transportation of migrants to sanctuary cities.

Governor Abbott: Texas Will Hold Biden Administration Accountable On Border

Earlier this week, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the Biden Administration to stop cutting Texas' razor wire, granting Texas’ injunction pending appeal.

Texas will continue to hold President Biden and Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas accountable until they do their jobs to secure the border.

WATCH: Lt. Olivarez Talks Biden's 'Extreme' Open Border Policies

DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez joined Neil Cavuto on Fox News this week where he responded to comments by the Biden Administration criticizing new measures signed into law by Governor Abbott that will enhance Texas' border security efforts.

""The only thing extreme right now are the failed border policies that continue to encourage illegal immigration between ports of entry, [putting] the lives of illegal immigrants in danger by crossing a dangerous river with children and also placing their lives in the hands of smugglers,"" said Lt. Olivarez. ""Right now, the federal government has no solution to this current situation. They refuse to acknowledge that there's a crisis at the border, and [Texas] is having to step in and take on that responsibility by taking historic action.""

WATCH: Lt. Olivarez Details New Border Surge In Eagle Pass

DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez spoke with Lawrence Jones on Fox & Friends to detail the harrowing effects of President Biden's open border policies, using this week's mass migrant surge in Eagle Pass as a recent example.

“""We haven't see this type of flow [of illegal immigration] since we had the Haitian situation back in 2021 in Del Rio,"" said Lt. Olivarez. ""This is not your ordinary border situation. We've moved beyond chaos—this situation has gotten much worse. This is deliberate inaction by the federal government to secure our border.""

WATCH: DPS Troopers Arrest Human Smuggler From Guatemala In Uvalde County

On December 15, DPS troopers stopped a Cadillac Escalade in Uvalde County and discovered seven illegal immigrants being smuggled inside the SUV. The driver, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, was arrested and charged for smuggling of persons. The seven illegal immigrants, two from Guatemala and five from Mexico, were referred to Border Patrol.

WATCH: Lt. Olivarez Highlights Texas' Efforts To Combat Ruthless Mexican Cartels

On Fox News this week, Lt. Olivarez described the dangerous reality of Mexican cartels operating on the Texas-Mexico border. Lt. Olivarez highlighted Texas' recent success to secure Fronton Island in the Rio Grande River to gain operational control and prevent cross-border criminal activity from Mexican cartels.

""In October, there was a piece of land in South Texas—a 170 acre piece of land—that was designated the most dangerous area along the southwest border,"" said Lt. Olivarez. ""We were constantly seeing cartel fire between rival cartels and the Mexican military, and we were finding explosives and cartel members who were actually on that island in the United States heavily armed with tactical gear, long rifles, and explosives. We took that piece of land over thanks to the leadership of Governor Abbott and [Texas General Land Office] Commissioner Dawn Buckingham who gave us complete access of that island.""

WATCH: Texas National Guard Installs Barriers To Stem Eagle Pass Surge

On Monday, the Texas National Guard began installing anti-climb barriers in the Eagle Pass region to deter and repel the recent mass migration encouraged to enter illegally because of President Biden’s open border policies. Cpl. Aaron Barrow, an engineer on Operation Lone Star, describes his experience installing barriers to stop the flow of illegal immigrants coming across the border.

""Today, we're starting to put [anti-climb barriers] up, and then a bunch of [migrants] were coming up behind us, so we did our best to prevent them from coming up,"" said Cpl. Aaron Barrow. ""I've been in three different [areas of operation], and by far this one has been the busiest.""",

Robert Phillip Marsh, 51, for theft in 1990 (Midland County). Marsh was sentenced to 2 years of deferred adjudication probation.

Heather Christine Sherman, 33, for possession of marijuana in 2010 (Collin County). Sherman was sentenced to three days of jail.

Jerry Lynn Smith, 64, for theft in 1978 (Harris County). Smith was sentenced to pay a $500 fine.



“Having served as a trial court judge, Texas Supreme Court Justice, and Attorney General, I have the utmost respect for our legal system and the unique gubernatorial power to grant clemency to Texans looking for a fresh start,” said Governor Abbott. “These three Texans have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to reshape their lives and serve their communities. I thank the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their work to improve our criminal justice system and reduce recidivism in Texas.”

Smith’s effort to circumvent the standard appellate process is extraordinarily unusual. To elevate the petition to SCOTUS before a lower court has considered the issue, the petitioner must show a clear public need for immediate action. Smith, representing the United States government, has not demonstrated the urgency he claims justifies this attempt to bypass the ordinary appellate process.

The brief explains: “The United States’ petition repeatedly proclaims—but never explains why—‘[i]t is of imperative public importance that respondent’s claims of immunity be resolved by this Court and that respondent’s trial proceed as promptly as possible if his claim of immunity is rejected.’ That silence is both telling and troubling, suggesting that the United States’ demand for extraordinary and immediate relief is driven by partisan interests, not the public interest.”

359,359.0,359.0,DPS Reminds Everyone to Make Safety a Priority this Holiday Season,https://www.dps.texas.gov/news/dps-reminds-everyone-make-safety-priority-holiday-season,"AUSTIN – The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) encourages everyone to put safety at the top of their list this holiday season. The Texas Highway Patrol (THP) will conduct its annual Christmas and New Year’s holiday traffic enforcement campaign beginning Dec. 22 and running through the rest of the year. Troopers will be out on the roads looking for people who are speeding, not wearing their seat belts, driving while intoxicated or committing other traffic violations.

“The holidays can be a dangerous time with so many people traveling to and from celebrations,” said DPS Director Steven McCraw. “It’s absolutely critical that drivers pay attention, stay at safe speeds, put their phones down and do not drink and drive. Let’s all do our part to close out the year on a happy and safe note.”

THP will increase enforcement as part Operation CARE (Crash Awareness and Reduction Effort), which runs nationwide from Dec. 22 through Jan. 1. During DPS’ 2022 Christmas and New Year’s enforcement efforts, there were more than 108,400 citations and warnings issued. This included over 9,000 speeding citations; 950 seat belt and child seat violations; 2,303 citations for driving without insurance; 731 felony and fugitive arrests; and 452 citations/warnings for Move Over, Slow Down violations.

DPS offers the following safety tips for the upcoming holiday season:

Don’t drink and drive . Make alternate plans if you are consuming alcohol.

Move Over or Slow Down for police, fire, EMS, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) vehicles and tow trucks stopped on the side of the road with emergency lights activated. Show the same courtesy to fellow drivers who are stopped on the side of the road.

Buckle up everyone in the vehicle — it’s the law.

Slow down , especially in bad weather, heavy traffic, unfamiliar areas or construction zones.

Eliminate distractions while driving, including the use of mobile devices. Texas law prohibits the use of portable wireless devices to read, write or send an electronic message unless the vehicle is stopped.

If you’re using a navigation device or app, have a passenger operate it , so you can keep your eyes on the road.

Keep the Texas Roadside Assistance number stored in your phone. Dial 1-800-525-5555 for any type of assistance. The number can also be found on the back of a Texas Driver License.

Drive defensively , as holiday travel can present additional challenges.

Don’t drive fatigued — allow plenty of time to reach your destination.

On multi-lane roads, use the left lane for passing only . Not only is it courteous and avoids impeding traffic, Texas law requires slower traffic to keep to the right and to use the left lane for passing only (when posted).

Don’t cut in front of large trucks and try not to brake quickly in front of them. They can’t maneuver as easily as passenger vehicles and pickup trucks.

If you can Steer It, Clear It : If you are involved in a non-injury crash and your vehicle can be moved, clear the traffic lanes to minimize traffic impact. Leaving vehicles in a traffic lane increases traffic congestion and leaves those involved with an increased risk of harm or a secondary wreck. On some highways, if you don’t move your vehicle when it’s safe to do so, it’s against the law.

Check your vehicle to make sure it’s properly maintained and always ensure your cargo is secure.

Report road hazards or anything suspicious to the nearest law enforcement agency.

Monitor weather and road conditions wherever you are traveling. For road conditions and closures in Texas, visit Drive Texas .

Additionally, DPS would like to remind Texans to report suspicious activity. The iWatchTexas program is a critical resource for this type of reporting in communities in order to help prevent dangerous attacks. Everyone is urged to download the free iOS or Android mobile app if you haven’t done so already. Tips can be reported via the website, the mobile app or by calling 844-643-2251. All reports are confidential. For information on how to use iWatchTexas, you can view this how-to video.

Remember, iWatchTexas is not for emergencies. If there is an emergency, call 911 immediately.

As you travel, the department also asks travelers to be on the lookout for possible human trafficking. An increase in people on the road and at airports means there is an increased opportunity for the community to spot potential human trafficking activities, report it to law enforcement and potentially save lives. If you are traveling, be observant of others around you and take note of the following possible indicators of human trafficking:

The person appears to be under control of another person either physically (someone else controls the person’s possessions i.e., ID, money, phone) or psychologically (little to no eye contact, unable to speak for themselves or unable to make simple decisions without approval).

The person has little to no awareness of their surroundings including where they are or where they are headed.

The person has untreated illness or infection, visible injuries, appears malnourished or sleep deprived.

The person’s clothing is inappropriate for the weather or environment. The person is dressed in a manner that does not appear age appropriate or makes them appear older.

The person is being transported to and from work by their employer.

The person lives where they work or works excessively long or unusual hours.

The person’s workplace has security measures that are unusual or excessive for the type of business (i.e., boarded or opaque windows, excessive security cameras).

The presence of an indicator does not confirm an occurrence of human trafficking; however, the combination and context of indicators may indicate human trafficking pending law enforcement investigation and you are encouraged to report it.

If you see signs of Human Trafficking while traveling for the holidays, call 911 immediately to report it and be ready to give as many details as possible. You can also make a report on iWatchTexas or call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or text “BeFree” to 233733.

Remember do not endanger yourself or others by intervening or confronting someone you suspect of engaging in human trafficking if it is not safe to do so.

360,360.0,360.0,How to Maximize Texas' Relationship with our No. 1 Trade Partner,https://www.txbiz.org/post/how-to-maximize-texas-relationship-with-our-no-1-trade-partner,"The global economy is a complex, dynamic and interconnected space, and if a nation or state wants to ensure a robust economy, the importance of healthy trade partnerships cannot be overstated. At the Texas Association of Business’ 2023 Policy Conference, a primary focus of discussion was the immense value Texas’ current trade partnership with Mexico holds.

Gerry Schwebel, the Executive Vice President of the International Bank of Commerce, shared insights on the unprecedented growth that has been occurring recently throughout the Lone Star State, particularly in Central Texas. His perspective highlighted the strategic significance of the I-35 corridor, stretching from Texas into Mexico, as a thriving trade bloc. He also emphasized the need to analyze the substantial investments pouring into the region and continue to utilize and expand the opportunities they offer.

“With that (growth) comes jobs, it comes tier one, tier two, tier three suppliers,” Schwebel said. “It just creates an environment that is enviable, and we have it. So, as we move forward as a State Chamber, I would like to make sure that every part of the state, particularly rural Texas, gets the opportunity to participate.”













Texas shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to attracting new businesses and experiencing diverse industry growth. Rolando Pablos, the former Texas Secretary of State, stressed the necessity of preparing for this surge through strategic investments and fortifying trade routes.

""We expect a tsunami of more business to come, and we have to get ready to get ready for that through infrastructure and a business-friendly climate and through trade routes,” he said. “You know, bilateral or state and Mexico level relationships.""

In the broader context, the significance of Texas and Mexico as trade partners cannot be overblown. The economic development fostered by this collaboration not only supercharges prosperity and security but also creates an environment of unparalleled potential. The partnership with Mexico is also a linchpin in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and has resulted in innumerable benefits for Texas, highlighting the interdependence and mutual success that such alliances can yield.

However, recent challenges, such as the temporary suspension of international rail crossings at Eagle Pass and El Paso, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of these connections. The closures, affecting a substantial portion of cross-border rail traffic, underline the urgent need to reopen these routes to safeguard commerce and prevent further damage to the economy.",
361,361.0,361.0,A Bright Future for Semiconductors in Texas,https://www.txbiz.org/post/a-bright-future-for-semiconductors-in-texas,"In Texas, the growing semiconductor industry exists as a display of our state’s economic strength, technological innovation and commitment to national security. The Texas Association of Business’ 2023 Policy Conference brought to light the profound importance of continuing to bolster this industry, with key insights from influential speakers emphasizing the critical role semiconductors play in shaping Texas’ future.

Adriana Cruz, the Executive Director of Texas Economic Development & Tourism, affirmed the significance of the semiconductor industry, stating, ""Texas is truly the birthplace of the integrated circuit, and the semiconductor industry for our state is incredibly important… there are 15 semiconductor manufacturers in the state right now… 43,000 Texans are employed by the semiconductor industry.”













It is evident that this industry is a catalyst for job creation and overall economic prosperity. Strengthening this sector promises to further boost employment opportunities as Texas’ population continues to grow, which would lead to an even more successful economy.

Although our state is traditionally associated with industries such as oil and gas, investing in developing sectors, specifically semiconductors, would make Texas more resilient to economic fluctuations and global market shifts. Recent disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain as seen during the pandemic underscore the importance of strengthening Texas' semiconductor industry to ensure a resilient and robust supply chain, reducing dependency on foreign sources.













The speakers also underlined the national security implications intertwined with the semiconductor industry. This industry plays a pivotal role in various national defense systems, communication networks and critical infrastructure, further emphasizing the need for a reliable domestic supply. With an environment already primed for an increase in semiconductor manufacturing, Texas has an opportunity to take the stage as a national and global leader in an industry that is fully integrated and essential to citizens’ daily lives.",

“This is a short-sighted, half-baked decision that will not make a dent in illegal migration but will cause economic harm to everyday Americans. On behalf of the business community, TAB urges CBP to reopen railway crossing operations at El Paso and Eagle Pass to resume the flow of legal, everyday goods to American citizens.”





TAB sent a letter to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the Texas delegation, recognizing the importance of a secure border and underscoring the economic case for resuming rail operations.





﻿ Eagle Pass and El Paso are the No. 2 and No. 3 rail gateways, moving roughly 450,000 rail shipments annually. Nearly 10,000 railcars in Mexico and the U.S. are being held from one day's closure alone. Eagle Pass and El Paso account for a total of $33.95 billion or 35.8% of all cross-border rail traffic to/from Mexico in the most recent 12 months of available US DOT transborder data. A wide diversity of industries such as food/beverage, finished vehicles and auto parts, agriculture, grain, consumer goods, and other industrial products will be heavily impacted.

TAB is the Texas State Chamber, representing companies of every size and industry. The Association's purpose is to champion the best business climate in the world, unleashing the power of free enterprise to enhance lives for generations. Follow TAB on Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn .

363,363.0,363.0,Governor Hochul Announces Guidance to Manage Climate Risk for New York State-Regulated Banking and Mortgage Institutions,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-guidance-manage-climate-risk-new-york-state-regulated-banking-and,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted guidance for New York State-regulated banking and mortgage institutions to help them manage their material financial and operational risks associated with climate change.

“Climate change is impacting every sector of New York's economy, including financial services,” Governor Hochul said. “As the financial capital of the world, I'm proud that we are proactively addressing climate-related financial risks so that New Yorkers can continue to have access to affordable financial services.”

DFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris said, “To protect New Yorkers from financial harm, regulated institutions must anticipate and respond to new and emerging risks. Today’s guidance provides these institutions with a balanced, data-driven approach to preserve safety and soundness and operational resiliency by addressing the risks posed by climate change.”

The guidance is designed to support Institutions’ efforts to identify, measure, monitor, and control their material climate-related financial and operational risks in a manner consistent with current risk management principles. It addresses key components of prudent risk management by Institutions — including corporate governance, internal control frameworks, risk management processes and data collection and analysis — so that Institutions will incorporate assessment of these risks into their existing risk frameworks, taking a strategic and forward-looking approach.

DFS has finalized the guidance with careful consideration of the valuable feedback received from regulated entities and other key stakeholders. In response to feedback, as part of today’s announcement, the Department has also published available resources to assist smaller organizations as they work to adopt measures that address their climate-related risk.

On January 11, 2024, at 11:30 a.m. EST, DFS will be hosting a webinar to provide an overview of the guidance.

Statistics from the FBI's National Crime Information Center show that of the more than 271,000 missing women and girls reported in 2022, 43 percent were Black, Indigenous or people of color. This task force, which was funded through an appropriation included in the FY24 Enacted Budget, will consider policy changes to address this crisis.

“Public safety is my top priority, and I'm committed to doing everything in my power to protect all New Yorkers,"" Governor Hochul said. ""The statistics are alarming: thousands of women and girls who are Black, Indigenous or people of color go missing every year. We have a moral obligation to treat these cases with the care and seriousness they deserve, and this new Task Force will be a critical part of that effort.""

The Missing BIPOC Women and Girls Task Force will work to assess the epidemic of missing women and girls, address discrepancies in the care with which these cases are treated and develop policies to increase community education. The Task Force will have nine members, including representatives of the Office of Family and Children's Services, the Division of Criminal Justice Services, the New York State Police and members appointed by the Senate and Assembly. Hearings will be required, and the Task Force must submit a report of its findings and recommendations within two years.

State Senator Lea Webb said, “A staggering number of BIPOC Women and Girls go missing each year across the US and here in New York State the numbers keep rising. This legislation will establish a task force to address this gap in care and concern for BIPOC victims of abduction and human trafficking. This taskforce will focus on educating communities to prevent disappearances, identify the major hubs across New York where abductions occur, and implement other equitable policies and practices on this important issue. I thank my Assembly partner, Assemblywoman Karines Reyes for her efforts to pass this critical bill and our community advocates. By signing our BIPOC Task Force legislation, Governor Hochul is helping to take important steps toward a safer New York for all women and girls, addressing the epidemic of BIPOC missing and murdered women and girls.”

Assemblymember Karines Reyes said, “I applaud Governor Hochul for her leadership and courage in signing this bill into law today. Women and girls of color face a systemic disregard of their cases when they go missing, from law enforcement’s delayed response in addressing these cases and the media’s disinterest in promoting the fact that they are missing. This new law will establish a task force to fully understand the gaps that exist in our state’s response in these cases, allow us to understand best practices and ensure that more of these cases are resolved. If followed through, we can return more women and girls of color to their families and provide them with closure. I am thankful for the partnership of Senator Webb on getting this bill passed into law, former Senator Alessandra Biaggi for first entrusting me with this bill in the Assembly in 2021, and most importantly for the advocacy of Dawn Rowe and Girl Vow for highlighting this critically important issue. Together, we will bring back our girls.”

Girl Vow, Inc., President & CEO, Dawn Rowe said, “Today is a historic moment for BIPOC women and girls whose stories and lives have been pushed into the shadows. You are no longer silent. We speak for you with urgency to push past disparities and gendered racism until you find safety. This legislation to establish a task force on missing women and girls who are Black, Indigenous, and people of color seeks to remedy the structural harms we have faced for far too long. From this day forward, we work to shatter the barriers until you have visibility.”",

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Good morning. What a wonderful, spectacular day this is. I know everybody looks really serious, but this is a great day. First of all, to our Acting Superintendent Chiumento, I want to thank you for accepting the role of leadership at a time when your skills and your talent and your experience are so desperately needed.

Very proud to be joined by New York's own Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado. Let's give him a round of applause.

Trooper Fryer, that was one of the most beautiful renditions of the National Anthem I've ever heard, so thank you for sharing that. And also, I do want to also recognize the class representative, Kevin Knightes, for obviously demonstrating leadership, the first among first, and I want to thank him for already displaying the kind of leadership we expect to see as his career unfolds.

Major Anthony Oliver, Director of Training. This is your first training class, sir? Yes? I think you did very well, don't you? Let's give him a round of applause.

And those who remind us of the presence of God in our lives, who we call on in our time of need, in our time of gratitude, and that's Pastor Traynham and Rabbi Heschel. I thank both of them for bringing the spiritual presence to us as well. Also, I want to recognize members of the State Legislature who've joined us today, many in spirit, but also those who are present here today, if they could stand up and take a bow to our, we recognize our members of the Assembly and the Senate who are here today.

Thank you. Thank you.

Before we get into the joyous occasion of this, it's also hard when I, as Governor, get the phone call, and the phone call that I received, not once, but twice in the last ten days or so, was the loss of two of our State Police officers, both who succumb to illnesses that they incurred when they were helping find lives, save people in the aftermath of 9/11.

And to their families that have watched the sadness of seeing this hero not taken away on that day like thousands, but also similarly losing their life in the pursuit of helping fellow Americans, I want to recognize them as well here today. So let's keep them in our prayers always.

And remember, as you celebrate this graduation, you stand on their shoulders. And the shoulders of thousands who came before you, who were brave and courageous, who sat in these very seats at one time. On that first day, not quite sure what would unfold in their lives, but they still showed up.

And you are the 213th class. Think about that. All the classes that went before you and your role as you think about your place in history and the history of this elite institution. This is what I hope you are having, calling to mind today.

And I also want to acknowledge the pride of all the people watching. The moms and dads, the partners, husbands, wives, sometimes children, brothers and sisters – you sacrificed a lot and you have that sense of anxiety. Is my loved one going into harm's way in this profession?

But as the Governor, I want to thank all of you for, at some point, influencing the people sitting before us, whether it's conversations at the dinner table, whether it's people who came before and wore the uniform. Whatever the influences were, you taught them to be good Americans, to be great New Yorkers, and also so selfless that they would become one of the elite few who put on a uniform go through the trials and tribulations and the sacrifice and the time away from families to be here today. So, let's all give a round of applause and I'm going to tell all of the recruits here and our new troopers to give your families a round of applause as well. So, let's recognize them. You're allowed to do that.

I think about the fact that 4,400 people applied for these positions. If you do the math, 1,000 were processed, but only 232 were selected. That's less than one percent. That is one of the many reasons you are in a very elite class of individuals, and don't forget that. You were called to this, but your experience and your dedication and your passion for service to others is why you are sitting here today.

And I also know that there's individuals who have inspired their own family members. In 2003, Kenneth Kellenbenz graduated from this very academy. He went on to serve with great courage and admiration from his colleagues for over 20 years. But somewhere along the way, his work, his passion, caught the attention of his children. And today, two of his sons, Daniel and Andrew, will graduate today as troopers, joining not just his father's work, but also the family of the state police. And I want to thank them as well for continuing that legacy of service to others.

Also, many of you have answered the call to service to our nation. Over 20 served in wars – Afghanistan, Iraq. 46 of you actually served in other police forces. I spent 14 years in local government. I was responsible for hiring police officers and our chief of police. I knew what I was looking for. So many of you have already served in your local communities and now you have a chance to serve them at even higher level.

But I want to talk today about my expectations on all of you as your Governor. I want to make sure that you never stop treating your fellow New Yorkers as human beings, people in need. They're going to call upon you in a way that you'll never even be able to think about today. Because some night you're driving on a dark road, and you see a vehicle off to the side with the flashers on. It's dark, it's scary, you don't know what you're entering into. Someone who could do you harm, or is it someone in need? But in that car could be a young mom, who ran into car trouble and has children crying in the back seat. When they roll down the window and see your face, and all of a sudden, they know they're going to be okay.

Extend that love and compassion to them. All of you have that within you. You don't check that at the door when you put on a uniform to serve a community. You keep that. You kindle that. Don't ever be disillusioned because you are the ones that are bringing hope to someone in need. And we saw that on display so many times this year.

Just since I spoke to the last graduating class in June. Our State Police responded and helped capture the Gilgo Beach murderer who traumatized the community for over a decade. People unsure whether they should let their children go out and play. Our State Police helped bring that person to justice.

Not long after, a bus full of students from Farmingdale High School, careened down a ravine, 50 feet down with students, a band heading off to Pennsylvania. Our State Police were there, and you can imagine putting themselves in danger, their own lives, as they had to go down that steep ravine and approach a bus that could have blown up in any second. My State Police, our State Police did that.

I think about a little girl, a nine-year-old that was kidnapped not far from here. Our State Police responded, and they were there. So, you never know the face of someone who's going to need you. But they're all over our State.

And I know that you've been through the rigors of the academy. You've had to learn so much. Learn all about the penal code. More than I learned in law school about all the rules. I know the grueling morning exercises, the PT. I'm with State Police every day of the week and I ask them about this, and I know how hard it was. But more than that was the separation from your family for all those months.

And to describe how on a Friday would roll around, it was like a birthday celebration, all excitement, because you're going home to your family. And on Sunday, that natural reluctance to kiss your loved ones and say goodbye but knowing that it was temporary. But this was an investment of time and your energy, and today it pays off.

It is true we are trying to bring more to the ranks, because this is a proud institution. I want to see more diversity, I want to see more women, but all of you are part of that journey to help us get there. By your example in your community, when people see what you are doing, you can be the inspiration to others who want to be in that same uniform someday. So, I'm calling on all of you to be ambassadors – wear that uniform proudly, go to other events in the community, interact with people, show the compassion.

I know it's hard, my friends. I know there's a time when those in law enforcement feel they're under siege and they're not respected. And sometimes communities just make them feel unwelcome. But you also have the ability to break down those barriers, show them your humanity. Let them know you care, help people have understanding. That's powerful. If every one of you can have that impact on just one other person, and help bridge the divide between communities and law enforcement, then we're on the road to healing in this State. That's the power that you have. There's a lot of mistrust of law enforcement.

But I want to tell you right now, as your Governor, I have your back. I've invested more than any Governor in the State of New York's history – in resources, and technology, and communication systems, and helping fight guns on the streets. And I made that one of my top priorities. So, where are these guns coming from? They're coming up from Pennsylvania and going over to Syracuse, or over to Brooklyn, or the Bronx. Someone has to stop them. So, we started working closely together across the State with other states, all driven by the State Police.

So I've identified new responsibilities. Monitoring social media. When we have a white supremacist who telegraphed on social media that he was going to go to my hometown of Buffalo and slaughter ten innocent people shopping in a grocery store. That was out there on social media, so I doubled the size of our capacity watching for credible threats.

You may be in that space someday and how important that is. My job is to make sure you have the tools you need. I've increased budgets over 27 percent when others are cutting and talking about defunding police. We're not defunding police. We are refunding the police. We're making sure they have all the resources they need, and you can count on that.

And one thing I'm really proud of because of our ramped-up efforts, there are now 3,300 fewer guns in the hands of criminals in the State of New York. That is what we're focused on, because my number one job, and your number one job, is to keep New Yorkers safe, full stop. And nothing, nothing, will ever get in the way of that mission.

Because that's what the people of our State are counting on all of us to do. So at the end of your time, you're not thinking that far down the road, but it's going to come at some point. I want you to remember this day. Remember the sense of awe and expectation and excitement and pride that you felt and “I finally got there, I achieved my dream” and you did it.

But it's not about today. It's about the end of your career. What will your legacy be? What will people say about you and your contributions and perhaps the lives you saved that you may never know? And those conflicts that you resolve without violence. All of those, all of that, is what I hope that you better look on in your life.

Because those are my expectations as your governor. They're high. There’s 4,400 people who thought they could do it, and I have 230 who are sitting here today. That is extraordinary. And finally, never forget the Bible. What was said in Matthew, “blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the earth.”

Today you go forth as New York's peacemakers. That is your responsibility. You'll see things you never saw before. You'll experience things that you never imagined. But again, before you leave this planet, you must be able to say, “I made a difference. I was a peacemaker.”

Congratulations to every single one of you, to your families, to your friends. This is a great day for all of you. It's a great day for us here in the State of New York to know that all of you will be out there serving all of us. And I want to say one last thing. May God bless you and keep you safe – keep you in his hands. And may God bless the great State of New York and may God bless America.

Thank you everyone.",
369,369.0,369.0,Governor Hochul Announces $8 Million Awarded to New York State Under Inflation Reduction Act to Reduce Methane Emissions From Oil and Gas Wells,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-8-million-awarded-new-york-state-under-inflation-reduction-act,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy awarded New York State $8 million from the Methane Emissions Reduction Program. The funds, included in the Inflation Reduction Act, bolster New York's ongoing efforts to help reduce climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas infrastructure, as well as protect ground and surface waters.

“New Yorkers are feeling the impacts of climate change all across the State, and in response we are taking bold action and building a stronger, more resilient New York with the help of record State and Federal resources,” Governor Hochul said. “The Biden-Harris Administration and our federal partners are recognizing the importance of reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions through the Methane Emissions Reduction Program, and strengthening New York's commitment to confronting the existential threat of climate change head on.”

Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said, “Upstate New York, from the Southern Tier and Central New York to Western New York and the Finger Lakes, has long been plagued by orphaned oil and gas wells creating hidden hazards that pollute our backyards, drinking water sources, and worsen climate change. Now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act that I championed, New York will receive $8 million to reduce noxious methane pollution from these wells. I am proud to deliver this major federal investment to help fight climate change and ensure that municipalities do not have to take on the full financial burden to clean up the polluting remnants of the fossil fuel industry in Upstate NY.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Reducing methane emissions is vital to combating the impacts of climate change. This federal funding will help bolster New York State’s ongoing efforts to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector and protect water quality for countless New Yorkers. I am proud to see this federal funding going to create a cleaner environment for New Yorkers and will continue to fight to bring federal dollars home to combat climate change.”

U.S. Department of Energy Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management Brad Crabtree said, “New York State is a leader in the nationwide effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, states like New York can do even more to slash harmful pollution and take an important step in slowing the devastating impacts of climate change.”



U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2 Administrator Lisa F. Garcia said, “New York is leading the way in tackling climate change by reducing methane emissions from oil and gas wells. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest federal climate investment in history, this $8 million in funding demonstrates the commitment by EPA and New York State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect our essential water resources. By plugging oil and gas wells and preventing methane leaks, we are eliminating a major source of pollution and protecting the health and safety of all New Yorkers.”

The $8 million in federal funds will be used to further the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) efforts to monitor and mitigate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as the State works to plug wells with a focus on wells with individual landowners listed as operators. The funds are part of $350 million awarded to 14 states that will help measure and reduce methane emissions, one of the biggest drivers of climate change. The funding, which is made possible by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — the largest federal climate investment in history — will help New York and other states support industry efforts to cut methane emissions from active wells and support environmental restoration of well sites.

The Methane Emissions Reduction Program also provides a combination of technical and financial assistance to New York to help well owners and operators voluntarily identify and eliminate methane emissions from low-producing conventional oil and gas wells, also referred to as marginal conventional wells, with disproportionately high methane emissions.

Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “Under Governor Kathy Hochul’s leadership, and with the help of our federal partners, New York is advancing a just transition to clean energy that creates good jobs and supports a green economy for the future. Curbing methane from the oil and gas sector is critical to New York’s progress in implementing the Climate Act and reaching our emissions reduction milestones. DEC thanks President Biden, EPA Administrator Regan and Regional Administrator Garcia, and DOE Secretary Granholm for this significant $8 million investment in New York’s ongoing methane reduction initiatives.”

The federal funding announced today complements New York's many steps to reduce emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases. In 2022, Governor Hochul announced finalized regulations that require significant reductions in methane and other harmful emissions from any oil and natural gas infrastructure in New York State. The regulations marked a milestone in realizing the State's nation-leading clean energy and climate agenda by reducing methane emissions by more than 14,000 metric tons per year and volatile organic compound emissions by more than 2,000 tons per year. In addition, regulations in 2020 establish limits requiring that statewide emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases be reduced 40 percent by 2030, 85 percent by 2050, including emissions associated with imported electricity and fossil fuels.

Earlier this year, Governor Hochul announced the completion of the first gas well safely plugged with funding from a $25 million federal grant to New York State through the landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. New York State is working with landowners to plug aging and abandoned oil and natural gas wells to protect public safety, help reduce methane and other climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions.

New York State's Nation-Leading Climate Plan

New York State's nation-leading climate agenda calls for an orderly and just transition that creates family-sustaining jobs, continues to foster a green economy across all sectors and ensures that at least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities. Guided by some of the nation’s most aggressive climate and clean energy initiatives, New York is on a path to achieving a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century. A cornerstone of this transition is New York's unprecedented clean energy investments, including more than $52 billion in 118 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale up solar, nearly $3 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. These and other investments are supporting more than 165,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2021 and over 3,000 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, New York also adopted zero-emission vehicle regulations, including requiring all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in the State be zero emission by 2035. Partnerships are continuing to advance New York’s climate action with nearly 400 registered and more than 100 certified Climate Smart Communities, nearly 500 Clean Energy Communities, and the State’s largest community air monitoring initiative in 10 disadvantaged communities across the state to help target air pollution and combat climate change.",

372,372.0,372.0,Governor Hochul Signs Legislation to Protect Low-Income New Yorkers from Fraud,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-protect-low-income-new-yorkers-fraud,"Governor Kathy Hochul today signed legislation S.6088/A.4023-A to protect low-income New Yorkers from fraud by requiring stores accepting electronic benefit transfer cards to warn of skimming. Skimming occurs when a scammer installs a device at a point-of-sale terminal that skims the holders’ card data and pin number, allowing the scammer to drain the victim’s benefits. By raising awareness about skimming, this legislation will help prevent New Yorkers from falling victim to this practice and losing their SNAP benefits or cash assistance.

“From baby formula to fresh food, New Yorkers use their EBT cards to cover the cost of essential products to ensure their families are fed and healthy,” Governor Hochul said. “We are taking action to protect New Yorkers from scammers who steal money out of their pockets by making sure customers are aware of skimming and ensuring they know how to protect themselves from falling victim.”

Many New Yorkers are unaware of skimming until it’s too late. Once skimmers steal an individual’s card data and pin number, they have the ability to drain the victim’s benefits. Legislation S.6088/A.4023-A helps protect consumers by requiring businesses who accept EBT cards to place a sign at the point of sale containing a notice to make customers aware of the practice. Additionally, the legislation requires the notice to include steps customers can take to protect themselves and other resources.

State Senator John C. Liu said, “EBT skimming is a rising problem across the state that must be addressed at the point of sale to best protect low-income New Yorkers who rely on this benefit to feed their families. Thank you to Governor Hochul for signing this important legislation into law and to Assemblywoman Rozic for championing this effort in the Assembly, and for making sure all New Yorkers can be appropriately armed with the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.”

Assemblymember Nily Rozic said, “Every day, more low-income New Yorkers are at risk of having their SNAP benefits stolen with no recourse. That’s why it’s so important to raise awareness and provide consumer protections for those who rely on their EBT cards to help put food on their table. I thank Senator Liu for tirelessly advocating for this issue, and Governor Hochul for signing this important bill into law.”

New Yorkers who have had their SNAP or Public Assistance benefits stolen electronically can fill out a simple application to have them replaced. All EBT card holders, however, should remain vigilant about these scams and take several basic precautions to protect themselves, including carefully inspecting point-of-sale devices, changing their PIN regularly, and reviewing their transaction history frequently.

Anyone who has their benefits stolen should immediately contact the EBT Customer Service Helpline to report their card stolen and request a replacement EBT card. New Yorkers can contact the helpline by:

Calling 1-888-328-6399;

Visiting ConnectEBT; or

Using the ConnectEBT mobile app.

After reporting their EBT card stolen and requesting a replacement card, New Yorkers can get information on applying for replacement benefits here. Eligible recipients will receive the lesser of either the amount stolen or twice the full monthly allotment received in the month before the benefits were stolen.",

Release Date: December 21, 2023 NYSDOT Announces Start of Public Comment Period on Troy-Menands Bridge Study Comment Period Running through January 31 the Latest Step in Public Engagement Process Newly Released Project Report and Appendices Here The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) today announced the start of the public comment period for a high-level study identifying the best location for a new Troy-Menands Bridge. NYSDOT has released its Draft Project Scoping Report and Attachments 1-6, that cover items such as bridge corridor concepts, traffic and environmental background information on the Project. The Draft Scoping Report and appendices identify the project’s needs and challenges, and consider the project’s environmental, community and economic benefits. Comments will be accepted through January 31 The Purpose and Needs of the project include maintaining the connection between Menands and South Troy, rebuilding the bridge and approaches to current highway engineering standards to curtail recurring crashes along the bridge, addressing environmental justice concerns as well as improving pedestrian and bicycle facilities and connections to the Empire State Trail along the Hudson River. The structure, built in 1932/1933, carries State Route 378 over the Hudson River, connecting the Village of Menands and the Town of Colonie to the South Troy neighborhood in the City of Troy. The bridge has no load restrictions, is inspected regularly, and is considered safe, but is nearing the end of its life cycle with NYSDOT recognizing that the bridge will need to be replaced within the next decade. Community outreach and public input is paramount to this Project. The State Department of Transportation has met with public officials, state, and federal permitting agencies, presented at regional metropolitan planning meetings, hosted a neighborhood stakeholder meeting and three public meetings, with the final meeting held on October 26, 2023, when the Department presented the study findings and recommended concepts 1, 3 and 4B for further investigation and engineering in future project phases. Community members and interested stakeholders are invited to submit questions and comments via email by contacting the Project Manager, Susan Olsen at susan.olsen@dot.ny.gov.

The Office of Special Investigation (OSI) of the Attorney General’s Office released a video from a body-worn camera that a responding NYPD officer was equipped with during the incident. The release of this video follows Attorney General James’ directive that camera footage obtained by her office during an OSI investigation be released to the public in order to increase transparency and strengthen public trust in these matters.

Pursuant to New York State Executive Law Section 70-b, OSI assesses every incident reported to it where a police officer or a peace officer, including a corrections officer, may have caused the death of a person by an act or omission. Under the law, the officer may be on-duty or off-duty, and the decedent may be armed or unarmed. Also, the decedent may or may not be in custody or incarcerated. If OSI’s assessment indicates an officer may have caused the death, OSI proceeds to conduct a full investigation of the incident.

The release of this footage is not an expression of any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of any party in a criminal matter or any opinion as to how or whether any individual may be charged with a crime.

375,375.0,375.0,Attorney General James Urges Congress to Pass NCAA Accountability Act of 2023,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-urges-congress-pass-ncaa-accountability-act-2023,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today joined a bipartisan coalition of 18 attorneys general urging Congress to pass the NCAA Accountability Act of 2023. If signed into law, this legislation would ensure that the NCAA provides transparent due process in its investigations and create fairness for college athletes, coaches, and institutions.

“When powerful interests and institutions lack accountability, we know that those without power have little to no chance of standing up for their rights,” said Attorney General James. “The NCAA currently holds tremendous authority over thousands of New York college athletes, and many more throughout the nation. That is why I am proud to stand with my fellow attorneys general in urging Congress to pass the NCAA Accountability Act of 2023. I will always fight to ensure the rule of law is extended equally in New York, regardless of people’s or companies’ wealth or power.”

The NCAA uses lengthy, opaque, and arbitrary investigations, and this legislation would change that by increasing accountability and transparency. The NCAA’s current unchecked concentration of power is a problem that leaves college athletes vulnerable to mistreatment, distracts both students and universities from their educational priorities, and results in unequal treatment that can deprive athletes, coaches, and institutions of a fair process.

Given the economic powerhouse that college sports have become, such NCAA investigations can harm the level of competition in respective sports and also damage the financial well-being of higher institutions and the surrounding areas. Additionally, such investigations effectively deprive college athletes of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) opportunities, which allows college athletes the opportunity to monetize their brand.

Joining Attorney General James in sending this letter to Congress are the attorneys general of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, and the District of Columbia.

In addition to calling on Congress to pass the NCAA Accountability Act of 2023, Attorney General James has been an outspoken leader in the fight to protect college athletes. Earlier this month, Attorney General James and a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general sued the NCAA for its transfer eligibility rule, which prohibits student athletes from competing in games for a year if they transfer schools more than once. Attorney General James secured a temporary injunction, which was extended to become a preliminary injunction, against the NCAA for its transfer eligibility rule. Under the preliminary injunction, college athletes can now participate in games if they have transferred schools.",
376,376.0,376.0,"Attorney General James Secures $10,000 for Dance Company Workers for Unpaid Wages and Harmful Labor Practices",https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-secures-10000-dance-company-workers-unpaid-wages-and,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today announced that her office secured $10,000 for nine former employees of H+, a Manhattan-based dance company, for failing to pay rightfully earned wages or properly address sexual harassment claims, in violation of New York’s labor and human rights laws. An investigation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) found that H+ charged for dance classes entirely staffed and run by purported volunteers while the company’s leaders pocketed the funds. The OAG also found that the company’s founder and artistic director, Safi Thomas, perpetuated a hostile work environment.

“Far too often, the physical labor and sacrifice of artistic workers like dancers are overlooked, but every New York worker deserves to be paid what they are rightfully owed,” said Attorney General James. “H+ built a stressful work environment and took advantage of hardworking artists just to pocket the profits for themselves. New Yorkers have my word: as your Attorney General, I am committed to ensuring that no one gets away with cheating hardworking people out of their fair pay or threatening their rights.”

The OAG opened an investigation after receiving a February 2021 complaint from Safe Horizon, the nation’s leading survivor assistance organization. The OAG found that H+ consistently misclassified workers as “members” or “apprentices” instead of employees so that they would not have to pay them for their labor. Profits earned from employees’ hard work directly funded the living expenses of H+’s so-called “artistic echelon,” a group comprised of Thomas and three other members of H+’s leadership team who lived together in an apartment entirely funded by the company. The investigation also revealed that Thomas fostered a hostile work environment, frequently subjecting women employees to unequal treatment and sexual harassment. Further, H+ lacked a formal process for employees to report cases of discrimination.

Under the settlement announced today, H+ will pay $10,000 in unpaid wages to nine former employees, and Thomas will undergo individual training regarding sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment prevention, and an employer’s obligations under the law. H+ will also, among other things:

Develop anti-discrimination and anti-sexual harassment training protocols and complaint processes for employees and managers, and submit written materials to OAG regarding these trainings.

Ensure new hires complete the training protocol within 30 days of the start of their employment.

Properly classify all persons who perform work for H+ and Thomas as employees and set wages appropriate for their labor in compliance with New York wage laws.

377,377.0,377.0,"Attorney General James Secures $656,000 from Unlicensed Nursing Home Operator for Years of Fraud and Neglect",https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-secures-656000-unlicensed-nursing-home-operator-years,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James and the United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York (USAO-NDNY) Carla Freedman today announced they have secured $656,000 in a settlement with Chaim “Mutty” Scheinbaum, an unlicensed operator of the Saratoga Center for Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Care (Saratoga Center) for years of fraud and resident neglect. From 2017 to 2021, Scheinbaum operated the nursing home without a license from the state, in violation of New York law. Under his control, conditions at Saratoga Center rapidly declined. The facility lacked hot water and clean linens, and residents suffered falls, pressure sores, and other significant lapses in care. Today’s settlement follows four prior settlements as part of a resolution in February 2023 with Saratoga Center’s owners, a second unlicensed operator, and the facility’s landlord, for over $7.1 million. As part of the settlement, Scheinbaum will return $656,000 to Medicaid, with $393,600 going to New York.

“Every resident of New York’s nursing homes deserves high-quality care and proper staffing to meet their needs,” said Attorney General James. “Rather than ensure vulnerable residents got the care they deserved, this individual mismanaged Saratoga Center’s finances and failed to adequately staff the facility, causing residents to suffer the consequences of neglect and unsanitary conditions. I want to thank United States Attorney Carla Freedman and our partners in law enforcement for their assistance in bringing this unacceptable situation to light and to justice. My office will continue to ensure nursing home residents are protected, and I encourage anyone who has witnessed alarming conditions, resident neglect, or abuse at a nursing home to contact my office.”

“Nursing homes should protect the health and well-being of every resident,” said U.S. Attorney Carla Freedman for the Northern District of New York. “That did not happen at Saratoga Center. An individual with no lawful authority controlled the finances and failed to pay vendors. This unlawful arrangement resulted in false claims to Medicaid for worthless services. We will continue to hold responsible people accountable when they receive federal funds while providing substandard care. Thank you to Attorney General James and her office for collaborating on this case.”

Saratoga Center operated as a 257-bed nursing home from 2015 until it closed in 2021. In 2017, the landlord pressured the owners to relinquish control of Saratoga Center to unlicensed operators, including Scheinbaum, but did not report the change to the Department of Health (DOH).

The conditions at Saratoga Center declined under the control of the new, unlicensed operators, leading to a breakdown in the quality of care provided to residents. From when they took over in 2017 to when Saratoga Center closed in 2021, Scheinbaum and the other unlicensed operator mismanaged the nursing home’s finances and failed to adequately staff the facility, causing residents to suffer the consequences.

The investigation revealed that residents at Saratoga Center experienced excessive and unnecessary falls and injuries, including the development of pressure sores that went untreated. Under the management of Scheinbaum, Saratoga Center also failed to:

Maintain consistent and reliable hot water throughout the facility;

Properly maintain the fire alarm system;

Keep a sufficient stock of clean bed linens for residents; and

Manage trash and waste removal in a timely fashion, subjecting residents to unsanitary and unhealthy conditions.

Scheinbaum and the other operators then billed New York’s Medicaid program for services provided to the residents. However, as the investigation revealed, these were claims for worthless services, and amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars of fraudulent claims.

Under New York law, owners of nursing homes have a “special obligation” to ensure the highest possible quality of life for residents, and to staff the facility at a level sufficient to provide adequate care. Nursing home operators are also prohibited from delegating key duties to other individuals who have not been approved as operators by DOH.

In 2018, both DOH and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) fined Saratoga Center for serious deficiencies and violations, and in 2019, CMS designated Saratoga Center a “Special Focus Facility,” signifying it was among the poorest performing nursing homes in the country.

The parties to the settlement announced today are Chaim Scheinbaum, Alliance NJ Care LLC, and Alliance HC II LLC, the entities through which Scheinbaum conducted business. Under the settlements, Scheinbaum will pay $656,000 to Medicaid, of which $393,600 will go directly to New York state. The remaining $262,400 will be paid to the federal government.

Attorney General James has been investigating nursing homes throughout New York based on concerns of resident neglect and other unacceptable conduct, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, Attorney General James released a report revealing that many nursing homes were ill-equipped and ill-prepared to deal with the pandemic crisis because of poor staffing levels, which resulted in a lack of compliance with infection control protocols and increased risk to residents. In November and December 2022 and June 2023, Attorney General James filed four special proceedings against skilled nursing facilities and their owners due to findings of repeated and persistent fraud, resident neglect, and false and misleading representations to DOH. These facilities include: The Villages of Orleans Health and Rehabilitation Center in Orleans County, Fulton Commons Care Center in Nassau County, Cold Spring Hills Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Nassau County, and four Centers Healthcare facilities throughout New York state.

Attorney General James encourages anyone with information or concerns about alarming nursing home conditions, or resident abuse or neglect, to file a confidential complaint online or call the Office of the Attorney General's (OAG) Toll-Free Tip Line 1-866-697-3444, option 1.

The investigation and settlements were the result of a coordinated effort among OAG, USAO-NDNY, the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG). Attorney General James thanks USAO-NDNY, DOJ, HHS-OIG, and DOH for their partnership and assistance.

The MFCU investigation was conducted by Detective Supervisor John Benshoff under the supervision of Deputy Chief, Commanding Officer William Falk, with Principal Auditor-Investigator Cheryl Abraham and Senior Auditor-Investigator Nathaniel J. Wood, both under the supervision of Regional Chief Auditor Sarah Finning, and with assistance from Medical Analyst Stephanie Keyser, R.N.

378,378.0,378.0,Initial Findings Released From Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group On Emergency Response,https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/2023-Announcements/2023-12-21-Governor-Hochul-Announces-Results-of-Fire-Safety-Working-Group,"Available Analyses Find No Reported Injuries, No Harmful Levels of Toxins Detected at Sites of Battery Storage Fires

Governor Kathy Hochul today released initial findings from the Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group, which was convened following fires at battery energy storage systems at facilities in Jefferson, Orange and Suffolk Counties this summer. The Working Group has made significant progress in evaluating both preventive and reactive standards and practices for battery system fire safety, in addition to analyzing the impacts of the fires. Based on available analyses of air quality, soil, or water data collected in the days following the incidents, the Working Group concluded that there were no reported injuries and no harmful levels of toxins detected. Additionally, statewide battery system project assessments and fire code reviews are currently underway with draft recommendations expected to be released for public comment in the first quarter of 2024.

“New York State is grateful to the first responders who were on the scene at these fires, and we are taking this opportunity to ensure they can continue to do their jobs safely and effectively,” Governor Hochul said. “As we continue to advance New York’s clean energy transition, maintaining this safety is of the utmost importance. Thankfully, the Working Group’s analysis shows no notable lasting impacts on the health or safety of the first responders or the communities they serve.”

The Working Group includes representatives from the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) Office of Fire Prevention and Control (OFPC)New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), Department of Public Service (DPS), and the Department of State (DOS). The group was convened in August 2023 and has gathered data and worked diligently with project developers, equipment manufacturers, and government officials to learn as much as possible about the fires at the three battery system sites.

The data assembled and analyzed by the Working Group includes:

An air monitoring report from the OFPC, and soil and water sampling data received from DEC from the Chaumont site.

On-site air monitoring results collected from the Warwick sites and relayed to the Working Group by local officials.

On-site soil sampling results from the East Hampton site relayed to the Working Group by a project developer.

An independent third-party site inspection report consisting of air monitoring and surface sampling at school buildings in the vicinity of the June 27, 2023, fire at the Warwick site.

Based on the information available to date, there is no evidence of significant off-site migration of contaminants associated with the fires.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “NYSERDA remains committed to working with our state agency partners, project developers and local communities to ensure a responsible transition to a zero-emissions grid and making available the data and resources needed to facilitate that transition in a safe and responsible manner"".

New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said, “Battery energy storage sites are essential to securing our climate future. As these technologies continue to be implemented throughout the state, we will work closely with our partners to ensure they are operated safely.”

Department of Public Service CEO Rory M. Christian said, “The Department is pleased that the Working Group has made significant progress in evaluating both preventive and reactive standards and practices for battery system fire safety, in addition to analyzing the impacts of recent battery storage fires. Kudos to Governor Hochul for creating the working group. The Department will continue working to ensure safety comes first as more and more batteries come into service.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “DEC applauds Governor Hochul for prioritizing New Yorkers’ safety and taking the lead to ensure energy storage deployment projects continue to be protective of our communities and the environment. DEC experts assisted the Fire Safety Working Group by analyzing current practices, assisting in site testing, enhancing emergency response measures, and identifying improvements in operations at facilities with vital roles in building a safe and responsible clean energy future for our state. We look forward to working with our partner agencies in continuing to advance this important work.”

In addition to the air, soil, and water quality analysis described above, the Working Group has partnered with subject matter experts to inspect all operational battery systems above 300 kW in New York, which accounts for the majority of commercial battery systems in service across the state. Inspections are currently underway and are slated to be complete by the second quarter of 2024. The goal of these inspections is to revise the current evaluation checklists and best-practices available for use by NYSERDA and others prior to energizing the systems, and to incorporate lessons learned from the battery fires while enhancing emergency response measures.

Battery energy storage systems are a critical component to achieving a reliable, zero-emissions grid. New York is taking the lead in addressing the incidents head on by forming the inter-agency fire and safety working group. The conclusions and recommendations will improve the way energy storage projects are deployed in New York and across the country. New York's Working Group has drawn national attention from other states as the industry is strongly invested in improving energy storage deployment best practices on a broader scale.

The Working Group is concluding negotiations with the impacted facilities’ battery manufacturers and utility companies to secure Root Cause Analysis (RCA) reports for the Warwick, East Hampton, and Chaumont fires. Subject matter experts will review and analyze the reports once they are made available.

Additionally, the Working Group has been collaborating with national labs and other nation-leading subject matter experts to review all existing codes and testing procedures pertinent to the development and electrification of battery energy storage systems. The Working Group is actively assessing all relevant codes and standards and will make recommendations to ensure building and fire codes are adequate and appropriate. Draft recommendations will be available for public comment in the first quarter of 2024.

Following the fires, the OFPC has made a Lithium-Ion Battery Awareness training course available on the DHSES E-Learning Management System for all first responders. According to the OFPC over 2,000 participants have taken the course to date.



New York State's Nation-Leading Climate Plan

New York State's nation-leading climate agenda calls for an orderly and just transition that creates family-sustaining jobs, continues to foster a green economy across all sectors and ensures that at least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities. Guided by some of the nation’s most aggressive climate and clean energy initiatives, New York is on a path to achieving a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century. A cornerstone of this transition is New York's unprecedented clean energy investments, including more than $52 billion in 118 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale up solar, nearly $3 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. These and other investments are supporting more than 165,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2021 and over 3,000 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, New York also adopted zero-emission vehicle regulations, including requiring all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in the State be zero emission by 2035. Partnerships are continuing to advance New York’s climate action with nearly 400 registered and more than 100 certified Climate Smart Communities, nearly 500 Clean Energy Communities, and the State’s largest community air monitoring initiative in 10 disadvantaged communities across the state to help target air pollution and combat climate change.",

###​



— On Monday, Governor Wes Moore announced that the Board of Public Works unanimously approved a long-term agreement between the Maryland Stadium Authority and the Baltimore Orioles. The agreement – which keeps the Orioles at Camden Yards for the next thirty years – represents the fruition of countless hours of work from the Moore-Miller Administration and the Maryland Stadium Authority to deliver a deal that benefits all Maryland taxpayers, keeps the Orioles in Baltimore well into the future, and spurs economic growth – through a lens of diversity and inclusion – in the entire City of Baltimore.“The Orioles are a team not just in Baltimore, but of Baltimore, and I could not be more thrilled that they’ll continue to call Oriole Park at Camden Yards their home,”. “In the ballpark that forever changed baseball, the Orioles will continue to make their mark on our city, while the city shows them our love right back. I want to extend my thanks and congratulations to Governor Moore, Maryland Stadium Authority Chair Craig Thompson, John Angelos and the entire Orioles organization, and everyone involved in getting this deal across the finish line under sometimes difficult circumstances and lots of attention. I said from the beginning that if I had 99 problems, the Orioles staying in Baltimore weren’t one — and, as a lifelong fan, I knew that faith was warranted. I look forward to working with all of our partners as we embrace this next era for the Orioles in Baltimore and take the next steps to modernize Camden Yards to ensure the park and the surrounding area remains a fixture of our downtown for generations to come.”“An agreement that provides a pathway for the Orioles to remain in Baltimore for years to come is incredible news for our region,”. “The Orioles are a significant source of pride for families throughout Baltimore County and we are excited to continue celebrating this historic team. We are grateful to Governor Moore and partners with the Orioles organization who recognize the potential of our region — understanding that a vibrant Baltimore creates economic opportunities for our residents, communities, and businesses across the state.”“Keeping the Orioles in Baltimore is an incredible win for the State of Maryland,”. Thank you to Governor Moore for getting this deal done right. I look forward to seeing many more years of playoff baseball here in Baltimore.”“I applaud the partnership and leadership of everyone involved in this process – from the Maryland Stadium Authority to the Baltimore Orioles to leaders in the Moore-Miller Administration and beyond,”. “This final deal puts Marylanders first and delivers for Baltimore.”“Our Baltimore Orioles are the pride and joy of Baltimore City, our region, and our state. This agreement will help unlock the full potential of our region – giving baseball fans a renewed sense of optimism and positivity that the best is yet to come,”. “I greatly appreciate the partnership of the Moore-Miller Administration, Treasurer Davis, Comptroller Lierman, and others in securing this critical deal. I look forward to our continued progress in creating economic opportunities that benefit every resident, business, and visitor across our great state.”“Keeping the Orioles in Baltimore is about more than baseball. This deal will leave an enduring legacy on the trajectory of downtown Baltimore and the communities that benefit from its economic vitality. Baltimore was just ranked one of the fastest growing economies in the nation and this deal will play a pivotal role in accelerating that progress,”. “This is a win for the ballpark, a win for the 46th District and the city, and a win for the state. I am thrilled to see playoff baseball at the Yard for many years to come.”“The new long-term lease agreement between the Baltimore Orioles and Maryland Stadium Authority is an exciting milestone in continuing this remarkable Baltimore legacy for generations to come. The new agreement holds immense potential to fuel a transformative wave of economic growth throughout the Downtown corridor, marking a significant moment for our entire region, with Downtown Baltimore at its heart,”. “We look forward to continuing to be a reliable partner to both our major league teams and commend Governor Wes Moore, the Maryland Stadium Authority, and our winning Baltimore Orioles for their dedication in advancing this promising new era and getting us all across home plate. Let's Go O's!”“The GBC celebrates the Moore Administration and the Orioles for reaching this momentous agreement, ensuring they’ll remain our hometown baseball team for up to 30 years. The Orioles are an important franchise in American sports, and there's no better place for the team than in the heart of our region. We take no long-term investment for granted and commend Governor Wes Moore and the many partners who worked to secure and deliver this milestone for our city, our region, and our state,”. “We look forward to GBC’s continued partnership with the Orioles to advance the Baltimore area and anchor the future of our downtown.”“It’s been a hard fought few months to get this point,”. “Just like the 1983 World Series, a talented and dedicated team of individual leaders came together to negotiate the new Camden Yards lease. This lease will move the City of Baltimore and State of Maryland forward under terms that are fair to Marylanders and the Orioles, sparking a renaissance for downtown Baltimore.”“State assets and resources must always be used in ways that maximize the benefit to Maryland taxpayers,”. “This new lease between the Orioles and the State ensures that the Stadium Authority and the Board of Public Works continue to have rigorous oversight over how state tax dollars are spent - and recourse if needed - while also prompting the Orioles to make their share of investments over the next 30 years. The certainty that comes from knowing fans will be able to enjoy Orioles baseball for decades to come will help bolster the confidence of local businesses and attract new investment to Downtown Baltimore which will help spur continued economic growth.”",

Researchers at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia recently flew multiple drones beyond visual line of sight with no visual observer. The drones successfully flew around obstacles and each other during takeoff, along a planned route, and upon landing, all autonomously without a pilot controlling the flight. 
Researchers at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia recently flew multiple drones beyond visual line of sight with no visual observer. The drones successfully flew around obstacles and each other during takeoff, along a planned route, and upon landing, all autonomously without a pilot controlling the flight. This test marks an important step towards advancing self-flying capabilities for air taxis.
“Flying the vehicles beyond visual line of sight, where neither the vehicle nor the airspace is monitored using direct human observation, demonstrates years of research into automation and safety systems, and required specific approval from the Federal Aviation Administration and NASA to complete,” said Lou Glaab, branch head for the aeronautics systems engineering branch at NASA Langley.
It is safer and more cost effective to test self-flying technology meant for larger, passenger carrying air taxis on smaller drones to observe how they avoid each other and other obstacles.
NASA also is testing elements of automation technology using helicopters. These stand-in aircraft help NASA mature the autonomy well before self-flying air taxis are integrated into the skies.
“When you have multiple vehicles, all coming and going from a vertiport that is located adjacent to an airport or deep within a community, we have to ensure the automation technologies of these vehicles are capable of safely handling a high volume of air traffic in a busy area,” said Glaab.
Building upon past tests, the team successfully performed multiple flights using purchased ALTA 8 Uncrewed Aircraft Systems, also known as drones, with no visual observer and flew the drones beyond visual line of sight, referred to as “NOVO-BVLOS” flights.
The software loaded onto the small drones performed airspace communications, flight path management, avoidance with other vehicles, and more skills needed to operate in a busy airspace. This is imperative for what is envisioned with Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), where drones and air taxis will be operating at the same time on a routine basis.
The flight tests were observed from NASA Langley’s Remote Operations for Autonomous Missions control center while the drones took off and landed at the City Environment for Testing Autonomous Integrated Navigation test range.
NASA will transfer the new technology created during this project to the public to ensure industry manufacturers can access the software while designing their vehicles.
“NASA’s ability to transfer these technologies will significantly benefit the industry,” said Jake Schaefer, flight operations lead for the project. “By conducting flight tests within the national airspace, in close proximity to airports and an urban environment, we are table to test technologies and procedures in a controlled but relevant environment for future AAM vehicles.”
One of these technologies was ICAROURS, which stands for NASA’s Integrated Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems. This software provides an autonomous detect-and-avoid function and is part of the overall system to maintain “well clear” from other air traffic.
Another technology used was NASA’s Safe2Ditch system, which allows the vehicle to observe the ground below and make an autonomous decision on the safest place to land in the event of an in-flight emergency.
NASA’s AAM mission has multiple projects contributing to various research areas. This project, called the High Density Vertiplex, was specifically focused on testing and evaluating where these future vehicles will take off and land at high frequency, called vertiports, or vertiplexes, for multiple vertiports near each other, and the technology advancements needed to make this successful.

NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Doug “Wheels” Wheelock participated in a recent test of a sub-scale mockup elevator for SpaceX’s Starship human landing system that will be used for NASA’s Artemis III and IV missions to the Moon. The Starship human landing system will carry two astronauts from the Orion spacecraft in lunar orbit to the surface, serve as a habitat for crew members’ approximately one week stay on the Moon, and transfer them from the surface back to Orion.
The elevator will transport equipment and crew between Starship’s habitable area, located near the top of the lander, and the lunar surface, as they exit for moonwalks. The test allowed the astronauts to interact with a flight-like design of the elevator system, serving as both a functional demonstration of the hardware and providing the chance to receive valuable feedback from a crew perspective.
Built at SpaceX’s facility in Hawthorne, California, the elevator mockup has a full-scale basket section with functioning mechanical assemblies and crew interfaces for testing. During the demonstration, NASA astronauts wore spacesuits that simulate the suit size and mobility constraints that crew will face on the Moon. For Artemis III, the crew will wear new advanced spacesuits being developed by Axiom Space.
The suited crew provided feedback on elevator controls, such as gate latches, ramp deployment interfaces for moving into and out of the elevator basket, available space for cargo, and dynamic operations while the basket moved along a vertical rail system.
NASA is working to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon under Artemis to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before and prepare to send humans to Mars for the benefit of all. The human landing system is a critical piece of deep space exploration architecture, along with the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, advanced spacesuits and rovers, and the Gateway in orbit around the Moon.

388,388.0,,"As the Arctic Warms, Its Waters Are Emitting Carbon",https://www.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/as-the-arctic-warms-its-waters-are-emitting-carbon/,"5 min read
Runoff from one of North America’s largest rivers is driving intense carbon dioxide emissions in the Arctic Ocean.
When it comes to influencing climate change, the world’s smallest ocean punches above its weight. It’s been estimated that the cold waters of the Arctic absorb as much as 180 million metric tons of carbon per year – more than three times what New York City emits annually – making it one of Earth’s critical carbon sinks. But recent findings show that thawing permafrost and carbon-rich runoff from Canada’s Mackenzie River trigger part of the Arctic Ocean to release more carbon dioxide (CO2) than it absorbs.
The study, published earlier this year, explores how scientists are using state-of-the-art computer modeling to study rivers such as the Mackenzie, which flows into a region of the Arctic Ocean called the Beaufort Sea. Like many parts of the Arctic, the Mackenzie River and its delta have faced significantly warmer temperatures in recent years across all seasons, leading to more melting and thawing of waterways and landscapes.
In this marshy corner of Canada’s Northwest Territories, the continent’s second largest river system ends a thousand-mile journey that begins near Alberta. Along the way, the river acts as a conveyor belt for mineral nutrients as well as organic and inorganic matter. That material drains into the Beaufort Sea as a soup of dissolved carbon and sediment. Some of the carbon is eventually released, or outgassed, into the atmosphere by natural processes.
Scientists have thought of the southeastern Beaufort Sea as a weak-to-moderate CO2 sink, meaning it absorbs more of the greenhouse gas than it releases. But there has been great uncertainty due to a lack of data from the remote region.
To fill that void, the study team adapted a global ocean biogeochemical model called ECCO-Darwin, which was developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. The model assimilates nearly all available ocean observations collected for more than two decades by sea- and satellite-based instruments (sea level observations from the Jason-series altimeters, for example, and ocean-bottom pressure from the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions).
The scientists used the model to simulate the discharge of fresh water and the elements and compounds it carries – including carbon, nitrogen, and silica – across nearly 20 years (from 2000 to 2019).
The researchers, from France, the U.S., and Canada, found that the river discharge was triggering such intense outgassing in the southeastern Beaufort Sea that it tipped the carbon balance, leading to a net CO2 release of 0.13 million metric tons per year – roughly equivalent to the annual emissions from 28,000 gasoline-powered cars. The release of CO2 into the atmosphere varied between seasons, being more pronounced in warmer months, when river discharge was high and there was less sea ice to cover and trap the gas.
Scientists have for decades studied how carbon cycles between the open ocean and atmosphere, a process called air-sea CO2 flux. However, the observational record is sparse along the coastal fringes of the Arctic, where the terrain, sea ice, and long polar nights can make long-term monitoring and experiments challenging.
“With our model, we are trying to explore the real contribution of the coastal peripheries and rivers to the Arctic carbon cycle,” said lead author Clément Bertin, a scientist at Littoral Environnement et Sociétés in France.
Such insights are critical because about half of the area of the Arctic Ocean is composed of coastal waters, where land meets sea in a complex embrace. And while the study focused on a particular corner of the Arctic Ocean, it can help tell a larger story of environmental change unfolding in the region.
Since the 1970s, the Arctic has warmed at least three times faster than anywhere else on Earth, transforming its waters and ecosystems, the scientists said. Some of these changes promote more CO2 outgassing in the region, while others lead to more CO2 being absorbed.
For example, with Arctic lands thawing and more snow and ice melting, rivers are flowing more briskly and flushing more organic matter from permafrost and peatlands into the ocean. On the other hand, microscopic phytoplankton floating near the ocean surface are increasingly taking advantage of shrinking sea ice to bloom in the newfound open water and sunlight. These plantlike marine organisms capture and draw down atmospheric CO2during photosynthesis. The ECCO-Darwin model is being used to study these blooms and the ties between ice and life in the Arctic.
Scientists are tracking these large and seemingly small changes in the Arctic and beyond because our ocean waters remain a critical buffer against a changing climate, sequestering as much as 48% of the carbon produced by burning fossil fuels.

Another jam-packed year is in store for NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida as the momentum of a busy 2023 is carried forward into the new year. On the horizon are missions to the Moon, more crew and cargo flights to the International Space Station, and several upgrade projects across the spaceport.
NASA’s first CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative mission with Astrobotic’s Peregrine lunar lander is set to begin work in 2024 after lifting off on the inaugural launch of United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur rocket. These missions will help the agency develop capabilities needed to explore the Moon under Artemis ahead of sending astronauts to the lunar surface. 
Another CLPS mission, set for launch early in the year aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, will send the Intuitive Machines Nova-C lander to a landing site at the Moon’s South Pole region. The mission will carry NASA payloads focusing on plume-surface interactions, space weather/lunar surface interactions, radio astronomy, precision landing technologies, and a communication and navigation node for future autonomous navigation technologies.  
Development toward Artemis II, NASA’s first crewed test flight of its lunar-focused Artemis program continues across Kennedy. SLS (Space Launch System) hardware, including twin solid rocket boosters and a 212-foot-tall core stage for the Artemis II mission, will begin stacking and integration inside the Vehicle Assembly Building in the coming months, after which teams will begin a series of testing prior to launch. Processing also is underway on the core stage for Artemis III. 
The Artemis II Orion crew and service modules will continue prelaunch processing inside Kennedy’s Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building alongside the crew modules for Artemis III and Artemis IV– NASA’s initial missions to land the next humans on the lunar surface.  
NASA and its commercial partners, Boeing and SpaceX, have three Commercial Crew Program missions set to fly from Florida’s Space Coast, setting up another busy year of traffic for the International Space Station in 2024. Teams are readying for the short-duration Crew Flight Test of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner no earlier than April. Meanwhile, NASA and SpaceX will continue crew rotation missions to the orbiting laboratory with Crew-8 expected no earlier than mid-February and Crew-9 to follow in mid-August.  
Other crewed missions to the space station include SpaceX and Axiom Space’s short-duration Axiom Mission 3 and Axiom Mission 4 private astronaut missions.  
SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn, the second private short-duration orbital flight will also lift off from Kennedy with four individuals that plan to attempt the first-ever commercial spacewalk. 
Along with crewed flights, three of the agency’s Commercial Resupply Services missions hosted on SpaceX’s Dragon cargo spacecraft, Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus, and the debut flight of Sierra Space’s cargo spaceplane, Dream Chaser, are slated to fly from Kennedy next year to deliver thousands of pounds of supplies, equipment, and science investigations to the orbiting laboratory. 
NASA’s Launch Services Program based at Kennedy has several science and CubeSat missions manifested to fly on commercial rockets next year. They represent a mix of some of the agency’s most complex robotic and scientific missions, as well as smaller cost-efficient missions, and missions sponsored by NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative. 
The first of three primary missions is NASA’s PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) spacecraft that will launch early next year on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. PACE’s science goals include extending ocean color, atmospheric aerosol, and cloud data records for Earth system and climate studies.  
GOES-U (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-U) is slated to launch in April on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, the fourth and final satellite in NOAA’s GOES-R Series of advanced geostationary weather-observing satellites. Scheduled for an October launch on a Falcon Heavy, the agency’s Europa Clipper mission will investigate Jupiter’s moon Europa to determine if it has conditions suitable to support life.  
Among the small spacecraft and CubeSat missions slated to launch in 2024 are two dedicated launches on Rocket Lab’s Electron for PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Infrared Experiment), which aims to give researchers a more accurate picture of the energy entering and leaving Earth. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket will host NASA’s EscaPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) mission that will send two spacecraft to study solar wind energy and momentum through Mars’ unique hybrid magnetosphere. 
While next year’s expected cadence of nearly 100 launches from Florida’s Space Coast is likely to mirror 2023’s record-setting pace, something else to look out for will be upgrade and sustainability efforts around the spaceport.  
The Indian River Bridge construction project, which opened the first of two spans in June of 2023, and the solar site 6 project of the Utility Energy Services Contract, are expected to wrap up and become fully operational next year. 
Restoration and beautification efforts across Kennedy also include the consideration of several sites for development into natural wildflower prairies. In the spring, Spaceport Integration’s sustainability team will work on “Project Arbor at the Spaceport.” It will focus on planting Florida native trees and one seedling from the Artemis Moon Tree project along the Fitness Trail near Operations Support Building II to provide shade, benefit wildlife, and help improve air quality. 
A historical marker sponsored by NASA and the Florida Department of State will be installed in early 2024 at the site of Kennedy’s original Headquarters Building making it the first to be located within Kennedy’s secure area. 
As 2023 draws to a close, Kennedy Space Center is gearing up to support more groundbreaking missions that will expand human knowledge of Earth and our solar system while protecting the local ecosystem and natural resources.

Teachers and students in remote Alaskan villages have become vital NASA climate researchers. These special volunteers are so important that last year, climate scientists took an epic 550 mile snowmobile journey to collaborate with them! You can learn all about it in a new video from the Fresh Eyes on Ice project.
The researchers stopped at several remote Alaskan villages, where teachers and students at the local schools already understood why this work was so crucial. When you drive over ice-covered rivers every day—as many Alaskan residents do—tracking ice thickness is no joke. Neither is climate change.
“We knew that climate change was happening around us.” explains Joyanne Hamilton, a teacher whose students worked with the team. “Our elders here in Shageluk were talking about changes that were happening….the data they’re gathering is ultimately important to the tribe.” 
The new video features Hamilton, her students, and Fresh Eyes on Ice researchers Dr. Chris Arp, Allen Bondurant and Sarah Clement. It follows their journey along the Innoko, Kukokwim and Yukon Rivers and the Iditarod Sled Dog Trail.

NASA Hubble Mission Team
Goddard Space Flight Center
This photo of Saturn was taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope on October 22, 2023, when the ringed planet was approximately 850 million miles from Earth. Hubble's ultra-sharp vision reveals a phenomenon called ring spokes.
Saturn's spokes are transient features that rotate along with the rings. Their ghostly appearance only persists for two or three rotations around Saturn. During active periods, freshly-formed spokes continuously add to the pattern.
In 1981, NASA's Voyager 2 first photographed the ring spokes. NASA's Cassini orbiter also saw the spokes during its 13-year-long mission that ended in 2017.
Hubble continues observing Saturn annually as the spokes come and go. This cycle has been captured by Hubble's Outer Planets Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program that began nearly a decade ago to annually monitor weather changes on all four gas-giant outer planets.
Hubble's crisp images show that the frequency of spoke apparitions is seasonally driven, first appearing in OPAL data in 2021 but only on the morning (left) side of the rings. Long-term monitoring show that both the number and contrast of the spokes vary with Saturn's seasons. Saturn is tilted on its axis like Earth and has seasons lasting approximately seven years.
""We are heading towards Saturn equinox, when we'd expect maximum spoke activity, with higher frequency and darker spokes appearing over the next few years,"" said the OPAL program lead scientist, Amy Simon of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
This year, these ephemeral structures appear on both sides of the planet simultaneously as they spin around the giant world. Although they look small compared with Saturn, their length and width can stretch longer than Earth's diameter!
""The leading theory is that spokes are tied to Saturn's powerful magnetic field, with some sort of solar interaction with the magnetic field that gives you the spokes,"" said Simon. When it's near the equinox on Saturn, the planet and its rings are less tilted away from the Sun. In this configuration, the solar wind may more strongly batter Saturn's immense magnetic field, enhancing spoke formation.
Planetary scientists think that electrostatic forces generated from this interaction levitate dust or ice above the ring to form the spokes, though after several decades no theory perfectly predicts the spokes. Continued Hubble observations may eventually help solve the mystery.
The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the telescope. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, conducts Hubble and Webb science operations. STScI is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, in Washington, D.C.

A first-generation student from North Carolina will return to school in January feeling more motivated and better connected to her future thanks to time invested as a NASA Pathways Intern at NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.
Raquel Cervantes Espinosa, the first member of her family to attend college and a rising junior at Duke University, applied to the internship at NASA Stennis because of opportunities the site presented, such as working with large rocket engines. She admits to initially being nervous, having never traveled to Mississippi or the Gulf Coast area.
The electrical engineering major says she was welcomed with open arms. She grew fond of the diverse and highly skilled workforce that showed how her studies apply to working with NASA, which makes leaving after the fall semester bittersweet.
“It feels like NASA is really investing in me as an individual, and the people that I work with make it feel that way, too,” Cervantes Espinosa said. “I feel valued here and feel like I can grow with my career and degree studies in terms of what I want to do in the future. I really enjoyed my time at NASA Stennis during the fall and look forward to returning in the summer.”
During the fall semester, Cervantes Espinosa worked with test stand camera systems, including those in support of NASA’s certification test series of the RS-25 engine. The series will lead to production of updated engines that will help power future Artemis missions to the Moon and beyond on the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket.
“Raquel had a great first semester as a Pathways Intern learning about various electrical and mechanical systems,” said David Carver, deputy branch chief of the Electrical Operations Branch at NASA Stennis. “Her shining accomplishment for the semester was the new test operations video system that she helped design and bring online. The system will provide test engineers with new insight into the operation and health of critical propulsion systems. I look forward to seeing what she accomplishes in the future.”
The thermal visual cameras set up by Cervantes Espinosa at the Fred Haise Test Stand, where RS-25 hot fires take place, help ensure safe operations by allowing engineers to monitor key areas of the test stand, such as the liquid oxygen stalls and hydrogen systems. The cameras can also identify potential gas leaks not seen with the naked eye. Additionally, Cervantes Espinosa had the opportunity to analyze data and work on instruments that are used on the RS-25 engine.
“A lot of the experience I’m getting from working at NASA Stennis, a lot of the stuff I’m learning now, is really shaping how I see engineering differently than I used to,” she said.
The Duke student says one key takeaway from the fall semester was learning beyond electrical engineering and understanding how her physics minor can be applied in the aerospace industry – an industry she now wants to join following graduation.
On pace to graduate in 2026, Cervantes Espinosa said it can be challenging at times in unfamiliar territory, whether as an intern at NASA Stennis or as a first-generation engineering student.
“I would encourage other first-generation students to keep your head up and keep going,” Cervantes Espinosa said. “It sounds very cliché, but I think it’s really accurate for people like me and a lot of my friends who are first-generation students in engineering and beginning to immerse ourselves into the workforce and see what we need to do. Keep your head up, keep going, and really take advantage of such opportunities because they are out there, and people want the best for you and want to invest in you. You just have to go and seize the opportunity.”
The NASA Pathways Intern Program opens in the spring and fall each year with job postings on USAJobs.gov. The application windows open two times each year – typically around February and September.

According to the warrants, Treasure Mcweay “was extremely underweight, and her face appeared to be sunken in around the eyes and cheekbones.” A Dec. 13 autopsy revealed that the child weighed only 24 pounds and had just 5 milliliters of liquid in her stomach, the warrant adds. Officials considered her to be “extremely malnourished and dehydrated.”

Two other children, ages 4 and 3, were found to have been living with Rodney Mcwaey, and the warrant accuses him of not providing “sustenance in the form of food or water for any of his three children.”

Those children were hospitalized for extreme malnourishment and severe dehydration, the warrant details. Doctors at Hughes Spalding also confirmed with police that Mcwaey failed to provide one of his kids’ prescribed seizure medication, officials said.

Police interviewed Mcwaey and uncovered that he never allowed the children to go outside and did not permit them to leave their rooms without his permission, the warrant said. He also told police that if the kids needed something, he would take it to them.

During a search warrant of Mcwaey’s home, police said they found only expired eggs and expired milk. The kids’ rooms were also searched and no clothing was discovered, the warrant states. Several cameras, including some facing the children’s beds, were found throughout the house, officials said.

Mcwaey did not have custody of his children, authorities said.

On July 6, he is accused of kidnapping all three kids from a residence in Aberdeen, Maryland, arrest warrants reveal. The document states that the mother was the sole legal guardian and Rodney Mcwaey prevented family members, the kids’ mother and Georgia Division of Family and Children Services employees from speaking to the children.

A working smoke detector raises the chance of surviving a house fire by 85%, said Burton Clark of the Fire Service Psychology Association. Evacuating a home before help arrives is also critical to improving outcomes not just for the residents, but for the crews rushing into the flames to try to rescue them.

“Do not take any fire alarms as being false. There’s no such thing as a false fire alarm. There’s something that made the fire alarm activate,” Georgia Tech Fire Safety Manager Bridget Mourao said during the demonstration. “It takes less than two minutes for a fire to become deadly, so getting out is the only way to stay alive.”",

But as days went by, the trauma he witnessed began to take a toll on him, and Daniels said he wasn’t sure how to deal with his emotions.

That’s the reality of being a first responder, facing traumatic events and withholding emotions to do the job. But sometimes the trauma goes home with you. For years, it’s a topic that was rarely addressed.

Firefighters face an increased risk of suicide due to job-related stress and depression, a 2021 federal study found. Some organizations report that more than 100 firefighters nationwide commit suicide each year, but federal officials acknowledge potential data gaps as some departments may be hesitant to share figures due to the stigma and patient confidentiality.

In recent years, firefighters have been encouraged to discuss workplace trauma, which officials claim helps them process it instead of letting it smolder. Authorities in Atlanta and DeKalb said firefighters will debrief after every call and are urged to seek extra support from peers, leadership, chaplains and other resources such as therapy.

Carla Moore, chief psychologist for Atlanta’s Public Safety Behavioral Health Wellness Unit, said firefighters experience increased stress during emotionally intense calls, particularly those involving death or children. First responders need to address their feelings to maintain mental stability and well-being, Moore said.

“They usually talk about it within the station, not ever really processing it in a therapeutic fashion or a way that kind of opens it up, because to open it up means I actually have to talk about it more. So usually it’s repressed or just completely ignored altogether,” she explained.

What triggers stress

Starting as a recruit with the Danville Fire Department in Virginia in 1983 and later joining Atlanta Fire Rescue in 2005, Roosevelt Johns anticipated facing trauma daily and assisting people on their worst days.

Sometime in the late 1990s, Johns responded to a fiery crash in Danville involving a teenager who was killed. His child was about the same age and Johns couldn’t help but think: That could be my child.

That call has stuck with him ever since. He described it as a moment he realized the mental impact of being a firefighter.

“We say often that the firefighter who comes in on the first year is a different person after about five years,” Johns said.

Johns, who since 2013 has been serving as a chaplain with the Atlanta fire department, said there used to be a stigma about being impacted by a call, and openly discussing it was not encouraged. Firefighters were expected to develop what he calls “tough skin” and not let incidents weigh them down.

“One of the things that I think is paramount is that we talk about it because historically we did not,” he said. “But nowadays, we do try to encourage people to at least talk about those circumstances among your peers.”

Johns serves as a listening ear to crew members after emotionally intense calls, and has had countless firefighters come to him regarding changes in personality and relational issues.

Understanding the impact

Moore said not processing one’s emotions after a traumatic event is usually how prolonged stress, behavioral and mental health conditions, or other unhealthy habits begin.

According to a 2018 paper by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, about 30% of first responders develop behavioral health conditions, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, compared to 20% of the general population.

Moore emphasized the importance of new firefighters knowing what to expect and how to work through trauma. She said firefighters undergo mental wellness screenings, are provided psychoeducation, and receive external referrals for therapists and other medical professionals.

“The goal is to from the minute a person walks in as a recruit to get them to understand, just like you have to stay physically fit so that you can carry that hose, you have to stay mentally fit in order to sustain your mental health in doing this job,” she said.

Personality changes are often the first sign a firefighter is dealing with unresolved trauma. Officials explained that getting to work late, appearing disheveled, isolating oneself and having a short temper are some indicators. Johns and Daniels said that a firefighter may not realize that stress has changed them, but those close to them will notice.

Though Daniels and Johns both said they regularly speak with close friends after tough jobs, Daniels claimed that his personality has changed. When faced with a problem, he immediately wants to fix it, fearing that something worse could come out of it.

“I’m a problem solver. Once we get on scene, people expect us to have a solution. ... When I’m presented with a problem, I immediately attempt to come up with some type of fix for it,” he said, adding that “in a family situation or family household, that can be a problem sometimes.”

Resilience

Daniels said he often becomes a counselor to victims and their families, helping them comprehend the tragedy they’ve faced.

“We get the brunt of the gore, the mental stress that goes with it. We have the family members screaming in the background, we have the kids sitting on the couch not understanding why their parent or their loved one isn’t moving or isn’t responding,” Daniels said.

Just like victims have to come to terms with death in those circumstances, Johns explained that firefighters must recognize their own limits: It’s not always possible to save everyone. Guilt is a feeling Johns said many firefighters struggle with at the start of their careers.

Overcoming those emotional challenges is eased by engaging in self-care and spending time with friends and family. With the right tools in place, most firefighters are resilient, officials agreed.

“We as firefighters, we are very resilient and we understand that this is something that we chose to do,” Daniels said. “When duty calls, we are going to respond and respond appropriately because it’s not about us, it’s about the person who called us for help.”",
398,,,"Former assistant alleges sexual assault against Vin Diesel in Atlanta incident, suit says",https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/former-assistant-alleges-sexual-assault-against-vin-diesel-in-atlanta-incident-suit-says/D76DFR7PGZCSBJ74QPLN2DJRJQ/,"Attempts to contact Diesel and his companies were not immediately successful.

“Ms. Jonasson was unable to escape and closed her eyes, scared of angering Vin Diesel by rejecting him further and trying to dissociate, wishing the assault would end,” the lawsuit states.

Claire-Lise Y. Kutlay, an attorney for Jonasson, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Jonasson was initially too afraid to report the alleged assault. Jonasson was also made to sign a nondisclosure agreement as an employee of Diesel’s One Race production business, Kutlay said.

“She was afraid what it would mean for her career in the film industry, which has a pattern of protecting powerful men and silencing people who do speak up about sexual abuse that they have received or been subjected to,” Kutlay said Thursday. “She has made the very courageous decision to file a lawsuit so that she can seek justice and hold Vin Diesel and the others that permitted and covered up the sexual assault accountable for their actions.”

Diesel’s sister, Samantha Vincent, has also been sued by Jonasson, case records show. Vincent is the president of Diesel’s production company that employed Jonasson, and was the one who fired Jonasson shortly after the alleged assault, Kutlay said.

One Race Productions Inc. and One Race Films Inc. are also named as defendants in the case.

Jonasson, a California resident, was over the age of 18 when the alleged assault occurred, Kutlay said. She said Jonasson wants to prevent other women from experiencing what she went through.

Jonasson alleged that she was hired by One Race in September 2010 as an assistant working directly for Diesel. She said her first assignment was to travel to Atlanta for the filming of “Fast Five,” the fifth movie in the “Fast & Furious” franchise.

On Sept. 10, 2010, Diesel was allegedly entertaining multiple women at his hotel suite. Once the other women had left, Diesel attempted to undress Jonasson, she alleged.

After the alleged assault, Diesel said “Good job,” to Jonasson before leaving the suite, per the complaint. Within hours, Jonasson had been fired by Vincent, the lawsuit states.

“The message was clear,” the complaint states. “Ms. Jonasson was fired for courageously resisting Vin Diesel’s sexual assault, Vin Diesel would be protected, and his sexual assault covered up.”

Jonasson was empowered to sue in light of the “#MeToo” and “Time’s Up” movements exposing sexual assault, her lawsuit states. She said she felt protected by the federal Speak Out Act as well as California law allowing her to bring her otherwise untimely claims.

The lawsuit includes civil claims of sexual battery, sex discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination.",
399,,,"UPDATE: Atlanta teachers, staff will get Gov. Kemp’s bonus after all",https://www.ajc.com/education/update-atlanta-public-schools-to-approve-kemps-bonus-plan/LMPDJJXHHFAALEOGU6KA6Z7SWI/,"“All eligible Atlanta Public Schools (APS) employees have already received the state-referenced employee retention supplement in the form of the Mid-Year Holiday Retention Stipend, included in the December 14, 2023 paycheck,” the message read.

The school district changed course Thursday evening, hours after Georgia School Superintendent Richard Woods sent a letter to Atlanta Public Schools interim Superintendent Danielle Battle pushing her to reconsider the district’s decision.

“The intent of Atlanta Public Schools and the Atlanta Board of Education was to reward our hardworking teachers and school staff with a bonus before the holiday break, while also being fiscally responsible stewards of taxpayer funds,” the district said in a statement. “We did that as a district on December 15th and we are committed to passing along any additional funds once funds are disbursed for the Governor’s proposal and clarification is provided on which categories of employees should be covered by the bonus.”

APS initially said the money Kemp approved for the bonuses would be used for other district priorities.

“In this instance, we preemptively moved to show our appreciation to staff by asking our Board to approve the usage of fund balance for all employees in early December so that we could get our payments out in advance of the holiday break,” the district said in a statement earlier this week to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “We greatly appreciate the Governor’s willingness to use the state fund balance to share in the cost by providing stipends for our teachers, as this allows us to use our fund balance for other educational needs. Since we used district fund balance to secure the appreciation payments made to all eligible employees on the December 15th payroll, the state funding announced today will be used in support of other APS priorities.”

In his letter to Battle, first reported Thursday by the AJC, Woods said he was “baffled” by the district’s ability to predict the exact timing and amount of the bonus.

“Let me be very clear: the intent of the state’s $1,000 retention pay supplement is not to backfill the Atlanta Public Schools budget or ‘share in the cost’ of additional recognition already provided by districts to teachers,” Woods’ letter reads.

Lisa Morgan, the president of the Georgia Association of Educators, said it’s puzzling that APS didn’t wait on guidance from Woods’ office before notifying staff they wouldn’t receive the money.

“It’s very disappointing that a system would state — before they have all the details — that educators are not going to receive the bonus that was announced and intended for them,” Morgan said.

Woods ended his letter to Battle with a plea to change the district’s decision.

“The state is providing a $1,000 retention payment to teachers and support staff, and it is my expectation that they will receive it,” he said. “Anything less is a disservice to the teachers and staff whose efforts in the classroom — far more than anything that takes place at the state or central office level — are the reason our students succeed.”",

He said about 10 inches of water left furniture, floors and walls damaged and sent Christmas gifts floating.

Bob Myers sat in the gymnasium of Oxnard College on Thursday afternoon holding his cane.

At around 1:45 a.m. Thursday, he was awakened at his home in the 55-plus community of Hueneme Bay by the sound of rushing water.

A storm that barreled down on Ventura County dumped what officials said was historic levels of rain over a short period of time. The downpour left streets flooded across Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme, where Myers lives.

“I thought some pipes had blown up or something,” he said. Myers ran to his bathroom but found no issues. He then moved to his back door, where he saw water rushing into his home “like someone was standing there with a fire hose.”

The doors, he explained, were closed, and the water was coming in from small spaces around them. The doors could not be opened.

He looked through one of his windows at the complex and saw “a lake.”

“Eventually,” he said, “the water receded enough that people could begin getting their doors open.”

Stories like this emerged in Ventura County coastal communities hit hard by the rainstorm.

Preliminary data suggest Oxnard may have experienced one of the heaviest downpours ever observed in the area, with rainfall rates of 3 inches per hour sustained for more than an hour.

“These are genuinely extraordinary torrential downpours — and, importantly, they’re continuing. This is not over yet,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA, said at a briefing Thursday.

Fire officials in Ventura County reported that 911 dispatchers had received more than 275 calls for help over a five-hour period as floodwaters rose in the coastal communities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard.

Mud and debris tumbled into roadways in Santa Barbara, closing at least one off-ramp on the 101 Freeway. Elsewhere, cars were surrounded by rushing water that appeared to be several feet deep.

But Port Hueneme was particularly hard hit.

One of Myers’ neighbors accidentally cut himself while attempting to get out of his home and was hospitalized.

Although the waters had receded, the damage to Myers’ home had been done.

“There is nothing livable left in my home,” he said. From 3 to 4 feet of water had entered the house, throwing appliances and furniture around and soaking walls.

Myers was at a loss about what his next steps would be.

“I am an unfortunate one,” he said. “I have no family in this state. I have no family closer than the East Coast.

Responding to a recent surge in retail theft, the California Highway Patrol announced Thursday it had seized more than $1 million in stolen items and arrested a Los Angeles woman in connection to a Southern California retail theft ring.

The Organized Retail Crime Task Force of the CHP conducted a raid on a warehouse in the city of Paramount and a business called The Makeup Store on Whittier Boulevard in Los Angeles, uncovering more than a million dollars worth of stolen cosmetics during the operation.

Officers arrested and booked Brenda Yanez, 48, on charges of organized retail theft, grand theft and receiving stolen property. Authorities linked her arrest to an organized theft ring targeting multiple Southern California retailers, including CVS, Sephora, Ulta Beauty, Rite Aid, Nordstrom, and 99 Cents Only stores.

In addition to the stolen property, police found tools used to remove anti-theft devices at the raided locations. Several loss prevention investigators from the affected retailers were on the scene, assisting in identifying stolen merchandise.

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last month that in response to a spike in retail theft, the CHP task force was “increasing enforcement efforts through proactive and confidential law enforcement operations with allied agencies through the holidays.” In the first 11 months of the year, the governor’s office said the task force had made more than 1,000 arrests, a 109% year-over-year increase.

Theft has prompted many retail businesses, including drug stores, to add extra security measures, such as locking allergy medicine, shaving razors, infant formula and batteries, among other items, behind plexiglass.

Tuesday’s raid came days after the Los Angeles Police Department searched a Westlake storefront and uncovered hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stolen merchandise. During that search, police discovered hundreds of stolen Apple products connected to burglaries.

Other law enforcement agencies have also been cracking down on retail thefts in California.

On the same day as the Whittier Boulevard bust, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office arrested six people in Lake Elsinore, charging them with various crimes, including burglary and narcotics-related misdemeanor warrants. Addressing a high rate of shoplifting at one retail store, the San Francisco Police Department conducted an operation Tuesday, arresting 18 shoplifting suspects.",

The latest storm in Southern California is expected to drop little, if any, snow on the slopes.

As skiers and snowboarders flock to the Lake Tahoe and the Eastern Sierra slopes this holiday weekend, National Weather Service meteorologists say the latest storm is expected to drop only a limited amount of snow in Southern California.

The only area that could record even as much as 1 to 2 inches of snow over the weekend is the high mountain peaks of the Eastern San Gabriel Mountains, said John Dumas, meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, operators of the Mt. Baldy Resort in the San Gabriel Mountains, said they expect to open their snow play area Saturday and Sunday as well as a chair lift “through the holidays.”

“We expect more snow after Christmas through the New Year,” according to the post.

Big Bear Mountain Resort in the San Bernardino Mountains is expected to see rain and snow flurries Friday evening but should have little to no snow accumulation over the weekend.

Looking out of his office window and seeing blue skies, Justin Kanton, Big Bear’s public relations director, said the limited trails open for skiing should remain open over the weekend, and the amount of snow in the area has been great so far for visitors, especially students on winter vacation.

As the Big Bear resort waits what the storm might bring, Katon cautioned visitors to prepare ahead of traveling to the area by checking the weather report, looking for road closures and identifying whether snow chains are necessary for travel.

“What [you] don’t want is to get halfway up the hill and CHP turns [you] around because [you] don’t have the right kind of traction,” he said.

Other parts of the state have already received enough snow to kick off the ski season.

409,,,Minimum-wage workers in these California cities are getting a raise in 2024,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/minimum-wage-workers-in-these-cities-are-getting-a-raise-in-2024,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom signs the fast-food bill, surrounded by fast food workers at the SEIU Local 721 in Los Angeles, in September.

Workers at fast-food restaurants and in minimum-wage jobs can expect a pay bump soon, courtesy of higher wage floors adopted by California lawmakers and more than two dozen cities across the state.

In California, the minimum wage is currently $15.50 per hour, but it rises to $16 per hour starting Jan. 1, according to the state’s Department of Industrial Relations.

For workers in several cities, the pay bump may be more significant. Twenty-seven cities across the state adopted new minimum-wage laws this year, according to a study by the UC Berkeley Labor Center, and the pay increases are set to take place Jan. 1.

Because the cities’ minimum wage exceeds the state’s floor, workers would be entitled to the higher wage set by their municipality.

According to the labor center, 58 counties and cities across the country have minimum-wage laws. Most of them are in California.

In Oakland, the city approved a minimum wage of $16.50 an hour for 2024. In the city of Mountain View, local officials set a minimum wage of $18.75 an hour for next year, more than $2 above the state minimum.

For fast-food workers, the increased pay will be a bit more significant.

A new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September — codifying a deal reached between fast-food companies and unions — will boost minimum wages for many fast-food workers to $20 per hour, starting April 1.

That wage floor, which will apply to chains that have more than 60 locations across the country, is estimated to affect more than 500,000 workers.

Here are the California cities that will have higher minimum wages in effect, starting Jan. 1:



The UC Berkeley Labor Center tracks cities and counties that have adopted their own minimum wage, usually higher than their states. Others boosted their wage floors previously; for example, the minimum wage is $19.08 in West Hollywood and is $19.08 and $16,78 in Los Angeles, both of which will be adjusted later in 2024 for inflation.",
410,,,"Six men allege ‘rampant, unceasing sexual abuse’ at secluded Northern California nonprofit",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/six-men-allege-sexual-abuse-fellowship-of-friends,"They were searching for spiritual awakening and enlightenment. Instead, the six men were subject to “rampant, unceasing sexual abuse” by their spiritual guide, in concert with members of a controversial religious group and workers at an award-winning Northern California winery, the men allege in court documents.

The unnamed plaintiffs filed a lawsuit Friday in Yuba County against the Fellowship of Friends — a nonprofit religious group described by some as a cult — along with its founder and spiritual teacher, Robert Earl Burton, and its Renaissance Vineyard and Winery.

Fellowship of Friends bills itself as an organization that helps members reach their true potential, an upscale throwback to the erstwhile Bay Area communes that separated participants from society so they could pursue self-realization. Former Fellowship members, however, allege the group is really a cult of personality masquerading as a nonprofit, and that its true purpose is to satisfy Burton’s sexual needs. On the side, the Fellowship created a famed winery whose lists of honors and accolades for its Cabernet Sauvignons, Sauvignon Blancs and Riesling span pages.

Their civil complaint seeks damages for 15 alleged violations, including gender violence, human trafficking, sexual assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs are also asking for a trial by jury.

Adam Slater, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said that although male sexual assault survivors experience “the same trauma as women,” stigma hinders the filing of criminal or civil lawsuits.

“We commend these brave individuals for coming forward and encourage others to do the same,” Slater said in a statement.

Fellowship President Greg Holman told The Times that his organization “has been made aware of the lawsuit” but has yet to be served.

Holman declined to comment when asked about the allegations and his personal interactions with Burton.

The Fellowship of Friends was established in 1970 by Burton , a former schoolteacher.

According to the Fellowship, members are encouraged to “learn both the principles of awakening and practical methods to apply those in their daily life.” Students are aided in this journey by Burton, 84, who is referred to as “The Teacher,” according to court documents.

Burton has told members he is guided by dozens of angels, including Abraham Lincoln, Plato and Jesus Christ.

California Trouble Taints a Cerebral Sanctuary Robert Burton created Fellowship of Friends to celebrate the intellect and offer a haven from nuclear holocaust. But claims of a sex scandal have prompted many members to leave.

The organization’s main campus is on a 1,300-acre tract in the Northern California community of Oregon House and is called Apollo. There, members drink fine wine, listen to opera and gaze upon expensive artwork.

Yet the plaintiffs asserted that the organization has a dark and “secret” side.

They allege they were “sexually assaulted, sexually battered, raped, harassed, groomed, and/or otherwise attacked” during their time at Apollo.

Five of the men were members from 1971 to 1986; the last plaintiff joined in 1997 and left in 2008.

Five of the plaintiffs said they suffered some form of sexual abuse or harassment from four to 30 times.

A sixth said he was “sexually harassed, abused, molested and assaulted” between 280 and 300 times over an eight-year period.

Burton and the organization made sure the balance of power was in their favor, the lawsuit alleges, as they maintained control of the men with threats of punishment and insistence on obedience. They quashed rebellion with “isolation, sleep deprivation [and] the creation of inner conflict.”

But the lawsuit also alleges that Burton lavished the men with praise and affection — “love bombing” them as a means of seduction and coercion, the lawsuit alleges.

Although Burton maintained that homosexuality was “degenerate” and “wrong,” the lawsuit says, he justified his pursuit of male members by referring to them as “feminine angels in a man’s body.”

A few of those suing were part of a “harem” of men who accompanied Burton throughout the day and were known as “Burton’s Boys.”

Burton told them “they are not sleeping with a man but an angel,” according to the lawsuit.

Between 2002 and 2005, the Fellowship hosted “Lovefests” on Valentine’s Day. On those days, Burton attempted to have sex with 100 men a day, falling short and sexually assaulting “between 70-80” men during these events, the lawsuit states.

He continued to assault members for decades with few repercussions because the handful of sexual abuse allegations made against him were primarily internal and never curtailed his activities, the lawsuit alleges. A female staffer filed complaints with the FBI in 2015 and 2019, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided the Fellowship twice as part of an investigation into its use of religious visas.

Members who pressed the organization’s board and Burton about the alleged sexual misconduct were shunned and kicked out, according to the lawsuit.

Samuel Sanders, director of the Fellowship board, was excommunicated after he wrote an internal email to fellow board members in 1981. “Burton has over the years pursued and sodomized young men. He has used his position to seduce these young men,” Sanders wrote, according to the lawsuit. “Our omission, and it is one in the strictest sense, is allowing it to continue.”

The men behind the lawsuit said in court documents that they are suffering from a variety of ailments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol abuse and panic attacks.

“Because the abuse here was committed by a so-called spiritual leader and enabled by the organization, it was all the more insidious,” plaintiffs’ attorney Slater said.

The men have also struggled in personal and romantic relationships, according to the lawsuit, and are pushing for the opportunity to tell a jury about their experiences.",
411,,,"November shatters global temperature records, marking 6 record-warm months in a row",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-12-21/november-shatters-global-temperature-records,"The planet has experienced an astounding six-month run of record-breaking temperatures, including the hottest November on record, federal officials announced Thursday.

Global average temperatures last month were 2.59 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average — 0.68 degrees above the previous record from November 2015, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose records date back to 1850.

The planet also experienced its hottest autumn on record — September through November — and its hottest ever January through November.

“It is virtually certain, with one month remaining in the year, that 2023 will be the warmest year on record,” said Karin Gleason, monitoring section chief with the agency’s National Centers for Environmental Information.

Last month saw record-breaking temperatures on land and in the oceans, Gleason said. South America, Africa and Asia each had their warmest November on record, while North America saw its second-warmest November on record.

In the contiguous United States, the average temperature in November was 44 degrees, or 2.7 degrees above the average, marking the 19th warmest November on record, she said.

The warming is largely driven by a strengthening El Niño, the tropical Pacific climate pattern associated with hotter global temperatures. Its counterpart, La Niña, is associated with cooler temperatures and had been in place previously for several years.

The hotter climate pattern is enhancing the effects of human-caused global warming, experts say.

“The overall trajectory, or trend, is warming, and then you have these influences of which [El Niño] is a primary player,” Gleason said. “The strong El Niño kind of broke through the barrier, and we’re starting to see temperature anomalies that we really haven’t seen historically in the record.”

The news comes only weeks after world leaders gathered in Dubai for COP28, an annual United Nations climate conference, during which nearly 200 countries agreed for the first time to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels.

Officials stressed that transitioning away from such fuels is critical to preventing additional planetary warming.

“As long as greenhouse gas concentrations keep rising, we can’t expect different outcomes from those seen this year,” read a statement from Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service in Europe, which has also affirmed that this was the hottest November on record. “The temperature will keep rising and so will the impacts of heatwaves and droughts. Reaching net zero as soon as possible is an effective way to manage our climate risks.”

NOAA officials said the effects of this warming are already being felt around the globe. The first 11 months of 2023 rank the highest for the number of billion-dollar climate and weather disasters in the U.S., Gleason said.

So far, there have been 25 billion-dollar disasters this year — 5 more than the previous record set in 2020. They include devastating flooding in California from January through March; flooding in the Northeast in July and Hurricane Idalia in Florida in August.

The total cost of 2023 events now exceeds $81 billion, and they have resulted in at least 482 direct and indirect fatalities, Gleason said.

Warmer ocean temperatures have also contributed to an above-normal hurricane season, with 20 named storms in the Atlantic and 17 named storms in the eastern Pacific this year, according to Matt Rosencrans, a meteorologist with the NOAA Climate Prediction Center.

That includes August’s Hurricane Hilary, which brought the first issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings in California. Ocean temperatures in November were a record-breaking 1.8 degrees above normal for the month.

El Niño isn’t only associated with warmer global temperatures. The pattern is also associated with wetter conditions in California, and the storms coming into the state now are likely related to it, Rosencrans said.

“Going forward, the forecast is that El Niño is expected to continue through this Northern Hemisphere winter — with a robust El Niño, potentially of historical strength,” he said. There is a 54% chance of a historically strong El Niño during the November through January season.

The impacts of that could include an enhanced southern storm track, which may affect Southern California as well as the Gulf region and the Southwest U.S., Rosencrans said. Long-term forecasts favor above-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures in California in January, Februrary and March.

However, the conditions this year have had at least one benefit for the Golden State, which was declared drought-free in November for the first time since 2020.

But the overall trends remain concerning, said Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, which also declared record warmth this year.

“We cannot return to the climate of the 20th century, but we must act now to limit the risks of an increasingly inhospitable climate in this and the coming centuries,” Taalas wrote in an update at the end of November.

“Greenhouse gas levels are record high. Global temperatures are record high. Sea level rise is record high. Antarctic sea ice is record low,” he said. “It’s a deafening cacophony of broken records.”",
412,,,Falling mortgage rates lend a helping hand to home buyers,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/falling-mortgage-rates-lend-a-helping-hand-to-home-buyers,"Mortgage rates fell for the eighth consecutive week, giving cash-strapped home buyers some relief as the new year approaches.

The average interest rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage clocked in at 6.67% for the week ended Dec. 20, down from 6.95% a week earlier, according to data released Thursday by mortgage giant Freddie Mac. As recently as late October, rates were 7.79% — the highest in more than two decades.

The drop in borrowing cost saves new buyers hundreds of dollars each month, but experts said consumers shouldn’t expect drastic improvement in 2024.

The interest rate on mortgages changes based on a variety of factors, including inflation expectations and Federal Reserve policy.

Keith Gumbinger, vice president of research firm HSH.com, predicted rates will bottom out around 6.4% in 2024 as economic growth and inflation remain elevated enough to prevent further declines in borrowing costs.

“Cheaper mortgage money doesn’t necessarily mean that cheap mortgage money is coming,” Gumbinger said. “If you really want the lowest possible interest rates, you really have to hope for the most horrific economic climate.”

Rates have fallen since October, however, in large part because multiple economic reports have signaled inflation is slowing.

The most recent decline comes after the Federal Reserve signaled last week it may be done raising its benchmark interest rate, which helps set a floor on all types of borrowing costs, including mortgage rates.

For prospective homeowners, housing remains drastically more expensive than when rates were 3% and below during the early part of the pandemic. But the decline from 7.79% to 6.67%, equals $486 in monthly savings for a $800,000 home, assuming a buyer puts 20% down.

What effect somewhat lower mortgage rates will have on the housing market depends on how buyers and sellers react.

When mortgage rates first surged in 2022, home prices fell in response as buyers quickly pulled away and inventory swelled. But prices started rising again this year as well-heeled first time buyers returned and existing homeowners increasingly chose not to sell, unwilling to give up their rock-bottom mortgage rates on loans taken out before or during the pandemic.

In most counties, home prices are near their all-time peaks, while in Orange County, prices are setting new records, according to data from Zillow.

Jordan Levine, chief economist with the California Assn. of Realtors, said rates likely will end 2024 in the “low-6% range,” which should convince more existing homeowners to sell.

But he said the increase in supply isn’t likely to be enough to offset an increase in buyers who will also be lured by lower borrowing costs. As a result, Levine said the market may actually be more competitive in 2024, with prices up around 8% by year’s end in Southern California.

A recent forecast from Zillow predicted values would be flat to down slightly in Southern California between November 2023 and November 2024.

Zillow senior economist Nicole Bachaud said falling rates could mean home price growth comes in stronger than that forecast, but maybe not.

“Given the affordability crisis in Los Angeles, we might see sellers move before buyers have enough room in their budgets to respond,” she said.",
413,,,"Huntington Beach to add new monthly celebrations, remove others like Black History Month",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/huntington-beach-to-add-new-monthly-celebrations-remove-others-like-black-history-month,"The Huntington Beach Fourth of July Host Band marches up Main Street during this year’s Fourth of July parade.

February’s city theme for Huntington Beach will be “We Love Our Libraries” in 2024, while the city will make no mention of Black History Month.

In June, the city theme will be focused on the history of Independence Day, but the city will not be recognizing (LGBTQ+) Pride Month.

The City Council voted 4-3 on Tuesday night to approve a 12-month calendar that will see each month dedicated to a specific theme but would remove other familiar months from the recognition list.

The item, introduced by Mayor Gracey Van Der Mark, Mayor Pro Tem Pat Burns and Councilman Casey McKeon, states that it is designed to honor the rich historic heritage of the country, state and Surf City itself. Each month’s theme will highlight significant events, landmarks and influential figures.

Tony Strickland voted to approve the item, while Dan Kalmick, Natalie Moser and Rhonda Bolton all voted “no.”

McKeon said that over the past year, city archivist and historian Kathie Schey has sent him about 20 chronological photos of the history of Huntington Beach that he has hanging in his council office.

“Myself, as a third-generation Huntington Beach resident, I’ve just been amazed to learn how much of our rich history that I was unaware of, and I can only imagine that the majority of our residents are unaware of as well,” McKeon said. “That was essentially the genesis for this calendar of historically themed months ... the monthly celebrations [now] are fragmented, inconsistent and relatively unorganized within the departments.”

But Schey, earlier in the meeting during public comments, said she would be resigning as the chair of the historic resources board and as member of the design review board in protest of the item. Another seven- to nine-member committee would be created to decide the calendar of events for each year, which she saw as usurping the power of the historic resources board.

“I think it’s a pretty thinly veiled, stinging vote of no confidence both in my role as a historian and leadership of the historic resources board,” Schey said. “The members of that board include a history professor, two history authors, two of the great-grandsons of our first mayor ... and this is unfair to them.”

The item states the committee could be assisted by the historic resources board or city staff, as needed. McKeon said the board was not consulted before the item was put on the agenda, though he did have a conversation with Schey over the weekend.

Monthly themes for 2024, as proposed and amended Tuesday, include celebrating the city’s origins and remembrance of the Holocaust in January, California’s history in March and the history of Huntington Beach’s railroad in April. But the item also states that any previous monthly themes or celebrations approved by earlier City Councils would be repealed and superseded.

These federally recognized celebrations include Black History Month, Women’s History Month in March and Pride Month in June, among others. May is Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, and Hispanic Heritage Month runs from mid-September to mid-October.

The item states that the new Huntington Beach celebrations are intended to be “free of any identity politics and political agendas.”

Kalmick questioned both the item itself and why the previously approved celebrations need to be disregarded.

“This is not public policy,” he said. “This is an Eagle Scout project. This is what we all learned in fourth grade and 10th grade and 11th grade. I do apologize if you didn’t know some of these things; a lot of folks in town do ... So, February of 2024 we’re not going to celebrate Black History Month. Why not?”

McKeon said the previous themed months could be added back in future years.

“This is meant to be a fun exercise that brings the community together,” he said. “You’re totally over-complicating it.”

Moser, who has a bachelor’s degree in history from Cal State Long Beach, said that presenting a comprehensive historical narrative is complex, and she cautioned against over-simplification or inadvertent sanitizing of the past.

“I love history and I want us to know more about history, [but] our immediate role as council members is to prioritize the needs of the community that directly impact them,” she said.

Don Han is the director of community partnerships for Groundswell, formerly known as OC Human Relations. He said he had been working to support the Huntington Beach Human Relations Task Force/Committee, which the council voted to ax over the summer, since 2005.

“It is kind of disheartening to see that the nationally recognized heritage months are being removed from the city of Huntington Beach,” Han said Wednesday. “The history of Huntington Beach is the history of these people. If Huntington Beach wants to continue to celebrate its diversity, it has to embrace and be inclusive of all people, so that they feel that they belong. Removing the Black History Month celebration, imagine if you identify as a Black person in that community, to see your city’s elected officials say, ‘We’re not going to recognize you and your history.’ That can be disheartening.”

State Sen. Dave Min also released a statement that was highly critical of the item.

Burns said that the federally recognized months were already well known and being celebrated.

“Just not in Huntington Beach,” Kalmick said.",

Los Angeles County firefighters responding to a garage fire at a Lancaster area home on Wednesday found the body of a woman stuffed inside the trunk of a burned-out car.

Firefighters responded to the fire on 38th Street West in the Quartz Hill neighborhood just after 8 a.m., quickly extinguishing the blaze, according to Ed Pickett, supervising fire dispatcher at the Los Angeles County Fire Department.

Crews searched the garage and discovered the woman’s body inside the trunk of the car, Pickett said. The investigation was then turned over to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Details about the woman’s identity, whether she lived in the home and how she may have died were not immediately available. A report from KCAL-TV news said the woman was an elementary school teacher in Palmdale.

Google’s lobbying skyrockets

Speaking of watchdog journalism, tech policy reporter Queenie Wong recently dug into Google’s lobbying reports and discovered that the search giant spent a record amount lobbying in California this year.

Why? Mainly to fund an ad campaign attempting to kill legislation that would force Google, Facebook and other large online platforms to pay news publishers for articles displayed on their sites.

Google’s payment to a taxpayers group for the advertising made up most of the record $1.5 million the company spent lobbying in California from January to September, Wong reports . During the same period last year, Google spent $187,434. The company spends an average of about $257,000 per year lobbying in California, according to her review of data from 2005-22.

The massive surge reflects the growing efforts by tech companies to influence California lawmakers as they debate how to protect young people and journalists and other workers from the threats posed by social media sites, artificial intelligence and other emerging technology.

Will Trump get dumped from the ballot?

California Democrats are hoping a court decision disqualifying former President Trump from the Colorado primary ballot will help them strike him from California’s Republican primary.

Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, sent a letter this week to California Secretary of State Shirley Weber urging her “to explore every legal option” to remove Trump from the March 5 ballot because of his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, writes politics reporter Noah Bierman .

“This decision is about honoring the rule of law in our country and protecting the fundamental pillars of democracy,” she wrote, citing the Colorado Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision to exclude Trump from that state’s ballot.

Though it’s expected that the U.S. Supreme Court will wind up weighing in with a ruling that could effect many states, several — including California — are facing a time crunch to get ballots prepared for the March 5 primary.

Weber, who oversees elections in California, already released a preliminary list of likely candidates that includes Trump. She plans to mail a certified list of candidates to county elections officials Dec. 28 so that they can begin printing ballots. Although ballots could be amended later, changing them gets harder — and more expensive — as the election date draws nearer, Bierman reports .

417,,,Column: Who will make sure L.A. reaches 100% clean energy by 2035?,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2023-12-21/column-who-will-make-sure-l-a-reaches-100-clean-energy-by-2035-boiling-point,"Then-L.A. Department of Water and Power board member Aura Vasquez applauds during a news conference outside DWP headquarters in February 2019, during which then-Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the agency wouldn’t spend billions of dollars rebuilding three gas-fired power plants along the coast.

Few people have a more important role to play in confronting the climate crisis than the head of the L.A. Department of Water and Power.

Although DWP is best known for its history of shady water grabs — as memorialized in the film “Chinatown” — it’s also a hugely influential player in the energy world. The agency drew international attention when it concluded it would be able to power the nation’s second-largest city with 100% climate-friendly electricity by 2035. Its early investments in large-scale solar power, green hydrogen and other clean energy technologies presaged similar moves by power companies across the country.

So if you care about limiting the deadly heat waves, destructive wildfires and other harms of global warming, you should care that Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is looking for a new general manager for DWP.

Marty Adams, the current head honcho, announced over the summer that he would retire in early February. His successor will lead DWP through a crucial period in the clean energy transition, during which the city will hopefully show the world it’s possible to dramatically reduce our use of planet-warming fossil fuels — without prompting widespread blackouts or causing electricity prices to soar out of control.

But some climate advocates are concerned that the Bass administration has done little to solicit public input on the next general manager. They’re also worried that DWP may not be as committed to 100% clean energy by 2035 as it once was.

Teresa Cheng, a Sierra Club staffer who follows the agency closely, told me city officials have made hardly any public statements about the search for the next general manager. That’s especially problematic, she said, because DWP’s next leader will play a key role in determining not only whether L.A. meets its clean energy goals but whether it does so equitably. That means low-income families and people of color saving money and breathing cleaner air in their neighborhoods.

“We really haven’t seen any public information about this search,” Cheng said.

I reached out to a representative for the mayor’s office late last week, mentioning the transparency concerns I’d heard from climate activists and asking whether Bass would do more to publicize the search process and give members of the public an opportunity to weigh in. Lo and behold, on Monday afternoon Bass’ office sent out a press release announcing that city officials have been working with a private firm to conduct a national search for DWP’s next leader.

The agency’s general manager “is critical in ensuring equitable service, safety and reliability in Los Angeles as well as helping us achieve the city’s collective goal of 100% clean energy by 2035,” Bass said in the press release.

Is phasing out fossil fuels still a top priority for the mayor and her appointees, though?

That question has been on my mind because of a letter sent by DWP to state officials a few weeks ago, requesting changes to a document drafted by the California Energy Commission. DWP asked the commission to strike a reference to the city’s “goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035” and instead refer to a “goal of 100 percent clean electricity” — sans the 2035 date.

The idea of ending the combustion of coal and natural gas for electricity has long been seen by climate scientists and activists as a necessary first step toward limiting global warming. The sooner we can transition the electric grid to solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, the sooner we can power our cars, trucks and home heating systems with clean energy.

Until recently, U.S. politicians were focused on switching to renewable energy by mid-century. California’s 100% clean electricity law, passed five years ago, included a 2045 deadline. Since then, nearly a dozen states have adopted similar timelines.

But with the world breaking temperature record after temperature record — and floods, storms and droughts getting worse — climate scientists and activists have increasingly argued we must move faster to ditch fossil fuels.

Following their lead, President Biden campaigned on a national target of 100% clean energy by 2035. DWP joined the party a few years later, concluding after extensive study with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory that L.A. can reach 98% clean energy by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Then-Mayor Eric Garcetti quickly endorsed that timeline, as did the City Council.

“This should encourage California to see that it’s achievable everywhere. If the biggest city in the state with the largest municipal utility in the country can do this, you can do it too,” Garcetti said at the time.

So when I pointed out to L.A. City Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky — a vocal renewable energy supporter — that DWP seemed to be backtracking on its 2035 commitment in the letter sent to state officials, she was none too happy.

“The City Council and Mayor have been clear about our commitment to reaching 100% clean energy by 2035 and have communicated this clearly and frequently to DWP,” Yaroslavsky said in a written statement. “Any effort by DWP staff to undermine this direction is infuriating and unacceptable. I fully expect the department to correct their filing.”

That’s exactly what happened. By the time I received Yaroslavsky’s statement, in fact, a DWP spokesperson had emailed me an updated version of the agency’s letter that reaffirmed rather than excised the promise to pursue 100% by 2035.

A spokesperson for the mayor’s office, meanwhile, pointed me to a recent news conference during which Bass touted her climate accomplishments, including securing federal funds that she said would help the city hit 100% clean energy by 2035.

“We’re cleaning up our power grid, building new zero-emission transit and transportation options and addressing climate and environmental justice issues, and creating a more climate-resilient water supply,” Bass said.

So is this all a giant nothingburger? Or should we be concerned that L.A.’s climate leadership is slipping?

The answer may depend on DWP’s general manager.

Running the Department of Water and Power is a notoriously tough job — and one that some recent occupants have only made more difficult for themselves. Marcie Edwards stepped down after two-plus years as general manager amid reports of customer dissatisfaction. Her successor, David Wright, was sentenced to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to bribery.

Adams, to his credit, will be leaving DWP after five and a half years at the helm, and four decades overall.

In an bulletin to DWP staff announcing his retirement, Adams said the agency finds itself at a “pivotal point as we see the critical importance of the Department’s role in creating the future of Los Angeles in a time of great economic and social need.”

“I am very excited for the next generation of employees and leaders who will carry this agency, and this City, into a bright new future,” he said.

Those employees and leaders will have difficult questions to answer on the road to 100% clean energy.

Some climate activists are frustrated by DWP’s plan to convert several power plants from burning fossil gas to hydrogen — a top priority for the politically powerful labor unions whose members operate those plants, but a nonstarter for environmental justice groups who worry that hydrogen combustion would lead to continued air pollution in low-income communities of color.

More broadly, DWP will need to make sure its clean energy programs bring proportionate benefits to low-income families and communities of color — which they historically have not, according to a recent report commissioned by the utility.

I’ll be watching closely as Bass chooses the city’s next energy boss. If you hear anything, let me know.

And if you want to weigh in? The mayor’s office isn’t offering any formal venues for public engagement. But Bass’ spokesperson told me the best way to provide input is via public comment at DWP board meetings and City Council meetings.

Whatever happens next, keep paying attention after the mayor makes her choice. We’ve got a long way to go.

On that note, here’s what’s happening around the West:

ENERGY POLITICS

The state Capitol in Sacramento, seen in 2014. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)

How have Big Oil and Big Labor made it so difficult to pass aggressive climate laws in California? This story by CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and Jeremia Kimelman does a great job breaking down the partnership between the two political heavyweights — and the campaign dollars they use to sway lawmakers. And if you’re wondering why last year’s law seeking to limit alleged price-gouging by oil companies — which Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed through the Legislature over industry opposition — hasn’t led to lower gasoline prices yet, E&E News’ Anne C. Mulkern has an explanation.

“A quarter of California households reported being unable to pay their utility bills in October.” So writes KQED’s Vanessa Rancaño in this story, which illuminates the crisis of rising electricity rates — and how it can fuel homelessness. Her reporting is a valuable reminder that if we want to transition our homes from planet-warming gas heaters and stovetops to electric appliances, we need to keep electricity costs down. Speaking of which, Grist’s Akielly Hu has a good rundown of what cities are doing to try to get gas appliances out of homes and businesses, following a court ruling striking down Berkeley’s ban on gas hookups.

That’s the ballgame: California’s Diablo Canyon nuclear plant will be allowed to keep running past 2025. Federal officials have accepted Pacific Gas & Electric’s application to renew the plant’s license, clearing the way for PG&E to continue generating climate-friendly electricity at Diablo beyond a planned 2025 shutdown date, Mackenzie Shuman reports for the San Luis Obispo Tribune. The federal decision was a victory for Newsom, who — as I’ve reported previously — has fought to keep the plant open through at least 2030, arguing that it’s become a crucial tool for keeping the lights on without fossil fuels.

HOW WE GET AROUND

Less groundwater pumping and more reliable high-paying jobs are good — but truck traffic spewing toxic air pollution and heat-trapping emissions, not so much. That’s the tension at the heart of this fascinating story by my L.A. Times colleague Rebecca Plevin, about the warehouse boom getting underway in California’s San Joaquin Valley. “Unlike the Inland Empire, where warehouses have moved in at tremendous cost to densely packed neighborhoods, the valley offers open space, cheap land and workers eager to exchange backbreaking farm labor for a different kind of toil, indoors,” Rebecca writes.

Remember all those electric car chargers Volkswagen built as part of a legal settlement to make up for its emissions-cheating scheme? Customers say they work terribly. That’s according to this piece by the Washington Post’s Shannon Osaka, which notes that Volkswagen’s Electrify America fast-charging network ranked last in a recent customer satisfaction study.

The decline of intercity bus terminals is a slow-burning public transit crisis — and one I knew nothing about until I read this great story by CNN’s Nathaniel Meyersohn. Not only is it getting harder to travel across the U.S. by bus, noted journalism industry villain Alden Global Capital is partly to blame. The New York-based hedge fund — which has bought newspapers across the country and cut them to the bone — is purchasing bus terminals and selling them to real estate developers.

AROUND THE WEST

The weed killer paraquat is banned in 50 countries — but not California. Some people who have used it say they’re suffering from Parkinson’s disease as a result, and there’s lots of science suggesting they may be right, The Times’ Hayley Smith reports.

“People can also change. They can learn to live within the limits of the planet, to heed the warnings written in wood.” So write the Washington Post’s Sarah Kaplan, Bonnie Jo Mount, Emily Wright and Frank Hulley-Jones, in a gorgeous story focused on a scientist studying ancient Sonoran Desert tree rings in an effort to learn from the past what humanity’s future may hold.

After years of preparation, there are wolves on Colorado’s Western Slope again. The Colorado Sun’s Jason Blevins was there to watch their reintroduction by state wildlife officials. “The wolf loped through the snowy meadow into a copse of aspens, her fur blending with the browns, grays and whites of the remote corner of state land,” he wrote. “She turned for a moment to look back at the collection of about 45 people gathered around the crates before trotting into the forest.”

ONE MORE THING

I wrote last week about a lawsuit brought by several environmental groups seeking to overturn the California Public Utilities Commission’s decision to slash rooftop solar incentives. The state’s 1st District Court of Appeal released its ruling Wednesday, upholding the large cuts to solar incentives — despite some reservations from Presiding Justice Alison Tucher.

“The issue before the court today is, as the majority notes, not whether the Commission has chosen the best possible” method for compensating homes with rooftop solar panels, Tucher wrote in a concurring opinion, supporting the other two judges even as she wondered whether their ruling would lead to the best possible outcome. “Rather, we are asked simply to decide whether the Commission has chosen a course that complies with the law and is reasonably supported by the evidence.”

Donald Trump just might win the presidency next year. Former L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva is again running for higher office — he thinks he has a chance to dethrone L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn — instead of hiding in his man cave in La Habra Heights for the rest of his life like any other humiliated human would.

*In-N-Out announces a new location on Neptune — not the avenue in Wilmington but the planet. Fans from California to Tennessee to whatever world Rob Schneider is from wait in a line that stretches to the Asteroid Belt, only to find out that In-N-Out is as overrated in the outer rungs of the solar system as it is on Earth.

At his victory party, De León vows to supporters that he’ll never, ever, pinky swear, cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die-stick-a-needle-in-my-eye run for higher office while councilmember — a promise he’s broken before. A day later, he announces write-in candidacies for president, U.S. Senate, Congress, his old Assembly district, L.A. County district attorney, L.A. County Superior Court judge and treasurer of the We Love L.A. Book Club that meets at the Eagle Rock Branch Library. De León loses each race.

419,,,"Historic, ‘genuinely extraordinary’ rainfall in Ventura County stuns experts, causes flooding",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/timeline-when-will-worst-of-rains-hit-l-a-what-are-the-flood-risks,"Michael Ramirez, owner of the El Mirage barbershop, sweeps away water that flooded his business overnight in Port Hueneme.

Ventura County was inundated Thursday with what forecasters described as a once-in-a-millennium rainfall that stunned experts and brought flooding to roadways and homes in several communities.

Preliminary data suggest that Oxnard experienced one of the heaviest downpours ever seen in the area, with rainfall rates of 3 inches an hour sustained for over an hour.

That amounts to a month’s worth of rain in less than an hour, officials said.

“The frequency of this kind of event is on the order of once in every thousand years,” meteorologist Mike Wofford with the National Weather Service in Oxnard said of the storm. In addition to the deluge in Oxnard, more than 1.54 inches of rain fell on the Ventura Auto Center in 15 minutes.

Other experts agreed the downpour was one for the record books.

“This is likely the heaviest rainfall that has been observed in this area in recorded history and is likely a multi-centennial kind of event,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA, said during a briefing Thursday. “These are genuinely extraordinary torrential downpours and importantly, they’re continuing. This is not over yet.”

Fire officials in Ventura County reported that 911 dispatchers received more than 275 calls for help over a five-hour period as floodwaters rose in the coastal communities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard.

Bob Myers woke up around 1:45 a.m. to the sound of rushing water outside his home in the Hueneme Bay senior community.

“I thought some pipes had blown up or something,” he said. He checked his restroom but didn’t see anything. Then he looked out his back door and found water rushing into his home “like someone was standing there with a fire hose,” Myers said. When he looked out his window, he saw a lake of water.

Eventually, firefighters arrived to help Myers and his neighbors get out of their homes as the water began to recede.

“There is nothing livable left in my home,” Myers said Thursday as he sat in a Red Cross emergency shelter at Oxnard College. Between 3 and 4 feet of water had entered the home, pushing appliances and furniture around soaked walls.

Myers was at a loss about what his next steps will be.

“I am an unfortunate one. I have no family in this state. I have no family closer than the East Coast,” he said. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do.”

Before he retired, he said, he worked for a utilities company. His job was to respond to natural disasters and to help cut off the flow of gas.

He used to be on the other side of the equation, but now he’s one of the survivors of a natural disaster.

“But you don’t realize the full impact of what does it mean to lose your house, the bedroom your children grew up in, your documents, your pictures of your parents from 50, 60, 70 years ago that cannot be replaced because you didn’t experience it,” he said.

Mud and debris tumbled into roadways in Santa Barbara, closing at least one offramp on the 101 Freeway. Elsewhere, cars were surrounded by rushing water that appeared to be several feet deep.

UPDATE: The US 101 southbound off-ramp is closed at Garden Street in Santa Barbara. Video shows current conditions at Mission Street.

The amount of rain is akin to that which preceded devastating debris flows in Montecito in 2018, experts said, though that incident was also exacerbated by recent wildfires in the area.

Indeed, radar imagery shows powerful convective cells hovering over Santa Barbara, Ventura, Oxnard and Thousand Oaks that indicate torrential downpours with some lightning could persist for several more hours.

By midday, the storms were also beginning to develop a bit farther south, including portions of Los Angeles County, and were expected to crawl toward downtown L.A., the San Fernando Valley and coastal Orange County through the day.

Swain, the UCLA climate scientist, said the storm is a classic example of the kinds of extreme precipitation events that can be expected in a warming climate. The system arrived as federal officials confirmed that November was Earth’s hottest on record, and that 2023 is virtually certain to be the planet’s hottest year on record, due largely to El Niño and human-caused climate change.

“As the climate warms, we’re going to see heavier and heavier downpours, both in California and everywhere else,” Swain said, noting that the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water vapor increases exponentially with warming. “These are the kinds of rainfall rates that we can see these days.”

A flood watch is in effect across most of the region through late Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service.

Widespread flooding in the area is possible, and residents are advised to clear debris from rain gutters and waterways, use extra caution on roads and be prepared for possible power outages and downed trees, the NWS said.

The agency briefly issued tornado warnings for the Port Hueneme, Oxnard, El Rio, Saticoy and San Buenaventura areas just before 1:30 a.m. and again at 2:30 a.m., but there was no evidence a tornado had touched down, Wofford said. The agency issued multiple flash flood warnings just before 4 a.m. farther inland and special warnings for possible waterspouts and high winds near Point Mugu.

The tornado warnings were issued because meteorologists saw rotational winds on radar readings, Wofford said, and because it would be difficult to confirm what was developing in the sky that late at night.

Unlike other winter storms, the low-pressure system ambling its way along the coast is cut off from the Pacific jet stream and dropping torrential rains as it lingers in place.

“It’s not moving much, and it continues to send bands of rain into the area,” Wofford said. The storm was expected to hit Santa Barbara later in the day.

Officials in Ventura County urged people to be cautious after the storms. Emergency officials performed 12 swift water rescues, mainly for people trapped in submerged vehicles, Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andy VanSciver said.

Firefighters assisted 10 patients in flooded roadways, VanSciver said, but it’s unclear if there have been any injuries amid the rescues. About six to eight blocks of homes in the Hueneme Bay senior community were affected by floodwaters; emergency responders helped 20 people out of homes there. Some homes saw as much as 3 feet of water, VanSciver said, requiring emergency crews to use a heavy-duty medical vehicle to transport residents.

“The storm drains could not keep up with the rain,” VanSciver said.

Some of the homes in that area remain under an evacuation warning. An emergency shelter was established at the Oxnard College gymnasium, but other residents have been told to shelter in their homes while the floodwaters recede. Officials urged residents to stay home while roadways remain flooded on Thursday morning.

The overall effect from the rain is minimal, Santa Barbara County Fire spokesperson Scott Safechuck said. For nearly two days, it’s rained over Santa Barbara County and the storm is expected to linger through Friday.

But creeks and rivers in the area continue to flow and rescue crews have not been called to pull anyone out of the waters.

“In general the public is being very responsible to our warnings, when we tell them not to drive if you don’t have to and avoid flooded roadways,” Safechuck said.

County emergency responders have taken a proactive approach to torrential downpours ever since 2018, when a strong rainstorm caused a series of mud and debris flows to sweep over the community of Montecito. In total, 23 people died from the flow that left a 15-foot wall of mud and debris in its wake. Emergency officials maintain a steady line of communication with residents to ensure their safety.

“We’ve experienced heavy rains before. The Montecito debris flow was a devastating episode,” Safechuck said. “It’s something we think about every time it rains.”

The rain station at the remote Rocky Butte summit, about a mile east of Hearst Castle in San Luis Obispo County, received 15.72 inches of rain over a five-day period starting Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.

The station’s rain total is not indicative of the surrounding areas that saw far less rainfall total, NWS meteorologist Ryan Kittell said.

The rain station at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo received 3.78 inches over the same period, and a station in Atascadero recorded 4.09 inches .

The storm is expected to push its way toward Los Angeles County throughout Thursday and will bring heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms through Friday afternoon, according to the weather service. Forecasts show 1 to 3 inches of rain in the forecast for Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties, with 3 to 5 inches in the mountains and foothills.

Meanwhile, the National Weather Service in Las Vegas issued a flash flood watch for southern San Bernardino County and southwest Mohave County through Friday night. Meteorologists forecast three-quarters of an inch to 1.50 inches of rain for the region, warning drivers to avoid low-water crossings.

Rain showers were expected to increase overnight on Thursday in Orange and San Bernardino counties. Snow levels were expected to drop to 6,500 to 7,000 feet early Friday, with a winter advisory in effect for the mountain areas and instructions for drivers to take snow chains.

What is the forecast?

The National Weather Service said there was a moderate risk of flooding mostly in coastal Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties as well as the Santa Monica Mountains. There were also concerns about mountain ranges along the coast in Ventura and Santa Barbara.

Though this storm is massive, it will move slowly. And that could cause heavy rain, thunderstorms and flooding on roadways and creeks.

What will the next few days look like?

Thursday: Heavy showers, chance of thunderstorms in some areas.

Friday: Moderate showers.

Saturday: Light showers, with moderate rain in some inland valleys, giving way to partly cloudy skies and strong winds.

Sunday: Partly cloudy, giving way to slightly warmer temperatures and sun.

Monday: (Christmas Day): Slightly warmer.

What conditions are expected?

The weather service issued a special marine weather warning for the Central Coast on Wednesday morning due to the potential for waterspouts and strong winds. There was a slight chance that the conditions would produce cause a tornado or waterspout between Point Conception in Santa Barbara County and Los Angeles County, according to the forecast.

A flood watch in in effect for most of Southern California. Residents in San Luis Obispo, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties should be on the lookout for debris flows, flash flooding, general flooding and overflowing rivers, the weather service said.

Areas along the Santa Ynez and Santa Monica coastal ranges could see rainfall rates of an inch an hour Wednesday and Thursday from isolated thunderstorms. Other areas could expect to see 0.30 to 0.60 of an inch of rain per hour.

The storm could dump 2 to 5 inches of rain in coastal areas and up to 12 inches in coastal mountains.

What does the weather service advise?

The storm is expected to bring flooding for most of the region through Thursday, according to the weather service, which cautioned drivers to avoid roads that appear to be underwater.

“Rain may be locally heavy at times, and numerous floods are likely,” the weather service said in its social media channels. “Flash and urban flooding are expected, and debris/mud flows will be possible. Turn around, don’t drown!”",
420,,,Pro-Palestinian UC students feel they are not supported. Some on the faculty are organizing to change that,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/uc-faculty-launch-unprecedented-organizing-drive-to-aid-campus-supporters-of-palestinians,"University of California faculty members across the system have launched an unprecedented organizing effort to defend campus advocates for Palestinian rights who feel unsupported after reporting widespread harassment and threats triggered by the Israel-Hamas war.

The effort to form Faculty for Justice in Palestine groups is part of a national movement that has taken off at nine of the 10 UC campuses, along with Princeton, New York University and Rutgers, among others. Faculty organizers said they were propelled to act by what many described as a singularly dangerous time for academic freedom and free speech, with the lives, careers and safety of campus Palestinian supporters on the line.

“I feel we’re at an inflection point,” said Ananya Roy, a UCLA professor of urban studies, social welfare and geography who is helping lead efforts at her campus to form a Faculty for Justice in Palestine group. “Folks are so alarmed by the calls for repression that we suddenly are seeing a real sense of urgency to have these formations in place.”

The organizing effort comes as Israel supporters said Jewish students on campuses across the nation have been subjected to hostile rhetoric against them and have experienced acts of escalating antisemitism. Many Israel supporters criticize the Students for Justice in Palestine campus group for what they regard as threatening actions. The student organization was recently suspended until the end of fall term by Columbia University for violating school policy leading to an “unauthorized event” that included “threatening rhetoric and intimidation,” according to a campus statement.

Yet faculty organizers say Palestinian supporters — whose large numbers on campuses nationwide are fueling robust activism — need the help to counterbalance better funded and organized pro-Israel campus groups that provide safe spaces. They say longstanding organizations, such as Hillel, and Israel studies centers, can swiftly mobilize to support Jewish students, along with a network of outside Israel defense groups that closely monitor perceived acts of antisemitism and move to combat them.

The result, argued Saree Makdisi, a UCLA English professor, is stronger blowback against pro-Palestinian students and faculty members — losing jobs or getting doxxed on such online blacklists as Canary Mission — than their pro-Israel peers.

At UCLA, junior faculty members have reported being criticized by senior members for including Palestinian voices in their course materials. One student said she burst into tears after feeling shut down in a class for defending Palestinian rights. An “emergency teach-in” on the crisis in the Gaza Strip led by Makdisi and other Palestinian supporters was moved online due to safety concerns. But students who gathered in a campus hallway to watch said they were verbally assaulted by young men who accosted them, screamed that they were terrorists and threw their laptops in a trash can. And a UCLA professor drew widespread criticism over reports that she required students to attend the teach-in — rumors that turned out to be false, according to a campus statement.

Makdisi and others say they hope that collective organizing — especially by faculty members with the privileges and protection of tenure — will strengthen their ability to protect vulnerable students and colleagues, expand teaching about the conflict and demand equal treatment for their concerns from campus leaders. Already, their voices have ramped up intense back-and-forth debate on campus and amplified their demands to the university administration.

Judea Pearl, a UCLA computer science professor who has led pro-Israel activism on campus, said he “of course” had no objection to the faculty forming support groups for Palestinian supporters. He said pro-Israel campus members also formed a support group last week, the UCLA Jewish Faculty Resilience Group of faculty and staff members, students and alumni to “counter rising Jew-hatred on campus and in the UC system, support Jewish students and faculty, and promote Western democratic values.”

He added, however, that “being ‘pro-Palestinians’ does not justify being anti-Israel or pro-Hamas” — calling the militant group’s ideology a “moral abomination.”

Colleges and universities nationwide have erupted in acrimony and tension since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war. On Oct. 7, Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostage, according to the Israeli government. Israel’s bombardment and ground war in Hamas-ruled Gaza has killed almost 20,000 people, according to health authorities in the Palestinian territory, and set off a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The United Nations estimates the war has displaced nearly 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents.

As the war intensified, a U.S.-based Palestinian support network that advocates nonviolent academic and cultural boycotts of Israel issued a call for campuses to form Faculty for Justice in Palestine groups. Three universities had already established such groups, including UC Davis and the University of Hawaii. The war fallout rapidly accelerated the movement. So far, more than 65 chapters have started up or are forming, a network representative said.

The campus climate is particularly fraught at UCLA. Supporters of Israel and Palestinians have faced-off in dueling rallies and faculty groups aligned with each side have pummeled Chancellor Gene Block and senior leadership with letters demanding action to calm the campus climate.

More than 350 faculty supporters of Israel have signed a letter urging Block to denounce any campus celebrations of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and hold “accountable” student groups and community members who cross the line from free speech to “incitement.” The letter said explicit calls for violence should trigger a campus response. As an example, the letter cited event advertisements featuring weapons and rally chants of “intifada,” an Arabic word that in the Palestinian context means uprising or rebellion against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.

Roy, of the Faculty for Justice in Palestine group, said that letter represented a “chilling moment of repression” that was endorsed by some influential department leaders with the power to short-circuit the future of students and untenured faculty who don’t agree with it. In their own counter-letter to Block, Roy and more than 280 faculty members said the pro-Israel demands were “so broad and overreaching as to make any activity — including teaching and research that supports even the most basic Palestinian human rights — punishable.”

“Such a stance is entirely against the mission of a public university, which is to protect critical education, pedagogy, and knowledge production guided by fidelity to truth, intellectual and methodological rigor, and a commitment to centering the experiences and narratives of all communities who bear the material impacts of systemic violence and oppression,” the letter said.

Pearl, who spearheaded the pro-Israel letter, dismissed such concerns. He said he was not aiming to quash speech, but believed Block should denounce any support for violence — a demand reiterated by the new Jewish support group. Pearl also said allegations of bias against Muslims and Arabs were overblown, saying criticism of them is immediately attacked as Islamophobia and racism.

“Who denies anyone the right to declare solidarity with Palestinians? No one!” Pearl said.

UCLA declined to respond to questions from The Times about whether Block and senior leadership regarded chants of “intifada” and other pro-Palestinian slogans as incitement that should trigger campus action.

In a letter to Pearl and other faculty signers, Block said “the speech and expression we have seen thus far does not meet the First Amendment standard for incitement.” He reiterated that “discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding.”

To ease safety concerns, UCLA spokesman Ricardo Vazquez said campus police were conducting additional patrols and had “added security resources.” Police and student affairs monitors were dispatched to events “to defuse possible tensions while protecting participants’ right to speak,” he said.

Vazquez encouraged campus members to report allegations of crimes to UC campus police and unlawful harassment or discrimination to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Civil Rights Office.

But some students said they were hesitant to report incidents because they don’t trust UC administration.

One UCLA student, who asked to be identified only by his first name Mohammad for fear of retaliation, said he has been spit on in his face and called a terrorist while wearing his kaffiyeh checked scarf. A friend was pepper-sprayed near the campus sculpture garden by an assailant who quickly ran away, Mohammad said, and another student was jumped by two young men, suffering a wrist fracture, while walking from campus residences. Mohammad said the incidents have not yet been reported to campus authorities but students planned to do so after compiling more reports.

The constant tension has led him to lose sleep, take up smoking for the first time and neglect his diet. He worries about getting doxxed so makes sure to encrypt his messages, hide his meeting sites and shield the identities of his fellow activists. Yet he pushes on with protest rallies, “die-ins” to portray Palestinian deaths and other visible advocacy.

“I’ve never been in this place of this stress before,” Mohammad said. “But we’re trying to take up visual space and make sure that faculty and the student body are all aware that the student presence on campus advocating for Palestinian solidarity is strong and unrelenting.”

Nationwide, complaints of harassment on both sides have skyrocketed in the last few months.

Palestine Legal, a Chicago-based nonprofit, has seen a tenfold increase in campus requests for help since the Israel-Hamas war began. The organization, which provides legal assistance in support of the Palestinian solidarity movement, received 449 requests for aid between Oct. 7 and Dec. 13 this year, compared with 40 requests last year.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, received 2,171 complaints of bias between Oct. 7 and Dec. 2, a 172% increase over the same period last year. First Amendment issues made up the largest category. The organization’s Greater Los Angeles office received 124 complaints of bias or requests for help specifically related to Palestinians or the violence in Gaza from Oct. 7 to Nov. 30.

Jewish students and faculty members also have experienced rising harassment. The Anti-Defamation League reported last week that it recorded 400 antisemitic incidents on college and university campuses between Oct. 7 and Dec. 7, compared with 33 during the same period in 2022. The ADL included campus rallies in the count, saying they involved “antisemitic rhetoric, expressions of support for terrorism against the state of Israel and/or anti-Zionism.”

Nour Joudah, a UCLA assistant professor of Asian American studies, said she is joining Faculty for Justice in Palestine to support students on campus experiencing harassment while they organize for a cease-fire and push its demand that UC not conflate criticism of Israel with antisemitism.

Joudah — who said she has lost more than 50 members of her extended family as a result of the Israeli bombardment — said she also hoped the group would influence UC leaders to speak out more even-handedly by decrying the mounting civilian deaths of Palestinians as they recognized the Israeli victims of the Hamas attack.

“I hesitate to center my emotions, and yet it’s undeniable that the actions of the UC administration both at UCLA and statewide have made me feel for the first time just how little value my life and the lives of my family hold in their eyes,” Joudah said.

UCLA declined to respond to questions over the perception that its statements were one-sided, whether criticism of Israel was antisemitic and why it had not publicly commented on the rising Palestinian deaths.

Vazquez said UCLA staff have been meeting with affected student groups and individuals to support their needs, provide resources, offer counseling and work with those who need academic accommodations.

Campus administrators, he added, have met with affected faculty members to discuss their concerns and issued a statement reiterating that personal views about the conflict should not influence the academic reviews of their peers. Makdisi said they have pledged to form a task force to address bias and harassment against Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs, which he viewed as an important step.

UCLA is developing other new initiatives to address antisemitism, Islamophobia and anti-Arab hate and would share them with the community soon, Vazquez said. UC President Michael Drake recently announced new UC systemwide actions focused on campus safety, civil rights, mental health, community education and employee training.

At UC Berkeley, the Faculty for Justice in Palestine group, along with several other campus organizations, last week pledged to expand teaching about “Palestinian history, arts and culture within the context of settler colonialism, anti-colonial struggles and decolonization.” The groups also said they would continue to support boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel — targeting related UC investments — and “fight fear and silencing” at the university globally known for free speech, academic freedom and social justice.

UC Merced’s pro-Palestinian faculty organizers hope to bring balance to UC’s “strongly pro-Zionist” stance on the conflict, among other goals, said Sean Malloy, professor of history and critical race and ethnic studies.

UC Santa Cruz’s new faculty group said it wanted to support Students for Justice in Palestine. The UC faculty members also said they would make space to discuss Palestinian issues in their classrooms, host events and act as liaisons for students experiencing harassment because they are perceived as Arab, Muslim, and/or pro-Palestinian.

At UC Riverside, faculty members involved in creating a Faculty for Justice in Palestine chapter hope to unify to create a stronger front against UC administrative power, said Dylan Rodriguez, a professor of media and cultural studies.

Sherene Razack, a UCLA professor of gender studies, said safety and strength in numbers can help Palestinian supporters avoid being targeted for possible retaliation. “It is really clear that the only thing one can do is organize collectively,” Razack said.",

422,,,The history of snowy Christmas days in Dallas-Fort Worth,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2023/12/21/snow-on-christmas-north-texas/,"It’s not common to see snow on Christmas in North Texas, with only a handful of instances on record.

According to the National Weather Service website, the “earliest record” of snow on Christmas Day in Dallas was in 1841, when “soldiers were tracking a bear in 6 inches of snow,” but the source of that report is unclear.

While 2023 isn’t likely to bring snow to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, here is a look back at the history of snow on Christmas in the region through The Dallas Morning News’ archival material and information from the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. This list does not include instances of snow before or after Christmas Day.

‘Gloomy’ with snow in 1914

A “trace” of snow was reported Dec. 25, 1914, in Dallas and in Fort Worth, with some mix of rain and snow, along with “a few flurries,” according to the weather service.

Advertisement

A newspaper clip from Dec. 26, 1914, described how some in the city anticipated “the rare experience of a white Christmas,” but noted how the “snowstorm did not continue long” on Christmas Day.

“It was as if a sportive Canadian cloud had wandered from bounds and suddenly recalled itself, making the damp, chill, cloudy weather that followed all the more gloomy by contrast,” the article read.

Half-foot of snow in 1926

According to a clip from The News in 1926, Dallas residents finally got a picturesque snow day on Christmas. A photo from the clip read the following: “Adults turned children Saturday to take occasion of Dallas’ big Christmas snow. At the upper left is a snowball fight, to the upper right, a young man taking a snapshot of his girlfriend, who is holding up a huge bunch of snow as a bouquet. At the bottom, left, a small boy is telling his mother how to complete the snowman, while to the right is a view of one of the small streams in Highland Park Christmas morning.”

Six inches of snow were reported in Dallas and Collin counties, according to the National Weather Service. In Dallas, 6.3 inches of snow reportedly fell on Christmas Day .

“Much of the snow was gone by the afternoon of Christmas day,” the NWS website notes.

Snow goes unnoticed by many in 1975

A Dec. 26, 1975, article in The News with the headline, “Most miss Christmas snow in area” described how many residents in the city were “too snugly nestled in their beds to notice” the first white Christmas in nearly five decades.

“However, the flakes melted as they fell and there was no accumulation,” the article read.

The weather service website noted “much of the snow” in the Dallas-Fort Worth area melted before hitting the ground, but also stated “flurries were reported at DFW Airport,” and less than an inch of snow accumulated at the airport.

White, ‘treacherous’ Christmas in 2012

On Dec. 25, 2012, a “strong upper level system and a cold front” brought hail to Dallas-Fort Worth and a “winter weather event that included snow and sleet,” according to NWS Fort Worth.

“The greatest concentration of heavy snow was in western Denton County and Collin County where 4 to 6 inches of snow fell,” the NWS Fort Worth website states.

A Dec. 26 article in The News headlined, “White Christmas, but treacherous, too,” described how “steadily falling snow” in the region “made for dangerously slick conditions.” A report in The News the following day described how “some 1,000 travelers were stranded Christmas night” at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport after winter storms caused more than 400 flight cancellations.

Despite some of the dangerous road conditions caused by the snow that year, photos also showed residents in North Texans enjoying the snowy Christmas Day.

423,,,Frisco expands creek monitoring program,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/12/21/frisco-expands-creek-monitoring-program/,"Frisco is expanding its remote monitoring program for its six major creeks that will allow staff to check water quality and potential flooding with the click of a mouse.

Staff is notified via email when it detects a pollutant so they can quickly send someone onsite to address the situation.

Dana Baird, communications director, said the technology has been used since the spring of 2020. Now, three new monitoring stations will be online by the end of the year.

The remote stormwater gauge stations, which cost $45,000 each, were paid for with stormwater fees. The stations have been great for the city, saving time and providing more accurate information.

“Frisco is essentially built around a lot of our creeks. They’re amenities to a lot of our residents and our communities,” Sean Aucoin, hydrologist for the city of Frisco, said via a Progress in Motion video. “So preserving and protecting these areas are vital.”

Currently, Frisco Public Works stormwater division monitors water quality in three of the city’s creeks — Stewart Creek at Legacy Drive, which is in the south part of the city; Cottonwood Branch at Legacy Drive in the city’s mid-section; and Panther Creek at Teel Parkway in the north.

Three additional stream monitoring stations are planned, with the focus on watersheds at Rowlett Creek, West Rowlett Creek and another section of Stewart Creek.

“The main brains behind this is actually a sonde,” Aucoin said.

Sondes are devices commonly used to monitor water quality, track changes in water chemistry and detect contaminants.

Before these stations were installed, Public Works employees would physically go out and check the water quality. Now they do both, checking onsite and using remote monitoring as a supplement.

In addition to checking for pollutants, each station has a rain gauge. Frisco’s Emergency Operations Center can see the same information as Public Works, which is helpful during flash flooding events.

“It also looks at the stage level so we can look at how deep the water is and basically how much rainfall has occurred within this area,” Aucoin said.

Advertisement

The new stations will also have cameras.

“The more data the better, right?” Aucoin said. “We get better information, better input info and better output info. So the return on investment has been spectacular because being able to remotely assess the streams has saved us a significant amount of time.”

Frisco Mayor Jeff Cheney said with the city’s culture of innovation, department staff are highly encouraged to take a look at how emerging technologies can make improvements.

“These are really smart applications that can make us smarter as a city, make us more effective and a safer community,” Cheney said.",
424,,,Texas AG Ken Paxton seeks gender-affirming care records from Seattle Hospital,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2023/12/21/paxton-seeks-gender-affirming-care-records-from-seattle-hospital/,"The Texas Attorney General’s office is trying to compel a Seattle hospital to hand over information about gender-affirming care patients from Texas may have received there, according to a lawsuit filed by the hospital this month.

The lawsuit, filed in Travis County District Court, said it is seeking to protect patient information of Texans who left their home state, where it’s illegal for minors to access gender-affirming care, to seek medically necessary treatment in Washington state, where it is legal. In the complaint, the Seattle hospital argues Texas authorities don’t have jurisdiction over these Washington patient records, and calls the requests “sham” and “improper.”

“There is no doubt the Attorney General is granted broad investigative powers under Texas law,” the lawsuit says. “But those powers are not unlimited. ... Gender-affirming care is legal in Washington.”

Seattle Children’s filed the suit after the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton served the hospital with a civil investigative demand in late November, according to the complaint. The request sought information about patients from Texas who had received gender-affirming care services from Seattle Children’s, including details related to diagnoses, medications prescribed, laboratory testing and other treatment protocols.

Advertisement

Paxton’s office also asked for the number of Texas children treated at the hospital and for guidance on how to “wean” a child off gender care.

According to the lawsuit, Paxton’s office told Seattle Children’s it was investigating potential violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which aims to protect consumers by preventing general misrepresentations of practices. In this case, the attorney general’s office said it was looking into misrepresentations related to “gender transitioning and reassignment treatments.”

The November letter also cited Texas law, referring to a new law that went into effect in September that prohibits minors from accessing gender-affirming medication and surgical interventions.

“Seattle Children’s took legal action to protect private patient information related to gender-affirming care services at our organization sought by the Texas Attorney General,” a hospital spokesperson said in a statement. “Seattle Children’s complies with the law for all health care services provided.”

The hospital on Thursday declined to comment further on ongoing litigation, but Seattle Children’s attorneys argued in the complaint that the Texas demands represent an “unconstitutional attempt to investigate and chill potential interstate commerce and travel for Texas residents seeking care in another state.”

They also said that if they complied with the data request, they would be violating federal health privacy laws and Washington state’s shield law. The shield law, approved earlier this year, prohibits local cooperation with out-of-state efforts to pursue criminal and civil cases related to reproductive health and gender-affirming care.

Advertisement

The law protects Washington-based businesses or organizations, like Seattle Children’s, from having to respond to “any [gender care-related] investigation by a ban state,” or a state that restricts access to gender-affirming care, the complaint says.

The law also prohibits state businesses from complying with subpoenas, warrants and other court orders related to health care that is legal in Washington.

Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A spokesperson for Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson’s office, which supported passage of the state’s shield law and has been vocal about protecting access to both reproductive health and gender-affirming care, did not comment on the lawsuit except to say their office was aware of it and was “closely monitoring.”

The hospital, which does not provide any gender-affirming care in Texas nor does it advertise gender-affirming services there, asked the court to “set aside” the patient data request — or modify the request and grant the hospital an extension to comply.

Seattle Children’s has provided gender-affirming mental, medical and some surgical care out of its gender clinic for more than five years. The state is not publicly tracking the number of out-of-state patients seeking some type of care that remains legal in Washington, but some local gender-affirming care providers have noticed increases in recent months.

425,,,Mesquite PD releases bodycam footage of officer who fatally shot 19-year-old inside car,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2023/12/21/mesquite-pd-releases-body-cam-footage-of-officer-who-fatally-shot-19-year-old-inside-car/,"Mesquite police released body-worn camera footage Thursday of the moments an officer fatally shot a 19-year-old man who police say refused to heed commands to stop moving his car.

The graphic bodycam footage is included in a video posted by the Mesquite Police Department on the City of Mesquite’s YouTube page. Warning to viewers: The video includes the officer firing the fatal shots.

About 3 a.m. Dec. 14, police said a stolen silver Hyundai sedan passed an officer on routine patrol near Cartwright and Edwards Church roads in the southeastern part of the city. The Hyundai was being followed by a Chrysler sedan.

Both cars then parked at gas pumps at a nearby 7-Eleven. Minutes later, police said a caller reported their Hyundai sedan had just been stolen from their residence near Clay Mathis Drive and Edwards Church Road.

Surveillance video from the gas station shows the driver of the Hyundai go inside the 7-Eleven with one of the Chrysler’s passengers.

While the two men were inside, footage shows the officer drive into the parking lot, get out of his patrol car, and walk up to the Hyundai with his flashlight in his left hand and gun raised in his right. Police said the car was empty.

The officer then walked over to the Chrysler as the two men left the convenience store and began walking toward the car. The officer repeatedly yelled at the suspects to get on the ground, and the footage shows one of them raise his hands in the air before they both ran through the parking lot, out of the frame.

The officer shared descriptions of the men to incoming officers before he ordered the driver of the Chrysler, identified as 19-year-old Payton Lawrence, to turn off the vehicle and stop moving it, police allege. Three people were with Lawrence in the Chrysler at the time.

“Do not move or I will f---ing kill you, do you understand me?” the officer barked at Lawrence.

The officer told Lawrence to stay at the pump and shut the car off while providing information to dispatch. As he was doing so, Lawrence placed the car in reverse and began to back out, away from the pump.

As the car moved, the officer banged the hood and yelled, “Shut the car off now.” He repeated the command at least four times.

Police said Lawrence stopped and pulled forward slightly before reversing again further away from the pump. The officer pointed his gun at him while yelling at him to stop.

Advertisement

As the car moved forward, the officer fired three shots into the front windshield with a 9 mm handgun, according to the bodycam footage. The car continued to roll forward while the officer reported, “Shots fired” into his radio.

The officer opened the front passenger door and pointed his firearm at Lawrence, telling him to not move. The officer then opened the back passenger seat door and yelled at the men in the backseat to not move. One of the men raised his hands in the air, the footage shows.

“Chill bro, chill our hands up, chill,” one passenger told the officer.

The car then rolled forward before traveling over a curb, coming to a halt in a grassy area, according to the footage. The officer then removed Lawrence from the vehicle and “performed life-saving measures,” police said. The department did not include any additional details about what medical treatment Lawrence received.

Two other people inside the Chrysler were questioned and released. The third, 19-year-old Kevon Moore of Dallas, was arrested on outstanding warrants. It was unclear, according to Mesquite jail records, what charges Moore was detained on.

Authorities were unable to find the two men who fled.

Four firearms were found inside the Chrysler, police said, including an AR-style pistol.

Citing the ongoing investigation, the department declined to release the officer’s name, but police said he has been with the department for 17 years.

After the department’s investigation is complete, it will be referred to the Dallas County district attorney’s office for review, police said. The office sent its own investigators to the scene as well to conduct an independent investigation.

According to police, its internal affairs unit will also conduct an investigation to determine whether the officer’s actions and use of deadly force followed department policy and procedures.",

Although the Tuition Equalization Grant program has been in existence for more than half a century, it’s not well-known.

Advertisement

In last month’s fierce Texas House debate of a voucherlike proposal by Gov. Greg Abbott, supporters said “education savings accounts” or ESAs, which would publicly fund private school for certain K-12 students, were nothing new.

“Stop lying to people about whether or not we can use tax dollars for private education,” said Tyler Republican Rep. Matt Schaefer, an ESA proponent. “We’ve been doing it for decades.”

In the Tuition Equalization Grant program, state taxes already go to private education institutions, even religious ones, Schaefer said.

Advertisement

Voucher opponents noted that K-12 education is compulsory, and the Texas Constitution requires the Legislature to create a system that provides it for free. Going to college is voluntary — and generally a lot more expensive — they noted.

From the House chamber’s back mic, Abilene GOP Rep. Stan Lambert told Schaefer that the 1971 Legislature created the grants for financially strapped students attending private colleges and universities to help save money for taxpayers.

Demographic bulge

A large demographic bulge — the Baby Boom generation — was moving into higher education, Lambert recounted. Building new dorms and classroom buildings at state universities would cost a lot more than using financial aid to nudge more people to apply for a growing number of unfilled slots at private colleges, he said.

Advertisement

“I’m just asking you to realize that the decision made in the ’70s was a cost decision [for] the state of Texas because it would cost three or four times as much money to put a student in a public university than it would a private college,” said Lambert, who joined 83 other House members in stripping ESAs from an ultimately unsuccessful teacher pay and school funding bill.

Advertisement

The grants helping low- and moderate-income students afford private college don’t have to be repaid.

A tuition equalization grant isn’t an entitlement. The Legislature has capped funding at $99 million a year, which has limited how many students the program can serve — a maximum of about 29,000.

Advertisement

Grants are overseen by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board but awarded by the private colleges and universities, explained Elizabeth Puthoff, president of the Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas. Its 40 members are accredited institutions — a requirement for eligibility.

The coordinating board estimates the total financial need on a private campus and then allots a proportionate slice of the state’s total appropriation to each participating institution, Puthoff said in an interview.

“Each institution has their own awarding philosophy,” she said. “Do they want to give fewer students larger grants or more students smaller grants?”

The Legislature funds only about 55% of the estimated need for the grants, Puthoff said.

Advertisement

Former Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes, who backed the 1971 legislation that created the Tuition Equalization Grant program, said Lambert accurately described policymakers’ motive — economy.

“It was solely sold to the Legislature … based on the fact that we were going to be able to take advantage of these vacancies at TCU and SMU and Howard Payne and Hardin-Simmons, Abilene Christian College and McMurry and Southwestern University and all of these private schools,” Barnes said in an interview.

He referred to Texas Christian University and Southern Methodist University, each of which usually has had about 1,000-1,300 students annually receiving the grants during the program’s 52-year history.

Advertisement

Baylor University in Waco has been the biggest beneficiary, with between 2,500 and 3,000 students a year receiving the grants for decades.

In the state’s fiscal 2022, the latest for which data is available, Dallas Baptist University had 726 recipients; Texas Wesleyan University in Fort Worth, 712; University of Dallas, 387; and Paul Quinn College, 200.

Barnes, a Democrat, said he found it “rather amusing” the Tuition Equalization Grant program “came up as part of the debate on vouchers because it didn’t have any of the same similar purposes at all.”

Decrease in first-year enrollments

A 1968 report by the Liaison Committee on Texas Private Colleges and Universities, which included the presidents of SMU, Baylor and Rice University, bemoaned a 9% decrease in first-year enrollments in private accredited schools in Texas the previous two years.

Advertisement

The private-sector colleges in the state, then educating about 70,000 students, easily could accommodate 12,500 more “and save hundreds of millions of dollars annually for Texas taxpayers,” the report said.

At the time, some skeptics, such as James Dunn of Texas Baptists’ Christian Life Commission, raised concerns about whether giving money for students to attend religious schools violated the Texas Constitution’s ban on state funds’ being used “for the benefit of any sect or religious society, theological or religious seminary.”

The program bans grants for ministerial students. In its early years, participating institutions had to vouch that they didn’t condition employment of professors and staff on subscribing to a set of doctrinal beliefs.

Advertisement

Another requirement from the program’s inception has been that private-college students receiving athletic scholarships can’t apply for tuition equalization grants.

Recipients must meet the same “satisfactory academic progress” requirements as do state university students receiving TEXAS Grants, the state’s main financial aid program, said Puthoff of the Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas.

That includes maintaining a minimum 2.5 grade-point average.

In fiscal 2022, the average amount disbursed was $3,639, according to the coordinating board.

Advertisement

Also that year, 37% of recipients were Hispanic; 34%, white; 15%, African American; 5%, Asian; and 8%, of other or unknown race and ethnicity.

This year, the maximum award — $3,873 — is pegged to 50% of the estimated state subsidy to students attending public institutions of higher education. Students demonstrating exceptional financial need can get 150% of the maximum grant, or up to $5,810 a year.

Barnes, who was lieutenant governor from 1969 to 1973, said he considers the program a success.

No one’s trying to repeal it, he noted.

“We carefully looked at what the cost of building new classrooms was plus the cost of the land on public university campuses, and it was not even close,” Barnes said. “It made all the economic sense in the world for us to take advantage of this classroom space.”

The qualification is that inductees must demonstrate courage, creativity and caring on issues important to you, members of my Watchdog Nation. Past inductees are shown on the bottom — along with a big surprise.

First, though, let me update you on two previous inductees: former Richardson police officers Kayla Walker and David Conklin. They exposed the city’s illegal traffic ticket quota system and now have settled their lawsuit with the city.

They received a $616,000 settlement from the city, whose officials always denied the city used an illegal quota system.

Now the pair are trying to remove the “dishonorable discharge” left on their records. How spiteful!

As I reported all along, the pair was right.

In a released statement, the city manager’s office wrote that nobody proved state law was violated.

Hello! Read my columns on this. The evidence was in the department’s own record keeping.

In a note to the entire department, Chief Gary L. Tittle wrote that he and the department want to “put this issue behind us as we move onward.”

Here are the 2023 inductees:

1. ARMIN MIZANI

Armin Mizani is the mayor of Keller. He led the removal of Tarrant County Chief Appraiser Jeff Law. (City of Keller)

Removing a county appraisal district’s chief appraiser is as difficult, as the Texas expression goes, as finding a horse thief in heaven. Yet Keller Mayor Armin Mizani answered my decadelong prayer that some public official would lead the ouster of the man whom, in my opinion, was the worst big county chief appraiser, Tarrant County’s Jeff Law.

Law was incompetent year after year. His computer system didn’t work. He was dishonest in his explanations. It was never ending with this dude.

Advertisement

The mayor will try to share the credit with other officials who helped him pull off this very difficult feat, as he did when I complimented him. But don’t let his humility fool you. It never would have happened without his intercession. People talked about removing Law for years, but without help of top leaders, it was too difficult.

2. DORA OVERTON

The Forest Hill widow was the last holdout on the Texas Department of Transportation’s Interstate 20 expansion project. She argued that she wasn’t able to sell her property to the state for an amount that would help her move to a comparable house. She was under a lot of pressure, but she didn’t fold.

Well, there’s good news. Her settlement offer was increased by $35,000, her pro bono lawyer, Michelle Jones of Denton, told me.

Overton tells The Watchdog she has made an offer for a house in her city and hopes to move into it in a few weeks.

3. JENNIFER OLSON

Jennifer Olson is now a member of her town's ethics commission. (Elias Valverde II / Staff Photographer)

Jennifer Olson is inducted because she is the rare local government gadfly who doesn’t care who gets ticked at her. The Trophy Club woman forges ahead.

She raised questions about the town’s extensive video surveillance system. She managed an extremely rare write-in campaign to elect Mayor Jeannette Tifany, whose name wasn’t even on the ballot.

Now she serves on the town’s Ethics Review Commission, which is charged with enforcing ethics for elected officers, appointed board, committee and commission members and town employees.

4. JENNIFER THOMPSON

Former Godley Councilwoman Jennifer Thompson is photographed outside of Godley City Hall. She was arrested on the city hall steps and charged with a fake charge (tampering with city council agenda items) to keep her from attending the council meeting. She was strip searched and kept in jail for almost 24 hours. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)

The former Godley city council member was thrown in jail minutes before a council meeting. The reason? Mayor Acy McGehee didn’t want her to vote against some of his measures. After I wrote about this, the mayor resigned.

Thompson filed a federal lawsuit charging that her civil rights were violated, and she was the victim of government repression that involved the small town’s police force, too.

Advertisement

As part of the incident, Thompson pleaded no contest to a charge brought by the Texas Attorney General’s office that she originally didn’t disclose that she had a felony conviction some 20 years ago involving misuse of gift cards. She said she thought the charge was erased from her record.

Her lawyer, Ana Jordan of Dallas, says she remains traumatized. “She is very brave. She’s facing a lot of resistance from very powerful people, and she continues down the path. She knows what she’s doing is right. She’s very inspiring.”

5. KELSO KING

Kelso King has monitored PUC and ERCOT meetings for 20 years. (Kelso King)

Kelso King is an Austin resident who monitors every Public Utility Commission meeting and every board meeting of ERCOT (operator of the state’s fragile electricity grid) and then writes an extensive report for his subscribers who pay $150 per quarter. Amazingly, he’s done this for 20 years.

“It’s in my blood,” he says.

He worked for the PUC in the 1980s and then worked at the attorney general’s consumer protection division for 10 years, representing state agencies before the PUC. His company is called King Energy Consulting. He doesn’t have a website but gave me permission to share his email address: kelsoking@aol.com.

6. SEAN BECKER

Becker Roofing and Exteriors owner Sean Becker wrote a book, Roofs That Last, that helps property owners avoid being hurt. He even makes his crews sign “roofer ethics statements.” (Tom Fox / Staff Photographer)

The Keller roofer has committed himself and his company, Becker Roofing & Exteriors, to promote honesty and transparency in a troubled, unregulated industry.

He wrote an excellent book called Roofs That Last. He has a “club” that, for a small fee, schedules an annual roof inspection. He requires his subcontractors to sign off on an “Ethical Agreements” form before they work for him.

Advertisement

He strikes me as a much-needed role model for an industry loaded with honest players but also untrustworthy individuals who take the money and run. In Texas, that happens every day.

(David Lieber)

7. EDGAR DWORSKY

Edgar Dworsky of Massachusetts is nicknamed MrConsumer. He hosts ConsumerWorld.org and mouseprint.org and is a retired lawyer and one of the nation’s foremost experts on companies that try to fool grocery customers in various ways. His specialty is deceptive packaging; the box looks bigger, but there’s less product inside. That’s called shrinkflation. His favorite toy as a child was a cardboard supermarket. I asked him to dig up a photo of the toy from the 1950s. He sent me one. What a charming origin story.

We met Hernandez in a recent Watchdog story showing how he won a half-million-dollar jury verdict against Southern Solar of Colleyville.

Do you realize how rare this is?

The jury believed that the company had violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

If more civil lawsuits like this were to occur, we could start cleaning up what I call “The Lone Scam State.”

(David Lieber)

9. ELLIE BREED

Ellie Breed is spokesperson for the Public Utility Commission, (Ellie Breed)

I saved the big surprise for the end. If there’s a Texas journalist who excoriated the (p)UC — Public Utility Commission, but I took away the ‘P’ because it doesn’t answer to the public — more than I, I’ve yet to meet her or him. But I don’t know if anyone has noticed in the past year that ERCOT has drawn more negative attention than the (p)UC.

I suggest that it has something to do with the hiring this year of Ellie Breed, the PUC’s spokesperson. She is receptive to inquiries and goes above and beyond when it comes to getting answers.

Advertisement

Compared to some previous (p)UC PR people, it’s a dramatic change. One spokesperson before her told his bosses in open records I obtained, that I was “an unprincipled, self-promoting huckster.” History has shown that’s an apt description of the (p)UC. He also concocted a story that my “prank-style antics [could] culminate in footage of him being dragged from our hearing room by a state trooper.”

Anyway, the bar for this state job is low, but Breed, whom I’ve never met personally, is a pro making a difference.

429,,,Another round of rain this weekend,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2023/12/21/another-round-of-rain-this-weekend/,"Thursday has been delightfully wet since we need the rain. The rain will continue through the evening before diminishing overnight.

Friday will begin with spotty showers early, but dry by mid morning. There will be a bit of afternoon sunshine. However, more rain is on the way for the weekend. A storm system will approach from the west and bring a chance of showers and thunderstorms Saturday, especially toward evening. Some of that rain will likely carryover into early Sunday as well.

Before all is said and done, we could receive a total of 1-2″ (with isolated 3″ amounts). Of course it won’t rain constantly and there will be several hours each of those days as well.

Thankfully temperatures will remain well above normal so there are no concerns for any ice or snow.

“The first year after you lose someone is usually the hardest, especially around Christmastime,” Strasner said. “A lot of times, people that are new in their grief … the last thing they want to do is go to a Christmas party and put on a fake smile.”

She was grateful to find a different way to mark the holiday that year in the “Blue Christmas” service at Highland Park United Methodist Church.

Churches across the D-FW area hold Blue Christmas services to support those experiencing grief, loss or other hardships during the holidays. Also called “Longest Night Service,” it’s usually held around the winter solstice, which typically falls on Dec. 21 or 22.

Many Blue Christmas services omit hymn-singing, instead featuring acoustic guitar, harp or simple chants repeated in unison. Many also include a candle-lighting ritual in honor of lost loved ones or as a reminder of hope amid suffering. The UMC’s North and Central Texas Conferences put together a list of United Methodist churches offering these services this year.

It’s unclear exactly when “Blue Christmas” services began, but they have been offered by churches across the country since at least the 1990s. The Rev. Dawn Anderson of Dallas’ Lovers Lane United Methodist Church organized her first Blue Christmas while volunteering at another area UMC around two decades ago. Anderson had lost her husband to suicide, and together with her friend and fellow volunteer Sharon Clepper O’Connor, she organized a simple service with recorded music and a few candles.

“I think having been through deep grief myself, and some of the mental stuff that followed it … it just made me hyperaware of what people need during that time,” Anderson said.

Of her Blue Christmas service, she said, “I really kind of design mine for a person that might still be traumatized and in shock and just barely able to get out of bed. That’s the kind of person I want to make sure we offer something for. Hopefully, they leave on a hopeful note, because we remind them of how Jesus came to bring eternal life and how we’re going to see our loved ones again.”

Advertisement

Strasner has been coming to Anderson’s Blue Christmas services for years, following her after she moved churches. As she waits in line to light candles for her father and sister every year, she said, she always makes sure to hug Anderson.

“My grief journey [has] been going on for a while now, so I don’t see her like I used to,” Strasner said of Anderson, adding that she no longer attends the pastor’s biweekly GriefShare meetings. But the Blue Christmas services have remained a tradition she looks forward to every year, she said.

“You get a moment to light the candle for your loved one, and then you set it next to all of the other candles that are lit. It’s just really powerful, when you go back to your seat and sit down, because you look and you see all of these candles glowing, and they’re all for someone that we’ve lost but someone whose memory still lives on in us.”

431,,,"Uvalde school shooting evidence won’t go before grand jury this year, prosecutor says",https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2023/12/21/uvalde-school-shooting-evidence-wont-go-before-grand-jury-this-year-prosecutor-says/,"DALLAS (AP) — A Texas prosecutor says a criminal investigation into police failures during the Uvalde school shooting will continue into 2024, pushing back expectations that a grand jury would convene before the end of the year.

Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell said earlier this week that her staff are still examining the halting and haphazard police response to the May 2022 shooting that left 19 students and two teachers dead. Investigators sent Mitchell their preliminary findings in January and she previously said prosecutors would present evidence related to the massacre to a grand jury this year.

Advertisement

The possibility of criminal charges against some of the nearly 400 officers who rushed to Robb Elementary School but waited more than an hour to confront and kill the shooter has hung over Uvalde since state lawmakers faulted law enforcement at every level with failing “to prioritize saving innocent lives over their own safety.” The issue has divided the close-knit community of 15,000, and as the timeline for the criminal investigation has expanded, so has the frustration of some victims’ families with the district attorney.

“She’s just plainly not doing her job,” said Velma Lisa Duran, whose sister Irma Garcia was one of the teachers killed. “I don’t understand how they expect us to live in a place where there are no consequences.”

Mitchell did not answer questions posed to her by The Associated Press about when she now expects to go before a grand jury, the focus of her investigation or what charges she might be considering.

“My office is still dissecting the investigation of the Texas Rangers which is quite voluminous,” she said in an email response. “Upon our completion of the review of the Rangers investigation, we will then convene a grand jury.”

Advertisement

The Rangers, a part of the Texas Department of Public Safety, sent prosecutors their initial findings at the start of this year. But Mitchell said the agency’s investigation continued after that, and she told the San Antonio Express-News that she would need until the end of 2023 to present a case to the grand jury because she only received the full case file in July.

Since the shooting, there has been widespread criticism of the officers who massed outside the school and waited in hallways as the shooter could be heard firing an AR-15-style rife in a classroom. At least five officers have lost their jobs, including two Department of Public Safety officers and Uvalde’s school police chief, Pete Arredondo, who was the on-site commander during the attack.

The ongoing investigation is also likely to prolong legal fights over the release of records that might offer a fuller picture of the attack and police response.

Advertisement

Uvalde city officials filed a lawsuit last year that accused prosecutors of not being transparent and withholding records related to the shooting. News outlets, including the AP, have also sued local Uvalde officials for withholding records requested under public information laws. Over the summer, Uvalde’s then-mayor, Don McLaughlin, called on Mitchell to resign, saying she “has been involved in a cover-up regarding the city’s investigation into the Robb School tragedy,”

Advertisement

The Department of Public Safety has fought disclosure, citing a request from Mitchell due to her ongoing investigation. In November, lawyers for the state appealed a judge’s order that records be released.

Nonetheless, body camera footage, investigations by journalists and a damning report by state lawmakers have laid bare how over the course of more than 70 minutes, a mass of officers went in and out of the school with weapons drawn but did not go inside the classroom where the shooting was taking place. The 376 officers at the scene included state police, Uvalde police, school officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents.

Robb Elementary is now permanently closed and in October the city broke ground on a new school. But Uvalde remains split between residents who say they want to move past the tragedy and others who are still demanding answers and accountability.

Advertisement

In November, during the first mayoral race since the shooting, locals elected a man who’d served as mayor more than a decade ago, rather than a mother who has led calls for tougher gun laws since her daughter was killed in the attack.

This month, Duran, 52, marked what would have been her sister’s 50th birthday. She no longer expects to see justice on Earth for the police who failed to protect her sister and the officials she believes are shielding them.

“I take confidence in God’s wrath,” she said.

432,,,Flash flooding wreaks havoc on Los Angeles area as powerful storm slams into Southern California,https://nypost.com/2023/12/22/news/flash-flooding-wreaks-havoc-on-los-angeles-area-as-powerful-storm-slams-into-southern-california/,"Southern California continues to face a dangerous flood threat through Friday as heavy rain targets the Los Angeles and San Diego areas, before moving eastward.

More than 20 million people from Southern California through central Arizona remain under a Flood Watch as rainfall totals surpassed 10 inches in several mountain areas, while bringing a month’s worth of rain in an hour in Ventura County.

The overall rainfall amounts combined with the potential for bursts of thunderstorm-triggered heavier rain, especially over recent wildfire burn-scar areas, prompted NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center (WPC) to put a swath of Southern California in a Level 3 out of 4 risk zone for flash flooding.

For many communities, the precipitation is the heaviest rainfall event since the remnants of Hurricane Hilary impacted the region in August.

Some of the hardest hit areas included Oxnard and Santa Barbara, where water rescues were needed.

A good Samaritan driver pulled two people from a vehicle before it was swept away and the American Red Cross opened at least one shelter.

Oxnard, Port Hueneme residents wake up to flooded homes

Significant flash flooding occurred in the Oxnard area, the largest city in Ventura County, after 3.18 inches of rain fell in one hour – of which 2.25 inches fell in just 30 minutes.

The city averages about 2.5 inches of rain for the entire month. Overall storm totals were nearing 6 inches at the city’s civic center by Thursday evening.

Photos shared on social media from Oxnard showed upwards of 2 feet of water on roads.

Larry Emerson, a resident of Port Hueneme in Ventura County, says he awoke to a frustrating sight Thursday morning when he found about a foot of water had seeped into his garage.

“Everything is wet and about a foot up on everything,” he said. “The deluge must have gone through the entire garage. I got boxes destroyed… (The floodwaters) tipped over a commercial vacuum cleaner and got water on the inside. It was so forceful.”

About 60 homes were flooded, and even a senior living center had to be evacuated. First responders had to use high-wheeled vehicles to evacuate about 20 people.

During the peak of the flooding, Ventura County Fire reported that they received approximately 275 calls within a span of five hours, according to public information officer Andy VanSciver. That is significantly higher than their usual call volume of less than 200 calls per day.

“This storm was a little bit unique to the Port Hueneme, Oxnard area. This is a coastal community, so it’s rather flat to begin with here by the ocean,” VanSciver said.

“And so the flood control channels were overwhelmed. I did hear on my response in as I was gathering information both on the police radio and the FM radio that the National Weather Service was reporting that it had received an enormous amount of rain.

“Sometimes they were saying maybe more than we’ve ever received in the last 30 to 40 years in such a short period of time.”

As much as 8 inches of rain expected

By the end of the week, between 5 and 8 inches of rain is forecast to fall in several areas, with some places experiencing even higher amounts, keeping an ongoing risk of flash and urban flooding.

Some mountainous areas in Southern California reported rainfall totals over 10 inches through the week as of Thursday evening.

Rocky Butte in San Luis Obispo County reported 15.95 inches, while Ventura County’s Old Man Mountain had 13.70 inches, according to the National Weather Service.

Closer to the metro area, Beverly Hills had 2.66 inches of rain while Los Angeles’s LAX airport reported 2.15 inches.

Severe weather jolts residents as Tornado Warnings issued in Ventura County

For some, the storms didn’t just bring heavy rain and flooding, but a threat of severe weather.

Early Thursday morning, two Tornado Warnings were issued for the Oxnard area after Doppler Radar indicated possible rotation inside passing thunderstorms.

The Tornado Warnings were the first issued by the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles office during the month of December since 2008.

“At one point, we had over 350,000 people under a Tornado Warning and also a Flash Flood Warning,” FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin said.

Snow blankets the Sierra Nevada

The same system is also dropping heavy snow over the highest elevations of California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains, with lower snow amounts over the highest elevations of the Washington and Oregon Cascades and parts of Idaho and Nevada.

Rain was forecast to slowly head east through the day Friday, drying out Southern California from west to east and shifting heavy rains and the flooding threat into parts of Arizona.",
433,,,Baby girl born 4 months early and just 14 ounces finally goes home in time for first Christmas: ‘She is our gift’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/22/news/missouri-baby-girl-born-4-months-early-and-14-ounces-home-in-time-for-christmas/,"For one grateful family, there’s no place like home for the holidays.

A Missouri girl who was born the size of a “little baby bird” four months early and spent nearly 10 months in the hospital finally made it home — just in time to be her parents’ greatest Christmas “gift.”

Evangeline “Evie” Statler will celebrate her first holiday at home with mom and dad after she only had about a 50% chance at survival when she was delivered at a Cape Girardeau hospital on March 24 – about four months before her mid-July due date – and weighing just 14 ounces, according to reports.

“For the timing to line up with Christmas, it’s like, symbolic, almost like, yeah, she is our gift,” the newborn’s father, Dylan Statler told KSDK after Evie was released Monday.

Evie arrived prematurely after mother Maddie Statler, 27, explained she woke up with back pain, and later that day started having contractions.

After she had some bleeding, she went to the hospital, ABC’s “Good Morning America” reported.

She received medications to stop the preterm labor, but the bleeding continued during her stay at the hospital. Maddie was hemorrhaging from placental abruption, a serious pregnancy complication, which led Evie to be born by C-section.

“It was definitely scary,” said Maddie in a news release cited by People.

“We didn’t know if we both would make it or not and didn’t know what would really happen. She was so tiny, like a little baby bird.”

Doctors told the couple their new daughter had less than a 50% chance of survival in what Dylan, 30, called a “nightmare scenario.”

“Each day was kind of like a victory that we got through — like, if we got through another day there at the beginning, we counted that as a win,” he told ABC.

Evie was later transferred to St. Louis Children’s Hospital in July for specialized care as she still fought for survival and was treated for complications including high blood pressure in the arteries of her lungs, ABC reported.

“We anticipated a very long stay,” Dr. Melissa Riley, who oversaw her care, told ABC.

“So when she arrived here, as sick as she was … at that time, if you would have said, ‘Dr. Riley, is Evie going to be home by Christmas?’ I would have said, ‘I’m not betting on that one.'”",

A Post reporter watched Thursday morning as Alexander Mendez, 23, of Venezuela and 30 others — including women and children — crossed the Rio Grande Thursday morning.

“I am going to New York,” Mendez said, noting that his sister, aunt and cousin were joining him.

He said he already had a cousin the Empire State and hoped to carve out an improved existence in his new environment.

“I want to explore New York, work and get a better life,” he said after making the two-month journey to the border.

The group crossed the Rio Grande under the crowded Camino Real International Bridge.

“Attention, attention,” blared a loudspeaker in a pre-recorded message in Spanish.

“It is illegal to cross here. This area is secured with wire and there is no entry. Go to the bridge. It is illegal to cross here. Remain in Mexico.”

Officials said more than 4,000 undocumented travelers were apprehended in the Lone Star State’s Del Rio sector in past 24-hours alone.

Most will cite seeking asylum as their reason for crossing illegally into the US, which means they must have a “credible fear” of harm if they are returned to their homeland.

The 10,000 who have given themselves up to Border Patrol in Eagle Pass this week are the equivalent to roughly one third of the small town’s permanent population, putting huge strain on its resources.

Beleaguered border agents worked in vain to stem the human tsunami, hustling to repair holes in razor wire while migrants calmly scaled the barrier around them.

Three Guatemalan men removed their shoes and socks before crossing a riverbank in the area.

“My brother has been in New York for two years,” one of them said.

Johan Rodriguez, 20, told The Post through an interpreter that he arrived in Piedras Negras in Mexico at the Texas border after a grueling three-month trek by foot and bicycle that began in Venezuela.

“I traveled through Venezuela, Colombia, El Salvador, Panama, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and now Mexico,” he said under a baking sun Thursday after crossing over into the US and joining the crowds in Eagle Pass.

Rodriguez said he came to out America solely for economic reasons, and was not in any danger back home.

“There’s no opportunity in Venezuela,” he said.

“It’s not dangerous but the economy is bad.”

The former secretary of state leveled the accusation against Netanyahu, 74, during a meeting at Columbia University on Wednesday with 16 children and siblings of some of the more than 100 hostages that remain in Palestinian territory, according to Haaretz.

Clinton, 76, reportedly urged the family members to ramp up the pressure on the Israeli government to strike a deal with Hamas terrorists that would see more hostages let out of Gaza.

She further accused Netanyahu of being more focused on “politics and his personal survival” than on negotiating the release of hostages.

“As long as the hostages are not the main and primary target for Israel, then everything that I or President Biden say or do is of little value,” Clinton said, according to sources that spoke with Ynet News.

The former Democratic presidential candidate also told family members that the Biden administration was making efforts to reach a “Christmas deal” that would lead to the release of more hostages, but that the fate of the deal was ultimately in the hands of Hamas and the Israeli government.

Eight Americans are believed to be among the 132 hostages that Hamas has refused to release since the terror group’s deadly Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish state.

“The work that the families and the forum does is so important and influential. You need to keep doing it. Put pressure on all the players involved,” Clinton reportedly told the families of the hostages.

Hamas officials said Thursday they would not discuss any hostage exchange deal “except after a full cessation of aggression.”",

A judge granted Thursday Lindsay Shiver’s request to return to her young children in the US while she awaits the murder-for-hire trial, which is anticipated to kick off in March.

She has been remanded to the island nation since July, though allowed free from prison under the conditions that she wear an electric monitoring device and adhere to a curfew.

Shiver and her team told the court she feared for her “mental and physical safety” and begged that she be allowed to see her children, who she has been separated from since her arrest, according to Court TV.

Shiver, 36, will be allowed to return to her parent’s home in Alabama under the new ruling, but must keep her ankle monitor on and will not be permitted to travel to Georgia, where she lived with husband Robert Shiver before allegedly asking her new beau to kill him.

Robert Shiver pleaded that the judge strike down her request, stating that he is “thankful to be alive” after her fruitless attempt on his life.

“After reviewing the indictment, this was a situation close to happening…I’m concerned for the safety of myself,” the Auburn University football standout said.

Shiver is accused of explicitly instructing her barman beau Adrien Bethel, 28, and alleged assassin Faron Newbold Jr., 29, to whack Robert Shiver amid their increasingly bitter divorce.

Shiver allegedly sent a series of texts to Bethel asking him to “kill” her snapper husband.

Local police unearthed texts that detailed the plot during an unrelated investigation of a break-in at the waterfront bar where Bethel worked.

Both Shiver and Beth denied seriously pursuing a murder-for-hire plan, claiming the texts amounted to little more than hyperbolic fantasy amid Shivers’ marital combat.

Prior to their marriage’s implosion, the Shivers split their time between a multi-million dollar Thomasville, Georgia, mansion and a luxury spread in the exclusive Bahamian enclave of Baker’s Bay.

John McWhorter, a linguist professor at Columbia University, wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times on Thursday in which he said Gay should resign if the Ivy League school declines to dismiss her from her post.

Gay allegedly quoted or paraphrased authors more than 40 times without proper attribution in her academic works — which breaks the school’s strict rules on plagiarism.

“Harvard has a clear policy on plagiarism that threatens undergraduates with punishment up to the university’s equivalent of expulsion for just a single instance of it,” McWhorter wrote.

“That policy may not apply to the university’s president, but the recent, growing revelations about past instances of plagiarism by Dr. Gay make it untenable for her to remain in office.”

He added that Gay keeping her job “would not only be a terrible sign of hollowed-out leadership, but also risks conveying the impression of a double standard at a progressive institution for a Black woman, which serves no one well, least of all Dr. Gay.”

Claudine Gay is accused of 40 acts of plagiarism. David McGlynn

Gay, Harvard’s first black president, has produced a mere 11 academic articles in her career and not one book on her own, noted McWhorter, who is black.

Her appointment as president, he argued, “gives the appearance that Dr. Gay was not chosen because of her academic or scholarly qualifications, which Harvard is thought to prize, but rather because of her race.”

On Thursday, a complaint revealed more than 40 allegations of her plagiarizing others’ works.

Columbia University’s John McWhorter said Gay should resign

The allegations first surfaced earlier this month, with accusations she lifted other scholars’ works in her 1997 doctoral thesis and that four papers published between 1993 and 2017 did not include proper attribution.

The allegations have also caught the attention of Congress amid its investigation into existing claims of antisemitism on campus, which McWhorter noted he initially pushed back on, wanting more evidence.

“But in the wake of reports of additional acts of plagiarism and Harvard’s saying that she will make further corrections to past writing, the weight of the charges has taken me from ‘wait and see’ to ‘that’s it,’” he wrote in The Times.

“If it is mobbish to call on Black figures of influence to be held to the standards that others are held to, then we have arrived at a rather mysterious version of antiracism, and just in time for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday in less than a month,” he wrote.

“I would even wish Harvard well in searching for another Black woman to serve as president if that is an imperative. But at this point that Black woman cannot, with any grace, be Claudine Gay,” McWhorter said.

Gay has defended her academic integrity, telling the Boston Globe “Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards.”

Harvard has stood by its president, with its board announcing unanimous support for Gay.

The House Committee on Education and the Workforce on Wednesday announced a probe into how the school handled the allegations of plagiarism against Gay.",

“[Jones] is then seen pressing the erect penis against the door before walking away,” court documents state.

Four days later, police tracked down the accused burglar, who allegedly admitted to creeping around the house.

Jones told investigators he was merely checking in on the woman’s “welfare” after having seen someone else get shot at the house just two weeks earlier, court documents show.

As for the sex toy, Jones allegedly relented that he was carrying one but that it had “slipped out” when he approached the door.

He was taken into custody, but put up a brief fight, the charges indicate.

Jones was booked into the Pinellas County Jail for stalking, attempted burglary and resisting arrest.

Tim Burchett says he’s ‘sure’ members of Congress have been ‘honeypot’ victims: ‘Next thing you know, you’re in the motel room with them naked’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/rep-tim-burchett-sure-members-of-congress-are-honeypot-victims/,"Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett claimed Thursday that “good conservative” lawmakers are falling victim to “honeypot” schemes and voting in ways to avoid being outed for their deviant behavior.

The “powerful people” entrapping members of Congress are “always either out on the tarmac or in the private room” with the president, Burchett right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson during a discussion that centered on the impending release of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s client list.

“They’re the ones that write the big checks. They don’t care who’s in [office]. They hate this country. They hate what we’re about. But they love their portfolios and they love their money more than they do anything else,” the 59-year-old congressman said, adding that they gather disparaging information about lawmakers in order to “protect” their investments.

“And by doing so, you know, the old honey pot — the Russians do that — and I’m sure members of Congress have been caught up,” Burchett suggested, without offering any specific evidence other than the voting patterns of some of his congressional colleagues.

3 Burchett suggested that “good conservatives” are voting “for crazy stuff” because they don’t want to be outed for deviant sexual acts. AP

“Why in the world would good conservatives vote for crazy stuff like what we’ve been seeing out of Congress?” Burchett said.

The lawmaker went on to assertively describe how he believes the honey trap schemes work.

“You’re visiting, you’re out of the country or out of town or you’re in a motel or at a bar in DC and, whatever you’re into – women, men, whatever — comes up and they’re very attractive and they’re laughing at your jokes. And you’re buying them a drink. Next thing you know, you’re in the motel room with them naked,” he said.

“And next thing you know, you know you’re about to make a key vote. And what happens? Some well-dressed person comes out and whispers in your ear, ‘Hey, man, there’s tapes out on you,’ or, ‘Were you in a motel room or whatever with whoever?’ And then you’re like, ‘Oh,’ and [they] said, ‘You really ought not be voting for this thing,’” Burchett went on.

The congressman argued that “it’s human nature” for lawmakers to vote in ways that would keep compromising personal information from getting out.

“And, you know, no man or no woman actually is an island. And they know what to get at. You know, if it’s women, drugs, booze, it’ll find you,” Burchett said, claiming that this sort of blackmail happens in all levels of politics.

“I’ve been in this game my whole life. I spent 16 years in the state legislature in Tennessee and eight years as county mayor. And now I’m in my fifth year in Congress. But it’s just — the stakes are higher. But the game is still the same,” he said.

Burchett theorized earlier this week that Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s (R-Tenn.) effort to subpoena the flight logs for Epstein’s infamous private jet was “snubbed” by Senate Democrats because some are “compromised.”

“Too many of my colleagues, I’m afraid, are compromised in this area. For whatever reason, somebody’s whispered in their ear, said, ‘Hey, you don’t want something to come out on something else. You better keep your mouth shut on this,'” Burchett said during a Monday appearance on Newsmax.",

Jesse Leonardo Otero, 44, is well known to the California businesses he frequently targets as well as several local police departments who’ve dealt with his antics repeatedly over the years, KRON reported.

He was most recently picked up by cops outside a shopping center in Pleasant Hill, about 20 miles east of Oakland on Dec. 8.

He had been released from the Martinez Detention Facility jail on misdemeanor charges just hours earlier that same day, the outlet reported.

The career criminal allegedly hurled swears and insults at a KRON reporter who asked him, “Jesse, don’t you get sick of getting arrested?” as he was cuffed outside the shopping center.

Otero, who is homeless, survives and supports his drug addiction by shoplifting and then selling the stolen merchandise, cops told the outlet.

3 Jesse Leonardo Otero, 44, has been arrested 90 times for shoplifting in the California Bay Area. KRON

He’s known to police throughout the Bay Area, where he travels by BART trains to hit different communities to commit crimes.

His lengthy rap sheet shows he goes after both small businesses and big-box stores — and often returns to steal from them again to the extent that many store employees know him on a first-name basis.

“Since we started knowing who he was, we would call him out by name and say, ‘Jesse — you’re not allowed to be here,’” Daisy Erns, store manager at Five Little Monkeys toy store in Albany, told KRON.

Otero’s typically cited or briefly jailed before he’s released back out on the streets again.

3 Otero is known to multiple police departments in the Bay Area, where he targets stores repeatedly. KRON

He rarely steals more than $950 worth of products, according to police, which keeps him out of jail due to a 2014 change in state law.

That year, California residents voted to up the felony charge threshold for shoplifting from $400 in stolen property to $950, making most shoplifting crimes misdemeanors, according to the outlet.

Police are then left with no choice but to set him free despite his incredible criminal record.

“Nowadays, with the way that the filing standards have changed and the law is written, if it’s a petty theft under $950, he’s given the same ticket that you would get for running a stop sign,” Pleasant Hill police officer Jacob Williams told KRON.

“So that person is no longer booked into jail based off the shoplift alone — even if we are aware of prior convictions on his criminal history,” he said.

Otero is currently in jail after his latest arrest. It’s unclear if or when he will be released.

3 Otero is currently facing a consolidated 31-count misdemeanor complaint for his arrests in 2023.

He was also arrested on Nov. 21 in Concord after committing a theft at a mall. He ran onto an interstate highway as he tried to flee police before he was detained.

Just days later on Nov. 24, Otero stole $340 worth of items from a bike store in Danville, according to the owner.

The Contra Costa DA’s office filed a consolidated 31-count misdemeanor complaint against the career criminal — compiling his 31 arrests in the past year into a single case, KRON reported.

District Attorneys in the Golden State can consolidate cases for repeated crimes into one case, as Otero is currently facing.

His misdemeanor jury trial is scheduled for the last week of the year.",

“We’ve got to fight for our country,” Trump reportedly told two officials with the Wayne County Board of Canvassers on Nov. 17, 2020, according to a recording reviewed by the Detroit News. “We can’t let these people take our country away from us.”

He also told the pair, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, that it would be a “terrible” look for them to sign off on the state’s election results after previously voting in opposition to certifying them during the call. The two Republican members of Wayne County’s canvassers board later voted to certify the 2020 vote results.

McDaniel, who was also on the call, suggested that both Palmer and Hartmann would be offered legal representation, presumably by the RNC, if they decided not to sign the certification document.

“If you can go home tonight, do not sign it. … We will get you attorneys,” she reportedly said.

“We’ll take care of that,” Trump added.

Palmer and Hartmann did not sign the official statement of votes for Wayne County and tried unsuccessfully to rescind their votes supporting the certification of Michigan’s election results the day after the call.

The call took place some 30 minutes after the end of a Nov. 17, 2020, meeting between the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, according to the Detroit News.

Trump further claimed that Republicans had been “cheated on this election” and “everybody knows Detroit is crooked as hell.”

“How can anybody sign something when you have more votes than people?” the 77-year-old former president said on the call.

McDaniel, a Michigan native and Wayne County resident argued that if the election were to be certified without an audit, voters would “never know what happened in Detroit.”

She told the Detroit News that Joe Biden’s narrow margin of victory in the state “warranted an audit.”

Both McDaniel and Michigan GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox formally requested an audit in a Nov. 21, 2020, letter to the Board of State Canvassers.

“What I said publicly and repeatedly at the time, as referenced in my letter on Nov. 21, 2020, is that there was ample evidence that warranted an audit,” McDaniel told the outlet.

Hartmann and Palmer both acknowledged in 2020 that they had received a call from Trump and McDaniel, and that the call took place as the pair sat in a parked car outside the Wayne County elections building.

“The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance, stated Wayne County, Michigan, Canvassers,” Trump tweeted the morning after the call. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers. There are more votes than people. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!”

Biden edged out Trump in Michigan by about 154,000 votes in 2020 – 50.6% to 47.8% – and easily defeated the incumbent in Wayne County by a 38 percentage point margin.

The 79-year-old Democrat was convicted on 13 of the 14 charges leveled against him in a 2019 federal indictment accusing the veteran Chicago City Council member of using his position to steer business from private developers to his law firm.

Prosecutors also alleged that Burke threatened to block a measure raising admission fees at Chicago’s famed Field Museum over its failure to grant an internship to the daughter of a former alderman, whom he had recommended.

Burke’s shakedown scheme targeted the developer working on a $600 million renovation of Chicago’s Old Post Office, a Burger King in the former alderman’s 14th Ward and Midwest liquor store chain Binny’s Beverage Depot.

Burke, 79, faces a maximum of 110 years in prison. AP

The former Chicago alderman was found guilty of 13 of the 14 corruption charges brought against him by federal prosecutors. AP

“Did we land the, uh, tuna?” Burke told former Alderman Danny Solis, who wore a wire for two years as federal authorities investigated the case, in an apparent reference to his desire to land the Old Post Office developer as a client for his law firm specializing in property tax appeals.

In another recording played for the jury, Burke told Solis that the developers could “go f–k themselves” if they thought they would get favorable treatment from him without their business.

The disgraced city official also repeatedly played up that he could help the developer – 601W Companies LLC of New York – in a dispute with Amtrak because of his close ties with a board member for the rail operator.

“We made his daughter a judge here in Cook County. And one of their other daughters is a friend of my daughter … You’ll find out Chicago is a very small town,” Burke said in one recording.

“Jews are Jews, and they’ll deal with Jews to the exclusion of everybody else … unless there’s a reason for them to use a Christian,” Burke also told his colleague, referring to the lead developer of the Old Post Office renovation project, who is Jewish. Burke is Roman Catholic.

Burke was also accused of shutting down remodeling work at a Burger King owned by Zohaib Dhanani after the fast-food franchise operator didn’t respond to Burke’s request to employ his law firm.

“It seems like the two were being linked together … the property taxes and the permits,” Dhanani told jurors.

“Maybe since I had not responded about the property tax business, maybe that’s why it would have been shut down,” Dhanani testified. “I didn’t see any other reason why it would be shut down.”

Peter Andrews, a political aide to Burke, and developer Charles Cui were on trial alongside the former alderman, who resigned in May.

Andrews was found not guilty on all charges.

Cui was found guilty on bribery charges after he hired Burke’s law firm in an effort to get the ex-alderman’s help resolving a pole sign dispute with the city related to his Binny’s Beverage Depot property. Burke had the city’s buildings commissioner look into Cui’s sign issue the same day his firm signed Cui up as a client.

443,,,"Prosecutor who allegedly shielded Joe, Hunter Biden testified 79 times she’s ‘not authorized’ by DOJ to give answers",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/lesley-wolf-who-allegedly-shielded-joe-hunter-biden-said-shes-not-authorized-by-doj-to-give-answers/,"WASHINGTON — The former federal prosecutor who allegedly shielded President Biden and his son Hunter during a criminal investigation testified 79 times to Congress that she was “not authorized” by the Justice Department to answer questions about the case, according to a transcript reviewed by The Post.

Former assistant Delaware US attorney Lesley Wolf repeatedly cited a five-page authorization letter from Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer as she refused to answer questions during a House Judiciary Committee deposition last week.

Weinsheimer’s Dec. 12 letter, also reviewed by The Post, says: “[T]he Department generally does not authorize congressional testimony from line-level personnel, especially relating to an ongoing investigation with charges pending in court. The Department has declined to do so in connection with this matter.”

Wolf’s dozens of refusals to answer questions — just one day after the full House voted to authorize an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden — frustrated attempts to firm up the storyline involving what whistleblowers say was a sweeping coverup by Wolf and colleagues to protect the Biden family.

5 A former federal prosecutor who allegedly shielded President Biden and his son Hunter during a criminal investigation testified that she was “not authorized” to answer questions about her actions, according to a transcript. AP

The near-blanket rejection of questions follows pressure from House Republicans on the administration to allow witness testimony and could bolster GOP arguments that the White House is obstructing the inquiry, which itself could form an article of impeachment.

Two IRS agents who worked on the long-running tax fraud investigation of Hunter Biden, which focused on his foreign income from countries such as China and Ukraine, alleged in prior testimony to House committees that Wolf tipped off the first son’s lawyers to investigative steps and forbade inquiries into Joe Biden, even when communications mentioned him.

Wolf served on the squad of prosecutors that signed off on a probation-only plea deal in June for the first son on tax and gun charges, which fell apart the following month under scrutiny from a federal judge.

IRS supervisor Gary Shapley, who oversaw the Hunter Biden investigation for three years, and case agent Joseph Ziegler, who worked on the inquiry for five years, made a series of specific claims against Wolf, which she did not refute in her testimony.

Tax investigators learned in December 2020 that Wolf “reached out to Hunter Biden’s defense counsel and told them” about investigators’ plans to search a northern Virginia storage unit that contained business records, “circumventing our chance to get to evidence from potentially being destroyed, manipulated or concealed,” Ziegler testified in July.

Shapley testified that investigators were months earlier barred from searching a guest house at Joe Biden’s Wilmington, Del., home where Hunter often stayed.

Shapley said that on Sept. 3, 2020, “Wolf told us there was more than enough probable cause for the physical search warrant there, but the question was whether the juice was worth the squeeze.”

Wolf also allegedly objected during a meeting on Dec. 3, 2020, to questioning a key Biden family associate, Rob Walker, about the president.

“Wolf interjected and said she did not want to ask about the big guy and stated she did not want to ask questions about ‘dad’” he said.

“When multiple people in the room spoke up and objected that we had to ask, she responded, there’s no specific criminality to that line of questioning. This upset the FBI, too,” Shapley testified.

Wolf served as a key point person for the investigation, serving under Delaware US attorney David Weiss.

The whistleblowers accused Weiss’ office of giving Hunter Biden’s legal team advance knowledge of a planned interview attempt in late 2020, scuttling a planned approach, and said that prosecutors didn’t pass along a paid FBI informant’s tip that Joe and Hunter Biden received $10 million in bribes from Ukrainian energy company Burisma, which paid Hunter a salary of up to $1 million to serve on its board beginning in 2014 when his vice-president dad led US policy toward the country.

Wolf allegedly instructed FBI agents in August 2020 to remove references to Joe Biden from a search warrant affidavit, writing, “Someone needs to redraft [the affidavit]… There should be nothing about Political Figure 1 in here,” according to an email released by the Ways & Means Committee.

“That email, I think, is super important because it’s a one-off example in writing of the constant concern of following investigative leads that might lead to Joe Biden,” Ziegler said last week in a Fox News interview.

“The FBI agents who drafted that affidavit, they believed that they had sufficient evidence — probable cause — to support including Political Figure 1 in that affidavit,” said the self-identified Democrat.

“That related to [Ukrainian energy company] Burisma, access to Joe Biden and access to the administration and there was ample evidence that was included in that affidavit that’s supported including Political Figure 1. That has a waterfall effect on the investigation because those emails that we’re searching for might not come through to the team.”

Shapley and Ziegler said they were not allowed to get cellphone geolocation data that could have proved Joe Biden was with his son in July 2017 when Hunter sent a threatening text message to a Chinese government-linked businessman saying, “I am sitting here with my father,” and warning of retribution.

Within 10 days of that message, $5.1 million flowed to accounts linked to Hunter and first brother James Biden from CEFC China Energy — after a tranche of $1 million earlier that year, less than two months after Biden left office as vice president.

A May 2017 email penciled in Joe Biden, referred to as the “big guy,” for a 10% cut from CEFC dealings.

The IRS whistleblowers say that — in addition to preferential treatment for Joe and Hunter Biden — Attorney General Merrick Garland misled Congress under oath about Weiss’ ability to independently bring criminal charges against Hunter Biden.

Biden-appointed US attorneys in Los Angeles and Washington have confirmed in testimony that they declined to partner with Weiss, who in August was elevated by Garland to be a special counsel, allowing him to bring charges independently outside of Delaware.

444,,,"Another billionaire, Len Blavatnik, joins growing list to yank donations to Harvard amid antisemitism, plagiarism scandals",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/billionaire-len-blavatnik-yanks-donations-to-harvard/,"Another billionaire has slapped his checkbook shut to Harvard University.

Businessman Len Blavatnik and his family foundation have paused their millions of dollars in funding to the Ivy League as it stands behind President Claudine Gay despite accusations she stood by as students spewed antisemitic rhetoric on campus, according to a report.

The Harvard Business School alumnus will halt his funding until the university directly addresses what he sees as rampant antisemitism at the school, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.

Blavatnik and his wife Emily have donated at least $270 million to Harvard, with about $200 million directly benefiting the medical school.

What it will take for the elite institution to win back the Access Industries founder’s financial support is unclear.

The Ukraine-born billionaire did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Harvard University also did not respond to emails.

Blavatnik, who is Jewish, is the latest of a string of heavy donors to pause donations to Harvard following its alleged failure to condemn the mass slaughter of Israelis by Hamas terrorists.

Former Victoria’s Secret CEO Les Wexner, whose foundation had given untold millions to Harvard over 34 years, cut ties with the university shortly after the Israel-Hamas war started in October.

Hedge funder Bill Ackman, also a business school alum, has repeatedly spoken out against the Ivy League, along with $500 million donor Ken Griffin.

The US government is also considering ways to strip billions of dollars in federal funding from the institution.

The backlash against the school has only ramped up following Gay’s disastrous testimony before Congress in which she said calls for genocide against Jewish people would only violate Harvard’s rules depending on their “context.”

Harvard has continued to stand behind Gay — who was also recently accused of 40 acts of plagiarizing other scholars’ work in a separate scandal — and has since apologized for her testimony.

The school is now being investigated by the federal Department of Education over whether it has breached the civil rights of Jewish students, which are protected under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

The millions of dollars in suspended gifts and federal funding would dramatically affect Harvard’s longstanding reputation, forcing the school to slash the level of donations that can secure admission.

One college counselor previously told The Post that a $2 million check might be the new $20 million.",

James Oliver, a 14-year-old student at Geneva High School, collapsed at West Chicago High School on Dec. 8, and suffered an AVM stroke and brain hemorrhage, school officials told parents in a letter.

He died on Sunday night after weeks in the hospital.

The teen’s sudden death has left the community stunned.

“He just brought me so much joy, as he did many other people,” swim coach Jennifer Heyer-Olson told ABC7 Chicago.

James Oliver, 14, died on Sunday after suffering a stroke at swim practice earlier this month. GoFundMe

“And I think when somebody passes away, you just wish more that you could have told them that.”

A family friend told the outlet that Oliver was born with a brain arteriovenous malformation — or AVM — a condition in which tangled blood vessels in the brain cause connections between arteries and veins, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

A neurosurgeon at Northwestern Medicine said that the condition is congenital and very rare.

“It’s thought that most AVMs are present from birth, and so we see a lot of AVMs either being diagnosed incidentally or being diagnosed because they bleed,” Dr. Matthew Potts told ABC7. “We see a lot of that in children, and teenagers and young adults.”

James Oliver was born with a brain arteriovenous malformation, according to family friends. Sharks for Heyer

“About half people diagnosed with AVM experience symptoms, while the other half don’t experience any symptoms until a rupture occurs,” Potts added.

The school community was informed of James’ death in an email on Monday.

“As a school community, our thoughts are with his brother, Sean, a GHS junior, his family and friends, and our hearts are mourning this loss,” the email read.

The two brothers were inseparable, according to the outlet.

Sean was also a member of the swim team and trained at Heyer-Olson’s home pool, the swim coach said. She grew close with the boys’ family, and the brothers would help her with chores while her husband battled a serious illness.

“Just delightful to be around, happy, polite, doing good, just doing kid things,” Heyer-Olson said.

“Summer mornings in the pool will never be the same without experiencing the brotherly love, silliness, and ongoing whispering (usually regarding trading cards) between Sean and James,” she told the Kane County Chronicle.",

“Get out, get out!” one Las Vegas cop is heard shouting at disgruntled professor Anthony Polito from a second-floor balcony at the school after the horrific Dec. 6 massacre.

Polito, 67 — wearing a long, black trench coat with one hand visible at his side — said nothing as he briskly walked by and headed for the door and into his final shootout with police.

The split-second sighting is buried in more than five hours of bodycam video released by the Las Vegas Metro Police Department this week from the massacre that left three UNLV professors dead and one other wounded.

The footage shows cops swarming the campus shortly after shots rang out around 11:45 a.m., combing through stairwells and hallways looking for the active shooter.

“Careful, careful,” one cop says. “Don’t rush it.

“Watch the doors,” he said as they moved down one hallway as alarms blare in the background. “Keep looking at the doors… He’s still active. Be careful. He’s still active.”

At one point a cop reports that “the suspect is down,” but the search of the massive building continued, with staffers and students periodically found cowering in classrooms.

During one grim exchange, an officer tells another, “I have bodies in here, like a lot. Every f–king floor.”

Police said three UNLV educators — Naoko Takemaru, 69; Cha Jan “Jerry” Chang, 64; and Patricia Navarro Velez, 39 — were killed during the shooting rampage.

The 38-year-old professor who was wounded has not been identified.

Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Polito was armed with a 9 mm handgun and nine magazines with more than 150 rounds when he stormed onto the campus.

The shooter had been turned down for a teaching position at the school and had been “struggling financially” — and had a “target list” of UNLV faculty members, WPLG-TV News reported.

County Undersheriff Andrew Walsh acknowledged to the Associated Press that cops had a brush encounter with Polito while searching the campus building but had no way of knowing he was the killer.

“They don’t have a description of the shooter at the time,” Walsh said. “And they know there are other police sources on the first floor.”

447,,,‘Pure torture’: Family of 9-year-old girl kidnapped from NY campground and held captive for days speaks out,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/charlotte-senas-family-speaks-out/,"The family of the 9-year-old girl who was abducted from an upstate New York camping ground three months ago is breaking its silence as the child tries to “resume her normal life” following the frightening, days-long ordeal.

The shocking kidnapping made national headlines when the child vanished while riding her bike around a small loop at Moreau Lake State Park, outside of Saratoga Springs during a family camping trip on Sept. 1.

The ordeal, which Gov. Kathy Hochul called “every parent’s worst nightmare,” came to an end roughly 48 hours later when authorities found her hiding in a cabinet inside the mobile home of local man Craig Nelson Ross Jr., 47, who lived just two miles from the girl’s home.

“You always say this type of stuff doesn’t happen to you but obviously it can happen to you,” Jené Sena, the victim’s aunt, told ABC News Thursday.

Sena, speaking on behalf of the of the family, asked the network not to publish the girl’s name or show her picture, even though her identity and likeness had been widely publicized after being the subject of an Amber Alert. The Post has honored the family’s request as well.

The woman said she “dropped to my knees, screaming” with relief when learning police had finally found her niece following a massive multi-agency manhunt.

“Pure torture, pure pure torture really, you’re thinking like, what if this doesn’t end soon? What if we can’t find her, all of the what ifs,” Sena said.

Ross had led police to the scene when he dropped a ransom letter in the family’s mailbox as troopers staked out the address.

He was initially charged only with first-degree kidnapping, but prosecutors added charges of predatory sexual assault against a child, along with charges of sexual abuse, assault and endangering the welfare of a child last month.

“Honestly, it’s been a roller coaster. She’s a child that didn’t ask for what happened to her. So, she’s trying to resume her normal life,” Sena said.

“Unfortunately, the world we live in, there are predators out there. And so justice will be not only him being safely away to not do this to anyone else, but also her having… a great support system and tools, and whatever she needs around her to move forward,” Sena said.

“This isn’t just a headline. This isn’t just something to get clicks. This is a real person, a real child, a real family,” she added.

The woman told the network that the young victim will be spending Christmas with her family and hoped her case would bring awareness to other abductions and increase “sensitivity” in the legal system.

448,,,"South Africa threatens prosecution, revoked citizenship for nationals who join IDF",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/south-africa-warns-nationals-its-illegal-to-join-idf-without-approval/,"South Africa issued a stark warning Monday against its civilians taking up arms with Israel, threatening prison time for those who do so without government approval.

Officials said they were “gravely concerned” by reports that the country’s nationals had joined the Israel Defense Forces in its war in Gaza against Hamas, adding that such action could violate domestic and international law.

“Any person joining the IDF without the necessary permission of the [National Conventional Arms Control Committee] is breaking the law and can be prosecuted,” South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement.

South Africans caught fighting in the IDF without approval could be thrown behind bars, while the punishment for naturalized nationals could result in their citizenship taken away, according to the country’s laws.

The warning made clear that the Republic of South Africa “does not support or agree with” Israel’s crusade against Hamas.

Last month, the country’s parliament voted to cut diplomatic ties with Israel shortly after it filed a referral to the International Criminal Court for an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza.

President Cyril Ramaphosa had previously accused Israel of war crimes and acts “tantamount to genocide” just three weeks into the war.

Although it had condemned Hamas for its Oct. 7 surprise attack that killed 1,200 people, Ramaphosa claimed Israel was illegally retaliating by punishing Palestinian civilians through unrelenting bombings and the deliberate denial of medicine, fuel, food and water.

Nearly 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

Talks for a second temporary truce between Israel and Hamas and hostage release negotiations apparently broke down Thursday after Hamas officials became incensed over Israel’s comments that the fighting will resume regardless of a cease-fire.

Hamas leaders claimed the Jewish state was trying to lure the group into a temporary pause rather than end the war that has left Gaza in shambles, pointing to recent comments made by Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicating the IDF would not stop fighting until Hamas is eradicated.

“Whoever thinks that we will stop is detached from reality,” he said Wednesday night. “We are continuing the war to the end. It will continue until Hamas is eliminated — until victory.”

The Jewish state believes that there are still 128 hostages in Gaza, not all of them alive, following the weeklong truce agreement that resulted in 105 captives being freed last month.",
449,,,Police called to Mass. middle school over ‘concerning illustrations’ in ‘Gender Queer’ book after anonymous complaint,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/police-called-to-mass-middle-school-over-concerning-illustrations-in-gender-queer-book-after-anonymous-complaint/,"A police officer was called to a Massachusetts middle school after receiving an anonymous complaint that a commonly banned book on gender expression was being read inside an eighth-grade classroom.

A plain-clothed officer, equipped with a body camera, was deployed to W.E.B. Du Bois Regional Middle School in Great Barrington on Dec. 8 to search for the highly controversial book: “Gender Queer”.

The award-winning graphic memoir by Maia Kobabe — which details the author’s exploration of sexuality and gender identity through adolescence into adulthood — was the most banned book across the country for two straight years, according to the American Library Association.

The Great Barrington Police Department received a complaint about “concerning illustrations” in the book that an eighth-grade teacher had made available to students in their classroom, Police Chief Paul Storti told Boston.com.

The anonymous complainant said the book had images of sexual acts.

Because the issue was filed with the police department, Storti said they had a “duty to examine” it further.

An officer arrived toward the end of the school day and, alongside the teacher, looked for the book but was unable to locate it.

District Superintendent Peter Dillion said in a statement that the book was “not a class text but a supplemental material that students can request to sign out.”

Police notified the Berkshire District Attorney’s Office, but the investigation was later dropped as the office determined it was a “matter to be managed within the Berkshire Hills Regional School District.”

Dillion said he had wished the concerned patron had come to the school district first before going to the police, as “we have systems to respond to concerns about curriculum.”

News of the incident spread wildly through Commonwealth State and even grabbed the attention of Governor Maura Healey, who said that “book banning has no place in Massachusetts,” according to Boston.com.

“That’s partly what is so concerning,” said Ruth Bourquin, a managing attorney for the ACLU of Massachusetts. “Police going into schools and searching for books is the sort of thing you hear about in communist China and Russia. What are we doing?”

The school’s librarian, Jennifer Guerin, said it was “critically important for concerned community members to remember that the current situation is not about forcing a book into students’ hands.”

“It’s about the freedom to read. It’s about providing voluntary access to a well-written, highly acclaimed resource in a safe place for a teenager who might want or need it,” she said, according to the Berkshire Eagle, which first reported the news.

Book bans have taken root in schools across the country, with Florida and Texas banning vast multitudes of books.

In August, one Texas school district pulled Anne Frank’s Diary, as well as the Bible after community members complained.

A Moms of Liberty chapter in Florida also got five books banned from a school district after arguing they had graphic depictions of sex, violence, pedophilia, bestiality, and other subject matters.",
450,,,Terror NYC tenant who displayed Hitler images in lobby now charged with scrawling ‘Kill Hamas Condo Board’ on building,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/metro/queens-property-manager-who-displayed-images-of-hitler-in-building-charged-with-hate-crime/,"A former Queens building manager who allegedly terrorized tenants and proudly displayed Nazi propaganda in the lobby has been charged with scrawling “Kill Hamas Condo Board” all over the property, prosecutors said Thursday.

Surveillance cameras allegedly caught Neal Milano, 76, using a black permanent marker to scrawl out the nasty message — as well as homophobic and sexist slurs — across eight walls on four separate floors of the Sunnyside building on Nov. 2, the Queens District Attorney’s Office said.

Milano was released without bail at his Thursday arraignment in Queens Supreme Court on a 10-count indictment, including for hate crime charges.

The accused creep, who at one point was the property manager of the 39th Place building, has long caused tensions there.

“He always seems intoxicated. He’s a real problem,” one of the residents, a man who asked to remain anonymous, told The Post on Thursday.

Milano allegedly spray-painted the vile missive about Hamas on every floor of the building, including in the stairwell, said the neighbor.

6 Surveillance cameras allegedly caught Milano using a black permanent marker to scrawl out the nasty message, as well as homophobic and sexist slurs across 8 walls on 4 separate floors of the Sunnyside building.

“Everybody pretty much feels the same. Everybody in the building wants him to leave,” he said.

In 2017, when Milano was the condo’s property manager, he filled the space with a strange mix of hyper-patriotic posters and images of Hitler and Mussolini, and tenants told The Post at the time that he ruled the building with an iron fist.

A year later, Milano was acquitted by a Queens judge of all counts after he was accused of repeatedly harassing a 43-year-old tenant, including grabbing her by the neck and arm, calling her slurs and threatening to “burn the building down.”

Before the ruling, he defended hanging Nazi and other imagery in the building lobby, saying, “It’s history! You can’t change history!”

“There was a picture of Hitler and the Nazi flag next to a bigger picture of Churchill and the British flag! It’s history, it’s WWII!” he said at the time.

The current super said that Milano was no longer the manager of the building, which was free of the eclectic decorations when The Post visited Thursday.

He and every other member of the condo-board have a restraining order out against Milano, the super said.

“He lives here but all he can do is come in and go out,” the super said.

“He was told by the judge he can go straight in and he can go to his apartment and when he leaves he has to come straight out, no stops. No, if he sees one of us he has to lower his gaze, look at the floor and continue out.”

6 Before the ruling, he defended hanging Nazi and other imagery in the building lobby, saying, “It’s history! You can’t change history!”

A woman who lives on Milano’s floor said she and her husband are “terrified” of him before pointing out his massive red pick-up that had every window, including the windshield, blacked out, and was creepily idling within earshot from where she spoke to The Post.

“The red pickup truck with the engine running across the street. That’s him, he’s watching you right now,” she said.

6 Neighbors described Milano as a terrifying and frequently drunk animal who constantly causes issues for the rest of the building.

The nervous neighbor said that Milano was “usually very drunk” and “getting in an argument with people.”

“He also writes ‘kill the super’ inside the trash chutes. He’s always screaming and cursing at the super,” she added.

The super, who said he was the one who called 911 on Milano over the vile graffiti, said the building received a fresh coat of paint to cover the missives after the police investigation concluded.

6 A woman who lives on Milano’s floor said she and her husband are “terrified” of him before pointing out his massive red pick-up that has every single window, including the windshield, blacked out.

Milano was charged with one count of criminal mischief in the third degree as a hate crime, one count of criminal mischief in the third degree and eight counts of making graffiti.

He faces up to seven years behind bars if convicted.

Milano’s defense attorney Kevin O’Donnell said that his client entered a not-guilty plea earlier Thursday.

“He looks forward to defending the charges,” O’Donnell said.

Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz slammed Milano’s alleged actions, saying, “Hateful and bias-motivated attacks have no place in our communities and this shameful aggression will not be tolerated.”

“The defendant will be held accountable for the serious charges against him,” Katz said in a statement.

Milano is scheduled to appear in court next on Jan. 30.",

“Mr. President, I believe you are guilty of treason and should be publicly hung,” Schneider, 63, wrote in the message that was screenshot by multiple outlets. “Your son too,” he added, presumably about Hunter.

“Your response is..? Sincerely, John Schneider,” he concluded.

The country singer reportedly wrote the tweet in response to the current president’s message, which reads, “Trump poses many threats to our country: The right to choose, civil rights, voting rights, and America’s standing in the world. But the greatest threat he poses is to our democracy. If we lose that, we lose everything.”

When contacted by The Post for comment, Schneider defended his words.

“Seriously, folks? This is my final comment on this. I neither said nor implied any such thing. Despite headlines claiming otherwise, in my post, I absolutely did not call for an act of violence or threaten a U.S. president as many other celebrities have done in the past. I suggest you re-read my actual post and pay attention to the words before believing this nonsense.”

He continued, “It’s my position, which I am entitled to have, that some of our nations leaders in Washington have lost their way, and corruption runs rampant, both on our nation’s borders and abroad. Transparency and accountability must happen in order for our constitutional republic to survive. There is no threat implied or otherwise in that statement. “

The Secret Service also told The Post in a statement, “The Secret Service is aware of the comments made by Mr. Schneider, and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence. We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.”

Schneider has never shied away from expressing his distaste for the president, 81, claiming in an October tweet that he “funded the Hamas barbaric and inhumane attack on Israel.”

In 2018, he told Fox News that there was “a bias against conservatives, Republicans, in Hollywood,” which he believed was why he was serving jail time for failing to pay alimony to his estranged ex-wife, Elvira Castle.

Schneider’s most recent comment comes just one day after he came in second as Donut on “The Masked Singer” to R&B singer Ne-Yo, who was dressed as Cow for the show.

The actor claimed the Fox program is “really the glue that held me together for the last couple of months” as he is grieving his wife, Alicia, who died of breast cancer in February.

“It was one of the shows that Alicia really wanted me to do,” Schneider told People. “She would always say, ‘You’ve got to do ‘The Masked Singer.’ I fully expected one day for Alicia to be there to help … so when that opportunity came, I just had to kind of look toward heaven and kind of laugh because, of course, she still runs things but further away. And then, when they said, ‘We’d kind of like you to be a Donut.'”

He continued, “Every Saturday, Alicia would go down to our local donut store, get me a bag of apple fritters. And I would eat one, only one, but donuts had been part of my life. For a long time, they were part of Alicia’s and I’s marriage and relationship. So again, they said, ‘Donut,’ and I just had to look up at the sky and go, ‘Well, of course. This is you. It’s got to be you.'”",

That’s according to the man himself, who told the New York Times in a story published Thursday that “I have found out over the last couple years … that the right, and now the left, are hoping that I die.

“There are ones that are rooting for another blood clot,” the Pennsylvania Democrat added, referencing his near-fatal stroke from last year. “They have both now been wishing that I die.”

Once beloved by the far left, Fetterman, 54, has rankled many activists with his staunch support of Israel following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, and now insists that he’s “not a progressive.”

In response, disgruntled left-wingers have referred to him with the X hashtag “#GenocideJohn” and some have even berated him in person.

The hulking Pennsylvanian, famous for strutting around the Senate in oversized shorts and hoodies, bemoaned what he described as “purity tests” set by his former fellow travelers.

“It’s just a place where I’m not,” he told the Times. “I don’t feel like I’ve left the [progressive] label; it’s just more that it’s left me.”

“I’m not critical if someone is a progressive … I just believe in different things.”

Back in 2016, Fetterman backed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) bid for the presidency and billed himself as “a Democrat and a progressive.”

He later endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after Sanders exited the race.

“This bizarre purity thing, where people were offended that I was embracing Secretary Clinton when we have Trump on the other side?” Fetterman reflected. “How did that work out for you?”

As mayor of Braddock, Pa. and then as lieutenant governor of the Keystone State, the Democrat earned a reputation for backing many far-left wish list items.

Fetterman insists that he still wants federal legalization of marijuana, a $15 national minimum wage, and universal healthcare.

But his support of Israel and recent admission that he doesn’t believe “it’s unreasonable to have a secured border” have rubbed some on his side of the aisle the wrong way.

“Whenever I’m in a situation to be called on to take up the cause of strengthening and enhancing the security of Israel or deepening our relationship between the United States and Israel, I’m going to lean in,” Fetterman told Jewish Insider in April of last year.

“I would also respectfully say that I’m not really a progressive in that sense.”

On Thursday, he expressed bewilderment to the Times that “the very left progressives in America don’t seem to want to support really the only progressive nation in the [Middle East] that really embraces the same kind of values I would expect we would want as a society.”

“I’m not really sure,” he added, “what part of any of this would be a surprise if anyone’s been paying attention.”",

When researchers sought volunteers for the study, mostly women raised their hands “because for them it’s much more socially acceptable to cry,” Ph.D. student Shani Agron, who spearheaded the work, said in a statement.

However, the researchers hypothesized that the tears don’t need to come from a woman to have a similar effect.

Previous studies with rodents found that female mouse tears reduce fighting among male mice, and male mole rats smear themselves with their own tears to avoid being attacked by alpha mice, the Weizmann Institute noted.

Scientists said other research also shows that sniffing tears reduces testosterone.

“Given previous findings showing lower testosterone levels in men following sniffing tears and the findings in rodents showing that tears reduce aggression, we hypothesized that tears would act the same in humans; however, we were surprised by the size of the effect in the lab,” Agron told Newsweek.

After collecting tears from six female volunteers who watched sad films, researchers exposed dozens of men to the tears or a saline liquid.

They couldn’t distinguish between the substances since both are clear and odorless.

The men then played a computer game, used in other aggression studies, with players collecting money that their opponent attempts to steal from them.

Players can get revenge and make their opponent lose money, even though they wouldn’t gain more money for themselves.

After smelling women’s tears, the men’s desire to seek revenge fell 43.7%.

These results are similar to the study findings involving rodents, but unlike rodents, humans don’t have a structure in their noses that detects odorless chemical signals.

The researchers dug deeper by studying 62 olfactory receptors, which play a key role in the sense of smell, finding that four were activated by tears, but not saline.

They also hooked study participants to MRI machines and noted that after smelling tears, the areas of the brain linked to aggression — the prefrontal cortex and the anterior insula — were less active.

Scientists believe that the substance of tears may have evolved to protect babies from harm.

“Babies can’t say: ‘Stop being aggressive towards me.’ They are very limited in their ability to communicate, and they are helpless as well. They have a vested interest in lowering aggression and that reflects the sad reality of aggression towards babies,” Noam Sobel, a Weizmann professor of neurobiology, told the Guardian.

Dr. Minna Lyons, a Liverpool John Moores University psychologist, told the Guardian that the findings are “remarkable,” but people shouldn’t draw significant conclusions.

“In real life, things may play out differently. The tears of the target of domestic violence may do little in reducing aggression of the perpetrator. Why does the chemosignaling not work in these circumstances?” she said.

“The social context of crying is massively complicated, and I suspect the reduction of aggression is just one of the many potential functions of tears,” Lyons added.",
454,,,IDF destroys Hamas tunnel in Palestine Square where leaders hid during Oct. 7 attack,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/idf-destroys-hamas-tunnel-in-palestine-square-where-leaders-hid-during-oct-7-attack/,"The IDF blew up an extensive Hamas tunnel system hidden beneath Gaza’s Palestine Square where terrorist leaders hid during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel — as officials said the ground offensive in the north is nearing an end.

The Israeli military released video Thursday of a huge series of explosions demolishing the tunnels in the upscale Rimal neighborhood in Gaza City that once housed Hamas’ upper echelons.

Col. Benny Aharon, who gave a tour to reporters two days before the demolition, said the homes and offices of Hamas’ top Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar and military chief Muhammad Deif were linked to the tunnel network, The Times of Israel reports.

Also located in the ritzy neighborhood was the home of the daughter of Hamas’ top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh.

The Jewish state believes Sinwar and Deif were operating in the tunnels beneath Palestine Square when their forces stormed Israel on Oct. 7, slaughtering 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 240 others.

5 The tunnels were in the wealthy Rimal neighborhood, which housed Hamas’ top leaders. IDF

The IDF located about 20 tunnel shafts that led to the Palestine Square underground network, with some entrances located just a few feet from the main traffic circle of the neighborhood.

Aharon told reporters that the electricity used throughout the tunnels was available because Hamas siphoned power from civilian generators and solar panels, with enough energy stolen to allow terrorists to “survive down there for months.”

Given its location and size in such a populated area, Aharon claimed it was “not possible that people did not know what was going on here.”

5 Inside the tunnel system, the IDF found several Hamas weapons and equipment. IDF

Along with the electrical system, the IDF found several weapons in the tunnels, including guns, rockets and equipment for nighttime operations.

The destruction of the tunnel was carried out by Aharon’s 401st Armored Brigade, along with the elite Yahalom combat engineering unit, which have decimated Hamas’ forces in northern Gaza.

After nearly two months of fighting across northern Gaza, the IDF said Wednesday night that its ground offensive in the area is nearing its end as only a handful of Hamas bases remain.

5 The tunnel system beneath Palestine Square had about 20 major entrances. IDF

Over the past 24 hours, the IDF said it has carried out airstrikes against 230 Hamas targets.

The United Nations estimates that more than 1.8 million Palestinians, 85% of the population, have been displaced by the war after fleeing northern Gaza.

The UN added that nearly 20% of all of Gaza’s buildings and infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli strikes.",
455,,,"US, China military leaders hold first call in more than a year",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/us-china-military-leaders-hold-first-call-in-more-than-a-year/,"WASHINGTON – The top military officials from the US and China held a long-awaited call Thursday, ending a 16-month standoff during which Beijing cut all armed forces contacts with Washington.

Chief of the Joint Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown and his counterpart, Gen. Liu Zhenli of China’s Joint Staff, spoke via videoconference to discuss “a number of global and regional security issues,” according to the Pentagon.

“General Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain open and direct lines of communication,” Joint Staff Spokesperson Navy Capt. Jereal Dorsey said in a statement.

“Gen. Brown reiterated the importance of the People’s Liberation Army engaging in substantive dialogue to reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings,” he added.

It was the first time that any Pentagon official has spoken with a Chinese military leader since August 2022, when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a controversial trip to Taiwan.

The move infuriated China – which has said its No. 1 goal is to absorb the island – and Beijing cut off dialogue with the US.

The call came about a month after President Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping while the two were in San Francisco for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

Resuming military-to-military communications was one of the major agreements to come out of the hours-long meeting.

Critical calls

During China’s silent treatment, defense officials repeatedly bemoaned the lack of contact between the two adversaries, calling it dangerous to close lines of communication in the event of a close call, troubling interaction, or other misunderstanding.

5 “General Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain open and direct lines of communication,” Navy Capt. Jereal Dorsey said in a statement. AP

“Beijing has consistently denied or ignored US requests for defense engagements at multiple levels,” the Defense Department said. “Those concerns have been amplified as US officials observe increasingly provocative and risky behavior on the part of China’s military.“

The point was made clear early this year when the US military detected a Chinese spy balloon entering US airspace.

Beijing ignored the Pentagon’s calls seeking an explanation, opting to publicly deny intentionally sending the balloon into US airspace and claiming it was a civilian airship that blew off course.

The balloon ultimately traversed US airspace from Alaska to North Carolina, where the Air Force finally shot down the surveillance craft after its weeklong trip over the country, irking Beijing.

While Thursday’s call brought optimism, Pentagon spokesman Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to say whether Liu had agreed to continue regular communication or reactivate the military-to-military emergency hotline.

“I’m not going to speak for China, but clearly … we’re going to continue to do everything we can do to keep those lines of communication open,” he said.

Still, Dorsey said Brown advocated during the call for regular conversations on “defense policy coordination” and opening communications between the commanders of the US Indo-Pacific Command and China’s eastern and southern theater commands.

Avoiding unintentional conflict

Brown also called for resuming the countries’ commitments to the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement, which was signed in 1998 and established a routine of regular talks between the two nations on maritime safety until the US-China relationship soured in 2020.

Maritime talks are critical to maintaining peace in the western Pacific, where the US Navy regularly patrols and challenges Beijing’s illegal claims to islands and reefs in the South China Sea.

There have been multiple close calls and dangerous encounters between the two nations’ navies over the past year as the Chinese military attempted to chase away US ships in international waters.

“China respects the rights of navigation and overflight entitled to all countries in the South China Sea in accordance with international law,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang. “However, we firmly oppose any action that undermines China’s sovereignty and security in the name of freedom of navigation and overflight.”

Such risks also extend to the air. Between 2021 and 2023, the US saw China conduct more than 180 “coercive and risky air intercepts” with American military aircraft in the region, according to the Pentagon’s latest China Military Power report.

“Defense officials have noted a steep rise in China’s risky and aggressive intercepts of US aircraft operating in international airspace in accordance with international law,” according to the DoD.

Should lines of communication remain open, the Pentagon hopes to avoid miscalculations after such encounters that otherwise could unintentionally spark conflict – or even war.

While Brown “regularly communicates with chiefs of defense across the world,” Dorsey said, it was the first time he had such a high-profile call since taking over the position from Army Gen. Mark Milley in September.

“[He] remains open to constructive dialogue with the PRC,” said Dorsey, using the official acronym for China.",

House Education and Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) wrote a letter on Wednesday to Harvard Corporation senior fellow Penny Pritzker demanding internal documents and communications about the scandal.

Foxx’s letter questions whether the university’s governing body is holding Gay to “the same standards” as students after her work was flagged for dozens of instances of copying other academics — including portions of her 1997 Ph.D. thesis.

The Post first contacted Harvard about the seemingly improper citations nearly two months ago — and was subsequently threatened with a defamation suit if it published a story based on the allegations.

As part of the probe, Foxx has requested any records about the university’s “public response to media inquiries.”

House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY), another member of the committee and a Harvard alumna, has also vowed to exercise “every tool at our disposal including subpoena power” to hold Gay accountable.

“Harvard University’s pathetic record of stifling free speech has expanded beyond campus, threatening the New York Post following their investigation and coverage of Claudine Gay’s history of serial plagiarism,” Stefanik told The Post Thursday.

“This attempt at bullying and subsequent censorship is entirely unacceptable; the Congressional investigation will use every tool at our disposal including subpoena power to expose the rot of antisemitism plaguing higher education and the hypocrisy of the poisoned ivy towers of Harvard. This is a reckoning.”

The committee letter also notes that Harvard’s federal funding is conditioned on its compliance with standards of academic integrity overseen by the New England Commission of Higher Education and asks the university to “provide assurance” those standards are being upheld by handing over records.

“If a university is willing to look the other way and not hold faculty accountable for engaging in academically dishonest behavior, it cheapens its mission and the value of its education,” Foxx wrote. “Students must be evaluated fairly, under known standards — and have a right to see that faculty are, too.”

The investigation comes after Gay was hauled before Congress Dec. 5 to testify about antisemitism on Harvard’s campus, during which she was pressed by Stefanik about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violated the university’s codes of conduct related to bullying and harassment.

Gay said allowance for the speech would depend on “context,” refusing to give a yes-or-no answer and adding that the words only could warrant action if it rose to the level of bullying, harassment and intimidation.

“Without sufficient action from the Harvard Corporation, the ‘depends on the context president’ will also be forever marred as the ‘plagiarism president,’ and a great stain will mark Harvard’s legacy,” Foxx said in a statement.

“While the antisemitism and plagiarism investigations being conducted by the Committee are separate and distinct, they both raise questions of hypocrisy in academia. In this case, how could a serial plagiarizer like Claudine Gay hold a student accountable for plagiarism ever again?”

On Oct. 24, The Post contacted Harvard about 27 instances of Gay’s plagiarism in two academic papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 2011 and 2017, as well as an academic magazine article from 1993.

7 “Without sufficient action from the Harvard Corporation, the ‘depends on the context president’ will also be forever marred as the ‘plagiarism president,’ and a great stain will mark Harvard’s legacy,” Foxx said in a statement. AP

The university’s senior executive director of media relations and communications, Jonathan Swain, a former Hillary Clinton aide and member of the Biden-Harris transition team, responded he would “get back in touch over the next couple of days.”

The next communication The Post received, on Oct. 27, was from Thomas Clare, a Virginia-based defamation lawyer with the firm Clare-Locke who shared a 15-page letter with comments from the academics cited by Gay denying she plagiarized their work.

Clare further threatened The Post with a lawsuit if a story about any plagiarism allegations went to press.

However, the Clare letter was sent two days before the Harvard Corporation had even begun an internal review of Gay’s potential plagiarism, according to the university’s student newspaper.

Harvard’s governing body asked a four-person subcommittee and three-person independent panel of experts to separately investigate the allegations.

On Wednesday, Harvard announced the joint review found “examples of duplicative language without appropriate attribution” in Gay’s 1997 doctoral dissertation, but concluded it did not rise to the level of plagiarism, the Boston Globe reported.

“President Gay will update her dissertation correcting these instances of inadequate citation,” a summary of the review stated.

That same day, however, Harvard received more than 40 new allegations of plagiarism against Gay in a 37-page document, which was obtained and first reported on by the Washington Free Beacon.

The firestorm has only added to calls from members of the House Education and Workforce Committee to conduct a thorough investigation of Harvard, its president and its policies.

“Harvard has been terrified of losing donations and taxpayer funding since they were exposed for harboring antisemitism,” Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who sits on the committee, told The Post.

“Claudine Gay claimed to support free speech and truthful inquiry in her congressional testimony, but now the university is threatening journalists and lying to protect its reputation and over $50 billion endowment. It’s shameful.”",
457,,,Norwegian cruise ship with 266 passengers loses power,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/norwegian-cruise-ship-carrying-261-passengers-loses-maneuverability/,"A Norwegian cruise ship lost power when a “rogue wave” smashed windows on the bridge as it sailed in the North Sea with 266 passengers aboard Thursday.

The cruise ship Maud, en route to England, lost its ability to navigate after its electricity went out, the Danish Joint Rescue Coordination Centre said, according to Reuters.

Punishing winds shattered windows on the bridge of the vessel, causing water to flood in.

A “temporary loss of power” occurred after Maud was struck by a “rogue wave,” ship owner HX told The Post in a statement.

The ship, which also had 131 crew members on it, was sailing from Floroe in Norway to Tilbury in the UK, a centre spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the Danish Joint Rescue Coordination Centre said that the “situation is under control” and the ship is being steered manually from the engine room, though it can’t navigate.

Authorities plan on towing the vessel to a Danish port around 10:30 p.m. local time overseas.

The cruise company said “no serious passenger or crew injuries” were reported due to the incident and the ship’s condition is “stable.”

“In line with our robust operational protocols, in addition to assuring the wellbeing of all aboard, the crew immediately conducted thorough safety checks and technical assessments,” HX said.

“Further assessments are now being made for onward sailing. The ship is in direct contact with the relevant maritime authorities and shoreside support teams.”

Tyler Anderson, 30, of Dover, now faces three counts of transmitting an interstate threat and could receive 15 years in prison if convicted on all charges, according to court documents.

Anderson was initially arrested Dec. 9 and charged with threatening graphic violence a day earlier in response to a Ramaswamy campaign message advertising an appearance in Portsmouth.

“Great, another opportunity for me to blow [Ramaswamy’s] brains out!,” Anderson allegedly replied, adding in a subsequent message: “I’m going to kill everyone who attends and then f— their corpses.”

The new charges relate to messages Anderson allegedly sent Nov. 22 in which he threatened to “impale” and “disembowel” one candidate, and a Dec. 6 message to a third campaign in which he said, “now I know where to go so I can blow that bastard’s head off” and added, “Hope you have the stamina for a mass shooting!”

The other two candidates allegedly threatened by Anderson were not identified by prosecutors, but the Dec. 6 message answered by Anderson used slogans associated with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Anderson was released on bail last week after his defense team contended he had no intention of following through on the threats, according to WMUR-TV.

The judge agreed, noting the defendant has no prior record, but insisted that Anderson take mental health medication, enroll in a mental health program, avoid contact of any kind with presidential candidates and not possess any weapons.

460,,,Our child has ADHD — the Adderall shortage is costing our family $280 more a month we can’t afford,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/lifestyle/adderall-shortage-costing-family-280-more-a-month-it-cant-afford/,"A nationwide shortage of drugs that treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has forced some patients to shell out hundreds more for pricey, brand-name alternatives.

A new analysis from USA Today found that the prices that retail community pharmacies pay for common ADHD medications have outpaced inflation, and in some cases, have doubled or tripled in the last year.

The Food and Drug Administration announced a shortage of Adderall in October 2022 due to “ongoing intermittent manufacturing delays” at companies that make the drug.

According to recent studies, an estimated 6 million children and 11 million adults suffer from ADHD. Adderall is a popular stimulant prescribed to improve focus and attention.

The Adderall shortage spurred patients to seek out alternatives — in turn, those ADHD meds became hard to find and prices increased.

A Delaware mom — whose husband and 17-year-old daughter also have ADHD — told USA Today that the Adderall shortage prompted their doctor to switch her daughter’s prescription to Vyvanse, the only option they could find.

The mom — whom USA Today only identified by her first name, Sam — shared that the monthly amount they pay after insurance rose from less than $20 to $300.

Without insurance, a supply of 100 capsules of Vyvanse costs around $1,306, according to Drugs.com.

GoodRx, which provides coupons for medications, says generic Vyvanse costs $100, while the brand-name Vyvanse starts at $369, which is slightly higher than the cost of brand-name Adderall.

Sam told USA Today that ADHD medication is now too expensive for herself and her husband — their daughter’s health and education are the top priorities.

“With medication and accommodations at school, my daughter is a straight-A student. Without the medication, she’s failing,” Sam explained. “It’s that stark of a difference.”

In addition to the price surge, Sam said there ends up being an “additional ADHD tax” since they have to travel far distances to pharmacies that have the drugs in stock.

“You can’t really compare it, but if there was a shortage of cancer drugs, there would be a lot more uproar than there is with the shortage of ADHD medication because people don’t seem to realize this is a disability,” Sam said. “It is very debilitating. It does have quite an impact on your quality of life.”

As far as the ADHD drug shortage goes, USA Today reports that the Drug Enforcement Administration said it has been adjusting its quota restrictions to increase production of ADHD stimulants.

“DEA has been in communication with the relevant manufacturers, and 17 out of 18 manufacturers have informed us that they will use their allotted quota amounts and increase production of stimulant medications,” the agency wrote in a letter early last month.",

Political science professor Dr. Carol Swain, formerly of Vanderbilt University, claims Gay used sections of a book she published in 1993 and an article published in 1997 without crediting her.

“Fire Claudine Gay posthaste,” Swain posted Thursday on X, as part of a post titled “Some free unsolicited advice for Harvard University.”

“She can be relieved of duties until the terms are negotiated.

“Hire the best man or woman who can steer the university back towards sanity.”

She also told the Ivy League college it needs to stop “appeasing the Marxist identity politics mob,” saying it “should not be a consideration,” in their decision-making processes.

Harvard University did not respond to a request for comment from The Post Thursday.

Swain also urged the prestigious Ivy League school to “apologize to alumni, students, parents, and donors who have been harmed and embarrassed.”

“Have a sit-down conversation with the people who have been harmed by the plagiarism of Gay and the system that protects her,” Swain continued.

She added she was “weighing [her] options” in response to a question from a follower about whether she planned to take legal action against Gay.

Plagiarism allegations against Gay first surfaced earlier this month, with accusations that she lifted other scholars’ works in her 1997 doctoral thesis and that four papers published between 1993 and 2017 did not include proper attribution.

Gay remains president of the college and an investigation by the university cleared her of research misconduct.

Although she will update attribution in three instances of her work, the university said it is standing by her on Thursday, according to the Wall Street Journal.

An earlier statement on December 12 from the Harvard Corporation, the school’s highest governing body, said officials became aware of claims of plagiarism in late October and had initiated an independent review. That found no misconduct, and a review deemed further plagiarism claims submitted earlier this week “without merit,” according to the WSJ.

In the aftermath of that statement, The Post revealed how Harvard had actually covered up a weeks-long investigation into whether Gay had used other researchers’ work without crediting it and hired a bulldog law firm to help cover it up.

In a statement to the Boston Globe, Gay has vehemently defended her academic rigor, saying: “I stand by the integrity of my scholarship. Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards.”

Swain previously blasted Gay in an essay for the same newspaper, in which she wrote: “Ms. Gay had no problem riding on the coattails of people whose work she used without proper attribution. Many of those whose work she pilfered aren’t as incensed as I am. They are elites who have benefited from a system that protects its own.”

The plagiarism allegations have attracted the attention of Congress, with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce expanding an already existing investigation into antisemitism on the college campus to include the accusations of plagiarism, according to the Harvard Crimson.

Gay was already under fire over her handling of antisemitic behavior on campus following the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel and her responses at a separate congressional hearing about them where she refused to condemn Harvard students calling for the genocide of Jews.

In the ensuing firestorm, a bipartisan group of members of Congress introduced a resolution calling for Gay to resign from her position, but the college also stood by her at that time too.",
462,,,Ron DeSantis calls Trump indictments biggest regret of the campaign: ‘Distorted the primary’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/ron-desantis-reveals-his-biggest-regret-of-the-campaign/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis opened up Thursday about the one thing he wishes he could change about the 2024 campaign: Donald Trump’s legal trouble.

DeSantis ripped the four indictments against the 77-year-old as unfair and lamented that they had “distorted” the GOP primary process — while also warning that they could spell doom for Trump in the general election.

“I wish Trump hadn’t been indicted on any of this stuff,” DeSantis told Christian Broadcasting Network host David Brody.

“From [Manhattan DA] Alvin Bragg on, I’ve criticized the cases … that’s distorting justice, which is bad, but I also think it distorted the primary.”

The 45-year-old posited that the indictments both turbocharged Trump’s support among Republican voters and prevented his rivals from getting traction in the race.

“It also has just crowded out so much other stuff, and it’s sucked out a lot of oxygen,” DeSantis said.

Bragg secured the first indictment against Trump in late March, charging him with 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments to former adult film star Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal.

At that time, polls showed DeSantis within sight of Trump in the race for the Republican nomination.

But from the time of the first indictment, Trump’s lead has skyrocketed to the current 52.2-point spread in the RealClearPolitics average.

In all, Trump faces 91 criminal counts in two federal cases, a state case out of Georgia and the Manhattan case.

“I think the Democrats have had a plan on this,” DeSantis told Brody. “I think the media has a plan on this. And I think if it gets to the point where six months from now, Trump’s the presumptive nominee and he’s having to go through all this, they have a plan for how they’re going to ride this out.”

On Wednesday, the Sunshine State Republican criticized the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove the 45th president from the primary ballot, echoing a similar concern.

“They’re doing all this stuff to basically solidify support in the primary for him, get him into the general,” he said at a campaign stop in Iowa. “And the whole general election is going to be all this legal stuff.”

DeSantis has campaigned aggressively in Iowa, seeking to build momentum against Trump ahead of the Jan. 15 caucuses.

The Florida governor has scored coveted endorsements from Gov. Kim Reynolds and evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats.

However, the RCP average shows Trump leading DeSantis by 32.7 percentage points.

“Trump does obviously have a certain segment that’s very strong,” he explained. “A lot of these people, though, that come up in these polls, a lot of them are soft. I mean, they remember him, they liked his policies, but they are willing to vote for somebody else.”

Throughout the campaign, DeSantis has tried to drive home a message that Trump failed to deliver on his promises and would likely lose in the general election.

“Obviously, Trump could win the primary,” he told CBN. “I’m not convinced he can win the general.”

“Ron DeSanctus has plenty of things he wishes he could have changed, from hiring Jeff Roe to run his super PAC, to wearing awkward lifts in his shoes, to announcing his campaign on Spaces that was bangled from the start, to hiring his personal cronies with no presidential experience,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told The Post in response.

“But above all, he probably wishes he wouldn’t have run in the first place so he wouldn’t have to humiliate himself on the campaign trail every single day.”",
463,,,California drunk driver pleads guilty after crashing into anti-drunk driving sign,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/drunk-driver-pleads-guilty-after-hitting-dui-warning-sign/,"A woman has pleaded guilty in California to driving under the influence after she crashed into a sign warning motorists against drunk driving.

Clarissa Hernandez, 27, from Texas, had downed a pint of tequila minutes before getting behind the wheel of her Land Rover early Aug. 11 and plowing into an electronic signboard in Palm Springs that read, “Don’t Drink & Drive,” according to a police statement.

The impact of the crash shattered the sign, but cops said the situation could have been much worse because the sloshed driver had narrowly avoided colliding with a group of pedestrians leaving a nearby theater.

Officers who were posted at the checkpoint near the crash scene ran over and saw Hernandez staggering away from her wrecked vehicle.

“Her eyes were bloodshot, red and watery, and her speech was slurred. She swayed forward and back continuously,” read an incident report cited by the station KESQ.

Hernandez even leaned on the smashed sign resting on its side to steady herself as she walked, police said.

Far from showing remorse for what happened, the woman was described in the report as “angry, argumentative and hostile.”

When questioned about her alcohol intake, Hernandez reportedly admitted that she had imbibed the tequila just 10 minutes before careening into the sign.

At one point, Hernandez allegedly swung a hand at an officer who tried to stop her from leaving the crash scene.

On Wednesday, Hernandez pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count each of driving under the influence of alcohol and willfully resisting, and was sentenced to three years of probation.",
464,,,Travel chaos in the UK as strong winds from Storm Pia disrupt holiday travel just days before Christmas,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/travel-chaos-in-the-uk-as-strong-winds-from-storm-pia-disrupt-holiday-travel-just-days-before-christmas/,"LONDON — High winds from Storm Pia on Thursday grounded flights in parts of the U.K., suspended train service and stopped Scottish ferries in a preview of holiday travel disruptions likely to hit northern Europe as the storm moved east.

Meanwhile, in a development unrelated to weather, a surprise strike by French workers added to the travel chaos by shutting down Eurostar trains between London and Paris, leaving thousands of travelers stranded.

Powerful gusts knocked out power to tens of thousands of homes in northern England, toppled a truck on a highway in Manchester, tore part of the roof off an apartment building in Sheffield and — in a bit of good news — helped generate a record amount of electricity.

A gust of 115 mph was recorded on Cairngorm Summit in the Scottish Highlands as the national meteorological service warned of winds up to 80 mph in northern Scotland and 55 mph in northern England and Northern Ireland. There was also an ice and snow warning for the Shetland Islands, where schools were closed.

The storm struck as travelers took to the roads, rails and skies to get ahead of holiday traffic expected to peak Friday.

As wind warnings expired Thursday afternoon, the storm bore down on Europe and was expected to bring similar troubles there.

Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport warned that “a significant number of flights” would be delayed or canceled due to the high winds.

Dutch authorities closed a number of storm barriers on major rivers as a precaution due to high water levels.

The storm was expected to reach southern Sweden on Thursday evening with a thunderstorm, heavy snowfall and poor visibility across the region, the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute said.

In Germany, national railway operator Deutsche Bahn said there were delays and cancelations to trains in Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony, the two biggest states on the North Sea coast. Lines affected included those from Hannover to Berlin and Frankfurt, and from Hamburg to and from western Germany and Denmark.

The Federal Office for Shipping and Hydrography warned of a possible storm surge Thursday evening on the North Sea coast, which could bring water levels up to 2.5 meters (8.20 feet) higher than mean high tide. Some ferries to or from North Sea islands were canceled for Thursday or Friday.

In the U.K., gusts knocked down trees that blocked roads and struck power lines, causing blackouts to 40,000 households in northeast England, energy company Northern Powergrid said.

A driver was hospitalized when a tree crashed onto his car in Clifton, Derbyshire.

The winds generated a record of 21.8 gigawatts of electricity, supplying 56% of all the power that was being used from the grid in Great Britain between 8 and 8:30 a.m., National Grid Electricity System Operator said. It surpassed the previous record of 21.6 gigawatts.

British Airways grounded two dozen flights, British broadcaster Sky News reported. A spokesperson for the airline did not provide further details but issued a statement saying it apologized to customers for having to “make some adjustments” to its schedule.

National Rail said speed restrictions for trains were in place across Scotland, and parts of England and Wales. ScotRail said it suspended service on some of its lines, and TransPennine Express asked train passengers to delay their journeys in and out of Edinburgh through most of the day.

Ferry operator CalMac canceled its service to 22 islands off the west coast of Scotland.",
465,,,Iowa Republicans more likely to back Trump after ‘poisoning the blood’ rant: poll,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/iowans-more-likely-to-back-trump-after-poisoning-the-blood-rant-poll/,"A plurality of likely Iowa Republican caucusgoers say former President Donald Trump’s recent comment that illegal immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” make them more likely to support him, a new poll shows.

A Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom survey found 42% said the statement made them more likely to caucus for Trump, while 28% said the rant made them less likely to back the 77-year-old.

Another 29% said the comment “did not matter,” and 2% were unsure.

Trump made the remarks to supporters at a Dec. 16 rally in Durham, NH, while heavily inflating the number of illegal immigrants who have entered the US since President Biden took office.

“When they let, I think the real number is 15, 16 million people into our country, when they do that, we got a lot of work to do,” the 45th president said. “They’re poisoning the blood of our country. That’s what they’ve done.”

Politicians on both sides of the aisle have since denounced the rhetoric — even as Trump doubled down days later at a Waterloo, Iowa, rally.

“I don’t believe, as the former president said again yesterday, that immigrants are polluting our blood,” Biden responded in a Wednesday speech at the Wisconsin Black Chamber of Commerce in Milwaukee. “The economy and our nation are stronger when we tap into the full range of talents in this nation.”

Vice President Kamala Harris said in an interview later that night with MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell that people have “rightfully” found Trump’s words “similar to the language” of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.

6 “I don’t believe, as the former president said again yesterday, that immigrants are polluting our blood,” President Biden responded in a Wednesday speech. AP

Hitler’s 1925 autobiography-manifesto “Mein Kampf” speaks about the “poison” of “foreign blood” being introduced into the “national body” of Germany, which he said would dilute the “purity” of the Aryan race.

Trump has since said he “never read ‘Mein Kampf’” and argued that his comments were made “in a much different way,” adding that illegal immigration brought crime and disease across the border.

“I don’t know what this means with the blood stuff. I know people are trying to draw historical allusions. I don’t know if that what he meant,” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is likely Iowa Republican voters’ second choice for president, according to the Des Moines Register/NBC/Mediacom poll.

“We need a nominee who’s going to be able to press the case against Biden’s failures without getting involved in, and stepping in it, or doing things that are going to divert attention,” he told Fox News.

“Because now the media is focused on, ‘What did he mean by that?’ instead of focusing on why Biden is failing.”

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is in third place behind DeSantis in Iowa, said the words were “more of the chaos and distraction we’re trying to get rid of.”

“We need to secure the border; we need to make sure that we start catch-and-deport instead of catch-and-release,” Haley told Fox News. “All of those things we need to do — and we can do it without the rhetoric.”

“Let’s fix the border without saying things that are gonna get people riled up,” she added.

Other Republicans mentioned family members who came to the US legally as immigrants, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose wife served in the Trump administration.

“It strikes me that didn’t bother him when he appointed Elaine Chao secretary of transportation,” McConnell said of his wife, who was born in Taiwan and became a naturalized US citizen as a teen.

The Iowa poll also found that 43% of GOP caucusgoers were more likely to vote for Trump after he said “radical left thugs that live like vermin” in the US need to be rooted out, and 50% were more likely to support him after he pledged to authorize “sweeping raids, giant camps, and mass deportations” to crack down on illegal immigration.

The survey, which was conducted Dec. 2-7, reached 502 likely GOP Iowa caucus attendees and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.",
466,,,Hamas refuses to hear new hostage deal as Israel says war will ‘not stop’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/hamas-refuses-to-hear-new-hostage-deal-as-israel-says-war-will-not-stop/,"The tense talks for a second temporary truce in the war in Gaza appear to have broken down after Hamas officials became incensed over Israel’s comments that the fighting will resume regardless of a cease-fire.

While negotiations to release as many as 40 hostages appeared to be heading in a positive direction yesterday, Hamas officials said Thursday they would not discuss any hostage exchange deal “except after a full cessation of aggression.”

It echoed Hamas senior official Ghazi Hamad’s recent comments to Al Jazeera, where he accused the Jewish state of trying to lure the terrorist group into a temporary pause rather than seek an end to the war devastating Gaza.

“Some people are looking for a small pause — a pause here and there for one week, two weeks, three weeks,” Hamad said. “But we want to stop the aggression [completely].”

“Israel will take the card of the hostages and after that they will start a new round of mass killing and massacres against our people,” he added. “We will not play this game.”

Hamas’ rejection came following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech Wednesday night in which he reiterated that regardless of any cease-fire, the war will not end until the terrorist group is eradicated.

“Whoever thinks that we will stop is detached from reality,” Netanyahu said. “We are continuing the war to the end. It will continue until Hamas is eliminated — until victory.”

The comments come as Egyptian and Qatari negotiators remain in talks with Israeli and Hamas representatives in an attempt to broker a deal to release 40 additional hostages in exchange for a temporary truce, the freedom of Palestinian prisoners and more aid for Gaza.

“Serious talks between Israel and Hamas through mediators are ongoing in an attempt to break the deadlock, but progress remains slow and there is yet to be a significant breakthrough,” a source briefed on the talks told the Financial Times.

The Jewish state believes that there are still 128 hostages in Gaza, not all of them alive, following the weeklong truce agreement that resulted in 105 captives being freed last month.

On Tuesday, all three major Israeli TV networks presented the Jewish state’s negotiating goals revealing that their government wants to see Hamas free specific hostages, including women, seniors and those with physical or mental illnesses.

President Biden told reporters yesterday that the US was also pushing for Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire deal as reports surfaced that the death toll in Gaza surpassed 20,000.

“We’re pushing it. There’s no expectation at this point, but we are pushing,” Biden said",
467,,,British teenagers ‘obsessed with murder’ convicted of ‘ferocious’ killing of transgender girl,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/british-teenagers-convicted-of-ferocious-murder-of-transgender-girl-brianna-ghey/,"LONDON, Dec 20 – Two British teenagers were found guilty on Wednesday of killing 16-year-old transgender girl Brianna Ghey in a “ferocious attack” in a park in northwest England earlier this year.

The court heard the boy and girl, who were 15 at the time of the murder and cannot be named because of their age, spent months plotting to kill someone and had a list of several potential victims who they knew.

Ghey, who had agreed to meet the girl in a local park, was stabbed 28 times with a hunting knife before her body was spotted by a couple walking their dogs.

Prosecutors said Ghey’s killers had shared hundreds of WhatsApp messages in the run-up to the murder, sharing fantasies about murder and torture, with the girl admitting she enjoyed watching videos about serial killers, murder and torture.

“The planning, the violence and the age of the killers is beyond belief. Brianna Ghey was subjected to a frenzied and ferocious attack and was stabbed 28 times in broad daylight, in a public park,” Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Ursula Doyle of Crown Prosecution Service Mersey Cheshire said.

“Girl X and Boy Y appear to have been a deadly influence on each other and turned their dark fantasies about murder into a reality.”

Speaking outside court, Nigel Parr, Detective Inspector at Cheshire Police, described the killing as “a senseless murder committed by two teenagers who had an obsession with murder, whose only motivation in killing Brianna was to experience what this would be like.”

The pair will be sentenced after Christmas.",
468,,,Biden calls Mexico president as illegal border crossings break all-time records,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/biden-calls-mexico-president-as-illegal-border-crossings-spike/,"WASHINGTON — President Biden spoke Thursday with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador — but broke little new ground as the number of daily illegal border crossings breaks all-time records with thousands of migrants camped out in border states awaiting processing.

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stressed to reporters that Biden and Lopez Obrador discussed longstanding efforts to address “root causes” of migration as well as tentative ideas to stem the flow of people through Mexico.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at the same briefing that “the president has done everything that he can — right? — on his own… [and] we also need funding” from Congress — drawing a sharp rebuke from the House GOP.

“The White House’s insistence that ‘the president has done everything that he can on his own’ to secure the border is an insult to the American people,” said Raj Shah, a spokesman for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who implored Biden in a Thursday letter to use his presidential powers to halt a mounting humanitarian crisis days from Christmas.

“In fact, it has been this administration’s policies — that President Biden can reverse — that have led to the historic crisis we are seeing on a daily basis,” Shah said.

In describing Biden’s talks with his Mexican counterpart, Kirby stressed that the leaders discussed dealing with underlying issues in other countries as an increasingly diverse group of migrants, including from outside the Americas, cross the border and apply for asylum.

“One of the things that President Lopez Obrador and [Biden] talked about today was trying to work at getting at the root causes of migration,” Kirby said — while also acknowledging an ongoing “big surge” and “significant spike” in illegal crossings.

A three-year Biden administration initiative to reduce illegal immigration by addressing “root causes” such as poverty, crime and corruption — led by Vice President Kamala Harris — has not reduced illegal crossings, the levels of which have risen dramatically.

“There’s a lot of factors and part of that is, of course, dealing with instability and political and domestic instability in the region,” said Kirby, who touted a Venezuela prisoner swap deal reached this week with socialist strongman Nicolas Maduro in which he agreed to free 21 opposition politicians.

“The work that we did with Venezuela here, not just to get Americans back, but to get the Maduro regime to ascribe to certain electoral reforms, that’s important — that’s important to help get at some of the root causes of migration,” he said.

Asked by a reporter whether Biden and Lopez Obrador discussed how to slow the current flow, Kirby said: “They did talk in broad terms about what can be done inside Mexico to slow that process down. And there are some things like checkpoints on rail lines and on highways and that kind of thing and the Mexican Armed Forces presence in the south also can be important to that as well.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will travel to Mexico in the near future to “flesh those modalities out a little bit.”

Kirby at one point admitted “more” must be done on the border — pointing to a pending request for additional funding for border operations and care of migrants allowed into the US.

“Part and parcel of the supplemental request was very much recognizing that more needs to be done on border security. And we’re willing to keep having that conversation with members of Congress,” he said.

The Biden administration has been forced to close two major rail links with Mexico amid the current rush to the border.

Lopez Obrador, whose office did not immediately release a readout of the call, said Thursday morning that Biden had requested the two men speak.

The Mexican leader said “I think migration” would be the topic of the conversation.

“Let’s see what he puts to us,” added Lopez Obrador, who is widely known by his initials, AMLO.

More than 12,600 people reportedly were processed by US Customs and Border Protection officers Monday, the most ever recorded in a single day.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott reacted to the surge by signing a law Monday that would allow state police to arrest people who illegally enter from Mexico — despite prior US Supreme Court rulings that immigration policy cannot be set by individual states.

Lopez Obrador has decried the Texas state law as inhumane.

Johnson, the top-ranking Republican in Washington, sent Biden a letter Thursday warning that “Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is at a breaking point.”

“All of this is the direct result of your administration’s policies,” Johnson wrote. “You have clearly undermined America’s sovereignty and security by ending the Remain in Mexico policy, reinstating catch-and-release, suspending asylum cooperative agreements with other nations, ignoring existing restraints on the abuse of parole, and halting border wall construction.”

“You also undermined Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) core mission, and even used a smartphone app to facilitate the release of border crossers into the United States,” he went on.

The House speaker demanded the president reverse these policies with swift executive action to expedite removals and reform parole and asylum policies and that he make use of Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The federal law would allow Biden to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate” if he “finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”

Johnson added, “The wide-open border has caused unspeakable human tragedy for migrants and certainly for our own citizens.

“Countless children and adults have been victims of human trafficking and cartels have been emboldened and enriched,” he wrote. “Local communities have been devastated and terrorists and dangerous criminals have entered illegally and dispersed across our country. We are now more vulnerable to a terrorist attack on our homeland than ever.”

Winter typically draws fewer migrants due to freezing temperatures along the southwestern frontier, but this month’s spike in crossings comes after years of mounting increases, which Republicans attribute to Biden’s more welcoming policies for asylum seekers.

Many people who illegally cross the border are allowed into the US to await decisions on their claims of persecution, burdening local government resources in New York City and other popular destinations.

After an initial wait period, migrants seeking asylum are entitled to work permits.

The badly backlogged system of check-ins and court dates mean cases can stretch out well into the future.

Nearly 2.5 million people were apprehended after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border in fiscal 2023, which ended Sept. 30, in addition to an estimated 670,000 “gotaways” who eluded authorities.

That record-breaking tally followed a record-breaking nearly 2.4 million the year prior, itself following a record-breaking 1.7 million in fiscal 2021.

On his first day in office in January 2021, Biden halted funding to construct former President Donald Trump’s US-Mexico border wall.

Biden in June 2021 ended Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy that required most asylum seekers who reached the southern border to await US court rulings in Mexico.

The Department of Homeland Security in October said it was necessary to resume wall construction in Texas, citing an “acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers … to prevent unlawful entries,” but Biden distanced himself from the move and said he had to spend money appropriated by Congress.",
469,,,Jack Smith again demands Supreme Court quickly rule on Trump immunity case,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/jack-smith-rebuts-trumps-bid-to-slow-down-scotus-review-of-jan-6-case/,"Special counsel Jack Smith’s team asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to quickly rule on former President Donald Trump’s claim that he enjoys immunity from charges in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Trump’s attorneys had contended in a brief Wednesday filing that there was no reason for the high court to intervene in the appellate process, which threatens to delay the scheduled start of the 77-year-old’s trial March 4.

But Smith’s team countered Thursday that the question demanded a “timely and definitive resolution” that only the justices could provide.

“The public interest in a prompt resolution of this case favors an immediate, definitive decision by this Court,” prosecutors wrote in their brief.

“The charges here are of the utmost gravity. This case involves — for the first time in our Nation’s history — criminal charges against a former President based on his actions while in office.”

Trump’s team has sought to get the courts to toss out the four-count indictment against him for alleged subversion of the 2020 election, arguing that he can’t be charged for carrying out official duties as president.

Earlier this month, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled against Trump, finding the 45th president was not entitled to a “lifelong get-out-of-jail-free pass.”

Trump’s team appealed the ruling to the DC appeals court, but Smith went straight to the high court with his initial Dec. 11 request for a speedy ruling.

Chutkan has put “any further proceedings that would move this case towards trial” on pause amid the appeal.

“Only this Court can provide the final word on his immunity defense,” Smith’s team wrote. “Certiorari before judgment will allow the Court to set a schedule for briefing and argument to assure that respondent’s immunity claim will be resolved as expeditiously as possible.”

Smith’s team further stressed that the “respondent agrees that the important constitutional question in this case will require this Court’s review.”

In Wednesday’s brief, Trump’s legal team contended that the matter had to be heard by the appeals court first.

“In 234 years of American history, no president ever faced criminal prosecution for his official acts. Until 19 days ago, no court had ever addressed whether immunity from such prosecution exists,” they wrote.

“To this day, no appellate court has addressed it. The question stands among the most complex, intricate, and momentous issues that this Court will be called on to decide.”

The Trump team also argued that Smith’s office lacks standing to request that the Supreme Court expedite an appeal of a decision that it won.

Should the Supreme Court opt against expediting the challenge, Trump’s case could be delayed indefinitely while the immunity question is decided.

Trump is facing a total of 91 criminal counts across four cases. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing in all of them.

On Tuesday, the Colorado Supreme Court disqualified Trump from the GOP primary ballot — a ruling his campaign has also vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
470,,,Boozy New Year’s Eve hookups to spark spike in morning-after pill sales: study,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/new-years-eve-will-come-with-a-spike-in-boozed-up-hookups-new-study-says/,"The new year will be coming in with a bang.

A new scientific study says New Year’s Eve revelers in the US will indulge in unprotected sex at a higher rate than during other holidays — including Valentine’s Day.

The study’s steamy findings are based on the seasonal sale of morning-after pills and other types of emergency contraception, which boozed-up revelers are more likely to use after the year end’s big ball drop, researchers at Texas Tech University wrote in the British Medical Journal this week.

“More than ever, emergency contraception is a critically important option for people in the US, particularly those living in regions with bans or severe restrictions on abortion,” the researchers wrote.

“Firstly, New Year’s Eve celebrations are commonly associated with increased sexual behavior,” the study said. “In a survey of American’s views of holidays and their sexual lives, more than 70% of respondents planned to put in extra effort to be sexual with their partner on New Year’s Eve.”

Researchers said Americans are less likely to use condoms during drunken New Year’s Eve hook-ups, making panicked runs to the pharmacy for morning-after alternatives more likely.

Overall, the holiday is expected to mean a 10% jump in unprotected sex based on yearly patterns.

Texas Tech largely tracked sales of levonorgestrel, the drug commonly referred to as the morning-after pill that can block pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of intercourse, but can be effective for up to 120 hours, according to the study.

The study looked at sales of the drug throughout the year between 2016 and 2022 by women between the ages of 15 and 44 — and found a jump in purchases after New Year’s Eve.

Results determined that about 41,000 more levonorgestrel were sold among the nearly 65 million women in the age group in the days following the holiday, the study said.

The researchers cautioned that, despite the wink-wink subject, it’s no laughing matter.

“Although this annual spike in sales might seem humorous, it is indicative of unmet contraceptive need that calls for further attention,” they wrote.",
471,,,NY man accused of killing girlfriend by shooting her three times with crossbow,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/frank-litterio-allegedly-kills-jill-harris-with-crossbow/,"A western New York man is accused of shooting his girlfriend to death with a crossbow in their living room.

Frank J. Litterio, 61, of Elma, allegedly shot Jill Harris, 62, multiple times with the medieval weapon on Dec. 13 before trying to take his own life, the Erie County District Attorney’s Office said last week.

“An autopsy revealed that Harris had been struck three times by arrows — once in the abdomen, once in the face and once in the chest,” Erie County Undersheriff Bill Cooley said at a press conference Friday.

The crossbow had to be reloaded one arrow at a time, adding to the sadistic nature of the domestic murder, Cooley noted.

“So when you consider what it takes to load and fire a crossbow, there’s a process to it. So this was clearly… deliberate actions,” he said.

Litterio was arraigned on second-degree murder charges from a hospital where he was being treated for “self-inflicted wounds,” including a cut to his neck, multiple puncture wounds to his chest and injuries to one of his wrists, officials said.

The front door of the suspect’s home.

He was being held without bail ahead of his next hearing, set for Jan. 29, 2024.

If convicted, Litterio faces 25 years to life in prison.

The incident came months after another upstate man was accused of killing his newborn baby and injuring his wife with a crossbow.",

473,,,"Citing 'simply massive' volume of discovery documents, Menendez lawyers seek trial delay",https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2023/12/21/senator-bob-menendez-lawyers-seek-trial-delay/72001944007/,"Sen. Bob Menendez may have a few more months to wait before his federal corruption trial starts.

Though it is currently scheduled to begin May 6, the senator’s attorneys — Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman — filed a letter with the judge Wednesday asking for the trial to be pushed back “at least two months to early July 2024” because of the “complexity of this case” as well as the “volume and timing of the government’s disclosures.”

“Contrary to the government’s overheated statements to the press, this is far from an open-and-shut case,” the letter states. “There are substantial meritorious factual and legal defenses that require defense counsel’s — and the court’s — attention. But defendants cannot meaningfully prepare for trial on the timeline the court set at the initial conference, before the government produced a single page of discovery.”

Story continues below photo gallery.

According to the letter, there have been more than 6.7 million documents totaling more than 15 million pages produced during the discovery so far.

That includes more than 3 million emails and text messages, over 20 search warrant and cell site applications and another 1.5 million documents that “lack sufficient metadata to readily categorize them by document type.” And about 48% of them came within the last month.

North Jersey:Most people call the police once or twice in their lives. Not when you're Nadine Menendez

Volume of discovery 'simply massive'

Fee and Weitzman say the volume of discovery is “simply massive” and will take months to sort through. They also note that classified discovery has not even started yet because the defense counsel is “still in the process of seeking and obtaining clearance to review classified discovery and participate in the CIPA process."" That refers to the Classified Information Procedures Act.

According to the letter, Fee and Weitzman also need time to conduct their own investigation and find witnesses “located in Egypt and elsewhere.”

“The defendants seek only a modest extension of the trial date — just two months — and a reasonable schedule for pretrial motions in the case,” the letter states. “Defendants’ requests still put this case on a true ‘rocket docket,’ proceeding to trial within 10 months of the filing of the original indictment.

""Given the complexity of this case and the seriousness of the charges at issue, the speed with which this case is proceeding is extraordinary, but defendants understand and respect the court’s desire to move this case expeditiously,” the letter says.

They also asked for an extension of one week for the pretrial motions deadline and requested that a second deadline be implemented for potential motions based on the government’s discovery.

Hundreds of thousands in bribes

Menendez faces corruption charges, brought by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from three businessmen in exchange for helping them enrich themselves and trying to get them out of trouble, according to an indictment unsealed on Sept. 22 in New York.

The senior senator and the other four defendants — his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, and businessmen Wael Hana, Fred Daibes and Jose Uribe — have all entered not guilty pleas.

The trial is expected to last four to six weeks.

The indictment alleges that between 2018 and 2022, Menendez and his wife “engaged in a corrupt relationship with Hana, Uribe and Daibes” to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for Menendez using his “power and influence to protect, to enrich those businessmen and to benefit the government of Egypt” even as he sat as chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Bribes allegedly included cash, gold bars, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a low- or no-show job and a Mercedes-Benz — much of which is detailed in photographs in the 39-page indictment.

Menendez is up for reelection next fall, and to secure his spot on the ballot, he will need to win the primary on June 4, likely around the time of closing arguments in the case if the trial date stands.

Rep. Andy Kim and first lady Tammy Murphy have announced that they will run in the Democratic primary for the seat.",

475,,,NJSEA will once again fund an UFC event at Prudential Center. Price tag? $5M,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2023/12/21/njsea-fund-mma-event-prudential-center/71991060007/,"For the second time this year, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority seems poised to dedicate millions of dollars to an event at Prudential Center.

A resolution the board of commissioners was expected to approve Thursday morning will allocate $5 million to the Newark arena for a mixed martial arts event next summer.

Why can the NJSEA fund events at Prudential Center?

Brian Aberback, a spokesperson for the agency, said Wednesday that the NJSEA has “broad statutory authority to promote and otherwise support sporting events statewide.”

The authority, created in 1971, holds the land lease for and provides for the ongoing operation of the MetLife Sports Complex, including MetLife Stadium, the Meadowlands Racetrack, the Meadowlands Arena and American Dream.

Beyond East Rutherford, the agency owns the Wildwood Convention Center and holds the land lease for the Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport; Favorites, an off-track wagering facility in Woodbridge, and the Atlantic Health Jets Training Center in Florham Park.

Prudential Center is privately owned by HBSE — Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment — and operated by Devils Arena Entertainment.

Earlier in 2023:How did the NJSEA steer $3.5M in pandemic relief to an MMA event at Prudential Center?

According to the resolution, the money will be provided because Devils Arena Entertainment “recently made a request to the NJSEA for funds to help secure an upcoming UFC mixed martial arts pay-per-view event, currently scheduled for June 1, 2024.”

Taxpayer money appropriated to the NJSEA in the fiscal year 2024 state budget for “International Events, Improvements and Attraction” will be used to meet this request.

The Devils and the Seton Hall men's basketball team are the arena's sole home teams. It also placed fifth for total gross revenues in Pollstar's 2022 annual rankings, topping $85 million. A spokesperson for the Devils said the venue set revenue records in ticketing, sponsorship, groups, entertainment, and food and beverage sales during the 2022-23 season.

Prudential Center also hosted events in late June for Gov. Phil Murphy's inaugural North to Shore Festival. Murphy said at the time that the festival will ""generate economic activity and have a significant impact on our region"" and will feature concerts, comedy shows and talks from various New Jersey business and industry leaders.

NJSEA approved pandemic relief funds for UFC 288

Earlier this year, the authority approved the use of $3.5 million in pandemic relief funds for UFC 288 on May 6. Thursday’s resolution does not use relief funds.

That money was ""for use in support of sporting events, attractions and promotions"" at Prudential Center, and the resolution authorized by the NJSEA's board of commissioners on April 27 specifically identified UFC 288 as one of the ""marquee events.""

The $3.5 million used in the spring is just a small part of the larger fund to which the state has access. New Jersey was given $6.24 billion in federal pandemic relief funding in May 2021. According to a report by State Auditor David Kaschak, as of Sept. 30, about $6.2 billion had been allocated but only $1.8 billion had been spent.

The state still has time, though. The deadline to allocate the funding is not until the end of 2024, and the deadline to spend it isn't until two years after that. But any unused funds must be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

The agency is also expected to approve $400,000 for the 2024 CONMEBOL Copa America international men's soccer tournament, being held at MetLife Stadium next summer, and $1.65 million for the NHL Stadium Series at MetLife in February. In both cases, the money will go to the New Meadowlands Stadium Company, because the state recognizes that these events “will generate significant tax revenue and will further benefit additional economic impact items including, but not limited to, tourism, hotels, restaurants and job creation,” the respective resolutions say.

477,,,Mysterious set of metal seats washes up on Jersey Shore beach,https://www.nj.com/atlantic/2023/12/mysterious-set-of-metal-seats-wash-up-on-jersey-shore-beach.html,"A rusted out set of seats that washed up on a Margate beach earlier this week fueled early speculation of a catastrophe offshore. But police in Margate believe in a more likely scenario: they’re probably from a railcar that was dropped in the ocean to form an artificial reef.

“The seats are far too heavy to have come from anything like a plane,” Margate police chief Matthew Hankinson said Thursday.

The chairs may have appeared from the Point Lookout artificial reef along the southern shore of Long Island. The State of New York has worked to build up the reef in recent years, dumping a myriad decommissioned objects - from subway cars, old turbines and concrete, to piles of miscellaneous objects - to the ocean depths in order to create a more diverse and healthy marine ecosystem.

The seats were reported at approximately 7 a.m. on Tuesday at Quincy Street beach by a resident named Matthew J. Perry, Lt. Joe Scullion of the Margate police department explained Thursday. Scullion said Chief Hankinson and a detective from the department went to the beach to inspect the seats and they were later recovered by the Department of Public Works.

“The seats are stripped down to the metal with nothing left from cushions, seat belts or buckles that would indicate they came from a plane crash,” Scullion said. “A detective did some further research and found that decommissioned railcar seats are typically stripped down to the metal parts and taken out to sea and dumped to help build artificial reefs.”

Scullion said the seat’s appearance on the Jersey Shore was likely caused by the strong storms over the past two weeks. Images of the seats taken by the police department show the metal frames and what appear to be foot rests, a feature commonly found on train seats where plane seats typically have a compartment for storage underneath the seat.

Scullion and Hankinson said that the fixed armrests found in the middle of the seats also suggested originating from a train rather than a plane.

“The storms probably broke it loose and it eventually landed on our shore,” he said. Other artificial reefs on the east coast have been created using old subway cars, including Redbird Reef off of Slaughter Beach in the Delaware Bay. Seats were reportedly removed from the cars to form that reef, however.

Scullion said the police department did not report this incident to federal or state authorities for further investigation. He said that if there was any indication the seats originated from some type of plane crash or other unexpected catastrophe at sea, they would notify the National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies.

A Tiktok video posted Wednesday, recorded by the person who reported the seats, known online as Matthew Jacob, captured the seats in the sand just outside the rolling waves off Quincy Street and quickly went viral. The video has been viewed over 12.5 million times and has nearly 12,000 comments. In follow-up videos, Jacob reports the discovery to police, who collect the seats and explain they will investigate their origins.

One of the third-prize Powerball tickets was sold at ShopRite liquor store on New York Avenue in Lyndhurst. The other was sold at Amazonia Multiservice, a convenience store on Wilson Avenue in Newark, New Jersey lottery officials said.

Both Powerball tickets matched four numbers plus the Powerball.

No one across the country hit Wednesday’s $576 million jackpot, pushing the top prize for the next drawing Saturday to $620 million with a cash option of $310.8 million, potentially the 20th largest in U.S. lottery history.

Wednesday’s winning numbers were: 27, 35, 41, 56 and 60. The Powerball was 16 with a Power Play of 2X.

Five second-prize tickets matching five numbers but not the Powerball were also purchased nationwide for Wednesday’s drawing.

Ticket sold in Colorado, Kentucky and Virginia are valued at $2 million each because the winners spent an extra $1 for the Power Play option. Two tickets are worth $1 million each — one in Kentucky and one in Rhode Island, lottery officials said.

In addition, no one won the secondary $10 million Double Play jackpot on Wednesday. Those winning numbers were: 22, 25, 28, 30 and 53. The Double Play number drawn was 3.

No one has hit the jackpot since Oct. 11 when a ticket worth $1.765 billion was bought in Frazier Park, California — about 70 miles north of Los Angeles.

The odds of hitting the Powerball jackpot are 292,201,388 to 1. A player who buys a $2 ticket has about a 1 in 11,688,053 chance to match five numbers and win at least $1 million, while the odds are 913,129 to 1 to win a third prize of at least $50,000.

Powerball drawings are held each Monday, Wednesday and Saturday in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Friday’s Mega Millions drawing is worth an estimated $57 million with a cash option of $28.4 million.

Janis Miller, 77, of South Orange, was charged with one count of wire fraud and released on $100,000 bond Thursday, the office said.

Miller is accused of collecting $1.01 million in Social Security benefits and U.S. Office of Personnel Management funds intended for her aunt since 1998. Miller’s aunt had previously worked at the Veterans Administration and was eligible for OPM benefits, according to the complaint.

Prosecutors alleged Miller withdrew approximately $70,000 using a debit card for her aunt’s account over the 25-year fraud. She also allegedly wrote $130,000 in fraudulent checks to her own company, forging her aunt’s signature on the checks in order to do so.

According to documents filed in the case, after Miller’s aunt died in 1998, federal retirement and survivor benefits continued to be deposited into her bank accounts. The federal benefits agencies were never notified about the aunt’s death. Authorities alleged Miller made cash and electronic withdrawals from the account and forged checks made out to company she controlled.

According to the complaint, Miller also impersonated her dead aunt on a phone call with the Social Security Administration in 2022 to continue receiving funds. After the agencies discovered the fraudulent activity, funds were discontinued in 2023, approximately 25 years after the fraud first began.

Miller’s federal public defender Carol Dominguez was not immediately available Thursday night for comment.

The incident occurred shortly after 8:30 a.m. at Hessian and Grove avenues in the borough of National Park near National Park Elementary School.

Motorist Lanielle M. Phelps, 40, of West Deptford, was allegedly intoxicated when police say she struck the four in a crosswalk.

All four victims were transported by ambulance to Cooper University Hospital, in Camden, to determine the extent of their injuries, police said. Additional details on their status were not available as of Thursday afternoon.

“All four sustained injuries. They are still being evaluated at Cooper,” West Deptford Police Chief John Chambers said around 2:30 p.m. He noted that one of the victims suffered a head injury. “At this moment, we do not believe any injuries are life-threatening.”

Phelps, who remained at the scene, was charged with four counts of assault by auto, endangering the welfare of a child and driving while intoxicated. She had a child in her vehicle at the time of the crash, police said.

Investigators have recovered surveillance footage of the incident, the chief noted.

492,,,"Man shot to death at N.J. park had planned to rob accused killer, prosecutors say",https://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/2023/12/man-shot-to-death-at-nj-park-had-planned-to-rob-accused-killer-prosecutors-say.html,"The victim killed in a shooting in Woodbury earlier this month conspired with another man to rob the juvenile charged in the homicide, according to court documents and statements made during a recent hearing.

Woodbury police officers responded to Wing-Dickerson Park around 1:15 a.m. on Dec. 2 and found 21-year-old Ti’jere K. Jackson dead of a gunshot wound to the chest.

A juvenile was identified as the shooter and later arrested. The Gloucester County Prosecutor’s Office has not announced the charges filed against the juvenile or revealed his age, citing state law that prohibits release of such details in juvenile cases.

Police also arrested Amante Black-Thompson, 18, of Woodbury, on a charge of criminal attempted robbery.

Black-Thompson conspired with Jackson to rob the juvenile, according to an affidavit of probable cause filed with his charges.

Around 11 p.m. on Dec. 1, Black-Thompson contacted Jackson via Instagram and arranged the robbery, detectives state in the affidavit.

Jackson and the juvenile communicated over Instagram about three hours later and then met in Woodbury and traveled to the park, investigators said.

Black-Thompson was then observed arriving and the three walked to a separate area of the park, the affidavit states.

Several minutes later, the juvenile was seen “fleeing the area” and police soon found Jackson dead, authorities said.

In an interview with police, Black-Thompson said that he had agreed to “be present” with Jackson for the attempted robbery of the juvenile, according to the affidavit.

During a hearing last week, Assistant Prosecutor Timothy Gaskill said Black-Thompson and Jackson conspired to rob the juvenile during a transaction.

“The investigation revealed that there was some type of deal to sell some type of item between these individuals at 2 a.m. and the resulting incident ended up in the death of another individual,” Gaskill said.

The item being sold was never disclosed in court or identified in the complaint.

Gaskill described Black-Thompson and Jackson as “associates” and said they knew the juvenile, but that their relationship to that juvenile was unclear to investigators at this stage.

While the prosecution asked that Black-Thompson remain jailed pending trial, describing him as a flight risk and danger to the community, his defense attorney noted that he had no prior juvenile or adult criminal record. Black-Thompson turned 18 a week before the incident.

Michael Ortiz said his client is struggling since Jackson’s death in the shooting and described the men as friends.

“The circumstances of this case are tragic. My client’s best friend … passed away during this incident. And the only evidence of a weapon is of the juvenile having a weapon, not of my client and, to my knowledge, the … decedent.”

Ortiz noted that his client has cooperated with investigators.

“He called the cops. He stayed on the scene. He gave a statement to police,” Ortiz said. “He turned over evidence to police.”

A judge ordered Black-Thompson’s pre-trial release with the requirement that he maintain weekly contact with court staff. He’s due back in court next month for a pre-indictment hearing.

While details about the juvenile are shielded from public view, he was arrested later in the day on Dec. 2 , according to the prosecutor’s office and details filed with charges against a 20-year-old who was not involved in the shooting incident.

As detectives were conducting surveillance on the juvenile’s residence, James Workman, of Barrington, arrived in a vehicle. The juvenile left his residence, entered Workman’s vehicle and they drove off, investigators said.

Plainclothes detectives pulled over the vehicle in Woodbury Heights and approached it while wearing ballistic vests labeled with “Police” on them, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Workman pointed a handgun at an approaching detective, officials stated, but complied with orders to lower the weapon.

Workman was taken into custody and the firearm was found to be a ghost gun — a weapon that is unregistered and has no serial number — loaded with hollow-point ammunition, authorities said.

He was charged with aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer by pointing a firearm, along with multiple weapons charges.

James D. Feeley, 46, of Grafton, Ohio pleaded guilty Thursday in New Jersey federal court to anti-kickback laws and health care fraud that involved an Edison-based pharmacy, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Thursday.

Feeley was accused of orchestrating an illegal $24 million health insurance kickback ring that included pharmacies, telemedicine companies and doctors.

Authorities alleged that Feeley and his co-conspirators used a network of marketing companies he controlled to call patients and coerce them into filling expensive prescriptions for medications they did not need.

Feeley then passed that information to telemedicine companies that paid kickbacks to doctors who signed prescriptions without ever meeting with those patients.

Once scripts were signed, Feely allegedly funneled those prescriptions to pharmacies where he and his business partner, Mark Belter, had agreements to receive kickbacks for expensive prescriptions, authorities said. The pharmacies would fill the prescriptions and submit claims to Medicare and TRICARE for reimbursement, and ultimately send a kickback to Feeley for the prescriptions filled, the office said.

The scheme lasted for three years, starting in 2017 and ending in 2020, authorities said. Over $24 million in fraudulent reimbursements were filled and Feely and his companies received $6 million of the illegal kickbacks from Edison-based Apogee Bio Pharm LLC.

The principals of Apogee were indicted in September in a $33 million prescription-drug scheme connected to the marketing companies Feeley controlled, authorities said.

Gary Kaczka, 62, of Saddle Brook as well as two New York men, William B. Welwart, 69, and Ethan B. Welwart, 35, were charged with 22 total counts of health care fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to violate the federal anti-kickback statute.

William was the CEO of Apogee while Ethan was Director of Operations and Kaczka was a pharmacist that at times acted as the pharmacist-in-charge. Ethan also owned pharmacies in Oceanport and Bal Harbor, Florida. All three are still awaiting trial.

Elan Yaish, the former president of Apogee, pleaded guilty to violating the federal anti-kickback statute in August.

Julio Cesar Paniagua, 27, made his first court appearance Thursday and was detained, officials said. Joel Ramon Garcia, 33, was previously ordered to be held in jail following his arrest on Nov. 20, the office said.

The father of the man who was kidnapped called the Paterson Police Department on Nov. 15 around 11 p.m. and told them about the abduction, according to a complaint.

He told detectives he had received a phone call about 25 minutes earlier from his son telling him that he had been kidnapped and asked his father to provide his kidnappers with $30,000 for his return, the complaint stated. However, he did not give his father a form of transaction, nor any instructions on where to send or drop the money.

At 11:50 p.m., while he was at the police station, the father received another call from his son, but this time, a person he did not know told him that he knew the police were involved and threatened to chop his son’s fingers off if he did not provide the $30,000, investigators said.

Police were able to track where the calls came from by using tower dumps, which is a list of all cellular numbers that connected to a given cellular tower within a defined time period, authorities said. Investigators determined the phone belonged to Garcia and that the calls were coming from the area of Dedham, Massachusetts, according to the complaint.

Garcia and Paniagua, both of whom were later positively identified by the man who was kidnapped, released the man on Nov. 17 and he went to the police to tell them what happened, authorities said.

He said he was sitting in his car around 5:45 p.m. when both Garcia and Paniagua got into the back seat and that both of them were armed with handguns, the office said. They arrived in Massachusetts about six hours later.

While Garcia was arrested three days after the man was abducted, Paniagua was not charged until Dec. 7 when he was being held in connection with immigration proceedings, according to the complaint. He later admitted his role to the detectives, authorities alleged.

The charge of kidnapping carries a maximum penalty of life in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000, the office said.

The area was hit hard by major flooding after the coastal storm on Sunday and Monday dumped as much as 4 to 5 inches of rain on the region. The city of Paterson declared a state of emergency on Monday and shut down multiple major roadways. District officials in the city announced Wednesday schools would be closed the rest of the week, and given next week’s winter recess, would not resume until 2024.

“This decision is due to continuing safety issues for our students and staff traveling into the city in relation to flooding, frozen surfaces, and road closures,” the district said in its announcement. The district said it would update the school calendar “to ensure the statutory requirement of 180 days of instruction is met.”

Paterson Police put up barricades on roads that were still closed on Wednesday and warned drivers to avoid these heavily flooded areas. Water damage and flooding could still been seen on some roadways in the city on Thursday, although several roads had significantly less water than the previous day and more cars seemed to be passing through.

A state of emergency was also in effect in Wayne from Monday to Wednesday, as residents in the town, as well as in nearby Little Falls, were told to evacuate their homes and move their cars to municipal parking lots.

The township of Little Falls sent alerts out on Thursday afternoon, saying flood waters have started to subside and residents in certain neighborhoods could return home.

Residents on Grey Rock Avenue, Orchard Street, West End Avenue, Parkway and Riverview Circle have returned to their homes. The neighborhoods west of Parkway are still closed and being monitored by local officials.

On Thursday evening, many of the streets in Little Falls appeared dry and electricity and Christmas lights were back on in most of the town.

Officials in Wayne and Paterson did not respond to requests for comment.

507,,,Ex-Paterson cop found not guilty of excessive force in flashlight beating of suspect,https://www.nj.com/passaic-county/2023/12/ex-paterson-cop-found-not-guilty-of-excessive-force-in-flashlight-beating-of-suspect.html,"A jury in Passaic County on Thursday acquitted former Paterson patrolman Spencer Finch of all criminal charges, rejecting the state’s case that the cop used excessive force when he beat a man 14 times with his flashlight during an arrest then kneed him in the face once he was in handcuffs.

After deliberating for three hours, the jury of eight men and four women found Finch not guilty of aggravated assault, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, perjury, falsification of public records, and official misconduct. Finch bowed his head and appeared to weep as the jury foreman read the verdict in Superior Court in Passaic County.

The jury determined that Finch, a 17-year-veteran of the Paterson Police Department, used justifiable force to subdue Brandon Cosby in the hallway of an Atlantic Street apartment building on the night of May 26, 2021.

Finch and another Paterson police officer, Edwin Martinez, had responded to the building on a domestic violence call.

Finch, who testified at the trial, admitted he knew that the oversized flashlight he had that night violated Paterson Police Department regulations, but told the jury he carried it anyway because it was a more effective tool.

Finch told the jury that the bigger flashlight was more effective at breaking car windows at accident scenes, and for reviving opiate users who had overdosed by rubbing them in the chest.

Finch told the jury that he only used as much force as was necessary to subdue Cosby, who he described as “enraged” and ready to fight police when they arrived.

But the prosecution maintained that Finch never did anything to de-escalate the situation, and didn’t tell Cosby he was under arrest until after the scuffle and the suspect on the floor and in handcuffs.

Finch then kneed the man in the face, but testified that the suspect had attempted to head-butt him.

Finch was fired from the Paterson Police Department after the criminal charges were filed. He is awaiting trial in an earlier 2018 case accusing him of using excessive force after responding to a robbery at a convenience store in Paterson.

Finch hugged his attorney, Eric Kleiner, following the verdict, and his parents, who were seated in the gallery and attended every day of the four-week trial. Finch declined to comment to reporters as he left the courtroom.

“This is exactly what innocence looks like: a full acquittal on every bogus charged that they trumped up against him,” Finch’s attorney, Kleiner, said.

“They charged the wrong guy. They should have charged Cosby. He committed three criminal offenses,” he said, referring to charges of resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer and making terroristic threats that Finch filed, but were later dropped by the prosecutor’s office.

“Spencer Finch saved lives that day,” Kleiner said. “He was the hero. They charged the hero as the defendant. And they made the criminal the victim.”

Chief Assistant Prosecutor Peter Foy left the courtroom and did not comment.

The trial, which was held before Judge Marilyn Clark, lasted four weeks. Finch took the witness stand and testified for three days, and claimed that Cosby was in a rage and resisting arrest.

Finch and Martinez had responded to the building on a domestic violence call placed by a woman who was the mother of Cosby’s two children. Cosby is seen on security camera video pacing the hallway and talking on his cellphone as police arrive.

Finch first went into the apartment to talk to the woman who had made the call. He testified that she showed him a series of angry texts that Cosby had sent her that night. Finch said he went out into the hallway intending to arrest the man for making terroristic threats.

Foy argued that Finch never told Cosby he was under arrest. Video shows Finch leaving the apartment and immediately confronting Cosby, who appears to take a step away from Finch as he approaches. Finch then slapped Cosby in the face and a scuffle ensues as Martinez joined.

Finch fell to the floor – he testified on the witness stand that Cosby “body slammed” him – then picked up his flashlight and is seen striking Cosby 14 times on the head. Finch’s body camera was off during the struggle and was not activated. But Martinez’s body camera stayed on and recorded the struggle as he and Finch wrestled Cosby to the floor.

508,,,N.J. cop indicted on charges he severely injured 2-year-old at his home,https://www.nj.com/salem/2023/12/nj-cop-indicted-on-charges-he-severely-injured-2-year-old-at-his-home.html,"A Salem County grand jury has indicted a Penns Grove police sergeant on charges he severely injured a toddler left in his care while he was off-duty.

Anthony J. Minguez, 38, of Carneys Point, was looking after a woman’s 2-year-old son at his residence on Feb. 12 when he called 911 to report the child had fallen and needed an ambulance, according to an affidavit of probable cause filed by Carneys Point Police.

Doctors who evaluated the boy found a serious head injury and concluded he was the victim of child abuse, police said. Minguez was charged later that month and suspended with pay from his position with the Penns Grove Police Department.

An attorney for Minguez did not respond to requests to comment on the case Wednesday.

When he called 911 on Feb. 12, Minguez said he was performing CPR on the child, authorities said. The boy was then taken by ambulance to Nemours Children’s Hospital in Delaware, authorities said.

Doctors determined the 2-year-old suffered a “severe injury” to the head, which was causing brain swelling, and a portion of his skull had to be removed to alleviate the swelling, authorities said.

Once the child’s head was shaved, a neurosurgeon noticed a “cluster of bruises which in his words resembled fingers or knuckles,” police stated in the affidavit. Other bruises on the toddler were noted as “areas of concern” and the doctor believed they were caused by “a blow, pinch or pull,” authorities said.

Another doctor found broken blood vessels in the child’s retinas, which would be caused by “violent shaking of the victim,” authorities said.

Court documents do not describe the relationship between Minguez and the boy’s mother, who had left the toddler with him while she went to take care of errands at her own residence, according to the affidavit.

The mother told investigators her son seemed fine when she left him at Minguez’s residence that day.

A grand jury indicted the police officer last week on charges of second-degree aggravated assault and third-degree endangering the welfare of a child.

Penns Grove Police Director Richard Rivera said he had not been notified by the Salem County Prosecutor’s Office that the officer was indicted.

Typically, an officer’s status would shift to suspension without pay after an indictment and Rivera said the borough will review the case this week.

Rivera criticized the prosecutor’s office for allowing a local police department to handle the case, saying matters involving charges against municipal police officers are usually investigated by county prosecutors to avoid the appearance of favoritism or conflict of interest at the local level.

“This entire matter — the investigation and charging — should have been handled at the county prosecutor level,” Rivera said.

Salem County Prosecutor Kristin Telsey declined to comment on Rivera’s remarks.

Rivera praised Minguez’s service in Penns Grove’s police department.

“Anthony is a supervisor and he works very well with the community,” the police director said.

Minguez is due back in court Jan. 12 for a post-indictment arraignment hearing.

Minguez previously faced charges in an unrelated case. He was off-duty and dining at a restaurant in Salem County in 2017 when he was accused of exposing himself to two children in the restroom.

The Salem County Prosecutor’s office said in a statement at the time that it reviewed the case and found the boys had gone into a bathroom stall while Minguez was relieving himself and surprised the man. The prosecutor found the case did not rise to an indictable offense and referred it back to municipal court.

Minguez was found not guilty following a municipal court trial in 2018.

510,,,N.J. opens civil rights probe after Clark racism scandal,https://www.nj.com/union/2023/12/nj-opens-civil-rights-probe-after-clark-racism-scandal.html,"Rocked by a racism scandal and criminal charges against its sitting mayor, the Union County township of Clark now faces a fresh probe by the state Division on Civil Rights into whether town officials did enough to fix problems highlighted in a scathing grand jury report.

State civil rights investigators formally notified the township of their inquiry on Thursday, which is focused on whether the town and its police department “have taken appropriate corrective action to address and remedy any discrimination by leaders.”

Clark officials did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

The investigation comes a month after state Attorney General Matthew Platkin excoriated Clark officials at a press conference announcing the release of the grand jury report, which stopped short of finding criminal wrongdoing but flagged “disparities in police practices” that may violate state civil rights laws.

Both inquiries stem from secret recordings made by a police lieutenant capturing longtime Mayor Sal Bonaccorso, the police chief and other officers using racial slurs and making other discriminatory statements.

The recordings were first published last year as part of an NJ Advance Media investigation, which revealed the township paid $400,000 in a hush-money settlement that kept the public in the dark.

Bonaccorso, a Republican, has been Clark’s mayor since 2001. He faces separate criminal charges of using his public office to benefit his private landscaping business, which surfaced as part of the attorney general’s probe. He previously apologized for the racist recordings but has denied criminal wrongdoing.

The rest of Clark’s leaders have largely refused to publicly address the controversy. At a township meeting on Monday night, Council President William Smith broke the long silence in a prepared statement he read to the audience.

“With the recent release of the attorney general’s report concluding their almost three-and-a-half year investigation of the township, the Clark council was found to have acted appropriately on the recommendation of our township attorney and insurance company in the matters that were all investigated,” he said.

“None of us sitting up here condone the words that were heard on those recordings,” he added, but “the council is focused on moving forward and acting in the best interest of the citizens.”

The civil rights probe suggests the matter is far from over.

Among the issues being probed is the pattern of traffic stops and arrests in Clark, a suburb that has long held a reputation as a “sundown town” where minorities aren’t welcome after dark.

The state report found 44% of people arrested in Clark were Black, even though the township is 93% white. The grand jury report examined police records but ultimately found issues with record keeping left them without “conclusive evidence of discriminatory policing practices, though some areas require interventions and further study.”

It recommended the referral to civil rights investigators “for an in-depth investigation and review of the policing practices in Clark.”

The report also called for the firing of Police Chief Pedro Matos and internal affairs Sgt. Joseph Teston, who were caught on tape along with the mayor using racial slurs.

Earlier this month, the council voted to hire an independent hearing officer to review the AG’s recommendations, a role that would normally fall to the same mayor who was also caught on tape using slurs.

Matos and Teston have been on paid leave since July 2020, as has a third police officer, Capt. Vincent Concina, who was accused of retaliation by the whistleblower, former Lt. Antonio Manata.

In that time, the three have been paid more than $1.6 million in salary. They have also continued to receive health insurance benefits, costing taxpayers a combined $321,475 since their suspensions, according to financial documents obtained through a public records request.

512,,,Burden of high prices behind bars in NC,https://carolinapublicpress.org/62619/burden-of-high-prices-behind-bars-in-nc/,"As Cierra Cobb grapples with a soaring grocery bill at home due to historic inflation, she has to also help her husband pay for necessities such as hygiene and other items at the Maury Correctional Institution’s prison canteen.

The rising cost of household staples has put a strain on her budget, so she must choose between putting money in her husband’s trust fund account or on his tablet, which he uses to communicate with her.

“It’s putting a burden on me and everyone who has someone incarcerated,” she said. “We have to limit what we can and can’t send them. Sometimes I could put money on his tablet but put less money on the canteen, or more money in the canteen, and then he can’t have tablet time.”

Families of men and women incarcerated in North Carolina prisons are dealing with inflation in their own households while struggling to pay for the rising costs of essential items at prison canteens for their loved ones.

Incarcerated people rely on the prison canteen — a small shop inside prisons — to purchase essential items like hygiene products and snacks that the Department of Adult Correction does not provide.

Many rely on the canteen to supplement their diet, but rising prices due to inflation are making these items difficult to afford, especially for those struggling financially.

“It’s a double whammy because we have inflation at the grocery store outside, and then we have to deal with inflation inside,” Cobb said. “Simply put, you’re sometimes in the negative trying to take care of them.”

Rising cost of support

At Maury Correctional Institution in Greene County, where Cierra’s husband, Jeffrey Cobb has been incarcerated since 2017, a 29-ounce box of Banquet fried chicken now costs $13.46, a price that Jeffrey said is out of reach for many incarcerated people.

In 2018, the same box cost $6.40, he said. The boxes sometimes come with fewer than the six pieces advertised and the prices are so high that the chicken sometimes goes bad because few people can afford to buy them, Jeffrey said.

“They aren’t buying loads of it no more, and because of that it is getting mold on it,” said Jeffrey, who is serving a 30-year sentence for second-degree murder.

The cost of some items at the Central Prison canteen in Raleigh has increased so much over the past year that Lyle May is forced to cut back. A tube of Aquafresh Toothpaste-Sensitive now costs $5.70, up 52% from a year ago. Dental floss costs 48 cents, up 92% since last year.

Denture adhesive has increased by more than 148%, to $8.70, according to May, who is on death row.

“These are essential items that many people are forgoing simply because the cost keeps rising,” said May, a prison journalist who writes on issues related to mass incarceration and the death penalty. “People with dentures simply don’t wear dentures because they can’t afford the adhesive.”

For May, the price hikes serve as a reminder of how hard it can be for families to afford to send money to their loved ones in prison while also struggling with high prices on the outside.

“Those high costs also remind us of our absolute dependence on friends and family to send money to afford these things,” May said.

“Those people are also dealing with rising costs at the supermarket and are unlikely to send more money to their incarcerated loved ones when they were already struggling to do so.”

John Bull, a spokesperson for the Department Adult of Correction, said inflation has affected everyone, not just incarcerated people.

“Offenders in the North Carolina prison system aren’t affected by food or housing costs. Those are provided for them by the taxpayers,” Bull said. “All offenders are provided three square meals a day. Offenders are paying more for snacks and non-essentials because of inflation, just like everyone else. If they choose to purchase items from the canteens, that’s their choice.”

More than just inflation

While inflation is a factor, the high prices in state prisons are also because they have long been subject to price markups through agreements between the prisons and vendors. Since 2015, prices have been subject to up to a 20% markup at prison commissaries, according to DAC. Prior to this, they could be marked up by up to 18%.

In North Carolina, each state prison decides its own commissary prices, item selection, and vendor contracts. Profits for at least 13 prison canteens in North Carolina have increased significantly since 2015, partly due to the markups, according to a records request obtained by CPP.

For example, Avery-Mitchell Correctional Institution made about $21,000 in profits in 2015. As of August 2023, that figure was more than $100,000, a 21% increase, based on DAC data. Columbus and Alexander Correctional Institutions also saw double-digit increases in their profits, from 6% and 9% in 2015 to 18% and 17%, respectively, as of August 2023.

DAC said in a statement that profits increased partly because of the 20% markup on all canteen items, except stamps, in 2015. DAC also increased inmate spending limits to the current level of $45, $60 and $75 for close, medium, and minimum custody, respectively.

“When people buy things at the canteen, they’re often buying things that they can’t go without,” said Wanda Bertram, a communications strategist for the Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank focused on criminal justice. “It’s not right … for the prison or a company to be making money off of people shopping for those things.”

North Carolina prison commissary profits go to a welfare fund that the Department of Corrections is supposed to use on programs that benefit inmates. By law, some of the money goes to the Crime Victims Compensation Fund, which has received nearly $2 million since 2019, according to records obtained by CPP.

DAC says these funds are allocated to prison facilities for programs, education and recreational equipment. However, Bertram said the state should fund programs and services for incarcerated people, not shift the cost to inmates and their families by forcing them to buy essential items in the prison canteen.

“If there’s a program that people in prison need, that money for that program should come from the state,” Bertram said.

“You’re investing in incarcerated people’s lives and investing in their welfare when they come back from prison, that’s something that’s a public good. Taxpayers should be paying for that and not just the families of incarcerated people when they’re trying to buy something like a bottle of water.”

Economic strain on families

To prevent contraband from entering prisons or jails, correctional agencies prohibit family members from bringing packages during visits or mailing them directly to incarcerated loved ones.

To send packages, family members must order through online catalogs operated by Union Supply Group, the exclusive provider of packages to North Carolina prisons.

Its catalogs offer a variety of items, including toiletries, snacks and clothing. However, prices for these items are often higher than on the outside, and families often have to pay for shipping.

Cierra is one of many people who rely on USG to send food, clothing and gifts to her husband. She stopped ordering care packages for about a year because of the high cost.

“They had gone up so much for about a good year,” said Cierra, who has now resumed ordering the packages. “He told me not to buy them because some of the items on the care package were cheaper at the canteen.”

She pays more for some items, such as a 10-ounce Jergen lotion that costs $9.85, far more than she would spend outside.

USG is partnered with North Carolina Correction Enterprises, which is under DAC. Companies such as USG offer their services at no charge to corrections agencies along with a share of the revenue. In the last five years, North Carolina earned about $2.8 million from USG based on a 20% commission, according to records obtained by CPP.

Correction Enterprises operates the care package program at the Anson Correctional Institution in Polkton. About 21 incarcerated people work on the package program, earning $10.51 per hour. DAC said the revenue it receives from USG is reimbursement for operating the facility, including staff wages and benefits, rent and utilities.

USG has paid a 20% commission to Correction Enterprises since 2013, which will increase significantly this year after the company was forced to raise it to 35%.

In July 2021, after initially losing the package program to Keefe Group, which offered 35% commission in its bid, significantly higher than USG’s offer of 20%, USG sued. This past March, an administrative law judge awarded the contract back to USG, but this time the company agreed to pay a 35% commission.

Low prison wages

May and Jeffrey say the biggest issue they face is low pay inside prisons, which is well below the federal minimum wage.

Inflation is affecting everyone, but incarcerated people face even greater challenges because of their limited options, May said. People outside of prison can seek better-paying jobs, and employers are sometimes inclined to raise wages.

“Prices are indeed rising across the board, so too are the wages available to those in the workforce. An effort among employers exists to increase wages to match the cost of living. In contrast, North Carolina prisons continue to pay inmates the same rates they were paid in the 1960s and 1970s,” May said.

A 2022 ACLU report found that inmates in state prisons across the U.S. are paid on average between 13 and 52 cents per hour for “non-industry jobs,” such as janitorial work or maintenance and repairs, which make up the majority of prison jobs.

In North Carolina, for non-industry jobs, the daily wage is between 40 cents and $1.

About 90% of incarcerated people assigned to work programs in fiscal year 2020-21 worked inside prison facilities, according to the Department of Public Safety annual statistical report.

These jobs help reduce the cost of building and operating facilities, while providing job skills that can help incarcerated people find employment upon release, according to the report.

Incarcerated people working in prison industries earn up to $3 per day, for work such as farming, food processing, printing, sewing, laundering, and manufacturing car license tags and street signs.

Question before the courts

Kristi Graunke, legal director of the ACLU of North Carolina, says underpaying incarcerated people, especially when preparing them for the workforce, hinders their ability to thrive outside of prison and increases their risk of recidivism.

People in prisons often need to save money for things like transportation, housing, and food after they are released.

“To the extent that (job skills) are transferable, it makes no sense not to pay them more fairly for that work,” Graunke said. “Forcing incarcerated people to work for very little money, and then not leaving them a nest egg when they leave prison, creates a cycle of recidivism.”

The courts have ruled that incarcerated individuals working within prisons do not have the right to the minimum wage. However, a Maryland case currently before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit may soon determine whether prisoners working alongside non-incarcerated individuals for third party employers beyond prison walls are subject to the same minimum wage laws.

The ACLU of North Carolina and other chapters recently submitted an amicus brief in the case, arguing that those incarcerated individuals working for third party employees should be entitled to the same minimum wage protections as other workers.

“This practice of putting incarcerated workers alongside private sector workers turns that law on its head and undermines it because the incentive for these private companies or third parties is to reach out and try to get more incarcerated workers because they’re cheaper, rather than hire people who are free world laborers,” Graunke said.

“That is something that ought to be of concern to the court because not covering incarcerated workers in this instance really undermines the entire purpose of the minimum wage statute.”

513,,,What does ruling banning Trump from Colorado ballot mean for NC voters?,https://carolinapublicpress.org/62603/trump-disqualified-colorado-court-what-about-nc-ballots/,"The Colorado Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday, which disqualifies former President Donald Trump from running for president in that state under the disqualification clause in the U.S. Constitution, is likely to have implications in North Carolina too, experts say.

Recent efforts nationwide have tried to disqualify Trump from primary elections, but they were dismissed on procedural grounds because political parties get to decide how delegates are assigned and nominees get chosen, according to David Becker, the executive director and founder of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, civic organization.

“I don’t think this is going to make it more or less likely that any other state court passes a similar ruling, it’s very likely however that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up this case and that will have a significant impact on the states,” Becker said during a virtual media briefing on Wednesday.

Carolina Public Press interviewed five political scientists Wednesday to examine the significance of the Colorado ruling and its implications in North Carolina.

While some N.C. experts say similar efforts to disqualify Trump from the ballot in the state could possibly take place, most agree that the N.C. Supreme Court, which has a Republican-majority bench, may not rule in their favor.

Other experts say that what happens on a state level is of less consequence if the Colorado Supreme Court decision is appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which would ultimately either qualify or disqualify Trump on ballots in all states, including North Carolina.

Martha Kropf, a professor of political science and public administration at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, wouldn’t be surprised if there were efforts to disqualify Trump in North Carolina, she said.

“It is possible for a similar case to be brought to a lower or state court in North Carolina,” Kropf said, but “it still may be a federal issue like the one in Colorado.”

“It’s a state supreme court interpreting the U.S. Constitution,” said John Szmer, also a professor of political science and public administration at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, of the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling. “They have their interpretation and it only applies to Colorado and nowhere else.”

The disqualification clause in the federal Constitution is not the strongest legal argument because courts have disagreed on the issue and “it at least fits in a legal gray area,” Szmer said.

“There are possible implications for perceptions of the legitimacy of courts when they challenge the candidacy of somebody who has a very intense political following and is a perceived leader of a political party,” he said.

NC court friendly to Trump

Most of the experts interviewed share a similar perspective, that a state supreme court decision like Colorado’s is improbable in North Carolina’s political landscape.

Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, said such a ruling “is not possible here” because of the composition of the court — a Republican majority N.C. Supreme Court bench.

Based on the N.C. Supreme Court’s recent decisions on various voting issues, such as the reversal of the court’s decision on the voter ID requirement, it seems probable on a state-level that attempting to disqualify Trump from the ballot wouldn’t be possible, Kropf said.

Szmer agrees that “the probability of the North Carolina Supreme Court agreeing with the Colorado Supreme Court is very, very low,” he said.

However, the State Constitution in North Carolina also has specific criteria for disqualification for office. It describes three instances in which a person can be disqualified: denying “the being of Almighty God,” if a person “is not qualified to vote in an election for that office” and anyone who is found “guilty of treason or any other felony against this State or the United States.”

While the State Constitution does describe the grounds for disqualification, “North Carolina’s Supreme Court, appellate courts and the state Board of Elections will be very careful moving forwards in this direction because of this perception that the election might be rigged,” said Nadine Gibson, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington, of the sociopolitical climate in the state.

“This is very touchy territory, considering that the Jan. 6 situation is present in the back of many people’s minds,” she said of the statewide implications of disqualifying Trump on the ballot.

Preparations for elections start very early, she said. If Trump were disqualified from the ballot at the last minute, “there could be financial costs” for election administration, such as the reprinting of ballots, she said.

“It’s better to have the courts figure out what’s going to happen now, rather than even a few months from now,” Gibson said.

Andrew Taylor, a professor of political science at N.C. State, said if Trump were convicted in any of the federal cases against him, he possibly could be disqualified in North Carolina under the state Constitution.

“If Trump was found guilty as a felon, then he wouldn’t be, through that logic, qualified to be on the ballot in North Carolina,” Taylor said.

While Taylor isn’t sure whether any movements are afoot in the state to do that, he said, “I bet you there are lawsuits ready to go should this happen to Trump.”

Given that 2024 is an election year, Taylor said it’s clear to him that Trump’s qualification is a matter that would be best resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court because “it is a matter of federal office and the U.S. Constitution.”

“We’re on the road to some kind of national solution,” he said.

JERUSALEM — In a rubble-strewn alley near the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, Israeli soldiers say they found themselves being lured into a deadly and surreal trap. “The ambush attempted to use dolls and children’s backpacks with speakers playing sounds of crying,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement last week. “These were placed intentionally near a tunnel shaft connecting to a large tunnel network.” The IDF posted photos of two makeshift mannequins or dolls swaddled in toddler clothing rigged with explosives.

In recent days, the IDF has reported that its soldiers have been hearing recordings of weeping and people speaking Hebrew — attempts, commanders believe, to trick the Israeli soldiers to search for hostages nearby. The IDF has not released those recordings.

Some analysts suggest that wariness of such traps might have been a factor in the IDF’s mistaken killing of three Israeli hostages in Gaza last week — that the troops were spooked and too fast to fire.

As the conflict rages, Israeli forces and Hamas militants on the ground are waging war on an increasingly complex battlefield — one on which Israel deploys 21st-century drones and robots while Hamas relies on some of the oldest tactics: deception, surprise, ambush.

In intense urban combat, fought above and below ground, Hamas militants dart from building to building in civilian clothes, the IDF says, and attempt to ensnare Israeli soldiers with booby traps and lures.

Israeli analysts say the IDF is struggling to meet opposing objectives: finding and killing Hamas fighters while also trying to rescue Israeli and foreign hostages.

The three Israeli hostages could not have done more to signal that they were not a threat. They were shirtless and carried a makeshift white flag. Nearby was a crude sign that read, “SOS,” the internationally recognized distress signal, and below, scrawled in Hebrew: “Help! 3 hostages.”

A preliminary IDF investigation indicates the message was written by the hostages. Israeli officials have not explained why it was ignored.

Rights activists say the hostages’ deaths show that at least some IDF soldiers are too quick to shoot. Even the father of one of the dead captives asked, plaintively, why the soldiers did not wound his son in the leg.

The IDF said the soldiers broke the rules of engagement. Senior military leaders have apologized to the nation and the families. Evidence emerged this week that an IDF combat dog with a GoPro camera had recorded the voices of the three captives. An investigation continues.

Critics say the incident wouldn’t have been investigated or even publicized if the three had been Palestinians.

Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said the deceptions “are designed to entice the army to enter areas that Hamas prepared in advance as kill zones.”

“It’s also meant to create confusion, chaos, anger and frustration.”

Hamas recordings of people speaking Hebrew might grow less effective over time, but they remain a challenge or provocation, he said. “It’s as if they’re saying, ‘See, you are mighty forces, but we continue to taunt you.’”

Israeli soldiers facing high-intensity, close-quarters combat are probably “already fatigued and frightened,” he said, and “the backdrop of all the deception operations by Hamas” makes them “more vulnerable to being caught off guard.”

The IDF said Wednesday that it had uncovered approximately 1,500 tunnel shafts and tunnel routes in Gaza since Israel launched its ground invasion in late October.

Hamas boasts of its use of tunnels and ambushes. The militants stress that they’re the smaller force battling for their homeland against occupation by one of the best-equipped militaries on Earth.

The Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announces daily, through news briefings on its Telegram channel, the targeting of Israeli forces across the Gaza Strip. Proud of its use of antitank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades — especially those targeting Israeli tanks, but often aimed at infantry, too — it also publishes videos of the attacks.

A typical report, from Wednesday, reads: “Qassam Mujahideen were able to booby-trap the eye of a tunnel east of the city of Khan Younis, and as soon as an occupation army force advanced to the eye of the tunnel, it was blown up with soldiers, and the force members were killed and wounded.”

Al-Qassam statements do not reveal the deceptions employed. They don’t mention exploding dolls or Hebrew recordings. Hamas officials refused to share details with The Washington Post: “This is military information that cannot be disclosed by al-Qassam.”

“Booby traps, dolls, crying, people speaking Hebrew,” said a lieutenant colonel in an IDF reconnaissance unit. “We have been well-briefed.”

The officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the IDF, said his unit was sent recently to investigate a building in central Gaza where he said rocket parts had been manufactured and some of soldiers heard “recordings of crying” but could not find the source.

The IDF destroyed the building. In this environment, the officer said, everything and everyone is suspicious.

He described Hamas fighters coming out of a tunnel into a room where Israeli soldiers slept. He recalled a Palestinian man in his underwear waving a bloody white flag and approaching his troops. The Israelis sent a small drone out to examine him. The man was wounded.

The man told them later that he was forced by Hamas to surrender to the Israelis while from a nearby building the scene was being filmed, the officer said. The officer didn’t know if his troops were being probed or if the militants wanted to photograph the Israelis shooting a civilian. He was not shot, the officer said, but given first aid and taken to an ambulance.

“There’s no safe place,” the lieutenant colonel said. He was echoing, perhaps unintentionally, a plaint spoken by many Gazan civilians under the Israeli onslaught.

Hamas triggered the current hostilities by rampaging through Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostage. Israel responded with a campaign the government says is aimed at eradicating Hamas.

Nearly 20,000 Gazans have been killed in the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The IDF reports that at least 130 of its soldiers have died since the start of the ground invasion.

Gaza’s close quarters and dense population make “it very, very difficult to conduct any military operation,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters this week in Tel Aviv.

“Above and beyond that, Hamas routinely uses civilians as shields,” he said at a news conference with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “Beyond that, they place their headquarters and their logistical sites near protected sites, hospitals, mosques, churches, you name it. And so, that adds to the complexity.”

Advertisement

The conditions require “a very professional force,” Austin said, “and that force has to learn each step of the way.”

Ron Ben-Yishai, senior national security commentator for the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, has reported on all of Israel’s wars from 1967 to today.

He believes the shooting of the three hostages was not a result of Hamas lures but rather an ethical failure by the IDF. “The shooting of the three hostages was done hastily,” he said. “It has no connection to Hamas tactics, which I witnessed firsthand.”

“They simply abandoned IDF values,” he said. “In my opinion, not all fighters behave this way. Quite the opposite. Most of them are very careful.”

When Ben-Yishai entered Gaza recently with the IDF, he said, he “saw inside a children’s room, among the blankets, a large explosive device that was very unpleasant to encounter.”

Advertisement

“The bombs were hanging in sandbags on the walls to explode at the head level of the soldiers,” he said. “With the crying of children and all these gimmicks, the goal is to lure the IDF forces into traps. They lay bait to bring the forces to the area where explosives are placed in a circuit and connected to each other. And it did happen. They managed to hit soldiers like that.”

“Hamas’s use of deceit and trickery tactics is not new,” said Netanel Flamer, a senior researcher in Middle Eastern studies at Bar-Ilan University who is soon to publish a book on the group’s combat methods.

Hamas exploits the complexity of urban combat, he said, “aiming to either cause harm to innocent civilians, leading to the erosion of Israel’s international legitimacy and self-recrimination, or to harm the Israeli society by creating internal division and questioning the military operation’s justification.”",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/

KABUL — More than two years after the Taliban’s takeover, its internationally isolated government is pushing ahead with a plan to make the Afghan economy more self-sustaining, if not outright self-sufficient. Afghan officials are overseeing the construction of dams and canals to boost agriculture, and tunnels to connect remote provinces. Steel mills work through the night to churn out red-glowing, heavy beams for infrastructure projects.

The Taliban-run government’s ambitions, at least in part, are driven by necessity. The Taliban’s crackdown on women’s rights has worsened its pariah status, stalling efforts to gain control over Afghan central bank reserves held abroad and to secure Western funding. While foreign aid funded three-fourths of the public expenditures before the takeover, the Taliban says it is largely relying on domestic revenue and customs to finance its projects.

Abdul Latif Nazari, a deputy minister of economy, acknowledged in an interview that these financial constraints limit the scope of government projects. “But we’re on the right path,” he said, “the path that will lead us to self-sufficiency.”

For the Afghan population, however, economic conditions continue to deteriorate. The number of Afghans with humanitarian needs has surged by about 60 percent since 2021 and now represents over two-thirds of the population, according to the United Nations.

And challenges are mounting. Afghanistan’s top trading partner, Pakistan, is increasingly frustrated with the government in Kabul and has been willing to disrupt economic ties for political purposes. Meanwhile, cash-strapped Afghan business owners and other taxpayers say they’re running out of savings to pay for the Taliban-run government’s plans.

“Self-sufficiency itself does not mean anything,” said Omar Joya, an Afghan economist, unless the Taliban can achieve “economic growth, employment, lower poverty levels and an adequate life so that people can at least meet their basic needs.”

Riches below the ground

Taliban officials say a priority is an expansion of oil extraction, drawing on reserves that could eventually cover domestic demand, according to assessments conducted before the Taliban takeover. With new wells, one of Afghanistan’s biggest oil fields, located in the Amu Darya basin in the north of the country, could increase its output more than threefold in the coming months, officials projected.

They are also rushing to exploit the country’s vast wealth of lithium ore and other minerals, which might be worth almost $1 trillion, according to a U.S. Defense Department estimate in 2010. Afghan authorities say they struck seven mining contracts earlier this year, worth $6.5 billion in investment.

It could take years before mining can start on a large scale. Once it does, the Taliban says infrastructure projects now underway will be essential for exporting coal, minerals, as well as vegetables.

In the west of the landlocked country, a railway link with Iran that is being repaired has raised the prospect of Afghan freight trains heading to Iranian sea ports. Meanwhile, repairs at the Salang tunnel in northern Afghanistan were just completed, Taliban officials say, which could ease travel between central and northern Afghanistan and facilitate trade with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

During years of war, long-haul trucking in Afghanistan was obstructed by Taliban attacks and military checkpoints where extortion was common, but a more reliable road network could now help to revive this commerce.

“Afghanistan is standing on its own feet,” said Shir Baz Kaminzada, a mining and industry representative and the chief executive of one of the country’s largest printing companies, which until not long ago produced NATO leaflets.

But Kaminzada acknowledged that reminders of the country’s international isolation remain ever present. Western manufacturers that used to supply his plants with equipment and banks that facilitated his payments now shun his company, he complained.

He blamed Pakistan for much of the disruption. Afghanistan’s industry is rising from the ashes, he said. “They’re scared.”

Tensions with Pakistan

The more Afghan officials seek autonomy, the more apparent it has become how dependent the country remains on neighboring countries. When trucks carrying agricultural produce headed toward Pakistan this fall, they were repeatedly halted at the border. As politicians traded accusations, pomegranates and onions rotted in the sun.

Pakistan’s leadership blames the Afghan Taliban for harboring militants who have staged a mounting number of deadly attacks in Pakistan in recent months. Angered, Islamabad has expelled hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees, seized Afghan imports and imposed restrictions on cross-border trade.

The impact of the political tensions was palpable at the customs department in Kabul on a recent afternoon, where imports from and exports to Pakistan are processed.

As trucks carrying goods arrived at the gate, many of the warehouses were only half-full. Ahmad Khalid Rahimi, a 45-year-old customs official, was quick to explain that the empty shelves were in no way a reflection of the economy, but rather of the department’s efficiency. “Everything is being processed very quickly,” assured Rahimi.

“Why are you lying?” whispered a frustrated worker who stood nearby. “We don’t have enough supplies these days.”

An hour away, at the Milat steel factory on the outskirts of Kabul, the gap between the government’s ambitions and reality is evident every day at 4 p.m. when the electricity goes out for about six hours, and the cranes and observation towers lose power.

Hundreds of employees were hired when the factory, central to the Taliban’s infrastructure plans, reopened last year. And yet, the factory has in recent months struggled with shortages of electricity.

The Taliban is hoping to use solar energy to make the country’s power grid self-sufficient. But for years to come, the Milat steel factory will likely have to compete with the power demands of more than 5 million Kabul residents and the constraints of a grid that has for decades relied on imported electricity.

Despite high demand for the factory’s output, Milat Steel recently had to lay off 150 of its 500 workers, said Nasir Ahmad Haqmal, 35, who supervises production.

Uncertain times

Taliban officials primarily blame the West for many of the challenges. In an interview, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid singled out the United States for freezing $7 billion in Afghan central bank assets after the Taliban takeover. “First, they occupied our country. And now they occupy our reserves,” said Mujahid.

But Afghanistan’s new partners could prove challenging, too. While some Chinese companies are positioning themselves to reap a windfall from lithium and other natural resources, the Chinese government’s ties to the Taliban remain limited. Afghanistan is focusing much of its outreach on Iran, but long-standing border tensions over scarce water supplies make political relations between the two countries unpredictable.

Meanwhile, taxes, fees and licenses have become such a burden for some Afghans that they say they’re thinking about giving up their businesses.

Ismail Hotak, 25, founded a commercial real estate agency on the outskirts of Kabul last year. Even though business has been dismal, he keeps getting hit with taxes and unexpected fees that he said he didn’t know existed.

“If the authorities ask me for any more money, I’ll just close,” he said.

Many of these fees existed before the Taliban takeover but were less stringently enforced. Corrupt officials “reduced the cost if we paid them directly. Most of it went into their own pockets,” recalled Sahib Khan Ansari, 48, a steel vendor in Kabul.

Ansari said he appreciates the decline in corruption and the increased investments in infrastructure under the Taliban.

But the one thing that would make the economy flourish by clearing the way for foreign aid and investment, he said, would be the reopening of schools for girls.

MOSCOW — In Russia, where the entire LGBTQ+ community has been banned as “extremist,” some parents are paying thugs to abduct their queer sons and daughters, forcing them into secure private centers to “cure” them with so-called conversion therapy. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Some of these young people are fleeing the country, looking for safety in the West.

Former residents say conditions behind high concrete walls are like small unregulated prisons, designed for alcoholics, drug addicts, or people whose families see them as problems.

Many were tricked or abducted, then held for months. They recounted being beaten, humiliated or forced to read out confessions that they were destructive and selfish because of their “addiction” to their sexual or gender identity — mimicking rigid programs designed to combat drug and alcohol addiction.

Many of them emerged “somehow mentally broken,” believing there was something wrong with them, said Vladimir Komov, who formerly served as a rights lawyer at a prominent LGBTQ+ legal advocacy group DELO LGBT+, which shut its operations last week due to the ban.

A 2020 report by an independent United Nations expert found that conversion therapy was “deeply harmful … inflicting severe pain and suffering and resulting in long-lasting psychological and physical damage.” The report called for a global ban.

In President Vladimir Putin’s move to cement his rule and build a repressive, deeply conservative nation, he has singled out LGBTQ+ people as scapegoats alongside antiwar activists.

But the rhetoric is also part of Putin’s bid to enlist socially conservative nations in Africa and the Middle East to back Russia in its war against Ukraine. At the same, he hopes to divide liberal Western democracies by encouraging antipathy to LGBTQ+ rights.

In a Nov. 30 ruling, Russia’s Supreme Court endorsed a Justice Ministry application to ban the “international LGBT public movement” as an extremist organization, following other repressive laws. After the ruling, police raided LGBTQ+ venues in Moscow.

One movie streaming site, apparently fearing prosecution, placed an adults-only rating on “My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,” an animated children’s series, likely because of the pony Rainbow Dash’s rainbow mane and tail — the same colors as a Pride flag.

Before its closure, DELO LGBT+ handled 200 monthly requests for legal help from queer people. Of these requests, 7 percent said their families threatened to put them into treatment centers, tried to do so or had done so in the past, the group said.

“After these laws, the number of people facing threats to be put in such institutions has increased,” Komov said.

Ada Blakewell, a 23-year-old transgender nonbinary person, queer activist and journalist, who uses she and they pronouns, underwent nine months of conversion treatment, from August 2022 until May 2023, in a remote treatment center, Freedom Rehabilitation Center, in the Altai region of Siberia.

Blakewell said she was beaten, thrown into a nearby river as punishment and forced to perform physical exercises repeatedly “until all I could see is white and yet they forced me to do it over and over again.”

Those undergoing the treatment had to swim in the river daily at 8 a.m. before morning prayers, even in winter in subfreezing temperatures. She was given “manly” jobs like chopping wood and helping slaughter chickens, turkeys and pigs “to help myself to become a man.”

In one disturbing incident, she was forced to castrate a pig, after being told that she would see what transgender surgery was like.

“I was given a surgical knife and given instructions how to do it,” she said. “But I couldn’t finish it. I had a severe panic attack and from then on, I was getting more and more suicidal.”

She was given neuroleptic drugs, designed for people suffering psychiatric illness.

“You could call me a prisoner,” she said.

Alexandra, 28, a Moscow transgender woman whose wealthy parents also rejected her gender identity, was forcibly held in several treatment centers for 21 months.

Alexandra, who agreed to describe her experience on condition that she be identified only by first name, spent 20 months in a center outside Moscow with about 60 other people, mainly drug addicts and alcoholics, which was staffed by former residents, who doled out punishments. They told her being queer was an addiction that would ruin her life.

Alexandra said was so heavily sedated she felt “like a zombie” and was constantly told she was sick. Other residents threatened to kill her. “I felt alone because people around me were from another world,” she said. “People were very distant. I was feeling like I’m canceled. I felt invalid.”

The accounts by Blakewell and by Alexandra could not be independently verified but were consistent with previous accounts in Russian independent media and by international rights groups about conversion therapy centers in Russia.

Blakewell said she had been tricked into going to the center by her mother, a business executive, who asked her to support her during heart surgery in a rural area of the Altai region. Her mother got out of the car. A hefty, thuggish man then pressed Blakewell against the door, the locks snapped shut and her phone, Apple watch and backpack were taken.

As they drove to the treatment center, the driver told her it was time to atone for being queer, using an offensive epithet. “I still feel really bitter toward my family,” Blakewell said.

Alexandra faced similar deception.

“I didn’t know what to think,” she said. “I was in a really vulnerable state mentally at that time.”

Conversion therapy has been banned in 22 U.S. states and in 12 countries, with many others planning national bans, according to Global Equality Caucus, an international network of lawmakers that supports equal rights for LGBTQ+ people.

Last month, Konstantin Boikov, a lawyer with DELO LGBT+, fled Russia for New York after homophobic threats and abuse. (He does not identify as gay.) Tomatoes and eggs were hurled at his apartment door, and abusive notes and severed chicken heads were also left there.

He said he feared imprisonment by Russian authorities or homophobic violence if he stayed.

“We cannot continue our activity as an organization,” said Boikov, one of five DELO LGBT+ activists now based in New York, who serves as lawyer to both Blakewell and Alexandra as they pursue legal action. “So our members will act individually, helping people as lawyers or human rights activists.” No client will be abandoned, he said.

“The state is trying to convince the population that all the country’s ills all come from these enemies,” Boikov said, “so that people unite around one leader, without thinking.”

Alexandra was freed in June after she broke a staircase fitting and threatened managers that she would continue to break more things unless she was released. Her parents still shun her.

Blakewell escaped a month after she was abducted but was quickly caught and beaten so severely some of her teeth were broken. She tried twice more and was beaten again. She won her freedom by calling police from a staffer’s cellphone that was left lying around, insisting on rescue until they finally came.

Before her imprisonment, Alexandra was proudly transgender. After her freedom, she said she tried to mentally break free of the “conversion” therapy, “but I failed.”",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/

The U.N. Security Council is tentatively slated to vote Friday on a draft resolution that would call for an indefinite pause in fighting to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been delayed multiple times because of opposition from the United States. The political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, visited Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials about the war in Gaza.

Hostages: More than 100 held in the Gaza Strip have been released. Here’s what we know about those released by Hamas so far.

Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier around the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history. Traders earned millions of dollars anticipating the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, a study found.

More than 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip in the war between Israel and Hamas, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hamas militants led an attack on Israel on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s response — an all-out bombardment of Gaza and a ground invasion — has killed almost 1 in 100 people in the Strip.

The Gaza Health Ministry said early Friday that 20,057 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since Oct. 7.

The number of deaths is far higher than in any conflict in Gaza in recent history. And it is higher than the estimated 15,000 Palestinians killed in the violence that followed the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Palestinians call that mass displacement the Nakba, or “the catastrophe.”

Neta C. Crawford, co-director of the Costs of War Project at Brown University, which tracks the toll of conflicts, said the rate of death among the population was similar to that of 20th-century wars.

“This is, in the 21st century, a significant and out-of-the-norm level of destruction,” she said.

The number of people killed in Gaza since Oct. 7 has been a subject of dispute. The Washington Post and other media outlets rely on numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry, as many international institutions, organizations and global bodies did before the war. The ministry has proved reliable historically, with direct access to hospitals and morgues. It writes death certificates for Palestinians living in the enclave.

Israeli and U.S. officials have questioned the figures publicly, however, arguing that they cannot be trusted because the ministry is controlled by Hamas, which both countries designate as a terrorist group. Both governments have noted that it does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.

“The only figures that Israel and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] can estimate with a degree of confidence are the numbers of Hamas terrorists killed since the Oct. 7 attack,” an Israeli official said this month, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. The official said that “several thousand” Hamas fighters had been killed at that point, a small proportion of a force that has been estimated at 30,000.

War makes counting the dead difficult. The Gaza Health Ministry paused its death toll updates last month, citing communication outages and a lack of access to besieged hospitals, but later resumed counting.

While the United Nations often releases its own counts after a conflict, in Gaza it is relying for now on numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry, given the information available. U.N. officials have said they see no reason to doubt the figures, but acknowledge that the numbers could prove inaccurate for practical reasons.

At a meeting of the World Health Organization’s executive board, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cited the Gaza Health Ministry figures and suggested they could actually be an undercount.

“We don’t know how many are buried under the rubble of their homes,” said Tedros, who leads a U.N. agency that works directly with the Gaza Health Ministry.

The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has seen 134 members of its staff working in Gaza killed since Oct. 7, said William Deere, the agency’s representative in Washington.

A team of academic experts in health data at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health studied the number of deaths of U.N. staff in Gaza and used the data to estimate whether the Gaza Health Ministry’s death toll was being inflated.

They found “no evidence” of inflated mortality in the data, the experts wrote in a letter published in the Lancet medical journal earlier this month.

“The true death toll is probably higher than what’s being reported because of difficulties verifying bodies buried under rubble and diminished capacity from the hospital system,” one of the experts, Benjamin Q. Huynh, added in an email.

The bombardment of Gaza, particularly in the north in the early stages of the war, has been intense by any measure. The densely populated enclave, in which more than 2 million people live in cramped cities and refugee camps, and the presence of military facilities in civilian areas have contributed to a significant death toll.

Analysts have suggested that the heavy destruction of infrastructure, particularly in the north of Gaza, indicates the use of large bombs such as the 2,000-pound Mark 84 bombs.

While these huge bombs can be retrofitted with the U.S.-supplied JDAM system to become a precision weapon, a U.S. intelligence assessment found that almost half of the munitions Israel has used in Gaza since the war began have been unguided bombs, an unusually high proportion for a high-tech military like the IDF.

The pace of death does not appear to have slowed as the conflict drags on. An average of 277 deaths were recorded each day in Gaza from Oct. 7 to Nov. 24, when a week-long pause in the conflict began. In the period since fighting resumed on Dec. 1, the average number of daily deaths has risen to more than 300, according to Health Ministry figures.

The Biden administration has begun to push Israel to lower the tempo of its conflict. President Biden told supporters at a recent campaign event that “indiscriminate bombing” was beginning to cost Israel support around the world.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan told Israel officials that they should transition “to lower-intensity operations … in the near future,” John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, later told reporters.

At the end of November, the Biden administration provided an estimate to Congress that the death toll in Gaza was more than 15,000, close to the number provided by the Gaza Health Ministry at the time.

In an appearance on social media in early December, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus suggested that the Israeli military would soon present an “analysis of claims made by the Hamas-controlled and so-called Gaza Health Ministry.” In the same appearance, Conricus repeated the claim that the number of dead militants in Gaza was “in the thousands.”

Brian Finucane, a State Department attorney under the Obama administration who serves as a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, said that under the rules of war, the IDF would be expected to assess any potential civilian death toll of an attack before it began.

The aim would be to ensure that any civilian harm was proportionate to the military advantage expected. “Whether they’d ever release them is another matter,” Finucane said of those estimates.

Choose your plan ArrowRight Readers of Today’s WorldView may agree that it’s been a grim year. In Ukraine, a grinding counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion lurched into a bleak stalemate. In the Middle East, a decades-old conflict exploded into an unprecedented, high-intensity war in the Gaza Strip. The bulk of the territory’s inhabitants have been driven from their homes, some 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in a matter of weeks, and a quarter of Gaza’s population is “starving,” according to the United Nations, which warned Thursday that the risk of famine in the territory is “increasing each day.”

“It doesn’t get any worse,” Arif Husain, chief economist for the United Nations World Food Program, told reporters. “I have never seen something at the scale that is happening in Gaza. And at this speed.”

While these two wars consumed the attention of major global news outlets (and this daily newsletter) for much of 2023, other crises smoldered on. In Sudan and Myanmar, ruinous civil wars, marked by myriad atrocities and reports of war crimes, are collapsing already dysfunctional states and provoking spiraling humanitarian crises. Over a wide swath of sub-Saharan Africa, coups and power grabs roiled the region. Social instability and post-pandemic economic pressures fueled surges in migration across the world.

2023 will probably be the hottest year on record, with heat waves scourging every continent, accompanied by other extreme climactic events. Droughts and floods were both more acute — the most viscerally shocking moment came arguably in September, when heavy rains led to the failure of dams and flash floods that killed more than 11,000 in northeastern Libya. “This disaster is of mythic proportions,” a Libyan health official told my colleagues at the time.

After storm waters destroyed two dams in east Libya, a devastating flood washed through Derna on Sept. 11, washing away people, cars and buildings. (Video: John Farrell/The Washington Post)

The war in Gaza is reaching a dangerous tipping point. While Israeli officials vow a long campaign, the current fighting is pushing Gaza’s 2.2 million people to the brink. The territory is the deadliest place in the world to be a civilian. Before Oct. 7, when the militant group Hamas launched its strike on southern Israel, 80 percent of Gaza’s population required humanitarian assistance. Now, everyone does, and barely a trickle of what’s needed is getting into the besieged territory. Aid organizations and myriad world leaders are calling for a cease-fire and a surge of relief aid into Gaza. But absent a cessation of hostilities, the war could convulse the region, bringing in anti-Israel factions based in Lebanon and Syria, and spawning an unprecedented flow of Palestinian refugees into Egypt.

In its annual “emergency watchlist” published this month, the International Rescue Committee ranked the conflict in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories as the second most glaring crisis to watch in 2024. The first was the far-less-discussed civil war in Sudan, where eight months of fighting between the country’s military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have left more than half the country in need of humanitarian aid and forced some 6 million people from their homes. Some 19 million children are without education as the conflict has shuttered thousands of schools.

“Sudan has become the world’s largest displacement crisis,” the IRC’s Elshafie Mohamed Ahmed said in the report. “The ability to deliver aid is hindered by the lack of humanitarian access and funds. The ethnic, tribal and regional polarization of the current war is further threatening the limited access currently available.”

150,000.

Here’s what you need to know about this crisis. — UNICEF (@UNICEF) December 21, 2023

Africa is home to the bulk of the other potential hot spots, as listed by the IRC. Three “coup belt” nations in West Africa — the junta-led states of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger — are all in the rankings. The Burkinabe military is floundering in the face of a surge in Islamist militancy, with renegade factions controlling more than half the country. In Mali and Niger, where similar dynamics are on show, growing food insecurity and the drying up of foreign aid are plunging millions toward greater peril.

The IRC’s 10 “watchlist” nations account for 86 percent of all people in humanitarian need globally. Lurking behind the political instability consuming these societies is the specter of a warming planet, as droughts and other climate shocks affect some of the world’s most vulnerable communities. “What were once separate circles of crisis are now a Venn diagram with an expanding intersection,” wrote IRC President David Miliband. “Three decades ago, 44% of conflicts happened in climate-vulnerable states. Now that figure is 67%.”

The Biden administration has most successfully held the line in shoring up Western support for Ukraine’s resistance to Russian aggression. But its scope for action will be constrained in a divisive election year, and even Washington’s capacity to fund Kyiv is in doubt — let alone its ability to get its arms around myriad crises elsewhere, from Somalia to Afghanistan to gang-dominated Haiti, teetering on the verge of state collapse.

In Asia, an election in Taiwan may be marked by new provocations from China at a time when the Biden administration is trying to bring some stability to its relationship with Beijing. But the biggest conflagration could take place in Myanmar, where the ruling junta is reeling from an offensive launched by a coalition of rebel militias and seeing mounting desertion in its ranks.

The current trajectory, however, “does not point towards a near-term regime collapse on the battlefield, absent unforeseen developments,” noted Morgan Michaels, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Myanmar is instead headed towards a new phase of the conflict, marked by a weakened but still dangerous regime, more intense violence and greater uncertainty.”",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/

For Palestinians in Gaza, there’s nowhere left to go.

They were already packed tightly before the war, hemmed in by a years-long Israeli and Egyptian blockade. During the current conflict, few parts of the enclave have been spared bombardment, and Israel’s often haphazard and confusing evacuation orders have pushed the displaced into ever-shrinking “safe” areas.

But with limited internet and power, many civilians couldn’t access the grid and when they did, they found it hard to follow. Dec. 2 Israel on Dec. 2 directed civilians in southeastern Gaza to move farther south to Rafah. Dec. 3 A day later, civilians in Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, were also told to evacuate. Tens of thousands had been taking refuge in the city after having fled there from the north.

Almost 1.9 million people, 85 percent of Gaza’s population, have now been forced from their homes, the largest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948.

“They keep saying, ‘Go south. Go to a safer place,’” said Aseel, a resident of northern Gaza who gave only her middle name for security reasons. But then she hears that new strikes have hit those areas too. She added: “We are going in circles here in Gaza. That’s the problem.”

The IDF says it is “seeking constantly to minimize harm to the Palestinian civilian population,” pointing to its evacuation-announcement system of texts, phone calls, airdropped leaflets and warning strikes.

Nearly 20,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry — including many who had evacuated to elsewhere in the Strip in search of safety.

The IDF used to call areas supposedly free from bombardment “safe zones”; it now refers to them as “safer zones.” According to a damage analysis of satellite data by remote-sensing experts Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, at least 20 percent of buildings in the south have been damaged, including in Khan Younis and Rafah.

Overcrowding

Rafah, which makes up just 17 percent of Gaza’s area, has become the epicenter for displacement. Before the war, Rafah was home to 280,000 people. But population density has increased fourfold as more than 1 million people — about half of Gaza’s population — have poured into Rafah, according to the United Nations. The forced displacement has pushed civilians into shelters that are “dangerously overcrowded,” said Arvind Das, Gaza team lead for the International Rescue Committee.

For food and water, four people are sharing what one person would normally receive in U.N.-run shelters, said Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

“My 2-year-old daughter wants milk every day. She continues to cry for several hours, but I have no help to offer,” said Anwaar al-Khatib, 28, who fled from her battered home in Beit Hanoun to the Tal al-Zaatar area — which was then bombed — to the Indonesian Hospital — which was then besieged — and finally to a school serving as a shelter in Rafah. “Two cans of beans are distributed every two days. Or three.”

Rafah’s al-Quds School is overwhelmed with families, said Muhammad Issa, who is in charge of the shelter. The school, which normally accommodates 1,000 students, is now hosting three times as many people.

Touma called it a “super crisis moment.” The agency planned to host 150,000 people in 56 shelters in a worst-case conflict scenario; now, it’s supporting nearly 1.4 million in 155 shelters, according to UNRWA media adviser Adnan Abu Hasna.

At some shelters, 1,000 people share one toilet, he said. The wait is hours.

Displaced Palestinians have crowded into the 26 warehouses and set up tents in the empty lots around the complex’s buildings. Omar Omar, who was displaced from Beit Lahia, said the warehouses are so packed that “you feel that there is no oxygen in any of them.” Hygiene, he said, is “difficult to control.” Ahmed Ismail, 38, said that under the pressures of overuse, sewage from the bathrooms flows into the tent he shares with his wife, two daughters and two sons. Rather than waiting hours for the toilet, they relieve themselves in buckets and plastic bags. They shower every week or so. The Ismail family walked to Rafah from Jabalya — a 23-mile journey — after their neighborhood was bombed.

A displaced population

Severe overcrowding is leading to outbreaks of disease and infection — hepatitis, skin and respiratory illnesses — as people share tight spaces and resources. It’s made all the worse by the collapsed medical system incapable of treating them.

Saif al-Din Muhammad Qadouha, 45, is living in a tent with 11 family members in Rafah. Their home north of Gaza City was destroyed. His son and others in the family now have hepatitis C. Qadouha is worried that his family will pass on the infection to others crammed in their shelter.

“I didn’t lose my children to missiles, but now I’m watching them die of disease,” he said.

Then there is the psychological effect and the stress of displacement. “The story of becoming a refugee and the trauma that comes with leaving one’s home and not being allowed to return is something that haunts the Palestinian communities.” said UNRWA’s Touma.

Ramez Muhammad, 46, and 14 family members have heeded Israel’s evacuation orders three times, until they reached an area near the southern Rafah crossing.

“Our dignity has been lost in this displacement,” Muhammad said. “I want to return to my home, even if we have to live on top of the rubble.”",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/
521,,,Ask Amy: Husband interferes in wife’s friendship,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/22/ask-amy-friend-argument-husband/,"Listen 4 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Dear Amy: A while ago my wife got a cellphone call from “Martine,” a very high-strung woman whom she regarded as a friend. The reception was so poor that she asked Martine whether they could talk when she got home. Instead of agreeing, Martine exploded in hysterical anger, screaming that the 40-year friendship was over.

This extreme and illogical overreaction left my wife so depressed that I finally wrote to Martine on my own initiative, asking what kind of person she was who would treat a friend in such a shabby and insulting manner. I added that I was writing without my wife’s knowledge or permission (which she wouldn’t have given), but seeing the effect of her rage on my wife, I regarded it as my business, as well as hers.

Martine flew into another tantrum, but instead of directing it at me she attacked my wife, who had nothing whatsoever to do with my writing the letter. Martine seemed to be determined to hurt her for no reason, or maybe she was deflecting. I say good riddance and my wife seems philosophical about the matter, but the “friendship” — is clearly over.

Initially my wife was not happy with my choice to contact Martine but now she seems more or less behind it. We agreed to ask for your views on my choice. Your thoughts?

— Protective Husband

Protective: Your wife seems to have accepted your choice, as well as the consequences that have flowed from it, so asking for my opinion after the fact really puts me in the position of being an armchair referee.

Your wife’s relationships are her own to manage. Her feelings and actions are her responsibility. She reacted to “Martine’s” behavior by becoming sad and depressed. After some time had passed, she might have chosen to reach out to her in her own way and using her own words. She might have expressed some worry about Martine’s health or mental health. Or she might have expressed some anger and ended the friendship — on her own terms.

You’ve denied your wife these choices. At the very least, you could have told her how you were feeling and let her know that you intended to react. You didn’t do that because you knew she would disagree with you, and so you went behind her back. Your wife might feel that she is standing between two angry people who don’t hear her or respect her autonomy.

I assume that she is now threading the needle; appreciating your loyalty to her, understanding your protective behavior regarding Martine, and accepting the fact that — at this point — she can’t do anything about either one of you.

Dear Amy: A few weeks ago, I returned from an enjoyable touring vacation. The scenery and the attractions were wonderful. There was only one problem — one of my fellow travelers.

This person spent the entire vacation stating her obnoxious political views. Since I was sitting near her on the bus, I asked to be rotated, so I could escape her constant airing of her political opinions. That helped some, but every time I sat down to a meal, she seemed to be at the same table.

I go on these trips to have a good time and enjoy new experiences. I don’t go on them to discuss politics. Everyone has a right to their opinion, but I don’t believe it was her right to impose her opinions on other people who can’t escape. I’m wondering whether I should have done more to protect my serenity. Your thoughts?

Discouraged: You don’t report having asked this person not to discuss politics with you. You might have said, “I happen to disagree with your views, so let’s agree to leave our political views at home. I want to enjoy a peaceful holiday, and I want the same for you.”

Anonymous: Is it striking to you that the person who sexually molested a 10-year-old girl now has a lovely wife and implicit family support, and the victim of that sexual molestation has uneven results in therapy, a trauma response to family gatherings, and explicit criticism for being “extreme” and ruining parties?

It’s striking to me.

Real lives over three decades obviously can’t fit into a 100-word question to an advice columnist. Maybe your son has had extensive therapeutic intervention of his own; I certainly hope so. Maybe you’ve backed your daughter consistently with everything you’ve got.

But your version here, as presented to me, is that the victim is the problem.

And that’s a hard no.

I don’t have a harder “no” in me than the one I have for that.

Here’s my suggestion: Accept, as a result of your son’s actions, that yours is a family that no longer gathers in full. That’s it.

No family ever “has to,” by the way.

As heartbreaking as that is for you, what your daughter carries is unfathomably more so. Accept that, too.

If your family’s gathering situation changes for the better someday for some reason, then great. But if it doesn’t, then that will not be your daughter’s fault — just as it isn’t now and absolutely never was.

Dear Carolyn: I started seeing a therapist this year. I was going through a lot at work, some minor health issues, and feeling generally stuck and depressed. I’ve started to feel as if I don’t have much to talk about in sessions. I feel as if I’ve gotten to a better place, but mostly I want to spend the time — driving, appointment, driving home — on other things. A friend cautioned me that if I end my therapy now, I might be stuck if I suddenly need help again. So I’m weighing that fear against wanting the time back and not wanting to make up things to talk about. How do I know when I’m done with my therapist?

The long answer is still short, but includes: I’m glad your friend is looking out for you. That’s nice to have. It’s also good to look out for people we don’t know — in this case, someone who could get needed therapy when you free up the spot. Running out of things to talk about can be a legitimate sign of progress, as can feeling the pull of your attention back to other things.

524,,,Alex Ovechkin’s goal drought ends with an OT winner in Columbus,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/21/alex-ovechkin-ot-winner-blue-jackets/,"Listen 5 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

COLUMBUS, Ohio — In the long arc of Alex Ovechkin’s career, goal No. 828 easily could have been a simple footnote on his chase of history. If it had been any other goal — an empty-netter, perhaps, or a goal late in a blowout win — maybe it would have been.

But No. 828 turned out to be an overtime winner that busted Ovechkin’s 14-game streak without a goal, the longest of his career, and lifted Ovechkin’s Washington Capitals to a 3-2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena. Ovechkin’s emphatic celebration, with a fist pump toward the ice before jumping into the embrace of defenseman John Carlson, made clear exactly how meaningful the goal was for the Capitals’ captain — and for his team.

Ovechkin scored 4:07 into overtime and 1:25 into a four-on-three power play drawn by winger Tom Wilson after a dramatic encounter with Columbus goalie Elvis Merzlikins (29 saves).

When the power play began, Ovechkin already had 13 shot attempts in the game and looked intent on breaking the drought. Merzlikins previously stopped several of Ovechkin’s trademark one-timers from the left faceoff circle, so for the game-winner, Ovechkin held on to the puck for an extra second before firing a wrist shot that, after he had gone more than a month without a goal, finally hit the back of the net.

“I thought he was one of our best players tonight by far,” Washington Coach Spencer Carbery said. “Shot attempts, was shooting it, was moving well on the ice. Puck recoveries, it looked like he was handling the puck better. He had a ton of great looks where you think they’re going to go in, and this one, he stops and rips it low blocker. We had a great view from the bench. Huge goal for us.”

“It’s been a while,” Ovechkin said with a smile. “I’ll take it.”

For the second night in a row, the Capitals had leads of 1-0 and 2-1 before getting pushed to overtime. After a lukewarm start from both teams — they combined to produce one shot on goal through the first seven minutes — winger Anthony Mantha scored a power-play goal at 18:24 of the first period to put Washington into the lead, redirecting a shot from Ovechkin past Merzlikins.

The Capitals’ power play has been flawed and ineffective throughout this season, but after Mantha’s and Ovechkin’s tallies Thursday, they have scored on the power play in four of their past five games — raising their conversion rate to 12.5 percent, no longer last in the NHL.

“It feels great, honestly, inside the locker room,” Mantha said. “We kind of knew that it was going to eventually click. It couldn’t go the way it did early on. The guys made the adjustments and they’re still doing the adjustments to make it work.”

Share this article Share

It was clear, from the way the Blue Jackets began to pressure Washington goalie Charlie Lindgren (34 saves) in the second period, that Mantha’s first goal wouldn’t be enough to eke out a win. After spending much of the frame in Washington’s defensive zone, Columbus finally beat Lindgren at 15:18 as Cole Sillinger deflected a shot from Emil Bemstrom over Lindgren’s pad.

Advertisement

But the Capitals came back to life after Sillinger scored. Washington hasn’t completed many tic-tac-toe passing plays this season, but the Capitals put one together for Mantha’s second, just over two minutes after Sillinger’s goal. Carlson passed the puck down to winger Aliaksei Protas at the bottom of the right circle, and he one-touched a pass to Mantha at the edge of the slot.

The Capitals then found themselves in an uncomfortably familiar position, giving up a game-tying goal late in the third period. Their fatigue, on the second night of a back-to-back, was evident in the second half of the game, and Yegor Chinakhov scored with 7:11 remaining to force overtime.

“This one was right up there with the most challenging that we’ve had this year,” Carbery said. “You could just tell in that third period, and we talked about it. We knew what was coming. We had just been in this situation last night, and we had nothing in the tank, physically and mentally.”

Advertisement

In overtime, the two teams traded opportunities, with the Blue Jackets having a slight edge in dangerous chances. Then Columbus forward Kent Johnson tumbled into the net alongside Wilson, and Merzlikins’s fuse was lit. As he reached in to collect his stick from under Wilson, the two began to scrap, and Merzlikins threw several punches before the two were separated.

Merzlikins received a penalty for roughing, which gave the Capitals the power play that produced the game-winner.

“Power play steps up once again,” Carbery said. “O with a huge goal. And Tom Wilson, too, I think deserves a lot of credit for holding his composure there. You knew what was going on there. Merzlikins was sort of trying to create an odd-man rush and get in his way subtly, but obviously, Willy, to hold his composure and draw the power play there, arguably you could say is the difference in the game.”

525,,,Young Americans are more pro-Palestinian than their elders. Why?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/21/us-support-israel-palestine-poll/,"Listen 8 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Across more than two months of war between Israel and Hamas, public opinion on the conflict has continuously shifted. But there has been a constant: a divide between the views of older and younger Americans that has shown up both during the war and in the years leading up to it.

A late October YouGov poll is illustrative. It found that more people ages 18-29 sympathized with Palestinians than with Israelis in the current conflict — the only age bracket with that view (28 percent expressed more sympathy with Palestinians vs. 20 percent for Israelis — though even more sympathized with both peoples equally, 31 percent). Older groups were more likely to sympathize with Israelis than Palestinians or both groups equally, particularly those 65 and older. Fourteen percent of 18- to 29-year-olds thought it was “very important” for the United States to protect Israel compared with two-thirds of those 65 or older.

Experts say there are multiple explanations behind why age could be a factor in Americans’ opinions on Israel and its relationship with Palestinians.

Two generations, two narratives

Each age group has a different “generational memory” of Israel, Dov Waxman, director of the UCLA Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for Israel Studies, said. Beliefs about the world tend to form in our late teens and early 20s and often don’t change, he said.

Advertisement

Older generations, with a more visceral sense of the Holocaust, tend to see Israel as a vital refuge for the Jews, he said, and see its story as one of a people returning to safety in their homeland after living for 2,000 years as a scattered diaspora facing persistent persecution.

In the decades after its founding, Israel was a relatively lower-income and vulnerable country. Its military victories against its neighbors, in 1948, 1967 and 1973, were generally admired in the West. (An estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes during the months before and after the 1948 war that created Israel.)

But by the time millennials began forming their understanding of global events, the violence of the second Intifada had concluded in the mid-2000s with enhanced walls and barriers constructed between Israel and the West Bank, and then Gaza. This generation formed its idea of Israel from reports of Palestinians denied access to water, freedom of movement and fair trials, under the military control of what was by then a relatively rich, nuclear-armed power.

Advertisement

“When I was in college it was the Oslo peace process, and I still remember that Israel — pursuing peace with the Palestinians and the hopes that came along with that,” Waxman said, of the ’90s. “Younger Americans have no memory of that.”

A racial justice lens

Joey Ayoub, a Palestinian-Lebanese writer, podcaster and academic, says young Americans are more likely to conceptualize the Palestinian cause as a sister issue to U.S. efforts for racial justice. There is a “visual parallel,” he said: of an armed soldier or police officer dominating a space inhabited by a populace with limited power, whether in a town in the occupied West Bank or a majority-Black neighborhood in the United States.

“It’s a natural ally to the Palestinian struggle, because it’s very similar if you think of it in terms of the bullet points being demanded — the right to dignity, the right to life and so on,” he said.

Advertisement

He sees 2014 as a pivotal year in a new generation’s understanding of the conflict. A war in Gaza killed about 2,250 Palestinians and 73 Israelis at roughly the same time as protests erupted in Ferguson, Mo., over the police shooting of an unarmed Black man.

“Palestinian Americans were tweeting advice towards African Americans about how to deal with tear gas, for example,” he said. “That was something very symbolically powerful.”

Eitan Hersh, a political science professor at Tufts University, said conflict between Israel and Palestinians seems to be seen by the young left, especially on college campuses, as “a people of color — that is, the Palestinians — rising up against a white oppressor,” though a significant portion of Israel’s Jewish population is of a non-European background. (Some are the descendants of about 850,000 Jews who were expelled from Arab countries and Iran after Israel was founded.)

Advertisement

“It’s a bit of a curiosity,” he said. “One could tell an oppressor-oppressed story where the Jews, and Israel, is a story of the oppressed: kicked out of all these countries, going back to their homeland, surrounded by a broad set of dominant countries in the region that wants to destroy it.”

Shifting demographics

One explanation for the generational divide, experts said, was that fewer Gen Zers and millennials identify as conservative or Christian — demographics more likely to sympathize with Israel — than older groups.

Share this article Share

“Young adults in America on the left think of Israel in the same way that they might think about Iran, or China or Russia,” said Hersh, referring to a 2021 study of young Americans’ views on Israel compared with other nations. It found more than half of moderate and conservative Americans ages 18-30 held a positive view of Israel.

Thirty years ago, support for Israel was associated more with Democrats than Republicans, Waxman said. This began to change during the George W. Bush presidency, after 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when a perception on the American right developed “that Israel is the front line in this clash of civilizations — between a Judeo-Christian civilization and militant Islam,” Waxman said.

Donald Trump’s support of Israel, including moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to the more contested city of Jerusalem, furthered the trend, said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland.

“The fascinating thing there is that attitudes toward Islam and Muslims actually improved in America with the rise of Trump,” Telhami said. “People said, ‘We hate Trump, Trump hates Muslims, therefore, we like Muslims,” he said of progressives.

Advertisement

Another “major factor” in older generations’ feelings toward Israel is their greater religiosity, according to Waxman. More than three-quarters of Americans 60-64 are Christian — with increasingly higher numbers for older brackets — compared with about half of adults under 30.

“It’s, I think, for many religious Christians, somehow a kind of atonement in supporting Israel and Zionism,” Waxman added. “Genuinely, a feeling of Israel as a consequence of this long history of Jewish persecution” by Christians.

Some Christians, particularly among evangelicals who are especially likely to sympathize with Israel, believe that Israel was promised to the Jews by God, and that the return of the Jews to Israel fulfills a biblical prophecy of the events that will precede the second coming of Jesus Christ.

But even outside of this belief, the idea of Israel as a sacred land for Judeo-Christians has an emotional resonance that is simply not present for the increasing number of secular young Americans.

Advertisement

“There’s a connection between Israel as they see it in the Bible and Israel that exists politically today,” Telhami said of some Christians. There is an association between place names like “Hebron,” “Jerusalem” and “the Galilee” with Bible stories as much as with 21st-century geopolitics, and a long history of hearing this geography referred to as the home of the Israelites, particularly through the Old Testament.

Social vs traditional media

Dana El Kurd, a nonresident fellow at the Middle East Institute, said different types of media consumption have probably played a role in how people have formed their views on the Middle East.

Americans 45 and older are most likely to get their news from TV networks and their websites, and Americans younger than 45 are most likely to get their news through social media, according to 2022 YouGov polling.

The regular use of TikTok in particular is correlated with criticism of Israel, a New York Times/Siena poll found this week.

Ayoub, whose interview podcast “The Fire These Times” with Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, Jewish, and Armenian perspectives has mostly Gen Z and millennial listeners, said that new forms of media facilitated access between content creators and consumers without “having a gatekeeper.” This has downsides, including “a huge uptick in misinformation” online, he said, but also positives, including allowing traditionally underrepresented groups to reach an audience.

On social media, Palestinians in Gaza such as filmmaker Bisan Owda and photographer Motaz Azaiza have accrued millions of followers sharing content directly from the war zone.

TikTok has been criticized, especially by Republicans, because pro-Palestinian hashtags appear to be more popular than pro-Israel hashtags on the app. But the company says that phenomenon occurred organically, not because the company was intentionally manipulating its algorithm.

“I’ll give an anecdote,” El Kurd said. “My students, when the war broke out, said that they had gone onto TikTok and toggled between the different locations,” to see what kind of videos were popular in Israel compared with Gaza, the West Bank and other places. “It had never occurred to me before to do that.”",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/

President Biden said he will send top U.S. officials to Mexico in the coming days to seek help with the record migration surge that has pushed the number of illegal border crossings to more than 10,000 per day, prompting U.S. authorities to shut down two major railway crossings and other ports of entry.

“More enforcement actions are urgently needed to reopen key ports of entry across our shared border,” Biden wrote Thursday evening on X (formerly Twitter), after speaking by phone earlier in the day with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall will travel to Mexico “in the coming days” to meet with the Mexican leader and urge a firmer response, the White House said.

Thousands of migrants from countries around the world have been streaming across the border this month, the second consecutive December that U.S. agents have faced a massive influx during the holiday season.

Mexico’s immigration enforcement agency, the Instituto Nacional de Migración, has slackened its operations in recent weeks as its annual funding runs low, according to U.S. and Mexican officials.

In Lukeville, Ariz., families with children and groups from Africa, Asia and South America have been entering through breaches in the U.S. border wall where smugglers have sawed through.

In Eagle Pass, Tex., Border Patrol agents have had to set up a sprawling outdoor reception area to manage the thousands of migrants arriving daily by wading across the Rio Grande. Agents are facing spikes in Jacumba Hot Springs, Calif., as well as El Paso and other remote sections of southern Arizona.

Mexican forces are rarely visible on the south side of the border. The country’s National Guard has played a key role during previous migration crackdowns, but there has been scant presence of troops in recent weeks at the busiest crossing points.

Many migrants have arrived to the United States by riding freight trains through Mexico. The Biden administration’s decision to close the rail crossings at El Paso and Eagle Pass, Tex. — an attempt to stem the tide of migrants — is a significant disruption of commerce between the United States and its top trading partner.

U.S. farm groups, the rail companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are urging the Biden administration to reopen the crossings as soon as possible. Train operator Union Pacific said that the two crossings account for 45 percent of all cross-border rail commerce and that the shutdowns are inflicting losses of $200 million per day in wages, goods and transportation costs.

The Biden administration has not said publicly what specific actions it wants Mexico to take. Mexican authorities have long been wary of offers by the United States to help pay for immigration enforcement actions on Mexican soil.

“Everything revolves around getting the Mexican government to do targeted operations,” said one U.S. official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.

The United States would like to expand deportation flights to southern Mexico that would carry migrants from that region as well as Central Americans, two officials said.

Mexico’s cooperation with U.S. immigration enforcement has fluctuated in recent years, and both the Biden and Trump administrations have turned to Mexico for help when illegal crossings soar. Mexican law offers broad protections to migrants transiting the country, which makes crackdowns more difficult. The country’s enforcement efforts are weakened further by corruption and bribe-taking.

Robert M. Solow, who won the 1987 Nobel Prize in economics for exploring the impact of technology on economic growth, work that spawned a wider understanding of what drives the expansion of industrial economics, died Dec. 21 at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 99. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The death was confirmed by his son John. No cause was given.

The son of a fur buyer, Dr. Solow was a Brooklyn-born Harvard graduate with a quicksilver wit and liberal political leanings. His research made him a respected voice on public policy, particularly on matters of employment.

Dr. Solow, who spent most of his career teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, served on government panels and was a senior staff economist on President John F. Kennedy’s Council of Economic Advisers in the early 1960s. He was a believer in the Keynesian theory of government intervention in the economy, which put him at odds with conservative economists such as Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate who espoused free markets.

“Everything reminds Milton Friedman of the money supply,” Dr. Solow quipped while on a panel with Friedman. “Everything reminds me of sex, but I try to keep it out of my papers.”

In a special 2007 issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy devoted to the impact of Dr. Solow’s work, the editors wrote that his seminal 1956 paper, “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth,” and a follow-up paper in 1957, “Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function,” were “among the most influential and revered articles in economic theory.”

Those papers, the editors wrote, had “transformed growth theory from arguably obscure debates about stability and gloomy knife-edge properties into a fully fledged, flexible framework for analyzing key growth questions [such as] the impact of changes in savings, population, depreciation, and technical progress on the level and growth of output.”

Dr. Solow was essentially a theorist who devised statistical or mathematical models to describe the interplay of economic forces and was a pioneer in what came to be known as “total factor productivity,” the respective contributions of labor, natural resources and capital goods to increases in national income.

He was in his 30s when he laid the groundwork for his Nobel-winning theories, devising mathematical analyses that showed how technological progress accounted for much of U.S. economic growth in the first half of the 20th century. Previously, increases in capital and labor alone were widely believed to have played dominant roles in the growth rate.

“Solow’s theoretical model had an enormous impact on economic analysis,” the citation from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences read. “… Above all, Solow’s growth model constitutes a framework within which modern macroeconomic theory can be structured.”

The strong role of technological progress identified by Dr. Solow contributed to a greater emphasis by governments on higher education and technological research.

His liberal politics found expression in a collection of papers appraising the Kennedy-Johnson years that he and economist Eli Ginzberg of Columbia University compiled and edited. It was published in 1974 as “The Great Society: Lessons for the Future.”

In a final chapter, Dr. Solow and Ginzberg wrote that “there is nothing in the history of the 1960s to suggest that it is a law of nature that social legislation cannot deal effectively with social problems, or that state and local governments or private enterprise will always do better than the ‘Feds.’”

It was as if they were disputing the conservative doctrine of the Reagan administration, to come less than a decade later.

Implying support for a government safety net to help those with the lowest incomes, the editors also said: “The prolonged economic prosperity of the 1960s helped to lift many families out of poverty but this longest boom in the nation’s history also proved that economic growth is not the answer for all who lack an adequate income.”

The oldest of three children, Robert Merton Solow was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 23, 1924.

“I was good at school from the very beginning, but not very intellectual until my last year in high school,” he wrote in a Nobel biographical statement. “Then one of those teachers who make a difference taught me to read the great 19th century French and Russian novelists, and to take ideas seriously.”

He graduated from high school two months before he turned 16. He initially planned to enter Brooklyn College, whose tuition was free to New York City residents, but enrolled at Harvard University in 1940 on a full scholarship after an English teacher convinced him he probably could get into the elite college.

Months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Harvard sophomore enlisted in the Army because “it seemed that there were more urgent and exciting matters than what I was doing,” he wrote in his Nobel statement.

He spoke German and knew Morse code, and so the Army assigned him to a signals intelligence unit that fought its way up the Italian peninsula in 1943-1945. The unit’s mission was to intercept, decode and translate communications between German tactical units.

For his leadership of that unit, then-Tech Sgt. Solow was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, but he turned down a battlefield commission as a second lieutenant. He explained in a 2014 interview for this obituary that taking the commission would have altered his relationship with the other enlisted men in his unit or would have led to his transfer to another unit.

In August 1945, he was on home leave pending possible reassignment to the Pacific for the invasion of Japan when word came of the Japanese surrender after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Looking back, he recalled in the MIT interview, “I have never held it against Harry Truman that he dropped that bomb.”

That same year, he married Barbara Lewis, a Radcliffe student who became an economic historian. She died in 2014. Survivors include sons John Solow and Andrew Solow; a daughter, Katherine Solow; eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

After his military discharge, Robert Solow completed his undergraduate studies at Harvard in 1947. He also became research assistant to future Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief, a pioneer of the economic input-output analysis. Leontief “taught me economic theory and use of mathematics in economics,” he said.

He joined the MIT faculty in 1949, while still working on his doctoral dissertation for Harvard (a degree he received in 1951). In 1961, he won the John Bates Clark Medal, given by the American Economic Association to an American economist under age 40 who has made the most significant contributions to the field. In 1979, he served as the association’s president.

At MIT, Dr. Solow formed a close relationship with the economic theorist and textbook author Paul A. Samuelson, whose office was next door. Samuelson, who died in 2009, was the first American economist to win a Nobel. Their proximity at MIT, Dr. Solow later wrote in his Nobel biography, “began what is now almost 40 years of almost daily conversations about economics, politics, our children, cabbages and kings.”

Dr. Solow also became known for his mentorship of future Nobel laureates such as George A. Akerlof and Joseph E. Stiglitz (who shared the prize in 2001) and Peter A. Diamond (2010). They were among many high-powered graduate students who enrolled at MIT as Dr. Solow and others emphasized that the department put the education of students ahead of faculty research.

After retiring from teaching in 1995, Dr. Solow pursued several intellectual interests. He and Alan Krueger, a Princeton-based scholar and future chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, compiled and edited essays about the U.S. economic boom of 1995-2000 in their book “The Roaring Nineties: Can Full Employment be Sustained?” (2001).

Dr. Solow also devoted himself to examining, with others, the nature and institutional background of low-wage work in the United States and a few European countries.

Dr. Solow was not hostile to technology (it was central to his theory of economic growth), but he disliked and rarely used email. He offered this “economist’s explanation” of his distaste for electronic correspondence in the 2014 interview for this obituary: “If you make communications costless, you will get messages of zero value.”",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/
528,,,Three Wash. police officers found not guilty in death of Manuel Ellis,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/12/21/manny-ellis-verdict-tacoma-not-guilty/,"Listen 4 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Jurors in Tacoma, Wash., on Thursday found three officers not guilty in the March 2020 death of Manuel “Manny” Ellis, a Black man who was restrained, handcuffed and Tasered by police. Officers Christopher Burbank, 38, and Matthew Collins, 40, were found not guilty of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. The third officer, Timothy Rankine, 34, was found not guilty of first-degree manslaughter.

Ellis, 33, had been out walking on the night of March 3, 2020, when he stopped beside a police car and “briefly” interacted with the officers inside before continuing on his way, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson’s office said when it announced the charges in May 2021. Witnesses said the exchange was respectful, with no signs of aggression. But just after Ellis began to walk away, Burbank and Collins got out of the vehicle and wrestled him to the ground, the report said. Rankine was the first officer who responded to the scene, and he helped Burbank and Collins restrain Ellis, according to the attorney general’s office.

During the struggle with the officers, Ellis could be heard saying, “Can’t breathe, sir,” according to security camera footage. His death led to protests in Tacoma, with community members joining Ellis’s family in calling for accountability for the police department.

“I know the Ellis family is hurting, and my heart goes out to them,” Ferguson said in a statement after the verdicts were delivered. The case marked the first time the attorney general’s office had brought criminal charges against police officers for unlawful use of deadly force.

The Tacoma Police Department’s internal investigation, which is independent of the criminal trial, is ongoing, according to a statement from the city, which added that the years since Ellis’s death “have been filled with wide-spread anger, mistrust, and apprehension.” The department’s investigation will probably be finished Friday, the statement said, and its police chief will decide within the next two weeks whether the officers involved will face disciplinary action.

Around 11 p.m. on March 3, 2020, Ellis had walked to 7-Eleven for a snack, the attorney general’s office report said.

On the walk back, he passed a police car stopped at a red light and talked to the officers, which witnesses said seemed to be a casual conversation, according to the report. After Ellis turned away, Burbank swung open the passenger door, striking him and “knocking him to his knees,” the report states.

According to video cited within it, Burbank wrapped his arms around Ellis, lifted him up and then drove his body into the ground. Collins also got out of the police car and struck Ellis in the head at least four times, the report states. While Collins held Ellis in a restraint, Burbank used a Taser on him, according to the report. Ellis told the officers he could not breathe multiple times throughout the struggle, the report adds.

After Rankine came to the scene, he “started applying pressure to Ellis’s back,” the report states, adding that he “continued to pin Ellis to the ground with his body weight” until the fire department arrived.

Ellis was declared dead at the scene. The Pierce County medical examiner ruled his cause of death was hypoxia, or a lack of oxygen, “due to physical restraint.”

While witnesses told prosecutors it did not appear that Ellis ever struck the officers, according to the report, Burbank and Collins told other officers that Ellis had tried to get into another car near where they were stopped and that he had attacked them.

During the officers’ trial, their attorneys argued that Ellis “created his own death” and that he “forced the officers to use force against him.”

Wayne Fricke, an attorney representing Burbank, also told The Washington Post that the incident was “not a George Floyd case.” The charges against the three Tacoma officers were brought more than a month after Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted in Floyd’s murder.

Fricke told The Post earlier this month that he and the officers’ attorneys believe Ellis died because of drug use, not the officers’ use of force. While Ellis’s autopsy showed the presence of methamphetamine, Pierce County Medical Examiner Thomas Clark said that Ellis’s death was likely not caused by the drug, according to the attorney general’s report.

Jury deliberations began last week after about two months of trial. After the not guilty verdicts were delivered, Ellis’s family members gathered for a rally in Tacoma near a mural dedicated to him, KOMO reported. During the rally, James Bible, an attorney representing the Ellis family, said they would be asking for a federal probe of the case.

“You will do something about this, or we will do something about this,” Bible said. “That is the reality.”

The United States is prepared to support a new draft resolution in the U.N. Security Council that calls for an indefinite pause in the fighting to permit more humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said late Thursday. A vote on the measure is scheduled for Friday. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight “We’re ready to move forward,” Thomas-Greenfield told reporters outside the council chamber after a fourth straight day of closed-door negotiations. “It will be a resolution — if the resolution is put forward as is — that we can support.”

The new draft replaces a resolution offered Monday by Arab countries that avoided calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the war, in hopes of avoiding language that had brought U.S. vetoes of several previous U.N. votes since Israel began military operations in Gaza immediately following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.

Advertisement

The new draft retains much of the Monday language, calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” in the fighting throughout Gaza and the opening of corridors inside the enclave “for a sufficient number of days to enable full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access.”

But it alters another passage involving the pre-screening of all goods going into Gaza, calling for U.N. Secretary General António Guterres to appoint a senior coordinator “with responsibility for facilitating, coordinating, monitoring, and verifying in Gaza, as appropriate, the humanitarian nature” of all assistance, and demands that “the parties to the conflict cooperate with the coordinator to fulfill their mandate without delay or obstruction.”

That vague phrasing replaces initial wording that gave Guterres “exclusive” control over all truck inspections, a formulation that was rejected by both the United States and Israel. Until now, screening has been performed by Israel alone, seeking to prevent any military or other assistance going to Hamas. U.N. officials had also asked for more “flexibility” in the language, according to people familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive negotiations.

U.S. support for the resolution comes as the Biden administration has become increasingly isolated in its support for Israel and refusal to support widespread calls for a cease-fire, even as it has pressed for a change in Israeli military tactics amid nearly 20,000 civilian deaths from its airstrikes and ground operations, according to Gazan health authorities, and international warnings of widespread famine and disease in Gaza.

Over a quarter of the population of Gaza faces “catastrophic hunger and starvation,” according to a study published Thursday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), part of an international early warning system first established in the 1980s by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Drawing on data from the United Nations and other sources, the report says approximately 576,600 people have run out of food completely, with the broader population facing acute food insecurity.

The staggering figures stand out even against more encompassing global hunger statistics.

“The number of people facing ‘catastrophic’ levels of hunger in Gaza is four times greater than the total number of people facing ‘catastrophic’ levels of hunger worldwide,” said World Food Program (WFP) spokesperson Steve Taravella. “The scale and swiftness of this crisis is unprecedented in modern times,” Taravella said. “If current predictions continue, we will reach famine by February.”

“We have worked hard and diligently over the course of the past week with the Emiratis, with others, with Egypt, to come up with a resolution that we can support,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “And we do have that resolution now. We’re ready to vote on it. And it’s a resolution that will bring humanitarian assistance to those in need.”

Share this article Share

In addition to questions about the inspections, U.N. officials have said the distribution of aid flowing into Gaza — only a fraction of what is needed, according to humanitarian organizations — has been prevented by ongoing Israeli attacks.

Advertisement

“Currently, intense fighting, lack of electricity, limited fuel and disrupted telecommunications severely restrict access to loading points and to trucks” inside Gaza for distribution, Guterres spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Thursday.

Even before wide-scale Israeli attacks moved to southern Gaza, officials from the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have assessed Israel’s lengthy inspection regime as contributing to delays in assistance. While the United States was “actively working with our partners” on language in the U.N. resolution about the issue, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, “Israel has had, and understandably so, … a role in the inspection regime — a key role, a pivotal role. And we understand and respect that.”

In an angry response to charges that Israel is hindering the flow of aid, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said it was the United Nations’ “utter failure” to provide for the people of Gaza.

“Today it is possible to provide three times the amount of humanitarian aid to Gaza if the U.N. — instead of complaining all day — would do its job,” Herzog said, according to a Times of Israel report on Herzog’s meeting with a visiting French lawmaker. He repeated that Israel is ready to pause the fighting and facilitate far more aid into Gaza if Hamas will release about 130 Israeli and foreign hostages it still holds.

The draft resolution calls for the “immediate and unconditional” release of the hostages. It also demands that “all parties to the conflict comply with their obligations under international law ... including with regard to the conduct of hostilities and the protection of civilians and civilian objects.”",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) tried to compel a Seattle hospital to hand over information about gender-affirming treatment Texas youths may have received across state lines, according to court filings, signaling an escalation of his office’s attempts to crack down on Texans’ ability to access such health care. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Seattle Children’s Hospital requested a Texas judge nullify, or at least rein in, Paxton’s demands, arguing that his office lacks the jurisdiction over the Washington state hospital. In filings this month, the hospital said Paxton’s queries — made under the guise of an investigation by the AG’s consumer protection division — were “sham requests.”

Paxton’s office did not respond to request for comment about the hospital’s filing Thursday.

A spokesperson for Seattle Children’s Hospital declined to comment on the specifics of its legal action. In a statement, the spokesperson said the hospital complies with the law for all heath-care services and “took legal action to protect private patient information related to gender-affirming care services at our organization sought by the Texas Attorney General.”

Conservative lawmakers have driven efforts in recent years to criminalize gender-affirming care with laws similar to ones that restrict abortion access by creating legal liability for health-care providers and the in-state portion of people’s travel for out-of-state care.

Paxton has been at the vanguard of such efforts. Last year, his office investigated clinics in Austin, Dallas and Houston for providing gender-affirming care, leading them to close or stop offering the services. Paxton’s office also requested records from the Texas Department of Public Safety for those who had changed their sex on their driver’s licenses.

Paxton’s legal battle with Seattle Children’s Hospital marks a rare instance of conservative officials reaching the state’s long arm beyond their own borders.

Officials and doctors with Seattle Children’s Hospital signed affidavits saying the hospital has virtually no ties to the state of Texas: The hospital is not incorporated in Texas, does not have bank accounts or property in the state, does not advertise youth gender-affirming care in Texas and does not have physicians or health staffers who provide care in Texas.

Advertisement

The hospital’s legal filing further argues the information the Texas attorney general requested was for private medical records and health information covered under HIPAA and Washington state privacy laws.

Among the requests by Paxton’s office were documents for how many Texas children the hospital treated for gender dysphoria, the number of “gender reassignment” surgeries performed and specific medications hospital employees had prescribed to children from Texas.

“The demands are an unconstitutional attempt to investigate and chill potential travel by Texas residents to obtain healthcare in another state,” attorneys for the hospital wrote.

For families like Lisa Stanton’s, the hostile climate fostered by Texas’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies became overwhelming. Last summer, Stanton and her family moved to Colorado from Texas because of the state’s treatment of transgender children. On Thursday, her phone was “blowing up” with messages about the Seattle lawsuit.

“My moms group, we were all discussing it,” said Stanton, who has a 12-year-old transgender daughter.

Share this article Share

Other state attorneys general have requested similar records, but they have focused their requests on hospitals within their own states. Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville confirmed in June that it had turned over the medical records of transgender patients as part of a probe by the Tennessee attorney general’s office.

“We would hope most hospitals would respond as Seattle is, but what happened at Vanderbilt was shocking,” said Stanton, who noted that the Vanderbilt hospital now faces a lawsuit for releasing patient records.

Stanton predicted some families in states such as Texas who hadn’t previously considered moving will flee the state as the fear and risks of staying grow so strong that they outweigh the loss of leaving home.

At that thought, Stanton started to cry.

“It is a loss. It’s hard to be away from your friends, your community, all the people you care about,” she said. But in Texas, they were not safe anymore. “When very bad people have your information, you have to get out.”

If the courts rule in Paxton’s favor, it could give “a powerful tool to any other hostile state” wishing to similarly burden providers of gender-affirming care anywhere in the country, said David B. Cruz, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California.

“It does seem like this action by the attorney general is trying to push the state of Texas’s efforts further to restrict gender-affirming care and reduce or limit the ability of medical professionals to treat these people who need it,” Cruz said.

Ian Pittman, an Austin-based attorney representing families with transgender children, including some who sued Paxton and the state for using Child Protective Services to investigate them, said Texas’s SB14 law, which restricts gender-affirming care for youths, does not bar families from seeking the care out of state. If courts grant Paxton access to transgender Texas youths’ out-of-state medical records, he said, that may not matter.

Pittman likened the attacks on the LGBTQ+ community by the Texas GOP to attacks on reproductive and voting rights in recent years.

“They think that by harassing families like this, and generally making the state inhospitable, that two things will happen: People who are impacted will be more likely to move out of the state, and people who are not impacted but whose ideology is aligned with this will be more likely to move to the state,” Pittman said. “... It’s all connected and an attempt to maintain power.”

Beyond contesting Paxton’s jurisdiction over the matter, Seattle Children’s Hospital argued in its filing that it is protected under the state’s recently enacted Shield Law.

The law, crafted in response to the Dobbs ruling that eliminated federal protections related to abortion access, protects providers of abortion and gender-affirming treatment and their patients. Under the law, Washington courts and law enforcement may not aid, enforce subpoenas and investigations by or make arrests at the request of outside states seeking to prosecute treatment that they ban but that is legal in Washington.

Washington state Sen. Drew Hansen (D), who sponsored the Shield Law, said the legislature crafted the measure specifically to protect people in Washington from “aggressive overreach from states like Texas.”

“They say, ‘Don’t mess with Texas.’ But also don’t mess with Washington state,” Hansen said. “We make our own laws here. Other states don’t get to harass people here because of legal choices they made.”",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/

He warned the Philippines not to collude with “ill-intentioned external forces” — a likely reference to Manila’s treaty ally, the U.S. — while claiming it has provoked maritime incidents and undermined China’s lawful rights. An international tribunal ruled against China’s South China Sea claims in 2016, but Beijing has refused to acknowledge the verdict.

Mr. Wang said disputes should be resolved by dialogue, and Mr. Manalo characterized the telephone talks as “frank and candid.” Relations deteriorated after the 2002 election of Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., who reversed the pro-China policies of predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.

High-profile clashes have played out in disputed waters off the Philippines in recent weeks. Chinese coast guard ships and maritime militia — weaponized fishing fleets — rammed and fired water cannons at Philippine vessels.

The intentions of Mr. Wang, who reportedly requested the talks, are not clear, analysts said.

Alex Neill, a Singapore-based analyst of Chinese security matters and a fellow at Pacific Forum, said it was unclear whether the Chinese minister was trying to cool the crisis or escalate China’s claims but added, “My gut feeling is it is probably the latter.”

China’s official press has dismissed a U.S.-led coalition formed this week to protect maritime traffic in the Red Sea from attacks from pro-Iran, Yemen-based Houthi rebels as a “Band-Aid” given the larger regional crisis, but “freedom of navigation” has become a mantra of the U.S. Navy in repeated challenges to China’s claims regarding Taiwan and the South China Sea.

If tensions in the South China Sea — a mass of disputed shoals, reefs and islands — escalate from coast guard clashes to full-scale naval activity, the Pentagon’s Operation Prosperity Guardian could provide a template for a similar Washington-led coalition in East Asia. Governments in the strategic “First Island Chain” — the arc of islands closest to the Chinese mainland encompassing Japan, Taiwan, portions of the Philippines and Indonesia — are already leaning heavily toward Washington.

Farther afield

China has shown signs of focusing farther afield on countries where relations have not been so antagonistic. In recent days, senior Chinese leaders have engaged with the communist nations on China’s northeastern and southwestern flanks.

Mr. Wang hosted North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Pak Yong Ho in Beijing on Monday, the same day Pyongyang test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. Although little information about their meeting was released, it was reportedly friendly, with Beijing offering to upgrade cooperation and communications.

China has long been North Korea’s core supplier of food and fuel. North Korea’s ties with Russia have tightened in recent months, and Moscow is positioned to supply grain and power and potentially reduce Pyongyang’s reliance on Beijing.

Still, Chinese leaders apparently have concluded that Beijing is positioned to expand its influence as heavily sanctioned Russia joins long-isolated North Korea as a dependency.

“I don’t think China is too concerned,” said Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at Seoul’s Asan Institute. “China can dominate relations with either party.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping made a two-day visit to Vietnam last week, his first in six years. He visited the mausoleum of state founder Ho Chi Minh and was received by leaders of the ruling Vietnamese Community Party.

Party-party ties are believed to be strong. Mr. Xi and Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong signed 36 agreements on infrastructure, security, trade and other matters. The details of most agreements were not released.

In September, Vietnam warmly welcomed President Biden for talks that resulted in deals on semiconductors, minerals and other issues and elevated the U.S. to the same high diplomatic status extended to China and Russia.

As global manufacturers exit China, Vietnam is emerging as a high-tech investment destination. Vietnam has traditionally obtained its arms from Russia, which, because of its war in Ukraine, is constrained from significant arms sales.

China-Vietnam ties are clouded by simmering territorial disputes in the South China Sea. In Hanoi, the two countries agreed to establish a maritime crisis hotline and possibly operate joint naval patrols. It’s unclear, however, whether the two countries, which fought a war in 1979, are fully on the same page.

“A nice gloss is painted over these events as the two parties would like to paint a rosy picture of their relationship,” Mr. Neill said. “But truth be told, they are rivals — historic rivals. … There is too much weight laid on party-party relations.”

China’s dwindling peripheral influence

The end of the COVID-19 pandemic left Beijing with significant diplomatic ground to make up. Pro-American administrations hold office to its east, in South Korea and Japan, and to its south, in Taiwan and the Philippines. The Biden administration has moved to strengthen ties with all four nations.

Regional players in East Asia, jittery about Chinese assertiveness, are weaving a web of multi- and “mini-lateral” security ties extending as far as Australia and Britain. The result: In the strategic First Island Chain, China is losing political ground.

Japan is fortifying its southern Ryukyu Islands. The Pentagon obtained permission this year for expanded rotational troop deployments to the Philippines, notably in northern Luzon.

Both locations are adjacent to Taiwan and cover naval chokepoints flanking the island democracy, which China has vowed to take over one day. On Jan. 13, Taiwanese voters go to the polls, with the anti-Beijing ruling party widely expected to win a third consecutive term for the presidency.

The coming year may also bring headaches for Chinese diplomats.

“The U.S. and U.K. are demonstrating they are willing to intervene in the Red Sea against the Houthis,” Mr. Neill said. “That sends a message to the South China Sea, where there is a potential for unmanaged escalation.”

North Korea, constantly talking up untested tactical nuclear weapons, is also looking restive and uneasy over its dependence on Beijing.

“My belief is that China is concerned about North Korea’s behavior next year,” said the Asan Institute’s Mr. Go. “I think the North will engage in a major nuclear test or an ICBM test at a normal angle — over Japan — teasing the U.S. and Japan to try and shoot it down.”

535,,,"New naval coalition a ‘highway patrol’ to thwart Houthi ‘bandits’ in Red Sea, Pentagon says",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/new-naval-coalition-highway-patrol-to-thwart-houth/,"The Defense Department described Yemen’s Houthi rebels as “bandits” preying on merchant ships passing through the “international highway” that is the Red Sea. That makes the new U.S.-organized Operation Prosperity Guardian multinational task force a maritime highway patrol charged with keeping the peace in the region, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday.

The Iran-backed Houthis began launching drones and missiles at merchant ships passing through the Bab al-Mandab Strait linking the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden after Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel. More than 20 nations have now signed on to participate in the mission, Defense Department officials said.

“This is an international problem that requires an international response. We will continue to work with this ‘coalition of the willing’ and all countries will be able to contribute what they feel that they can,” Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman told reporters. “In some cases, that will include vessels [and] in other cases, it could include staff or other types of support.”

Operation Prosperity Guardian will fall under Combined Maritime Forces, an international naval coalition based in Bahrain under the command of the U.S. 5th Fleet.

“The Houthis aren’t attacking just one country. They’re attacking the economic well-being and prosperity of nations around the world,” Gen. Ryder said. “This is a defensive coalition that is there to help reassure global shipping and mariners as they transit the straits.”

Several major shipping companies and oil firms have suspended travel through the Red Sea after more than a dozen civilian ships came under attack since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Houthi officials say their campaign is a show of support for the Palestinian cause in the fighting.

Pentagon officials declined to elaborate on the strategy and tactics Operation Prosperity Guardian will employ to counter the Houthi attacks on merchant ships. The forces will cover an area of about 450 miles, the distance from Washington, D.C. to Boston.

“We’re going to continue to work with the international community to safeguard those vessels that are transiting those waterways,” Gen. Ryder said. “I would hope that the Houthis would understand the pressure that they are going to bring onto themselves if they don’t stop these attacks.”

536,,,Gen. Brown speaks with Chinese counterpart for first time since assuming top Pentagon job,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/gen-cq-brown-speaks-chinese-counterpart-first-time/,"Months of urging from the Pentagon for military leaders in China to communicate paid off Thursday when Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke with his Chinese counterpart by video teleconference.

It was the first time Gen. Brown spoke with Gen. Liu Zhenli of the People’s Liberation Army since he replaced retired Army Gen. Mark Milley on the Joint Chiefs in October.

“Gen. Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain open and direct lines of communication,” the Defense Department said. “Gen. Brown reiterated the importance of the People’s Liberation Army engaging in substantive dialogue to reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings.”

Thursday’s video call was the first talk between top military leaders from the U.S. and China since August 2022 when Beijing suspended all contact after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. It follows a meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month.

“The two military leaders discussed a number of global and regional security issues,” the Pentagon said.

The U.S. considers China its No. 1 pacing challenge, the only other country capable of marshaling high levels of military and economic power. Washington has accused Beijing of engaging in reckless and provocative behavior in the Pacific. The U.S. Navy regularly sends warships through the Taiwan Strait and other parts of the South China Sea to press its navigation rights.

The Pentagon said Gen. Brown “reaffirmed the importance” of both sides holding high-level talks between Washington and Beijing and between Adm. John C. Aquilino, commander U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and his counterparts in the PLA.

Gen. Brown “regularly communicates with chiefs of defense across the world and remains open to constructive dialogue with the [People’s Republic of China],” the Defense Department said.

537,,,Tesla seeks Nordic guru as labor fight escalates in Europe,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/tesla-seeks-nordic-guru-labor-fight-escalates-euro/,"Tesla is searching for all the help it can get.

According to a job posting on Tesla’s website, the electric vehicle maker wants a Scandinavian public policy expert with a “passion for Tesla’s mission,” who will make sure the “political, regulatory and fiscal frameworks of the ‘Nordics’ support Tesla’s mission.”

Whoever takes the job must reckon with the labor battle between Tesla and the Nordic region.

The battle began in late October when a handful of Tesla mechanics joined the Swedish labor union IF Metall. After Tesla refused to sign a collective agreement with the union, the machinists went on strike.

Other labor unions in Sweden soon launched sympathy strikes, with transport, mail and waste unions agreeing to stop servicing Tesla.

Since Tesla still refused to negotiate with the union, laborers across the Nordic countries launched sympathy strikes against Tesla.

The strikes show no signs of stopping, with Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, having little to say publicly about the issue. Mr. Musk has been openly anti-union for years, recently insisting that unions create a “lords and peasants” situation.

Hamas mapped the locations of border settlements and Israeli Defense Forces positions, then trained its fighters on the weak points of all the sites, The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday.

“They infiltrated Israel, knowing exactly which areas were under less surveillance, where there are observation posts (and) where the dining rooms and sleeping quarters are located,” the newspaper said, citing an Israeli military source. “Terrorists knew about the security vulnerabilities of an IDF base located kilometers away from the border.”

Other Hamas militants brought a video of a server room at an Israeli intelligence base they intended to attack. “Specific computers to be taken from the server room were marked in the video,” the newspaper reported.

Israeli officials said Iran provided the Hamas militants with instructions about which computers they should take during the attack.

“The level of their awareness about the Intelligence Corps base in the western Negev slipped us. They knew exactly what they wanted to achieve,” an IDF source told The Jerusalem Post. “It’s amazing to understand the level of their intent before the war.”

Hamas fighters also were given detailed instructions on tapping into the communications lines between IDF units located near the Gaza Strip, which would have allowed them to eavesdrop on encrypted systems, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Israeli government officials have publicly acknowledged the cascading series of intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to overwhelm their defenses during the Oct. 7 attack. They promised a wide-ranging inquiry once the war is completed, but according to The Jerusalem Post, a unit of Israel’s Intelligence Division has already launched an investigation.

“The field of defense and information security in the IDF will undergo a ‘fundamental change’ in the coming year, which will require the army to rethink its approach and fundamentally change its way of handling this issue,” the newspaper reported.

The bloodshed took place in the philosophy department building of Charles University, where the shooter was a student, Prague Police Chief Martin Vondrasek said. He has not been named publicly.

Police gave no details about the victims or a possible motive for the shooting at the building located near the Vltava River in Jan Palach Square. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said investigators do not suspect a link to any extremist ideology or groups.

Pavel Nedoma, the director of the nearby Rudolfinum Gallery, said he saw from a window a person standing on a balcony of the building and shooting a gun.

Police said they were still searching the area, including the balcony, for possible explosives. The building was evacuated, Prague Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda said.

The building forms part of the square and faces a bridge across the river with a view of Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech presidency. President Petr Pavel said he was “shocked” by what happened and offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims.

Where tourists, students and others would normally be enjoying the view of the iconic monument instead reflected chaos and terror on Thursday afternoon. Police vehicles and ambulances sped across the bridge with their sirens wailing to each the empty square, which was sealed off by officers.

540,,,Plagiarism charges dog Harvard President Claudine Gay on heels of antisemitism outcry,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/claudine-gay-harvard-president-dogged-by-plagiaris/,"Harvard President Claudine Gay survived an antisemitism uproar only to be engulfed by a plagiarism scandal that threatens her brief term in the top job and the reputation of the nation’s oldest university.

Calls for Ms. Gay to resign are mounting as the plagiarism claims snowball. She now stands accused of 41 instances of failing to give proper credit in seven articles over 30 years, according to the latest tally by Manhattan Institute senior fellow Christopher F. Rufo, who aired the first public charges two weeks ago.

The seven published writings in question represent more than half of the 11 articles listed on her resume, a conspicuously thin record of scholarship for the president of what many consider the nation’s most prestigious university.

“This is a scandal of epic proportions for the world of higher education and for the Ivy League,” Peter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, told The Washington Times.

He said Ms. Gay reached “sort of the summit of Mount Everest, the highest position an American academic could attain — and she got there with a very meager publication record.

“And then that record itself turns out to be largely bogus,” he said.

The Harvard Corp. reacted to the growing furor late Wednesday by telling The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, that Ms. Gay would request three corrections to her 1997 Ph.D. thesis based on the findings of a subcommittee formed by the board to consider the allegations.

Notably, Harvard didn’t use the word “plagiarism.” It said the subcommittee found “duplicative language without appropriate attribution.”

Ms. Gay has submitted four corrections to two of her articles after an “independent review” found “a few instances of inadequate citation.” Harvard said the review, which concluded on Dec. 9, “found no violation of Harvard’s standards for research misconduct.”

If members of the Harvard brain trust think seven corrections will resolve the matter, they haven’t been paying attention to Carol M. Swain.

Ms. Swain, a conservative political scientist and legal scholar, became a central figure in the scandal after charges that Ms. Gay paraphrased nearly verbatim two passages of Ms. Swain’s 1993 book, “Black Faces, Black Interests” (Harvard University Press).

Ms. Swain, a distinguished senior fellow at the Institute for Faith and Culture, offered some “free unsolicited advice” for Harvard on Thursday. The list included “Fire Claudine Gay posthaste.”

“She is a documented serial plagiarist,” Ms. Swain said on “The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show.” “That cannot be denied, and Harvard University can’t decide unilaterally that they’re going to change the definition of plagiarism just to protect its first-ever Black president.”

I have some free unsolicited advice for Harvard University.



1. Stop listening to the apologists for plagiarism.

2. Fire Claudine Gay posthaste. She can be relieved of duties until the terms are negotiated.

3. Stop listening to the racist mob of whites and blacks who cry racism … pic.twitter.com/TggW9QzTkB — Dr. Carol M. Swain (@carolmswain) December 21, 2023

Others calling Thursday for Ms. Gay to step down include Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, a Harvard alumnus who said the resignations shouldn’t stop there.

“Of course Harvard’s president should resign in disgrace for tolerating antisemitism and her rampant plagiarism,” he said on X. “But so should every member of Harvard’s board who covered up for her and allowed this to happen.”

Ms. Gay, who assumed the Harvard presidency in July, defended her academic integrity in a Dec. 12 statement saying her scholarship “adheres to the highest academic standards.” She has not commented on the issue since.

The plagiarism issue jumped this week from the conservative press to the left-tilting legacy media, including The Boston Globe, which asked in a staff editorial, “Did Claudine Gay plagiarize or not? Harvard should be clear.”

The New York Times called the allegations against Ms. Gay an “embarrassing development” for Harvard. CNN said the latest corrections fail to address “even clearer examples of plagiarism from earlier in her academic history.”

A full-blown plagiarism uproar was the last thing Harvard needed in the wake of the furor over campus antisemitism after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israelis.

The outcry over the college administration’s initial tepid response culminated in a disastrous Dec. 5 House hearing at which Ms. Gay and other university presidents said that whether calling for “genocide of Jews” violates conduct codes would depend on the context.

Those comments resulted in the resignations of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and Penn board of trustees Chairman Scott Bok, but the Harvard Corp. refused to force out Ms. Gay and billed her as “the right leader to help our community heal.”

Meanwhile, the university’s prestige and pocketbook have suffered. Applications for early admissions fell this year by 17%, while archrival Yale University reported a 1.4% increase, according to figures released this week.

The donor revolt also shows no signs of abating. Billionaire Len Blavatnik, a Harvard Business School graduate whose family foundation has donated an estimated $270 million to Harvard, has paused his financial support, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

Harvard still boasts the nation’s largest university endowment at $51 billion.

Rep. Virginia Foxx, North Carolina Republican and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, expanded the investigation into antisemitism at Harvard to include the plagiarism charges. She expressed concerns that Ms. Gay may have gotten away with conduct for which students would have been suspended or expelled.

In Ms. Gay’s corner are large swaths of the Harvard faculty. More than 600 faculty members signed a petition after the House hearing urging the board to “resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard’s commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay.”

Steven Levitsky, a Harvard government professor, told The New York Times that the examples of alleged plagiarism appear to be “mild sloppiness.” He said quantitative scholars like Ms. Gay are less concerned with “their literature reviews.”

Taking issue with his view was Rep. Elise Stefanik, New York Republican and a Harvard graduate.

“On the world stage, @Harvard continues to shred any remaining semblance of academic integrity,” she said on X.

541,,,U.N.: More than 1 in 4 people in Gaza are starving because of war,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/un-more-than-1-in-4-people-in-gaza-are-starving-be/,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip — More than half a million people in Gaza - a quarter of the population - are starving, according to a report Thursday by the U.N. and other agencies that highlights the humanitarian crisis caused by Israel‘s bombardment and siege on the territory in response to Hamas‘ Oct. 7 attack.

The extent of the population’s hunger eclipsed even the near-famines in Afghanistan and Yemen of recent years, according to figures in the report. The report warned that the risk of famine is “increasing each day,” blaming the hunger on insufficient aid entering Gaza.

“It doesn’t get any worse,’’ said Arif Husain, chief economist for the U.N.’s World Food Program. “I have never seen something at the scale that is happening in Gaza. And at this speed.”

Israel says it is in the final stages of clearing out Hamas militants from northern Gaza, but that months of fighting lie ahead in the south.

The war sparked by Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 rampage and hostage-taking in Israel has killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians. Some 1.9 million Gaza residents - more than 80% of the population - have been driven from their homes, and many of them are crammed into U.N. shelters.

The war has also pushed Gaza’s health sector into collapse. Only nine of its 36 health facilities are still partially functioning, all located in the south, according to the World Health Organization. WHO relief workers on Thursday reported “unbearable” scenes in two hospitals they visited in northern Gaza: Bedridden patients with untreated wounds cry out for water, the few remaining doctors and nurses have no supplies, and bodies are lined up in the courtyard.

Bombardment and fighting continued Thursday, and internet and communications that had been knocked out for several days gradually began to return across the territory.

U.N. Security Council members are negotiating an Arab-sponsored resolution for a halt in fighting to allow for increased aid deliveries. A vote on the resolution has been postponed twice this week in the hopes of getting the U.S. to support it or allow it to pass after it vetoed an earlier cease-fire call.

Thursday’s report from the U.N. underscored the failure of weeks of U.S. efforts to ensure greater aid reaches Palestinians. At the start of the war, Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, medicine and fuel into the territory. After U.S. pressure, it allowed a trickle of aid in through Egypt. But U.N. agencies say only 10% of Gaza‘s food needs has been entering for weeks.

This week, Israel began allowing aid to enter Gaza through its Kerem Shalom crossing, which boosted the number of trucks entering from around 100 a day to around 190 on Wednesday, according to the U.N. But an Israeli strike Thursday morning hit the Palestinian side of the crossing, forcing the U.N. to stop its pickups of aid there, according to Juliette Touma, spokesperson of UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. At least four staff members at the crossing were killed, a nearby hospital reported. The Israeli military said it struck militants in the area.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Israel has been working to increase its inspection of aid trucks to 300 or 400 a day and blamed the U.N. for failures in delivery. The amount of aid could triple “if the U.N., instead of complaining all day, would do its job,” he said, without elaborating on what more the U.N. should be doing.

Egypt’s Rafah crossing has limited capacity for trucks to cross. U.N. officials say delivery of aid within much of Gaza has become difficult or impossible because of fighting, and more than 130 U.N. personnel have been killed.

The report released Thursday by 23 U.N. and nongovernmental agencies found that the entire population in Gaza is in food crisis, with 576,600 at catastrophic - or starvation - levels. “It is a situation where pretty much everybody in Gaza is hungry,” Husain, the World Food Program economist, said.

“People are very, very close to large outbreaks of disease because their immune systems have become so weak because they don’t have enough nourishment,” he said.

Hundreds of people lined up at a soup kitchen in the southern Gaza town of Rafah on Thursday, waving cups and pots, waiting for soup to be served from huge vats hanging over wood fires. Rafah, by the Egypt border, is one of the few places that receives regular aid deliveries.

Aya Barbakh, a displaced woman, said she comes every day for food. “Let us be in comfort like other people. We see people dying every day, and we want to die like them. We have been insulted and humiliated,” she said.

Mahmoud al-Qishawi, with the American charity Pious Projects that runs the kitchen, said there’s no fuel to cook with, so they have to search around the neighborhood for wood to burn. “There’s a huge number of families and we don’t have food that is enough for them.”

Israel has vowed to continue the offensive until it destroys Hamas’ military capabilities and returns scores of hostages captured by Palestinian militants during their Oct. 7 rampage. Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and captured around 240 others.

Hamas fired a barrage of rockets at central Israel Thursday, showing its military capabilities remain formidable. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.

The United States has continued to support Israel’s campaign while also urging greater efforts to protect civilians. The U.S. wants Israel to shift to more targeted operations aimed at Hamas leaders and the group’s tunnel network.

The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday the death toll since the start of the war had risen to more than 19,600. It does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.

On Wednesday, the WHO delivered supplies to Ahli and Shifa hospitals in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops have demolished vast swaths of the city while fighting Hamas militants.

Israeli forces have raided a series of health facilities in the north in recent weeks, detaining men for interrogation and expelling others. On Thursday, troops stormed the Palestinian Red Crescent’s ambulance center in the Jabaliya refugee camp, taking away paramedics and ambulance crews, the group said.

In some health facilities, patients who are unable to be moved remain, along with skeleton staff who can do little beyond first aid, according to U.N. and health officials

Ahli Hospital is “a place where people are waiting to die,” said Sean Casey, a member of the WHO team that visited the two hospitals Wednesday. Five remaining doctors and five nurses along with around 80 patients remain in Ahli, he said.

All of the hospital buildings are damaged except two buildings where patients are now being kept - the orthopedics ward and a church on the grounds, he said.

Inside the church, it was “an unbearable scene,” he said. Patients with traumatic wounds struggled with infections. Others had undergone amputations. “Patients were crying out in pain, but were also crying out for us to give them water,” he said.

Israel’s military says 137 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. Israel says it has killed some 7,000 militants, without providing evidence. It blames the high number civilian deaths in Gaza on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields when it fights in residential areas.

However, the federal government cannot guarantee safe passage out of the besieged Palestinian territory.

Immigration Minister Marc Miller expects the program to be up and running by Jan. 9. Until now, the government has focused on getting 660 Canadians, permanent residents and their spouses and children out of Gaza.

Miller said the government will start accepting applications for people with extended family connections to Canada, including parents, grandparents, siblings and grandchildren.

He said people will be offered three-year visas if they meet eligibility and admissibility criteria.

543,,,Polish state TV relaunches its main newscast as the new government shakes up the media,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/polish-state-tv-relaunches-main-newscast-as-new-go/,"WARSAW, Poland — Viewers in Poland watched a remolded main evening newscast on TVP state television Thursday, after the country’s new, pro-European Union government took control of state media to free it from the control and propaganda of the previous right-wing ruling team.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose Cabinet took office last week, has promised to free the outlet and other state-owned media of the former ruling conservatives’ propaganda and divisive policies.

The first broadcast under the new authorities began with experts and officials explaining why programs under the previous government violated standards of fairness and objectivity, and why the new government had to make changes quickly. Even the name of the program was changed, from “News” to “19.30,” the time when it is broadcast on the main channel, TVP1.

The program then carried a report on the 2024 budget debate in parliament, followed by other news from Poland and around the world, trying to include various viewpoints. At the end, the newscaster said the program aspired to the highest standards and would also consider critical voices.

Other programs on TVP1, such as popular sitcoms or quiz shows, remained unchanged.

Police and security forces erected barriers in front of TVP’s main building in the capital, Warsaw, after leaders of the Law and Justice party that was ousted from power following elections two months ago began a sit-in inside the building on Wednesday to protest the changes implemented by the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

Some remained inside on Thursday, when police only allowed authorized employees into the TVP building.

The government on Wednesday said it had fired and replaced the directors of the state television and radio outlets and the government-run news agency, PAP. They had been under control of the right-wing Law and Justice party during its eight years in power, and were used as the government mouthpiece, denigrating government critics and the opposition and spreading euroskeptic views.

Tusk‘s administration said it would seek to reestablish independent media in Poland in a legally binding and lasting way.

The change of TVP management was sudden and the new editorial team apparently had no time to prepare a full evening newscast on Wednesday. Instead, a newly appointed anchor came on the air to explain the situation, promising unbiased newscasts would start on Thursday.

President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the previous ruling team, has criticized the steps by Tusk’s government regarding state media, but Tusk replied they were needed to restore their objectivity and fairness, in the service of the entire public.",
544,,,"Israel’s military campaign in Gaza seen as among the most destructive in history, experts say",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/israeli-military-campaign-in-gaza-seen-as-among-mo/,"JERUSALEM — The Israeli military campaign in Gaza, experts say, now sits among the deadliest and most destructive in history.

In just over two months, the offensive has wreaked more destruction than the razing of Syria’s Aleppo between 2012 and 2016, Ukraine’s Mariupol or, proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II. It has killed more civilians than the U.S.-led coalition did in its three-year campaign against the Islamic State group.

The Israeli military has said little about what kinds of bombs and artillery it is using in Gaza. But from blast fragments found on-site and analyses of strike footage, experts are confident that the vast majority of bombs dropped on the besieged enclave are U.S.-made. They say the weapons include 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) “bunker-busters” that have killed hundreds in densely populated areas.

With the Palestinian death toll in Gaza approaching 20,000, the international community is calling for a cease-fire. Israel vows to press ahead, saying it wants to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities following the militant group’s Oct. 7 cross-border rampage that triggered the war, in which it killed 1,200 people and took 240 others hostage.

The Biden administration has quietly continued to supply arms to Israel. Last week, however, President Joe Biden publicly acknowledged that Israel was losing international legitimacy for what he called its “indiscriminate bombing.”

Here’s a look at what is known so far about Israel’s campaign on Gaza.

Israel’s offensive has destroyed over two-thirds of all structures in northern Gaza and a quarter of buildings in the southern area of Khan Younis, according to an analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data by Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University, experts in mapping damage during wartime.

The percentage of damaged buildings in the Khan Younis area nearly doubled in just the first two weeks of Israel‘s southern offensive, they said.

That includes tens of thousands of homes as well as schools, hospitals, mosques and stores. U.N. monitors have said that about 70% of school buildings across Gaza have been damaged. At least 56 damaged schools served as shelters for displaced civilians. Israeli strikes damaged 110 mosques and three churches, the monitors said.

Israel holds Hamas responsible for civilian deaths by embedding militants in civilian infrastructure. Those sites also shelter multitudes of Palestinians who have fled under Israeli evacuation orders.

“Gaza is now a different color from space. It’s a different texture,” said Scher, who has worked with Van Den Hoek to map destruction across several war zones, from Aleppo to Mariupol.

By some measures, destruction in Gaza has outpaced Allied bombings of Germany during World War II.

Between 1942 and 1945, the allies attacked 51 major German cities and towns, destroying about 40-50% of their urban areas, said Robert Pape, a U.S. military historian. Pape said this amounted to 10% of buildings across Germany, compared to over 33% across Gaza, a densely populated territory of just 140 square miles (360 square kilometers).

“Gaza is one of the most intense civilian punishment campaigns in history,” said Pape. “It now sits comfortably in the top quartile of the most devastating bombing campaigns ever.”

The U.S.-led coalition’s 2017 assault to expel the Islamic State group from the Iraqi city of Mosul was considered one of the most intense attacks on a city in generations. That nine-month battle killed around 10,000 civilians, a third of them from coalition bombardment, according an Associated Press investigation at the time.

During the 2014-2017 campaign to defeat IS in Iraq, the coalition carried out nearly 15,000 strikes across the country, according to Airwars, a London-based independent group that tracks recent conflicts. By comparison, the Israeli military said last week it has conducted 22,000 strikes in Gaza.

The Israeli military has not specified what it is using. It says every strike is cleared by legal advisers to make sure it complies with international law.

“We choose the right munition for each target - so it doesn’t cause unnecessary damage,” said the army’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.

Weapons experts have been able to draw conclusions by analyzing blast fragments found on-site, satellite images and videos circulated on social media. They say the findings offer only a peek into the full scope of the air war.

So far, fragments of American-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) bombs and smaller diameter bombs have been found in Gaza, according to Brian Castner, a weapons investigator with Amnesty International.

The JDAM bombs include precision-guided 1,000- and 2,000-pound (450-kilogram and 900-kilogram) “bunker-busters.”

“It turns earth to liquid,” said Marc Garlasco, a former Pentagon defense official and a war crimes investigator for the U.N. “It pancakes entire buildings.”

He said the explosion of a 2,000-pound bomb in the open means “instant death” for anyone within about 30 meters (100 feet). Lethal fragmentation can extend for up to 365 meters (1,200 feet).

In an Oct. 31 strike on the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, experts say a 2,000-pound bomb killed over 100 civilians.

Experts have also identified fragments of SPICE (Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective) 2000-pound bombs, which are fitted with a GPS guidance system to make targeting more precise. Castner said the bombs are produced by the Israeli defense giant Rafael, but a recent State Department release first obtained by The New York Times showed some of the technology had been produced in the United States.

The Israeli military is also dropping unguided “dumb” bombs. Several experts pointed to two photos posted to social media by the Israeli Air Force at the start of the war showing fighter jets stocked with unguided bombs.

Israel says it has two goals: Destroy Hamas and rescue the 129 hostages still held by militants.

Eleven weeks into the war, Israel says it has destroyed many Hamas sites and hundreds of tunnel shafts and has killed 7,000 Hamas fighters out of an estimated 30,000-40,000. Israeli leaders say intense military pressure is the only way to free more hostages.

But some families of hostages worry that the bombing endangers their loved ones. Hostages released during a weeklong cease-fire last month recounted that their captors moved them from place to place to avoid Israeli bombardment. Hamas has claimed that several hostages died from Israeli bombs, though the claims could not be verified.

The level of destruction is so high because “Hamas is very entrenched within the civilian population,” said Efraim Inbar, head of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, a think tank. He also said intense bombardment of Hamas‘ tunnels is needed to protect advancing Israeli ground forces from attacks.",
545,,,From fugitive to shackled prisoner: ‘Fat Leonard’ back in U.S. court and could face more charges,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/from-fugitive-to-shackled-prisoner-fat-leonard-bac/,"MIAMI — A defense contractor at the center of one of the biggest bribery scandals in U.S. military history is expected to face additional charges following his return to the United States from Venezuela as part of a broader prisoner swap between the two countries, a federal prosecutor said Thursday.

Leonard Glenn Francis, who is nicknamed “Fat Leonard,” faced a federal judge for the first time since snipping off his ankle monitor last year and disappearing weeks before a sentencing hearing on charges that he offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defense contractors and others.

He was later arrested in Venezuela and had been in custody there since, but was returned to the U.S. in a large swap that also saw the release of 10 American detainees by Venezuela in exchange for the Biden administration freeing Alex Saab, a Colombian-born businessman and close ally of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was facing money laundering charges in Miami.

Francis, shackled and in a beige jumpsuit, stood by quietly as a federal magistrate judge in Miami ordered him to be transferred to the Southern District of California, the region where his case was initially filed.

Prosecutors said additional charges would be presented against Francis for failing to appear at a hearing in his ongoing bribery case in San Diego.

“Not right now,” an otherwise expressionless but soft-spoken Francis said in response to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Becerra’s question about whether he could afford an attorney.

Francis was arrested in a San Diego hotel nearly a decade ago as part of a federal sting operation. Investigators say he bilked the U.S. military out of more than $35 million by buying off dozens of top-ranking Navy officers with booze, sex, lavish parties and other gifts.

The scandal led to the conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges. Investigators say Francis, who owned and operated his family’s ship-servicing business, abused his position as a key contact for U.S. Navy shops at ports across Asia, wooing naval officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines.

He pleaded guilty in 2015 and was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor and security guards.

But weeks before he faced sentencing in September 2022, Francis made a daring escape as he cut off his ankle monitor and disappeared. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela.

He was arrested a couple weeks later before boarding a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach Russia.

He had been in custody in Venezuela ever since, and officials said he sought asylum there.

546,,,Congo conducts a 2nd day of voting after delays and closed polls keep people from casting ballots,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/congo-holds-2nd-day-of-voting-after-delays-and-clo/,"KINSHASA, Congo — Congo was wrapping up its second day of voting Thursday after a chaotic rollout and lengthy delays forced officials to extend the balloting in the general election. The problems drew criticism from some opposition candidates as concerns mounted that the logistical hurdles could affect the credibility of the results.

At stake was the future of one of Africa’s largest nations and one whose mineral resources are increasingly crucial to the global economy. Congo has a history of disputed elections that can turn violent, and there’s little confidence among many Congolese in the country’s institutions.

President Felix Tshisekedi, who is seeking his second and final five-year term, has spent much of his time in office trying to gain legitimacy after a disputed 2018 election. Some 44 million people - almost half the population - were expected to vote in this year’s presidential contest and in legislative and provincial elections held simultaneously.

Tshisekedi was the likely winner of the presidential ballot, as the opposition was fractured.

Voting stations that didn’t open Wednesday allowed people to cast their ballots between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Thursday, according to a statement from the electoral commission. Voters are given 11 hours to vote from the time a voting station opens and many stations were expected to be open late into the night.

The initial results will start being announced on Friday, said Didi Manara, a high ranking official with the election commission in an interview with local radio Thursday.

The Electoral Observation Mission of the National Episcopal Conference of Congo and the Church of Christ in Congo said Thursday that more than 27% of voting stations didn’t open, there were 152 reports of violence, confrontations or brawls and reports of more than 74% of voter interruption. This was based on a sampling of 1,185 reports and it was unclear how many reports were sampled.

“There are many citizen who were not allowed to vote because they didn’t have their names on the lists … there were stations that opened at 2 p.m., some at 7 a.m., 3 p.m., this is discouraging, frustrating and it creates tensions. It also impacts the credibility of the voting process,” said the Rev. Eric Nsenga, a coordinator for the mission.

“It is clear that in this entire voting process we recorded things that stood out, incidents that we never noticed in former election processes,” he said.

Opposition leader Moise Katumbi said Thursday the election was marred by widespread fraud, violence against his supporters and the inability of several people to vote. However, he claimed the results “so far collected across the country and compiled by our monitoring centers” show he is “far in the lead.”

Local residents stayed outside some sites through the night to monitor the counts and were still there, struggling not to nod off, on Thursday morning.

“It is important for me to be a witness in order to protect the voting process. Sometimes they steal our votes; that’s why we were sent here to protect our voting process,” Moise Ibadu, one of the unofficial monitors, said.

Some people who were unable to vote because the machines broke down tried to return Thursday to cast ballots but found their stations closed.

“I am disappointed because I couldn’t vote, and I am not alone. There are many other people who couldn’t vote,” said a 45-year-old woman who did not want to be named.

But not everyone agreed the voting should have been prolonged.

“What happened yesterday was just sabotage of the electoral process,” said Bienvenu Matumo, a member of the rights group LUCHA. “The law makes no provision for extension, but this is a fait accompli on the part of (the election commission).”

On Wednesday, some people waited for 10 hours or more to vote. Associated Press reporters saw frustrated voters at one station in the capital, Kinshasa, aggressively try to push past police in riot gear. At least one station didn’t receive materials until an hour and a half before it was scheduled to close.

In conflict-riddled eastern Congo, displaced people said they couldn’t find their names on voter lists. In the city of Bunia, a voting center was vandalized in a dispute between the electoral commission and voters, and gunshots in the area prevented people from voting.

Fighting between more than 120 armed groups for land and power, and to protect their communities, has been ongoing for decades in the east but has worsened in recent years with the resurgence of the rebel group M23, which has seized territory and displaced millions of people.

Some displaced people who were unable to register due to the violence tried in vain to use older electoral cards Wednesday and were turned away, in some cases resulting in violence.

In the town of Bunia one person was killed Wednesday and 11 wounded when displaced people demonstrated against the police, said Gen. Johnny Luboya the governor of Ituri province.

The chaos came as no surprise to election observers and Congo experts, who have been warning for weeks that massive logistical challenges could hamper the vote’s rollout and threaten its credibility.

Election observers say they’re preparing for the post-electoral period, when the results could be contested. Nicolas Teindas, the director for the international observation mission for the Carter Center, warned that there were high levels of disputes in the past.

547,,,Wildcat strike that shut down English Channel rail services is over with gradual return of trains,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/wildcat-strike-that-shut-down-english-channel-rail/,"PARIS — A wildcat strike Thursday by staff at Eurotunnel, which links Britain and the European continent and paralyzed dozens of Eurostar trains, ended some six hours after it began, Eurotunnel announced. It promised a gradual return to service.

Eurostar passenger trains will start transporting passengers on Friday, and the rail shuttle known as LeShuttle, which carries vehicles and passengers, was to return to duty starting Thursday night, along with freight trains.

The unannounced strike triggered by what Eurotunnel staff said was an insufficient bonus caused outrage and disarray in train stations as travelers on both sides of the English Channel tried to join families and friends for the Christmas holidays.

Union representatives at Eurotunnel’s French site had rejected a 1,000-euro ($1,100) end-of-year bonus, and went on strike to press a demand to have it tripled, Eurotunnel said earlier. That “resulted in the complete interruption of service and the closure of our terminals in France and the UK,” the statement said.

It said that 30 Eurostar passenger trains had been canceled out of London, Paris or Brussels.

Eurostar and Eurotunnel are two separate companies.

French Transport Minister Clement Beaune had called the stoppage “unacceptable,” insisting on the need for a quick solution.

“I salute the spirit of responsibility of all concerned,” he said later on X, formerly Twitter, noting the end of the Channel Tunnel blockage.

“Eurotunnel (officials) and union representatives reached an accord,” a Eurotunnel statement said, saluting the agreement - but not specifying any specifics of the deal.

It said earlier that affected customers would be able to exchange their tickets free of charge or claim a refund.

Tim Kelsey, of Oxford, was among victims of the strike, stranded at Paris‘ Gare du Nord train station.

“We learned about the strike here, when we arrived here at the station. It’s an outrage, being stuck here this close to Christmas,” he said. “What are the strikers thinking about?” He bemoaned the lack of any offer of accommodations in Paris.

“No trains available today or tomorrow. How am I going to get home to my children?” Kelsey asked. “It’s going to be a lonely Christmas on the streets of Paris.”",
548,,,Polish viewers await state TV’s newscast for signs of new government’s changes in the media,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/polish-viewers-await-state-tvs-newscast-for-signs-/,"WARSAW, Poland — Viewers in Poland were waiting Thursday for the main evening newscast on state television TVP to see first signs of changes in the media planned under the country’s new, pro-European Union government.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose Cabinet took office last week, has promised to free the outlet of the former ruling conservatives’ propaganda and divisive policies.

Police and security forces erected barriers in front of TVP’s main building in the Polish capital, Warsaw, after leaders of the Law and Justice party that was ousted from power following elections two months ago began a sit-in inside the building on Wednesday to protest the changes.

Some remained inside on Thursday, when police only allowed authorized employees into the TVP building.

The government on Wednesday said it had fired and replaced the directors of the state television and radio outlets and the government-run news agency. They had been under control of the right-wing Law and Justice party during its eight years in power, and were used as the government mouthpiece, denigrating government critics and the opposition and spreading eurosceptic views.

Tusk’s administration said it seeks to reestablish independent media in Poland in a legally binding and lasting way.

The change of TVP management was sudden and the new editorial team apparently had no time to prepare a full evening newscast on Wednesday. Instead, a newly appointed anchor came on the air to explain the situation, promising unbiased newscasts would start on Thursday.

Independent media reports were saying that apart from the new content, the evening news format on the main TVP1 Channel would be different, as well as its name.

President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the previous ruling team, has criticized the steps by Tusk’s government regarding the media.",
549,,,France’s president is accused of siding with Depardieu as actor faces sexual misconduct allegations,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/french-president-macron-accused-of-siding-with-dep/,"PARIS — Women’s rights activists criticized French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday for appearing to take sides with actor Gérard Depardieu by saying the film star who is facing sexual misconduct allegations “makes France proud.”

Speaking on Wednesday night on TV channel France 5, Macron described himself as a “big admirer” of a “great actor.” Macron added: “He makes France proud.”

Macron’s comments in a televised interview come after a documentary that aired earlier this month said 16 women have accused Depardieu of harassing, groping or sexually assaulting them. The France-2 report also showed the actor making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.

They also come as a Spanish journalist and writer recently filed a complaint against Depardieu, who she says sexually abused her during an interview in Paris in 1995, Spanish police said Thursday.

Asked about such accusations against Depardieu, Macron said he believed in the presumption of innocence and the judicial process. “You will never see me participate in a manhunt,” the French leader said.

Macron also criticized his culture minister’s decision to launch a disciplinary procedure concerning Depardieu’s prestigious Order of the Legion of Honor, which could lead to the award getting rescinded. He said Culture Minister Rima Abdul-Malak went “a bit too far.”

The Legion of Honor is not “a moral tool” and should not be removed “based on a documentary,” Macron said.

Depardieu, 74, was put under investigation in December 2020 for alleged rape and sexual assault following allegations in 2018 from actor Charlotte Arnould, who said the crimes took place at Depardieu’s home. The investigation is ongoing.

Another alleged victim emerged in Spain, journalist and writer Ruth Baza who filed a complaint last week in the southern city of Torremolinos that the Spanish police said will now be shared with French authorities.

Baza, 51, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Thursday that when she was 23, she interviewed the actor in Paris for the magazine Cinemanía. She said that in her police complaint she explained how at the end of the interview the actor started kissing her face and neck, and touched her between her legs, behavior she said that police have classified as rape.

Baza said she felt “truly paralyzed” by Depardieu. “I was trapped.”

Baza said she had buried the matter in her mind but wrote it all down in detail in her diary at the time. She said the whole episode flooded back last April when she read about accusations made by 13 women against Depardieu.

She said that since then she has been in “a true nightmare” and decided she had to speak out.

“Taking the decision to go to the police has been the very last decision to try to go on with my life and leave this story in the hands of others and just try to help others who are in my very same situation and who are not able to talk,” Baza said.

She said that she has every intention of testifying to French authorities if needed.

Another complaint was filed in France in September by comedian Helene Darras for alleged sexual assault. Darras accused Depardieu of touching her bottom when she was a young extra for the 2008 film “Disco.”

Women rights activists on Thursday vigorously denounced Macron’s comments.

Michelle Dayan, president of Lawyers 4 Women, said that as a lawyer and a citizen, she also believed strongly in the presumption of innocence. “Yet it mustn’t be used as a pretext not to listen to women who say they are victims of abuses,” she said.

Speaking on France Info news broadcaster, Dayan said “violence against women starts there … in the image of women that is conveyed” through Depardieu’s shocking remarks.

Activist group Osez le feminisme denounced on X, formerly Twitter, “one more confirmation that, definitively, Emmanuel Macron doesn’t live in the same world as us.”

“We, the prey, are facing a man (Depardieu) who describes himself as a ‘great hunter,’ yet who, in the words of the president, becomes the victim of a ‘manhunt,’” the group posted.

Anne-Cécile Mailfert, president of the Women’s Foundation, said on BFM TV that Macron’s comments were “very serious” because “he is judging women who filed a complaint, women who spoke out. … He’s taking sides.”

Former French President Francois Hollande also chimed in to counter his successor. “No, we are not proud,” Hollande said on the France Inter radio network.

What was expected from the president was to “speak about women” who see in Depardieu’s remarks “violence, domination and contempt,” he said.

In October, Depardieu published an open letter in the French newspaper Le Figaro that said, “I want to tell you the truth. I have never, ever abused a woman.”

550,,,Two railroad crossings temporarily closed in Texas raise concerns about cross-border trade,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/two-railroad-crossings-temporarily-closed-in-texas/,"McALLEN, Texas — The federal government has closed railroad crossings in two Texas border towns, raising concerns about the potential impact on cross-border trade and American consumers.

Customs and Border Protection announced Sunday that it would temporarily stop railroad operations in Eagle Pass and El Paso starting Monday. It did not say how long rail operations would be paused.

The railroads and politicians have decried the move that closes two of the six available railroad systems between Mexico and the U.S.

“This train doesn’t just stop at Eagle Pass. This train doesn’t just impact Texas,” Rep. Tony Gonzalez, a Republican congressman who represents the affected region, said Tuesday during a news conference. “This train impacts all of America, goods that are going all over America.”

CBP reported as many as 10,000 people entering the country illegally every day through the southwest border this month. Closing the railroad would free up customs officers to assist overwhelmed U.S. Border Patrol agents who need to take migrants into custody.

Thousands of asylum-seekers who have crossed are sleeping outside along the border as they wait for federal agents to process them. Most are released with notices to appear in immigration courts, which are backlogged with more than 3 million cases.

Operations were changed for similar reasons when CBP closed a port of entry in Lukeville, Arizona, a pedestrian crosswalk in San Diego, and an international bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Union Pacific and BNSF are the two railroads directly affected by the rail closures in Texas. Between them, 24 trains typically use the railroads daily to move agricultural products, automotive parts, finished vehicles, chemicals, and other consumer goods, according to the Association of American Railroads.

Union Pacific estimated its losses - in goods, wages and transportation costs - will exceed $200 million a day if the crossings in both cities remain closed. The railroad giant said the two crossings make up 45% of its cross-border business and that it cannot shift trains to other gateways.

BNSF did not provide a dollar estimate of losses but said it anticipates an impact to employees and a significant “downstream effect across our system, since those trains then travel throughout our 32,500-mile network,” according to a statement shared with the Associated Press.

Nearly 10,000 Union Pacific rail cars are currently halted on both sides of the border. Some of those cars contain automotive parts and completed vehicles.

Automakers Ford, GM and Toyota told AP that they would not be immediately affected by the border shutdowns, but Stellantis, an automaker of 14 car brands including Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler, expressed concern.

“The suspension of rail operations at the international crossings between Texas and Mexico has the potential to significantly impact production at Stellantis’ North American facilities that will quickly ripple out to our U.S. supply base,” spokesperson Jodi Stinson said in a statement.

Union Pacific said it has more than 60 trains - carrying automotive cars, food and beverages, industrial commodities, and agriculture products such as grain - waiting at the border.

The National Grain and Feed Association and the North America Export Grain Association raised fears that stalled grain and oilseed shipments could have an impact for their customers in Mexico, which is among the groups’ most important export markets.

“NGFA and NAEGA have become aware this afternoon of critical tightness in feeding supplies for several livestock feeders in Mexico,” the organizations said in a statement. “We have also learned of grain trains in multiple states being held for shipment due to CBP’s embargo. The critical nature of this issue is growing by the hour, particularly for those livestock feeders that may run short of feed.”

NGFA President Michael Seyfert said livestock feeders in Mexico could start to run out of grain to feed their animals if the crossings don’t reopen within a week because they don’t keep a big supply on hand.

“You can maybe stretch rations for a bit, but you can only do that so long,” he said. “And then it’s not like you shut the factory down for two days. You start making some some real difficult decisions related to animals from a humaneness standpoint.”

Trucks are a potential alternative to trains, although moving goods at such volume via road would be logistically problematic. It would take roughly 550 trucks to deliver the grain that one 110-car train hauls.

Union Pacific said it moves about 450,000 rail shipments through Eagle Pass and El Paso each year and estimates it would take one million trucks to move the same volume, or 2,800 trucks daily.

Migrants often board the trains as they travel through Mexico, but this does not guarantee entry to the U.S.

Union Pacific and BNSF use police, partnerships with federal agencies and technology to deter and detect contraband and people entering the country illegally. Union Pacific has a system that uses gamma-ray imaging to spot unwanted passengers.

Union Pacific said it has found only five migrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally on its trains in the last five weeks.

“Through our efforts, we have experienced very few people attempting to cross the border on trains at both ports of entry,” BNSF said via a statement.",
551,,,Archbishop in Kazakhstan is first cleric to rebuke Pope Francis on same-sex blessings,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/tomasz-bernard-peta-archbishop-in-kazakhstan-is-fi/,"An archbishop in Kazakhstan has become the first cleric to forbid priests from blessing same-sex couples and others in “irregular situations,” according to media reports.

Archbishop Tomasz Bernard Peta of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of St. Mary in Astana, Kazakhstan, and Auxiliary Bishop Athanasius Schneider rejected the new church policy declared by Pope Francis this week and asked the pontiff to rescind it.

Quoting Galatians 2:14, the clerics said Francis “does not walk uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel” in issuing the declaration, titled “Fiducia supplicans.”

Francis on Monday approved the declaration by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith to allow clergy to offer blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not performed in the context of a civil union or in any way resemble a liturgical wedding ceremony.

Archbishop Peta and Bishop Schneider said priests and laypeople in the archdiocese are prohibited “from accepting or performing any form of blessing whatsoever of couples in an irregular situation and same-sex couples.”

“It goes without saying that every sincerely repentant sinner with the firm intention to no longer sin and to put an end to his public sinful situation (such as, e.g., cohabitation outside of a canonically valid marriage, union between people of the same sex) can receive a blessing,” they added.

Their statement was first reported and translated by The Catholic Herald, an independent magazine in London.

According to the Association of Religion Data Archives World Religion database, 20% of Kazakhstan’s population in 2020 was listed as Christian, with 0.69% being Catholic.

The blackout began after midnight Thursday and was restored to service a few hours later.

Downdetector, a site that tracks the online status of various websites, noted that over 7,000 users in the U.K. and Canada reported X as inaccessible. French users also were unable to access the social media platform.

X leadership has yet to confirm the reason for the outage.

Users who tried to access their X accounts during the outage were met with a cheerful “Welcome to X!” message.

Some users migrated to X rival Threads to discuss the blackout.

Thursday’s brief but large outage is the latest case of technical issues at X following Elon Musk’s takeover of the company last year.

Before he took over, X experienced around nine outages a year. In February alone, X had four blackouts, with several others before and after in 2023.

553,,,Meet the Russian professor who became mayor of a Colombian city,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/meet-mikhail-krasnov-russian-professor-who-became-/,"TUNJA, Colombia — Mikhail Krasnov walks along the steep streets of the Colombian city of Tunja just like any other resident - except he’s no longer just another neighbor.

Now people greet the newly elected mayor as he makes his way around town and stop him for pictures. One woman hugs the man known here as the “Russian professor” and poses for a selfie.

Krasnov, a 45-year-old university professor from Russia, was one of the unexpected winners in Colombia’s regional elections in October. He prevailed by promising to stamp out corruption and embrace more meritocracy in the city government, where jobs often go to those with political connections.

He’s also trying to reduce the city’s debt.

“We are not here to promote my face,” said Krasnov, who has been interviewed by dozens of national media outlets and also a Russian network, since he won the election. “We want to send the message that Tunja exists, that we are competitive and want to attract investors.”

The blond and green-eyed professor stands out in Tunja, a city of 170,000 people in Colombia’s Andean highlands, where many residents are of Indigenous descent.

He is believed to be the only Russian living in the city, where he has been teaching economics and human rights courses at the local public university for the past decade.

Krasnov was born in Saratov, a city in southern Russia, in 1978. He arrived in Tunja in 2008 on a student exchange program, fell in love with the city’s food and culture, learnt Spanish and became a Colombian citizen two years ago.

“My mother has Ukrainian roots, my father is Russian and I am Colombian” he says proudly, adding that he opposes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where he has friends and family.

The professor says he decided to get involved in politics last year, due to his growing frustration with the city’s lack of progress in areas like job creation and poverty reduction.

“You reach an age where you start to ask yourself what you can contribute” to society, he said of his decision to enter the turbulent world of Colombian politics.

At first Krasnov tried to run as an independent, which meant he had to collect 30,000 signatures to get himself on the ballot.

After collecting the signatures however, Krasnov discovered there was another requirement for registering as a candidate – a $10,000 fee.

That was too much for Krasnov’s modest budget, but his growing fame and commitment to campaigning got him noticed by some political parties, who have the right to register candidates.

Eventually Krasnov was put on the ballot by The Force for Peace, a party founded last year by the former president of Colombia’s congress.

Krasnov describes himself as a centrist, and jokes about the campaign, in which he ran against several candidates that were better funded and represented traditional parties that have run the city for years.

In the nine-candidate race Krasnov also defeated a politician from President Gustavo Petro’s leftist party, the Historical Pact.

“I’m a public university professor, who was born in the Soviet Union, so you’d think I’d be on the left” he said. “But the leftists were the first ones to attack me, even when I was collecting signatures, because I also appealed to their voters.”

Krasnov won the election with 31% of the overall vote.

“It was a big surprise,” said Alejandra Monroy Martínez, a political scientist based in Tunja, who remembers seeing Krasnov handing out flyers and talking to people on the city’s streets. She said his victory reflects a growing dissatisfaction with the city’s political class.

Alba Rodríguez Parra, 56, said she trusts “the Russian” because he was a professor at the city’s public university, speaks six languages and has several degrees.

She’s hoping that the new mayor can reduce growing crime rates and help to expand the streets that lead into the city center and are sometimes jammed with cars.

“Previous mayors have let us down, because they pocketed all the money” she said.

554,,,Virginia's railways are getting an upgrade,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-21/virginia-passenger-rail-authority-amtrak-trains-dc-richmond-raleigh,"Earlier this month, two federal grants totaling well over $1 billion were awarded to help move along major rail infrastructure improvements. One day, that means passenger rail will more quickly propel riders from Richmond to Washington, D.C., or Raleigh, North Carolina.

Getting to Raleigh quicker would make Da’Quan Love ditch his car. Love is the owner of the political fundraising group Reflex Strategy Group, and he also serves as the executive director of the NAACP in North Carolina. He commutes south about two times a week — a trip that can take up to three hours, one way. Math: That’s about 12 hours total driving each week just to and from work.

“I’d absolutely love to take the train, because I can get some work done,"" Love said while leaving Raleigh. “I just hope that they would also improve the internet service.”

The influx of federal grants to fix rail infrastructure with the end goal of getting drivers out of their cars has been going on for years according to D.J. Stadtler, executive director of the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority.

“As we've seen over the last week, and really over the last couple of years, the feds are really excited about growing infrastructure. They see the congestion, too,” Stadtler said. “Rush-hour traffic and congestion is bipartisan. So whether you're Republican, a Democrat, Independent — if you are in traffic, you don't like it.”

Stadtler said over the last few years, Amtrak ridership in Virginia has increased. According to a press release, the rail line saw its highest ridership increase ever, with a 20.1% jump over last year.

“We have set a record for each month of ridership for the last 15 or 16 months,” he added. “We have the momentum going where ridership is setting records, blowing away even the pre-COVID numbers. We feel like we will be continually well-positioned to compete for infrastructure money to help get folks off the road, help the environment and give people a better quality of transportation.”

But not everyone will be able to ride the train even once all the infrastructure upgrades are finished.

Matt Simmons, president of the company that runs Capital Ale House and Fest Biergarten, travels up to Fairfax at least twice a week for work.

“I don't think the stops for the train are close enough to my restaurants,” Simmons said. “And there's a lot of times I have to make stops on the way. So, I don't think that would work for me.”

Simmons did say that he’d definitely take the train when he goes to D.C. for events or fun, especially since parking at most hotels costs the same as a train ticket.

The timeline for completion — at least for trains running back and forth from Richmond to D.C on an hourly basis — is about six years away.

“2030 is the magic number for north of Richmond,” Stadtler said. “2030 is when all of the Phase 2 projects will be done between Richmond and D.C.”

But riders looking for the express line from Richmond to Raleigh will have to wait a while longer.

The recent announcement by North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis of a $1 billion grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation — for a new passenger rail route between Raleigh and Richmond — was only for North Carolina, said Stadtler.

The route, once completed, will be along a former CSX freight line and be called the S-Line.

“CSX used to have the S-Line that took traffic straight down through Virginia to North Carolina,” said Stadtler. “They have pulled a lot of that up, because they didn't use it.”

VPRA purchased the S-Line with the goal of rebuilding it. Once operational, it’ll cut about 1 hour, 15 minutes off the roughly 4-hour route.

Stadtler said VPRA is only in the design stages of what the line will eventually look like. He doesn’t expect the S-Line to be operational until years after 2030.

“I'm very reluctant to say how many ‘a few’ is,” Stadtler said. “Once we get that design work done by the end of 2024, we will have a good sense for the design requirements. We will know whether it's a $6 billion investment or a $10 billion investment. We just have no idea.”

Eventually, VPRA envisions rail service running all across the commonwealth — including from Washington down past Roanoke, and Washington to Raleigh, and from Norfolk and Newport News out past Staunton.",
555,,,How to keep Richmond-area pets safe over the holidays,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-21/how-to-help-pet-dog-cat-animal-urgent-emergency-care-greater-richmond,"The holidays can be challenging for humans, but animals also get stressed out during this time of year. Friends or relatives might slip them extra treats from the table, they might find wrapping paper and Christmas decorations to be a tasty treat — or they might be staying away from home while their families travel.

What happens when pets need urgent and emergency care during this period? Tabitha Treloar, director of communications at the Richmond SPCA, has some advice to help pet owners breathe a sigh of relief this holiday season. The Richmond SPCA has a veterinary hospital that helps serve low-income residents. Urgent and emergency care may otherwise be out of reach financially, so the organization likes to emphasize prevention over everything else, especially now.



Food for thought

“Some of the biggest risks are foreign body ingestion and pancreatitis in dogs,” Treloar said. She added that it’s easy to prevent things that are “known risks,” such as feeding table scraps from a holiday meal to pets that could upset their digestive systems or giving extra treats.

If pet owners want to indulge their animals over the holidays, Treloar suggests preparing a fun treat — like putting kibble or veterinarian-approved treats in a Kong or other puzzle toy and freezing them in advance.

“Then you can give them that treat in another room away from where everybody is dining, so that they can enjoy that favorite,” Treloar said, “It also keeps them from pestering grandma for that little piece of gravy …that really is too rich for their stomachs to handle.

She also added that when gifts start getting unwrapped, animals might mistake wrapping paper, ribbons or holiday decorations for tasty treats: “Those are all kinds of foreign body things we worry about.” While unwrapping gifts, it wouldn’t hurt to keep a close eye on pets, just to ensure they’re not ingesting any small bits that may fall off the packaging.

If pet owners find themselves in need of emergency or urgent care and can’t afford to take pets to a veterinarian’s office, there are options.



In need of urgent care?

UrgentVet emergency centers have opened throughout the Richmond region, including in Short Pump, Carytown and Midlothian.

“These are kind of in between your normal primary care vet, like at a hospital, and the full-on emergency center,” Treloar said. She recommends calling pet urgent care centers in advance to find out if they have weight limits for animals, and to see what potential costs are.

If an emergency situation that requires immediate care arises, Treloar suggests calling emergency centers to find out what the wait times are, and to make sure they’re open and accepting patients —because holiday hours can change things.

The same goes for pet owners who have an exotic or unusual pet.

“Hopefully those who do have that type of pet will already have an [established] relationship with a vet,” Treloar said.

If pets get sick, she also recommends not using any home remedies found on the internet and to instead stick to vet-recommended solutions. “Our vets often tell us really rough stories that come from people trying to do things on their own at home that can cause more problems than the initial issue,” she said.



Boarding away from home

If pet owners are traveling over the holidays and unable to take their pets with them, they might choose to board their pets. There’s been a lot of news coverage recently about a respiratory illness affecting dogs. Making sure your pets are up-to-date on their vaccinations is key for situations like this, especially if an outbreak of kennel cough or parainfluenza breaks out at a facility.

“What is being seen is that people’s habits and vaccinations sometimes flipped during the pandemic, as did access to vaccinations here,” Treloar said.

Treloar also said that between lower vaccination rates and a surge in typical respiratory illnesses in animals around this time of year, things are being seen “a little bit differently among the populations.”

If pets aren’t traveling with their families for the holidays, they might end up at dog parks, or crowded places like daycare facilities, where the vaccination status of other animals could be unknown. By making sure pets are up-to-date on their shots or keeping them at a distance from other animals, pets are better prepped to healthy in case of a bug going around.",
556,,,"Gaza health officials say Israel's offensive has now killed more than 20,000 people",https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-22/gaza-health-officials-say-israels-offensive-has-now-killed-more-than-20-000-people,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel's devastating air-and-ground assault on Gaza has now killed more than 20,000 people in the 10 weeks since the conflict began, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health — a figure that is fast approaching 1% of the Palestinian territory's pre-war population.

The ministry, in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, said Friday that at least 20,057 people have died from the Israeli attacks since Oct. 7. It has said 70% of those killed are women and children.

Although the health ministry doesn't differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, it says the majority of those killed have been women and children. Another 50,000 people in Gaza have been wounded, the Hamas-controlled ministry says. International aid groups generally agree with its tallies.

A death toll of 20,000 in the enclave, where the population is estimated at roughly 2.1 million, means around 1 out of every 105 people has been killed since the war began.

As the death toll continues to rise, Israel faces growing international pressure to end the bombing of Gaza. Even the Biden administration, which has firmly backed Israel's stated goal of crushing Hamas, has repeatedly admonished Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to minimize civilian casualties.

Lives shattered

Among those whose lives have been shattered by Israel's bombardment is Yousef Es-Sakani. He sits on the edge of a planter under a tree in the center of Ramallah, a bustling, traffic-choked city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and tries to make sense of Israeli airstrikes earlier this month in Gaza that suddenly added most of his family to the war's staggering death toll.

In the early morning hours of Dec. 9, he says, his wife, four daughters and two of his sons were killed by Israeli airstrikes that flattened their four-story Gaza City apartment building. A third son only survived because he stayed with an aunt the night of the attack.

""One of the ones killed is my daughter, she had one semester left to graduate to become a doctor,"" he says.

/ Ayman Oghanna for NPR / Ayman Oghanna for NPR Yousef Es-Sakani is trying to make sense of the airstrike in Gaza City earlier this month that killed his wife, four daughters and two of his sons.

Of his two sons killed, the body of one remains buried under the rubble, says Es-Sakani, who wears a black baseball cap, a salt-and-pepper beard and an expression of weary stoicism.

Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 attack, when Hamas staged a lightning strike on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, Israel says. The Islamist militant group also seized around 240 hostages, but freed more than a hundred of them during a week-long cease-fire at the end of November. At least 110 others remain in captivity, Israeli officials say.

At last count, Israel's military says it has killed 7,000 Hamas fighters. It remains unclear, however, whether that figure includes an estimated 1,000 militants Israel says were killed inside its border during the Oct. 7 attack.

People who have followed past wars in Gaza say the Gaza Ministry of Health's numbers are reliable. The ministry has traditionally used a digitized system to gather the names, ages and gender of the dead from hospitals and morgues.

Even so, it has become increasingly difficult to keep an accurate count amid frequent communications blackouts in Gaza and attacks on hospitals, which Israeli says are harboring Hamas fighters and command posts. With much of Gaza now reduced to rubble, thousands, like Es-Sakani's son, lie uncounted under tons of concrete and twisted rebar.

""Any numbers you hear are unfortunately an undercount because we don't know how many bodies are underneath the rubble,"" says Sari Bashi, who works in Ramallah and serves as the program director for Human Rights Watch in charge of global research. ""And the [Gaza] civil Defense Force does not have equipment and many areas are unreachable.""

Pressure on Israel to switch tactics

The U.S. wants Israel to shift to lower intensity combat, sending in special forces teams to root out Hamas rather than targeting the Islamist militant group with airplanes and tanks. Many Israelis have also pushed their government toward another cease-fire to secure the release of the remaining hostages.

But a retired Israeli brigadier general, Shlomo Brom, said it is difficult for troops to avoid civilian casualties when Hamas is embedded in mosques, schools and hospitals, as the Israelis claim.

Anas Baba / NPR / NPR The civilian death toll in Gaza has led to growing calls for Israel to shift tactics in its assault on the Palestinian territory. Above, people survey the damage from an airstrike in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah.

Brom also says Hamas believes the growing death toll in Gaza is undermining support for Israel's war effort.

""Not only they don't care about their populations, they're seeing the casualties contribute to their cause,"" he said. ""Because that's OK if they can mobilize the media [and] public opinion.""

Meanwhile, for weeks, international aid groups have been warning of a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with food, water and fuel and critical levels. The U.N. World Food Program, warned Monday that ""Gazans are becoming more desperate by the day, with nowhere to go and nothing to eat.""

557,,,Tacoma police officers are acquitted in the killing of unarmed Black man Manuel Ellis,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-21/tacoma-police-officers-are-acquitted-in-the-killing-of-unarmed-black-man-manuel-ellis,"AILSA CHANG, HOST:

A jury acquitted three police officers of all charges today in the death of Manuel Ellis, an unarmed Black man who was killed in Tacoma, Wash., in 2020. Though he died months before George Floyd, Ellis' case gained new attention in the wake of Floyd's murder. The trial was the first test of a state law making it easier to charge officers for using deadly force. Jared Brown of KNKX reports.

JARED BROWN, BYLINE: Officers Matthew Collins and Christopher “Shane” Burbank were found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Officer Timothy Rankine was acquitted of manslaughter. Ellis had been walking home from a convenience store late at night in March of 2020, when Officers Collins and Burbank called him over to their patrol car.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PATTY EAKES: There seemed to be some sort of conversation, perhaps, a brief interaction.

BROWN: Special prosecutor Patty Eakes with the state attorney general's office argued in court that Burbank then knocked Ellis to the ground without cause. Video recorded by passing motorist show he and Collins then punched Ellis, put him in a neck hold and tasered him. Witnesses say he didn't fight back. Officer Timothy Rankine later kneeled on Ellis' back while his hands and feet were bound.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

EAKES: He's not threatening the officers. He's not incoherent. The words he uses are all words that anyone can understand. Please, I can't breathe. I still can't breathe. Sir, please, I can't breathe.

BROWN: Attorneys for the officers said that Ellis attacked them and resisted arrest with extreme strength, a symptom, they said, of what some call excited delirium. That's a medical syndrome that some police trainers say can cause a person to be difficult to control and can lead to death, but which has been widely rejected by medical associations. Defense attorney Wayne Fricke argued Ellis died of a methamphetamine overdose exacerbated by a heart condition unknown to the officers.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WAYNE FRICKE: All they know is they were being attacked by a guy out in the streets in a dangerous part of town, and they're acting accordingly.

BROWN: The county medical examiner ruled Ellis' death a homicide due to a lack of oxygen from police restraint with methamphetamine and heart disease listed as contributing factors. It took a year after Ellis' death for the officers to be charged. Police accountability advocates in Washington say the racial justice protests of 2020 were instrumental in getting state officials to reexamine the case and bring charges. And according to legal experts in Washington, it was nearly impossible to charge police officers before 2019, when state law required prosecutors to prove officers acted with malice or evil intent. Craig Sims is a former Washington prosecutor. He said the Tacoma officers' acquittal shouldn't impact future charging decisions.

CRAIG SIMS: The field has been somewhat leveled in terms of the path to pursuing accountability for police officers who may have crossed the line.

BROWN: After the verdict, Washington's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, issued a short statement thanking the jury for their service and saying his heart went out to the Ellis family. In a statement inside the courthouse, the officers' attorneys said the acquittal proved that their clients had been falsely charged. For NPR News, I'm Jared Brown in Tacoma.

558,,,UN Security Council debates how to get aid into Gaza as conditions become more dire,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-21/un-security-council-debates-how-to-get-aid-into-gaza-as-conditions-become-more-dire,"AILSA CHANG, HOST:

The question of how to get more aid into Gaza has deadlocked the United Nations Security Council. For three days, proposals have been debated there, and they continue tonight. Now, the nuances are complex. But in general, the U.S. has a veto power and could use it to stop proposals that it and Israel see as allowing Hamas to resupply or rearm. But millions of people in Gaza are in increasingly dire conditions. NPR's Michele Kelemen is covering all of this and joins us now. Hi, Michele.

MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.

CHANG: So what are these proposals that are prompting objections from the U.S. right now?

KELEMEN: Well, the original draft resolution called for a U.N. monitoring mechanism to check trucks going into Gaza. The U.S. and Israel opposed that because right now Israel is doing those inspections. They say they want to make sure that weapons aren't being smuggled in for Hamas. And U.S. officials have made clear that they feel like they have an OK system in place. Here's how National Security Council spokesman John Kirby put it today.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN KIRBY: It's important to us, of course, that the humanitarian situation in Gaza gets addressed. We are working harder than any other nation to actually address those concerns.

KELEMEN: So the U.S. pushed back on that proposal, which is - seems to be dropped in the latest version. The new draft resolution just calls for a U.N. aid coordinator. It also just calls for urgent steps to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access rather than calling for a cessation of hostilities now.

CHANG: OK. Well, I know that the U.S. has vetoed previous resolutions. Do you think that will happen again?

KELEMEN: The talks all week have focused on ways to get the U.S. to yes or at least to an abstention. And as I look over the latest draft, that does seem possible. You know, the Security Council did pass one resolution last month. It focused also on the plight of civilians in Gaza, particularly children. It called for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and aid corridors - that was language that the U.S. could accept at that time. It has vetoed resolutions calling for a cease-fire in this conflict, arguing that Israel has the right to go after Hamas, which carried out that attack on Israel October 7. But, you know, as the humanitarian crisis grows, every time the U.S. vetoes something at the U.N., Washington faces a backlash all around the world. And, Ailsa, there's growing criticism of the Biden administration at home too.

CHANG: Exactly. I mean, conditions are getting worse in Gaza. And now the U.N. is warning of mass hunger there, right? What are they saying about that?

KELEMEN: Well, the U.N. spokesman today painted a very grim picture. Stephane Dujarric talked about how few hospitals are operating in Gaza, how the Israeli military operations have uprooted tens of thousands of Palestinians who really have nowhere safe to go. And here's what he said about the food situation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEPHANE DUJARRIC: According to a food security analysis issued today, more than half a million people are facing catastrophic hunger conditions in Gaza. The World Food Programme warns that these levels of acute food insecurity are unprecedented in recent history and that Gaza risks famine.

KELEMEN: He said, you know, 1 in 4 Gazans have run out of food and are in brink of starvation. So, you know, there's a lot of pressure at the U.N. to do something. What the U.N. wants is a humanitarian cease-fire and more aid routes. The resolution that's being debated calls for unhindered humanitarian access and more aid routes and also more fuel to meet the dramatic needs. But it's definitely been watered down from the original proposals in order to get the U.S. on board.

CHANG: That is NPR's Michele Kelemen. Thank you so much, Michele.

KELEMEN: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",
559,,,Review: Andrew Haigh's 'All of Us Strangers' is a haunting meditation on connection,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-21/review-andrew-haighs-all-of-us-strangers-is-a-haunting-meditation-on-connection,"ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Two TV heartthrobs, Andrew Scott, the hot priest from ""Fleabag,"" and Paul Mescal, who plays the conflicted romantic Connell in ""Normal People,"" star in a new movie called ""All Of Us Strangers."" Critic Bob Mondello says the word that best describes the film for several reasons is haunting.

BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE: Adam is a screenwriter who lives in a massive, mostly vacant apartment building in London. He's working on a script about his parents, who died when he was 11 - if, by working, you mean watching TV and occasionally going outside when the fire alarm sounds.

(SOUNDBITE OF FIRE ALARM SOUNDING)

MONDELLO: One night when he does and looks up, there's only one other lit apartment in the whole building with a guy who stayed put. After the all-clear, there's a knock at Adam's door.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

PAUL MESCAL: (As Harry) Hello. I saw you looking at me from the street. I'm Harry. You drink?

MONDELLO: He motions to the bottle in his hand.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

MESCAL: (As Harry) It's meant to be the best in the world, but I couldn't tell you why, so...

ANDREW SCOTT: (As Adam) No, thanks.

MESCAL: (As Harry) Yeah, OK. OK, how about I come in anyway? - if not for a drink, then for whatever else you might want.

MONDELLO: Adam declines, but the ache of loneliness lingers. The next day, to research his script, he takes a train out to the suburb where he grew up and finds his old house and, as night falls, has an encounter with another man - only, this time, Adam's the one who's hoping to be invited in.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

JAMIE BELL: (As Dad) She's going to be over the moon to see you.

MONDELLO: And he is.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

BELL: (As Dad) Guess who I found loitering in the park?

CLAIRE FOY: (As Mum) Is it him?

BELL: (As Dad) Oh, yeah. It's definitely him. Look in his eyes.

FOY: (As Mum) Yes, it is you.

MONDELLO: It's his parents, who've not aged a day.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

SCOTT: (As Adam) Hi.

FOY: (As Mum) Hi. Don't just stand there. Get yourself inside.

MONDELLO: A ghost story of sorts about connection where it's least expected and after hope is all but gone - speaking of which, Adam returns to his apartment and meets up with Harry again, this time letting things go where they will...

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

MESCAL: (As Harry) I'm assuming you're not with anyone - never see you with anyone.

MONDELLO: ...Physical intimacy leading to personal intimacy.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

MESCAL: (As Harry) Is this your mum and dad?

SCOTT: (As Adam) Yeah. They died just before I was 12. I'm trying to write about them at the moment.

MESCAL: (As Harry) How's it going?

SCOTT: (As Adam) Strangely.

MONDELLO: You might say that. Filmmaker Andrew Haigh has adapted a Japanese novel called ""Strangers"" in ways that let him explore family and distance in a personal way. How personal? The house Andrew visits when he sees his parents in the movie is the house the filmmaker grew up in.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

BELL: (As Dad) And I would hear you crying in your room after school. Did the boys bully you then?

MONDELLO: Haigh is telling a generous tale of injuries done glancingly and without intent - of parents being offered a second chance in their children's memory...

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

BELL: (As Dad, crying) Sorry I never came in your room when you were crying.

SCOTT: (As Adam) Dad. Dad, I get it. It was so long - (crying) it was so long ago.

MONDELLO: ...And of comfort offered by those damaged children to each other in the present.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

MESCAL: (As Harry) I'm really sorry.

SCOTT: (As Adam) It was a long time ago.

MESCAL: (As Harry) I don't think that matters.

MONDELLO: Andrew Scott's tightly wound Adam, Paul Mescal's chill, but also wounded Harry, haunted by memories and self-doubt - two strangers finding comfort in each other as they struggle to reconcile the men they've become with the expectations they're still trying to set aside - the disconnect that makes all of us strangers to our pasts and that makes Andrew Haigh's ""All Of Us Strangers"" such a haunting meditation on how we can connect.

560,,,'Taking Cover' update: A senator and soldier try to get to the truth,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-21/taking-cover-update-a-senator-and-soldier-try-to-get-to-the-truth,"AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Earlier this year, NPR's podcast Taking Cover told the story of a friendly fire in Iraq back in 2004. Two Marines and an Iraqi interpreter were killed in the tragedy, which also wounded more than a dozen others. Our reporters learned that the son of a prominent politician was involved in the mistake, and the whole thing had been covered up. Now a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee is asking the Marine Corps for answers. NPR's Tom Bowman and Graham Smith bring us the latest.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: April 12, 2004. U.S. Marines accidentally launched an 81-millimeter mortar on one of their own positions during fighting in Fallujah - among those killed, Lance Corporals Brad Shuder and Rob Zurheide. Zurheide's wife, Elena, was expecting their first child.

ELENA ZURHEIDE: April 12 was my due date. I was due on April 12, and my husband died on April 12.

GRAHAM SMITH, BYLINE: The Marines didn't tell Elena the truth about how Rob died. They said it was enemy fire. She heard rumors it was an accident, but she wasn't officially informed it was friendly fire till more than three years later. And even then, a lot was held back. She wants to know why.

ZURHEIDE: Because that's what I view all of this as - a big, fat lie.

BOWMAN: When NPR reached out to the Marine Corps leadership after the podcast ran, telling them about our investigation, about Elena and several wounded veterans who'd never been told the truth, the Marines said there'd be no response. But there's someone else now looking for answers about what went wrong that day and why it was so poorly handled afterwards - Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat who serves on the Armed Services Committee.

MARK KELLY: Robert Zurheide's widow, Elena, is one of my constituents. His son Robert, who wasn't even born when he was killed, is there in Tucson with his mom.

BOWMAN: Going to Kelly's office, you walk past the orange spacesuit he wore as an astronaut and a photo of the fighter jet he flew in the Navy. He was a combat pilot like John McCain, the Republican war hero whose desk Kelly now sits behind.

KELLY: They deserve answers. It's important that they get them - not only them but the folks who were wounded. You know, why were they not informed? You know, why did it take this long? It shouldn't. They should be informed immediately. The Marine Corps has regulations, and they need to follow up.

SMITH: When we went to the Marines for answers, at first they said they couldn't find any documentation of the friendly fire. Then they gave us conflicting stories about what had happened. And then they failed to even follow regulations and reach out to the wounded vets. But Kelly's a senator. They won't ignore him. The senator told us he recently met with the No. 2 Marine officer, General Christopher Mahoney, and he raised the issue of this mishandled incident.

Had he any idea what you were talking about, or...

BOWMAN: What did he say?

KELLY: Yeah, he was familiar with it. And he told us he's going to get us some answers, and I trust that he's going to do that.

BOWMAN: One of the wounded troops Kelly wants answers for is John Smith. Smith was a Marine corporal. He lost a leg and the use of one eye that day.

SMITH: Hey, John.

BOWMAN: We visited him recently in Maryland. He ambles out of his house slowly, walking with a stiff gait.

JOHN SMITH: Y'all ready?

SMITH: Great to see you.

SMITH: Likewise.

SMITH: How you been?

SMITH: I can't complain - enjoying myself for the holidays. How's everything been with you, though?

BOWMAN: All good, all good.

SMITH: John's working on his master's degree in mental health counseling, and he's a hip-hop artist on the side. He says he still thinks about that explosion that mangled his leg every day.

SMITH: For about 10, 15 minutes in the morning, I'm back in 2004 'cause I have to put myself back together every time.

SMITH: You got the prosthetic. Yeah.

SMITH: Exactly. So it's like I don't get to move all the way forward. But, I mean, after I put myself together, my daughter runs down. And I'm like, hey; I'm here now.

SMITH: By Pentagon regulations, someone from the Marines should have met with Smith and given him a copy of the investigation almost 20 years ago.

SMITH: I have never been contacted on this at all, like, for none of it.

SMITH: You haven't heard anything official from the Marines.

SMITH: Nothing at all.

BOWMAN: And you learned about it from the podcast.

SMITH: Exactly.

BOWMAN: What is that - what do you think about that?

SMITH: I think it's - honestly, the only word I can say is disgusting. Like, you espouse the words honor, courage, commitment. And you want us to follow them. And we give our life to follow. But when the ball falls on you, it's all of a sudden not important.

BOWMAN: So why were John Smith and others never told the truth? Well, here's what we uncovered. One of the Marines involved in this deadly mistake, the officer who plotted this mortar mission was First Lieutenant Duncan Hunter Jr., son of Duncan Sr., then a California congressman and the powerful chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.

SMITH: Among those wounded that day in Fallujah were two U.S. Army soldiers. We met Joe Colabuno on the National Mall last summer. You can hear the cicadas. He remembers seeing the mortar round fall while he and his friend were having a smoke in the school courtyard where the Marines were holed up.

JOE COLABUNO: So he got blasted forward. I got blasted against - there was a little wall.

(SOUNDBITE OF CICADAS BUZZING)

COLABUNO: You know, and Shihab was standing in the absolute worst possible way that you could be standing, and something explodes next to you.

SMITH: Shihab was their interpreter, an Iraqi who took the job to help support his young brothers and sisters back in Baghdad.

COLABUNO: Shihab was just like this, staring up at the stars.

BOWMAN: Joe Colabuno and his friend John Nelson were both badly wounded, could have been medically retired. But they fought to stay in. Both are still on active duty and hold the rank of sergeant major. The Marines have never told them the truth about their wounds and the death of their friend, Shihab.

SMITH: Colabuno always assumed the explosion that day in April 2004 was caused by the enemy until we told him what really happened. He's never talked much about that day.

COLABUNO: I don't carry it like a weight. I carry it somewhere, I guess. But - and war sucks. War is hell, right? I mean, we know that. We know this. But it's so stupid to - why would you cover it up? But...

SMITH: He points to the Capitol building looming at the end of the Mall.

COLABUNO: As long as these guys understand it - and the further away we get from war, the less they understand the the cost of war going forward, right? I mean, it needs to be an incredible tax on the nation to go to war. It should be because we need to think real [expletive] hard before we do that.

BOWMAN: Which gets us back to why Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona tells us he's looking into this case. He says beyond these men and the families getting the truth, it's important for the military to learn from their mistakes.

KELLY: To prevent future ones and to figure out why it happened. And then you need to put in some, you know, processes and procedures to make sure that stuff like that does not happen again.

BOWMAN: We also wrote to the Army Chief of Staff, General Randy George, who had his lawyers reach out to the Marines, referring the questions on to them.

SMITH: Meanwhile, the Marines who fought in Fallujah 20 years ago are planning a reunion in California in February. They've invited Colabuno and the other soldier, too - men who they never got to know at the time but who share the same tragedy. They hope by then they'll get some answers from the Marine Corps. I'm Graham Smith.

Zach Condon, the creative force behind the band Beirut, toured hard in 2019 until his body said stop in the one way he couldn't ignore.

ZACH CONDON: Because it tried getting me sick. It tried getting me exhausted. And I think once it found the voice and it kind of pulled the plug on that, it realized that it could shut everything down.

SHAPIRO: A persistent case of laryngitis forced him to cancel a bunch of shows and take a break. So Zach Condon told me he went looking for a place to regroup. He wanted somewhere icy and dark.

CONDON: Because for some reason, that speaks to me, and that kind of gives me a sense of protection and shelter. And so I kind of went looking for the most extreme version of that in northern Norway.

SHAPIRO: Tonight is the winter solstice - the longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. So let's lean into that and travel with Zach Condon to a dark, cold Norwegian island called Hadsel, which is also the name of Beirut's latest album. In a cabin on Hadsel, he found a pump organ.

(SOUNDBITE OF BEIRUT SONG, ""HADSEL"")

CONDON: So the pump organ is the more piano-sized, for-your-own-home - you actually - it's funny. When you're playing it, it's like riding a bicycle because you're pumping air into the bellows with your feet.

SHAPIRO: Usually when people say it's like riding a bicycle, they mean you never forget how to do it. You mean you're actually pedaling your feet like a bicycle.

CONDON: Yeah. Yeah. You're literally pedaling your feet like a bicycle, yeah. And it - also, it gives you some kind of room for expression and other such things that you wouldn't have on a church organ, for example.

SHAPIRO: There's almost, like, an accordion-ish (ph) sound to it.

CONDON: Yeah. That's the closest other instrument to it. It's the same kind of reeds. It's just a different system of kind of bellows and air, I guess.

SHAPIRO: And so how much of you is thinking, oh, I've got the place to create my next album and make new music, as opposed to I just need to lick my wounds and recover and be away from people for a little while?

CONDON: Well, actually, originally it was more the latter. I mean, that was my entire purpose. But, yeah, once I saw the pictures of the pump organ and I found out that it was in tune and it worked, I kind of went into autopilot. Like, I wasn't really thinking anymore. I was just reacting. And I was packing five suitcases full of equipment and making these plans as if it was a studio visit.

(SOUNDBITE OF BEIRUT'S ""MELBU"")

SHAPIRO: We hear the pump organ throughout the album, but there's one instrumental track that I think is just that instrument on its own called ""Melbu.""

CONDON: Yeah. It's - it was a very meditative track, and it was a very meditative night. I actually was writing that at Agvar's (ph) house. Agvar is the guy who let me play the church organ and collects and repairs pump organs from around northern Norway, actually.

SHAPIRO: You say it was a special night, but it was all night. You were there in the Arctic winter.

CONDON: Polar night. Yeah.

SHAPIRO: I mean, it was one monthlong night - right? - or multi-month.

CONDON: Yeah. I was there for two months. The first month was mostly darkness. And I think my parents thought I might go there and lose my mind.

SHAPIRO: Did you?

CONDON: Yes and no. Yes and no.

SHAPIRO: Go on.

CONDON: I gravitate towards the night. I always have. Actually, since I was about 11 years old, I've suffered from really bad insomnia. It was like a switch went off in my head, and I could no longer sleep during the night. I could only sleep during the day for some reason. So, like, as soon as the sun would rise, I would rest. And I started to get this kind of backwards feeling of, like, the night is when it's peace and solitude and focus, and the daytime is when all the noise and activity and stress is. And so when I was looking for a place to escape, that was very purposeful on my part, to find somewhere that was literally nighttime the whole time so that I could just focus.

SHAPIRO: This is a real part of you now. It's not just a place you did a thing once.

CONDON: Well, I actually bought a cabin up there 'cause I loved it...

SHAPIRO: Wait.

CONDON: ...So much.

SHAPIRO: Really?

CONDON: Yeah. Yeah. I really appreciated it there. You know, I didn't expect to be making so many friends up there. That was not - I really thought I would be super isolated. But I ended up getting really involved with the local kind of village that I was part of there.

SHAPIRO: You describe the persistent laryngitis that, in part, led you to this remote island. And there are places on the album where it sounds to me like having lost and regained your voice, you're now relishing what it can do in a different way, like, taking more pleasure in some of the melodies and harmonies it can make.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ARCTIC FOREST"")

BEIRUT: (Vocalizing).

SHAPIRO: Do you think of your voice differently now?

CONDON: You know, on this record, I really allowed myself a lot of vocal freedom, because I was trying to enjoy it and really savor the moment, you know? 'Cause who knows? I still have kind of indigestion issues, and they can lead to, you know, voice degradation over time, for example. So I'm really trying to kind of take out the limitations. And so with the voice, I was very improvisatory, very just allowing whatever happened to happen. Almost every take on the record is first or second or third try...

SHAPIRO: Really?

CONDON: ...Like, somewhere in the very first few - yeah. Yeah. Because you get this kind of magical, deeper emotion out of it. And as cliche as that sounds, it's like, as soon as you start retreading the same territory and trying to get it, quote-unquote, ""correct,"" you end up losing the magic, you know? So I made sure not to allow myself to critique myself out of first takes on this record.

SHAPIRO: One place I hear what you're describing is the track ""Arctic Forest.""

CONDON: Yeah. Exactly.

SHAPIRO: Is that an apt example?

CONDON: (Laughter) It's very apt because I hadn't even finished writing the story I was going to put into it before I started singing. And then what happened is when I went, and I went back to rewrite and correct the kind of improvisation I had done, I realized I could never do it as well again. And so there is actual gibberish in there, and I had to just allow myself to be OK with it.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ARCTIC FOREST"")

BEIRUT: (Vocalizing).

SHAPIRO: So you're planning your first live concerts in years for early 2024. How are you feeling about it?

CONDON: If I'm being honest, I'm terrified. I'm - you know, I'm already losing a little sleep over it. But I wanted to celebrate the record in a lot of ways. It's not so much that I ever hated performance. I'm not a performer naturally. It's - I'm much more of the tinkerer. Like, I'm in the bedroom kind of tinkering on songs all night, and that's my natural place. But there's something beautiful about live music, especially when you have a lot of acoustic instruments on stage. And I just really wanted to be able to do that at least once with this music. So I told myself, I won't go on tour, but I'm going to try this. I'm going to try to get on stage once again and kind of fight through the stress and the struggle and see how this turns out. And maybe it's something I can do off and on from now on.

SHAPIRO: Do you feel like you now have a different relationship with your body than you did before the great rebellion of 2019?

CONDON: (Laughter) You know, you hear this a lot from people who have kind of suffered traumas and such things. It's not so much that you get past it or through it or anything, so much as you get better at carrying it with you. And I'm reaching that point where these issues that I have, I'm starting to be able to sit with them rather than run from them all the time. And I'm hoping that's the solution, because that might be the best I get, you know?

SHAPIRO: And now that you've got a cabin in remote Norway, you could always retreat to Hadsel again if you need to.

CONDON: That's my immediate plan after the February shows...

SHAPIRO: Really?

CONDON: ...So I can catch the really snowy month, which is March, which is my favorite.

SHAPIRO: Zach Condon performs as Beirut and his new album is ""Hadsel."" Thank you so much.

CONDON: Cheers. Thank you.

562,,,"Bigger, Better Buses",https://richmondmagazine.com/news/news/grtc-new-pulse-buses-2025/,"× Expand Photo courtesy GRTC

Fueled by the success of its Pulse line, the GRTC Transit System is on track to add four 60-foot-long articulated buses that run on compressed natural gas to its rapid-transit fleet by 2025.

The buses will be able to accommodate 120 seated and standing passengers. They’ll also have a third door, which GRTC says will help speed boarding and make overall trip times faster.

GRTC’s 40-foot Pulse buses can be crowded at peak times, according to GRTC communication specialist Henry Bendon. Bigger, larger-capacity buses will help create a “generally more pleasant peak commute experience,” he said in an email.

“The Pulse has been overwhelmingly successful, outpacing initial estimates by thousands of riders per day and bringing new people into the system,” Bendon says. “Projects like the Western Extension (which takes the Pulse out to Parham Road in Henrico County) and North/South Pulse (which will run from Azalea Avenue in north Richmond toward Chesterfield Towne Center) have already shown the demand for rapid transit is high and the enthusiasm from riders is real — and these larger buses are being brought in to help deal with that enthusiasm.”

To accommodate the larger buses, construction at the Pulse’s 26 stations, which shouldn’t affect their operations, is set for this spring.

GRTC launched its rapid-transit Pulse line in 2018. The buses run from Rocketts Landing to the Willow Lawn shopping center. Through October of this year alone, there have been 1.45 million rides on the Pulse.

The articulated buses — which feature an accordion-like junction in the middle of the bus — will eventually replace the entire Pulse fleet. Current Pulse buses will then be cycled into regular transit service.",

The armed robbery was reported just after midnight Thursday.

According to Montgomery County police, three masked suspects entered Shalla in the 8000 block of Sligo Avenue and demanded their belongings.

Two of the suspects had firearms, one of which was a long rifle. Police said the second suspect was carrying a shotgun, while the third was carrying a red bag. Police did not specify how many victims were involved, but they said all of the victims complied before the suspects headed towards Washington, D.C.

Mareg Antandh has lived in the neighborhood for several years and was just at the restaurant on Tuesday.

""I was shocked because this would be the last place I would expect this to happen, considering there is a police station in that building up the street. I was really, really shocked. I was surprised,"" Antandh told FOX 5 Thursday.

A few doors down the street on Sligo Avenue, beauty salon owner Mary Paulino said she first heard about the incident on social media. Paolino owns Wink’d, which specializes in services such as eyelash extensions and nails.

""You know, we’re like a family,"" Paolino said. ""All of the stores are kind of together. We all know each other, so it’s pretty scary, but this neighborhood, it’s not a bad neighborhood. I think at night, it gets kind of weird. At night, some of the businesses stay open really late. So, that attracts dangerous activities.""

Earlier this year, Montgomery County police launched a new plan with the goal of preventing violent crime.

Under the ""Late Night Safety Plan,"" businesses open between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. in high-crime areas are required to submit and develop safety plans. Those plans must be approved by the Montgomery County Police Department.

Antandh said while he remains hopeful a plan like this could be beneficial in the long term, he’s skeptical until he sees results.

""I would emphasize the fact that we need more police presence,"" he said. ""We need more police officers on the streets. People have to feel safe to come enjoy dinner at a neighborhood restaurant, in my opinion.""

565,,,Murder in Downtown Silver Spring parking garage remains unsolved one year later,https://www.fox5dc.com/news/murder-in-downtown-silver-spring-parking-garage-remains-unsolved-one-year-later,"Thursday marks one year since a man was murdered in a Montgomery County parking garage after a family outing to a restaurant in Downtown Silver Spring.

Just days before Christmas last year, 62-year-old Charles Reynolds was found in a stairwell of the Wayne Avenue garage.

The Montgomery County Police Department still has no leads in the deadly shooting, so FOX 5 came back to the crime scene with a retired homicide detective to analyze the mysterious murder.

""At approximately 9 p.m., officers responded to the parking garage located at Wayne Avenue and Fenton Street and found, in the stairwell, an adult male, dead, with trauma to his body,"" said Montgomery County Police Officer Carlos Cortes on the night of the crime.

Reynolds, who went by Joe, was the man found shot dead in that stairwell.

He had just finished shopping for last-minute Christmas gifts and having dinner with his family when he decided to drop off the leftovers in his car with plans to rejoin them for ice cream.

""It was literally six minutes between when we left the restaurant and when she called 911,"" said Reynolds’ wife, Karis Hastings, in a press conference months after the murder.

In those six minutes, Joe went from celebrating with his loved ones to being shot and killed. His sister-in-law was the one to find him and call for help.

""So then, instead of getting ready for Christmas we were talking to the police and calling funeral homes,"" his wife said.

According to the Montgomery County Police Department, no property was stolen from Reynolds.

There were also no cameras in the stairwell or the parking deck.

Despite sifting through hours of nearby surveillance, police say they have no leads.

""We’re really at our wits’ end in this particular incident because it is- it doesn’t make sense to us,"" said MCPD Chief Marcus Jones.

FOX 5 contributor and retired homicide detective Randy Kucsan recently analyzed the unsolved case.

""You can see this is fairly well-lit. You know they would look for nooks and crannies where perhaps it’s darker or no cameras,"" said Kucsan. ""But you can see right here it’s very well-lit, and it’s a short distance from the vehicle to the stairwell. So again, he might’ve been accosted at his car, or perhaps he just starts going back down the stairwell, and the person or the assailant or assailants piggyback through that door after him. This happened quickly, impulsively and that’s probably why there’s no witnesses to it.""

""I believe Mr. Reynolds was targeted because he was alone, and it could’ve been anyone, but they chose someone that was alone and vulnerable, and it was a crime of opportunity,"" Kucsan went on to say. ""There’s a $10,000 reward that remains in effect. I’m sure based on my training and experience, I’m sure somebody not necessarily saw the shooting because, again it was in a secluded stairwell, but they may have seen suspicious activity before or after the shooting.""

The police department told FOX 5 there is no danger to the community.

If you did see anything suspicious, detectives are asking you to contact them and you can leave an anonymous tip.

566,,,15 plead guilty in Maryland prison contraband scheme involving drones,https://www.fox5dc.com/news/15-plead-guilty-in-maryland-prison-contraband-scheme-involving-drones,"Fifteen people have pleaded guilty for their roles in a prison contraband scheme in Maryland that included the use of drones to smuggle drugs, cellphones and other items into a state prison, the state’s attorney general announced.

The guilty pleas came seven months after Attorney General Anthony Brown first announced that a correctional officer and civilians had been indicted on charges that they assisted inmates in illegal activity at the Roxbury Correctional Institution in Hagerstown, Maryland.

""Safety is as important in our correctional institutions as it is to the public in our neighborhoods and communities,"" Brown said in a news release this week. ""This meticulous investigation and subsequent convictions send a clear message that we will not tolerate crime or corruption within our correctional facilities that disrupts the goals of rehabilitation.""

An investigation began in April 2022, after authorities recovered drugs and other contraband that had been smuggled into the prison after an inmate returned to the facility from a hospital visit.

The AG’s investigative team ""uncovered a complex web of conspiracies operating to smuggle drugs and other contraband into RCI by way of an employee, drones, and outside civilians who were recruited over social media,"" according to the news release.

Featured article

Last month, Brown announced additional charges against one of the RCI inmates, Jose Miguel Tapia. Tapia created a fake court commitment document and impersonated a representative from a state’s attorney’s office in an attempt to secure his unlawful early release from prison, the attorney general said.

The forged document, imprinted with the seal of the clerk of the circuit court, purported to award Tapia 449 days of credit for time served against his sentence in an effort to get him an early release, Brown said.

From his prison cell, Tapia electronically faxed the fake order to the clerk of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and, assuming the identity of a representative from the state’s attorney’s office, called the clerk’s office to request that it be processed, according to the news release.

The clerk’s office recognized that the commitment was forged, the attorney general’s office said. Tapia was sentenced to 14 additional years.

Kinji Scott, who once chaired Maryland's juvenile justice coalition, isn't convinced Schiraldi is capable of reforming a habitually broken juvenile system.

""He has no track record of reforming anything,"" said Scott.

""We should be at the point now that we are transforming the penal system into a treatment-driven system and we're not there. This is not the guy for the job,"" insists Scott.

It has some residents scratching their heads over how it could have happened and at taxpayers' expense.

Justin Beitzel, who lives in North Baltimore, showed us his calendar Thursday.

It's a flawed calendar, one riddled with errors including a mistake made on the October page.''

""They missed the 22nd,"" said Beitzel.

The city erased October 22, going from October 21, skipping to the 23rd.

But in November, the city added a day--November 31st. That month only has 30 days.

""That's really unfortunate, somebody's kicking themselves for that one,"" said Beitzel.



Thousands of calendars were recently mailed to city taxpayers, including Pat Fisher and Eric Landers who live in the Medfield neighborhood.

""It's a waste of money, it went into the trashcan. The errors..did someone not go over them before they mailed them out? I mean, how incompetent,"" said Fisher.

""What are (they) doing with our money? We're paying this money as taxpayers, the citizens that live in the city. We want it to be put to good use. But also, people make mistakes and errors happen and that's, that's what happens in life,"" said Landers.



Fox45 News reached out to DPW and was told by a spokesperson to email our questions.

We did, asking: How much money was spent on these calendars, including mail cost? When did DPW become aware of the errors--were the mistakes caught, but mailed out anyway?

A DPW spokesperson responded but without answering any of our questions.



Instead, releasing a statement that reads in part: ""DPW deeply regrets the recent editorial mistakes that occurred in the annual calendar....in light of this, we have initiated a thorough review of our editorial processes.""

Still, more reaction in Medfield.

""Have you ever heard of a calendar that didn't have the actual dates correct? So, it may be a, what do you call it, save it for later...maybe a valuable item someday,"" said Jim Rapp.",

Baltimore's Office of the Inspector General cites a human error as the reason for the officer not receiving the compensation.

Specifically, IG Isabel Mercedes Cumming told FOX45 News a new payroll check never logged the former officer's accrued vacation hours when they switched Departments.

ALSO READ |

The former officer, who served for over 32 years and retired in November 2019, initially filed a complaint to the Baltimore's Office of the Inspector General back in October.

The officer was told that they would have approximately 114 days of accrued vacation leave paid out to them, but between November 2019 and October 2023, the officer never received the money.

According to a report from the Inspector General, the officer tried to correct the matter with the BPD's Human Resources office and a Fraternal Order of Police union representative, but the officer's efforts were unsuccessful.

The officer then contacted the Inspector General for assistance, and the IG referred the officer's allegation to the police department and Baltimore City's Department of Finance for review. The Inspector General's report says that the OIG maintained consistent communication with the BPD and the DOF between November 16, 2023, and December 13, 2023, and both responded to the OIG's referral of the officer's missing payout.

ALSO READ |

After reviewing records, the Police Department told the Inspector General's office that upon the officer's retirement date in November 2019, the police department never initiated a leave payout request for the officer's vacation leave balance. The finance department confirmed the finding by reviewing its records.

The DOF reviewed all payments made to the officer between the retirement date in November 2019 and December 2023 and found that while the officer received some accrued leave balance payouts, the officer never received any payments for their vacation leave balance. The report says that, according to DOF records, the officer was owed compensation for 111.98 days of vacation leave, which totaled $40,822.34.

On December 14, 2023, Inspector General Isabel Cumming and Assistant Inspector General Richard Mitchell contacted the officer to provide an update on the original complaint. A follow-up was sent on December 20, 2023, letting the officer know that on December 15, 2023, Baltimore City issued a check to the officer.",

579,,,Two Baltimore City Council members currently ineligible for reelection over campaign fines,https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/two-baltimore-city-council-members-currently-ineligible-for-reelection-over-campaign-fines-nick-mosby-antonio-glover,"With less than five months left before Baltimore City voters head to the polls, state records show two Baltimore City Council members are currently disqualified to file for reelection.

According to the online campaign finance database operated by the Maryland State Board of Elections (SBE), Council President Nick Mosby and Councilman Antonio Glover have several open violations and referrals to the Office of the State Prosecutor (OSP).

Mosby’s campaign has 10 active violations, with four referred to the OSP for further enforcement, SBE’s campaign finance records show.



RELATED |

With slightly fewer fines and violations, state records show Glover’s campaign boasts seven open violations with four active referrals to the OSP.

SBE Director of Candidacy and Campaign Finance Allen Norfleet explained the elected leaders’ current eligibility status to FOX45 News.

Mosby has outstanding fines of $8,355 and Glover $7,000,” Maryland State Board of Elections Director of Candidacy and Campaign Finance Allen Norfleet explained to FOX45 News. “They will need to pay these fines before they can be a candidate for reelection.”

Both Mosby and Glover have extensive histories with campaign disclosure violations compared to their colleagues.

Though some past fines have been waived, Mosby and Glover have amassed a history of $15,860 and $21,385 in respective fines since registering their campaign organizations with the state.

Both city officials also trail their colleagues in available campaign cash, state election records show.



While Mosby’s latest campaign disclosure has an outstanding amendment due from a routine audit, his January 2023 filing reported only $954 in its account.

In a written statement to FOX45 News, Mosby dismissed the violations and stated he has been more focused on governing.

My focus has not been on campaigning, but rather, advancing our city out of very challenging times. I had a very successful campaign fundraising launch last week, and my campaign is fully committed to working with the SBE to clear our the outstanding amendments and penalties,” Baltimore City Council President Nick Mosby wrote to FOX45 News.

In March, Mosby an eight-month battle with the Baltimore City Ethics Board over two ethics violations related to a legal defense fund.



The fund was in his name as well as the name of his now-ex-wife, former State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby. Amid the unrelated legal defense fund battle, the city’s ethics board asked a judge to penalize Mosby $1,000 daily until he complied with their demands.

The nearly $200,000 in fines Mosby racked up were never imposed, with the board later saying they were “confident that Council President Mosby [had] complied with the Board’s Administrative Order.”

Glover’s last filed campaign disclosure in November 2022 showed $3,095 in available cash. The councilman is 11 months past due in filing his last required campaign disclosure, SBE records show.



In response to questions submitted to Antonio Glover by FOX45 News, he suggested he is working with SBE to resolve his campaign’s violations and that this matter should not concern Baltimore residents.

Baltimore residents should not be concerned about the status of my campaign committee,” Baltimore City Councilman Antonio Glover explained to FOX45 News in an email.

Glover confirmed that, despite his current eligibility, he plans on seeking reelection.

Not all Baltimore City Council members have allowed their campaign finance violations to escalate.



Despite previously receiving four late campaign disclosure violations, Councilman Eric Costello successfully lobbied the SBE to waive all prior $3,080 fees and violations from his record, according to state records.

As of his last filed disclosure, Costello leads the City Council with over $435,000 in available campaign cash.

Out of the 15-member Baltimore City Council, only Councilman Mark Conway has a flawless campaign reporting record.

The Maryland State Board of Elections website states the next campaign finance reports are due on January 17. These public disclosures will include all campaign contributions and expenditures for 2023.

According to the SBE’s 2024 election calendar, eligible candidates must file by 9:00 p.m. on February 9 to appear on the primary election ballot.
