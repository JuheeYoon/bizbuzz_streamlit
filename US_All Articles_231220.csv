0,0.0,0.0,Trial of Jimmy Lai Under the Hong Kong National Security Law,https://www.state.gov/trial-of-jimmy-lai-under-the-hong-kong-national-security-law/,"The United States condemns the prosecution of pro-democracy advocate and media owner Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong under the PRC-imposed National Security Law. Lai has been held in pre-trial detention for more than 1,000 days, and Hong Kong and Beijing authorities have denied him his choice of legal representation.

We urge Beijing and Hong Kong authorities to respect press freedom in Hong Kong. Actions that stifle press freedom and restrict the free flow of information – as well as Beijing and local authorities’ changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system that reduce direct voting and preclude independent and pro-democracy party candidates from participating – have undermined Hong Kong’s democratic institutions and harmed Hong Kong’s reputation as an international business and financial hub.

We call on Hong Kong authorities to immediately release Jimmy Lai and all others imprisoned for defending their rights.",

Women are the fastest growing demographic at Bedford VA, and now comprise nearly 1500 patients served. With increasing demand, hospital leaders recognized infrastructure needed upgrading to meet sensitive needs.

“We are grateful to have won the contract to renovate this space for Bedford VA’s women Veterans clinic,” said Mark Voner, CEO of Veterans Development Corporation and a Veteran. For Voner, giving back touches close to home as he relies on VA for his own care.

Reviewing plans for clinic expansion

“We’ll offer more services than ever in a safe, welcoming space,” said Women Veterans Program Manager Cheryl Coviello. “Our staff and women Veterans are excited for this win-win. It’s been a long time coming.”

Renovation will add much needed space for female Veterans

The redesign adds privacy, more exam rooms, upgraded clinical equipment, and dedicated space to host group counseling supporting mental health. “This whole building renovation will add much needed space for our female Veterans,” said Charmaine Brooks, lead engineer. “I am thankful to be leading this important project.”

For Army Veteran Leanna Lynch, news of the expansion brought relief. As a member of the Massachusetts Governor’s Women Veterans Advisory Council, she hears concerns from fellow women Veterans needing access to quality care. “Women Veterans have a set of unique needs. Safety and privacy are very important to us,” Lynch said. “Over the moon about the clinic expansion for so many reasons. Most exciting is the expanded services and space that is safe and private.”

The project, expected to finish in spring 2025 after a year and a half of intense renovation, promises to transform access at the growing campus. It helps Bedford VA deliver the full spectrum of primary, specialty and gender-specific care women Veterans earned through their military service and sacrifice.",
5,5.0,5.0,VA dietitian rooting for root vegetables,https://news.va.gov/126689/va-dietitian-rooting-for-root-vegetables/,"December is a perfect time to learn about a versatile vegetable group and how to enjoy them during the holidays and beyond. The benefits of root vegetables are often undervalued or misunderstood.

Traditional root vegetables grow underground and include carrots, radishes, rutabaga, beets, parsnips and turnips. Tubers are another common root vegetable and include potatoes, yams, cassava and jicama. Rhizomes, including wasabi, ginger and turmeric are often used as spices in cooking. Lastly are bulbs, which include garlic, shallots, and onion, which are often used as flavor powerhouses in cuisines around the world.

Different root vegetables are staple crops around the world. While taro is not a common root vegetable in the U.S., it is a staple in many Pacific Island nations, and is used to make poi. Cassava is a staple in many tropical countries and is one of the most common carbohydrate sources in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Many root vegetables have a longer shelf life than the more delicate vegetables like spinach and lettuce, and they provide energy and nutrients during leaner times when there is less to harvest.

Root veggies have fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants

Root vegetables like potatoes are good for you. They’re rich in fiber, keeping you feeling full, and they stabilize blood sugar, lower cholesterol and support a healthy gut. Each root veggie has its own mix of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Including a variety of them in your meals is a great way to enjoy their benefits.

Consider trying:

If you’re unsure how to incorporate root vegetables into your meals, VA offers cooking classes and resources for preparing vegetables and recipes and cookbooks on the Healthy Teaching Kitchen website.

Reach out to your local VA to schedule an appointment with a dietitian to gift yourself the benefits of a healthier diet with more root vegetables.",
6,6.0,6.0,What you missed at the 2023 TAB Policy Conference,https://www.txbiz.org/post/what-you-missed-at-the-2023-tab-policy-conference,"Blog by Katie Zarate, Director of Communications The Texas Association of Business (TAB) rounded out its centennial celebration with our Annual Policy Conference on December 7, 2023.

This year’s theme was Texas on the Global Scale: How Policies Shape Our Future. With an impressive slate of C-suite executives from Texas’ hottest industries, the Policy Conference addressed employers’ most pressing challenges and celebrated newly minted legislation that strengthened Texas’ position as the Best State for Business.

The program began with an economic forecast by Jon Hockenyos, who emphasized the value of tech industry to our state’s economy. Due to a strong workforce, low cost of living, and a business-friendly regulatory environment, Texas is ripe for innovation. The Future of Tech & AI panelists spoke to the importance of good governance. Light taxes and reasonable regulations all contribute to the tech sector’s success.













TAB was fortunate to have Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione speak on the Tech & AI panel. A policy leader in this arena, Rep. Capriglione has passed several impactful pieces of legislation, including the Texas Cybercrime Act, the Texas Cybersecurity Act, and the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act. TAB advocates for tech regulations that balance individual freedoms while maximizing innovation.

In addition to the right regulatory climate, Amazon’s Rebecca Gonzales underlined the importance of human-centered AI. When developing these products, the goal should be to help people augment what they are already doing – not replace people altogether.

Panelists touched on the impact AI has, not only on retail and social media experiences, but also in education and the workplace. As McKinsey’s Saurabh Sanghvi said, “The future of work is already here and it's moving fast.”While we like to say everything is bigger in Texas, there is a technology champion across the globe that is worth mentioning. Our friend and ally, Israel, is an innovation giant, and Israeli Tech is a brand that has earned worldwide respect. Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem and Special Envoy for Innovation, Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, opened her remarks by saying, “Every single Israeli thinks they can save the world with some new technology. That is embedded in our DNA.” She explained how challenges with agriculture and water security led to creative solutions. “Necessity is the mother of invention,” she said.













While Fleur faced questions about her decision to travel to Texas during a war, she stood her ground. “Peace can be achieved through economic development and economic bridges.” The Deputy Mayor shared that Texas can help Israel strengthen its global partnerships, and Israel can serve as a gateway to the Middle East for Texas. TAB Chairman, Massey Villarreal, awarded Fleur the “Innovation Diplomacy Award” for strengthening economic ties and encouraging innovation through collaboration between the Start-Up Nation and the Scale-Up State.

Keeping with the international theme, TAB CEO Glenn Hamer moderated a conversation between IBC Bank’s Gerry Schwebel and former Texas Secretary of State Rolando Pablos on the value of Texas’ relationship with Mexico. $800 billion in trade flows between Texas and Mexico each year, and in 2022 alone, Texas and Mexico had a trade relationship of $285 billion. There is currently bipartisan legislation at the federal level, authored by Senator Ted Cruz, to streamline the presidential permitting process required for international bridges. Language for the bill was included in the Defense Authorization Act, a giant step forward for proponents. TAB’s CEO summarized the Association’s border policy position as “maximizing good goods and preventing bad people and bad goods.” IBC Bank’s Gerry Schwebel, a recognized trade and immigration expert, added that “migration is tied to trade whether we like it or not.” As the U.S. continues to navigate a labor shortage, there are legislative solutions, like commonsense immigration reform, that could help employers fill labor gaps. Any step forward should be celebrated, and as TAB advocates, border security can and must be achieved simultaneously.

















While immigration is one solution to labor gaps, there are also policy reforms in the education realm that can strengthen the future workforce. Commissioner Harrison Keller, Woody Hunt, and Grayson College President Dr. Jeremy P. McMillen joined former Secretary of State Ruth Hughs for the conversation. During the 88th Legislative Session, lawmakers transformed the way community colleges were funded through House Bill 8, which established an outcomes-based funding formula. Lawmakers also passed House Bill 1595 (Texas University Fund); both bills enjoyed immense support from the business community.

The Texas Association of Business celebrated the 88th Legislative Session as a historic success for economic development. Adriana Cruz, Governor Greg Abbott’s Executive Director for Economic Development and Tourism, applauded the Legislature’s passage of House Bill 5 (JETI Act) and the Texas CHIPS Act. The JETI Act will serve as the state’s new, transparent and accountable economic development incentive program. The tax tool will give communities a powerful leg-up in the competition to attract large capital-intensive investments to their regions. With Texas being the birthplace of the microchip, Adriana Cruz also emphasized the importance of the Texas CHIPS Act for reinforcing our state’s leadership on semiconductors. This is good for our supply chains, the broader manufacturing ecosystem, and the tens of thousands of Texans employed by the industry. Both bills were top priorities for TAB this session.













When it comes to business acumen, there is one family name that shines bright in the headlines: The Adelsons.

TAB Policy Conference were on the edge of their seats for Dr. Miriam Adelson’s keynote address. She recounted her recent travels to Israel and spared no detail in the brutalities of Hamas’ attack. Dr. Adelson applauded Texas’ support of Israel and said, like Texans, Israelis stand up and stick to their guns. Carrying on the legacy of her late husband and founder of Las Vegas Sands, Sheldon Adelson, Dr. Miriam Adelson is recognized as the most prominent philanthropist and advocate for encouraging a strong US-Israel relationship. She touted the Texas-Israel relationship as deeper than business, and with a smile she added, “and it even runs deeper than basketball.”To recognize her support of the world’s premiere Lone Star States, TAB CEO Glenn Hamer presented Dr. Adelson with the “Lone Star Champion Award.”













The 2023 TAB Policy Conference was attended by over 250 business leaders, state agency heads, and capitol staff.

7,7.0,7.0,Dr. Miriam Adelson Celebrates 'Shared Spirit' Between Texas and Israel at TAB Policy Conference,https://www.txbiz.org/post/dr-miriam-adelson-celebrates-shared-spirit-between-texas-and-israel-at-tab-policy-conference,"Blog by Glenn Hamer, President & CEO of TAB

The Texas Association of Business recently hosted its annual Policy Conference centralized on the importance of global relationships and policies for the Lone Star State. Texas’ partnership with Israel is undoubtedly one of the most prominent, and TAB was honored to host Dr. Miriam Adelson, a renowned doctor, business leader and powerful advocate of Israel, as a keynote speaker at the event.





Watch Dr. Adelson's keynote speech here .

""This is a critical time for Israel,” Dr. Miriam Adelson declared. “The support must be loud and clear, and nowhere has it been more so than right here in Texas. From the top office of my dear friend, Governor Abbott, and all the way down to ordinary churchgoers … Texans have turned out for Israel.”

These powerful words echo the sentiment shared by many who understand the depth of the bond between Texas and Israel. It's a relationship that goes beyond mere geopolitical alliances; it's a connection rooted in shared values, resilience, and a mutual commitment to freedom and prosperity.

Dr. Adelson acknowledged the booming commercial ties between Texas and Israel, while emphasizing that the relationship runs far deeper than business. The economic partnership between the two regions has indeed flourished, creating a beneficial situation for both parties. Texas, with its robust economy, and Israel, an innovative world leader in technology sector, are in a partnership that promises success and a prosperous future for both entities.













TAB, as a driving force behind this collaboration, is actively working to fortify the bonds between Texas and Israel. However, Israel is more than an important ally to Texas, they are also a friend.

Recognizing the challenges faced by Israel, TAB aims to play a pivotal role in continuing to provide steadfast support to Israel as they face unfathomable hardships and challenges. This alliance goes beyond economic growth and contributes to the broader canvas of international collaboration and shared prosperity.

In her address, Dr. Adelson touched upon the unique bond shared by Israelis and Texans. ""Look closer, and you’ll find that Israelis and Texans have a deep affinity,” she said. “It runs deeper than business, though commercial ties between Texas and Israel are truly booming. And it even runs deeper than basketball, though my family are huge fans of the Dallas Mavericks. It is a matter of shared spirit.""

This shared spirit, extending beyond business dealings and even beyond cultural and sporting interests, speaks to a deeper connection founded on shared values. It represents a unity that goes beyond borders, contributing to a harmonious collaboration that has and will continue to endure through the test of time.

At the conclusion of her remarks, TAB was proud to recognize Dr. Adelson with the ""Lone Star Champion"" award for supporting and strengthening the relationship between the world’s premiere Lone Star States – Texas and Israel.

8,8.0,8.0,Governor Hochul Reminds New Yorkers to Prepare as Heavy Rain and Strong Winds Move Into the State,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-reminds-new-yorkers-prepare-heavy-rain-and-strong-winds-move-state,"Governor Kathy Hochul today reminded New Yorkers to stay prepared as a storm system moves up the eastern coast and enters New York. This significant system will impact most of the state through Tuesday with heavy rain, strong winds and potential flooding, especially those in flood prone areas. The system is expected to produce 2-4 inches of rain and gusty winds in many locations, although parts of the eastern Catskills could see rainfall totals exceeding five inches. Rainfall rates are forecast to peak at 1-1.5 inches per hour during the storm’s duration, although there is the possibility for locally higher rates of rainfall at times. Flooding is likely in some locations, especially in the Mid-Hudson Valley, where recent rainfall and saturated ground is not able to absorb or hold the forecasted rainfall. Winds will be gusty, especially in New York City and Long Island, where gusts could reach 60 mph or more, especially in the far eastern portions of Long Island, which could cause power outages and worsen coastal flooding conditions. Governor Hochulcontinues to urge New Yorkers to prepare for heavy rain and gusty conditions, and to check on neighbors and family to ensure their safety through the storm.

“We have been tracking this storm system for several days and it remains on track to bring several inches of rain to New York, especially in the Mid-Hudson, where some places could see more than four inches of rain by Tuesday,” Governor Hochul said. “There is also a potential for very strong winds downstate in New York City and on Long Island, which could cause power outages. State agencies continue to monitor this system and are prepared to support our local partners. New Yorkers should continue to check the forecast for updates and take the steps necessary to stay safe.”

A Flood Watch is in effect for many locations through Monday evening. High Wind Warnings are in effect for Long Island, and Kings and Queens counties, and Coastal Flood Warnings are in effect for the coasts of Long Island and southern Queens County.

“Today marks the one-year anniversary of Mitchell’s death,” the state agency wrote in a news release. “(He) was known to many as a contractor in the metro Atlanta-area, a hard worker, and family man.”

On Dec. 17, 2022, the Paulding County Sheriff’s Office was called to a home in the 500 block of Warrenton Drive near Douglasville after several 911 callers reported gunshots in the residential area.",
10,,,Gridlock Guy: Intelligent left turns are decreasing wrecks in one Gwinnett city,https://www.ajc.com/atlanta-traffic/gridlock-guy-intelligent-left-turns-are-decreasing-wrecks-in-one-gwinnett-city/PDNTEGEIPBFRLA4ISN3TKLP7MU/,"Mulligan’s mantra is relatable: traffic systems have remained largely unchanged for a century, and simple nudges and tweaks can make the roads much safer and more efficient.

Mulligan’s Applied Information and tech incubator iATL, based in Alpharetta, partners with the public and private sectors to implement these systems. In Marietta, for example, smart traffic technology turns traffic lights green for firetrucks. This has decreased firetruck crashes to zero in the six years since installing it, Mulligan said.

Applied Information also has helped outfit buses in some school systems that communicate with smart cars, to tell the cars when they are planning to stop. The beacons help warn drivers to slow down or prompt autonomous cars to do that on their own.

Intelligent left turns work in the same manner, said Brandon Branham, Peachtree Corners assistant city manager. The Gwinnett County suburb has been one of the more forward-leaning, tech-friendly cities in Metro Atlanta, given its Curiosity Lab off of Peachtree Industrial Boulevard.

The city installed this system on the Peachtree Industrial/southbound left turn into the NAPA Auto Parts store on Business Park Drive. This is fittingly just north of the Curiosity Lab’s home on Technology Parkway, which has its own smart signal at a blind, three-way stop at Engineering Drive.

“It’ll tell you that it is unsafe, based on the algorithm, to turn left. You can still turn left, if you want to. But we are just giving you some notification that it may not be the safest time to turn left,” Branham said in promotional material about the technology.

Does that not speak to human nature? Sometimes a driver is on the fence about whether to risk that left turn. Maybe their decision is simply influenced by how long they have waited and not how safe turning is. They need a better prompt from something objective.

The Peachtree Industrial signal, Branham said, “Saw upwards of six car crashes annually. Since piloting this technology, police reports have shown a 25% decrease.”

Preventing a crash or two per year does not sound like much, but that certainly matters to the people in those crashes and the countless others inconvenienced by them.

And that is in just one intersection. Imagine if one crash per year was prevented at a city’s ten worst intersections. Extrapolate that over ten cities. And these are just small changes.

The toll of an ill-fated left turn is often far greater than crash damage and traffic delays. Lives are changed and lost, which makes this innovation personal for Mulligan. “A friend of mine, young Liam Haywood, was killed in such a situation,” Mulligan recounted in a video by Wavetronix, the intelligent signal’s manufacturer. “He was on a motorbike and a motor car just turned left in front of him and killed him and snuffed out a young, talented life at 20 years old.” Mulligan then fought tears, saying, “And that provided us the motivation to do something about it.” He calls the technology “Liam’s Light” and hopes there will be many more adaptors like Peachtree Corners.

Mulligan acknowledges that some cities embrace these innovations easier than others, and he credits several Atlanta suburbs — Alpharetta, Marietta, and Peachtree Corners, among others — for taking the risk and spending the money to see if this paradigm shift works.

“You need early-adopter cities; you need forward-leaning cities,” Mulligan said. These cities are more willing to take risks on these technologies — some would call these experiments — in the name of safety and traffic efficiency. When more rigid municipalities see the case studies work, they have hard data to show the innovations are worth implementing.

“You’d be amazed how much resistance you get from the guys that have been doing the same things for 40 years,” Mulligan said.

Mulligan and his associates continue finding the next safety frontiers, despite any headwinds: “We just keep pushing forward. We only know one way and that is to put our head down and push forward.”

He’d just taken a helmet-to-helmet hit from 232-pound linebacker Dennis Gardeck. The crowd, dominated by 49ers fans, tried to rally Purdy by chanting his name.

Was he knocked out? Did his surgically repaired elbow get wrecked? Was the 49ers’ season in peril?

Purdy would miss only three snaps because of a nerve stinger in his left shoulder, and he’d finish off that same drive with one of his four touchdown passes en route to a 45-29 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.

The 49ers (11-3) thus clinched their second straight NFC West title and their 23rd division crown in franchise history. They remain in position for the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed with three regular-season games to go, their next being on Christmas next Monday night against the Baltimore Ravens at Levi’s Stadium.

When Purdy’s fourth touchdown pass found Deebo Samuel on a 17-yarder to the front left pylon, offensive linemen gave Purdy a group hug, and then right guard Jon Feliciano pretended to brush dirt off Purdy’s back from the second-quarter injury scare.

Purdy, who grew up some 45 miles away in Queen Creek, totaled 242 yards in adding to his NFL MVP candidacy. He wasn’t the only star of this season-high point total, however.

Christian McCaffrey scored three touchdowns, ran for 115 yards, and had five catches for 72 yards. His scoring hat trick raised his season total to 20 touchdowns, including four against the Cardinals in a 35-16 home win Oct. 1. McCaffrey, who appeared to battle a cranky right knee Sunday, is three touchdowns shy of Jerry Rice’s single-season franchise record, set in 1997.

The 49ers never relinquished the lead once Charvarius Ward’s 66-yard pick-six put them ahead 14-7 in the first quarter. Another interception by Ward, with some six minutes left, helped seal the deal, as the 49ers sent in Sam Darnold to replace Purdy under much different circumstances than that second-quarter sequence.

The last-place Cardinals (3-11) proved pesky from the outset, jumping out to a 7-0 lead and running for more yards than any 49ers’ opponent since 2017. They continuously tested a 49ers defense that was missing interior linemen Javon Hargrave and Arik Armstead.

Arizona, however, often settled for field goals while the 49ers’ toy shop kept producing touchdowns.

Anything that unfolded at State Farm Stadium would have seemed so inconsequential had Purdy sustained a serious injury, similar to last season’s NFC Championship Game loss in Philadelphia, where he hurt his elbow.

This injury scare came when Purdy stepped up in the pocket to avoid two defenders, and just as he flipped a 9-yard completion to Kyle Juszczyk, Gardeck’s facemask collided with Purdy’s. After a couple of minutes on the grass, Purdy walked with the 49ers’ medical staff to a sideline medical tent for further evaluation, and Darnold took the next three snaps.

Once Purdy returned with 2:55 until halftime, the 49ers didn’t skip a beat. Purdy threw a 6-yard completion to Samuel, then deftly tossed a third-and-2 pass to George Kittle, whose 1-handed catch brought the 49ers to the 6-yard line. McCaffrey followed with a 1-yard run before his 5-yard scoring catch. Purdy pumped his right fist, strolled to the sideline to exchange high-fives, then took a seat on the bench to review video. It was business as usual, with a 21-13 lead only 1:14 before halftime.

And Purdy kept producing. He did, however, fall short of matching Joe Montana’s record of eight straight games with a 70-percent completion rate; Purdy was 16-of-25 (64%) with a 153.3 passer rating.

His third touchdown pass (41 yards) came as he escaped to his left and found a wide open McCaffrey, who backpedaled about 10 yards and fell down catching the ball at the 10-yard line. McCaffrey got up and scored his second touchdown for a 28-13 lead. On the previous play, Purdy beat the Cardinals’ bitz with a third-and-11 dime to Kittle for a 35-yard catch-and-run.

In between those two touchdown passes, an area of concern resurfaced: Ronnie Bell appeared to fumble a punt return and the Cardinals returned that loose ball for an apparent score 53 seconds before halftime. A replay review nullified that touchdown and deemed Bell down by contact before any fumble.

The Cardinals went over the 200-yard rushing mark Sunday when Emari Demercado scored on a 49-yard run, cutting the 49ers’ lead to 35-22, with 11:30 remaining. The 49ers hadn’t allowed so many rushing yards since the Cowboys racked up 265 in October 2017. Arizona finished with 234 yards on 30 carries.

Each team opened with a 75-yard touchdown drive, and the 49ers’ score came in glaring fashion when Purdy found a wide open Samuel for a 12-yard, game-tying catch. Samuel went in low-key motion to the left, and no Cardinals defender followed him on the play, which came after McCaffrey’s 26-yard run to the Cardinals’ 12. It was the 49ers’ ninth touchdown on an opening possession this season, and it was Samuel’s seventh touchdown in four games.

The 49ers surrendered an opening-drive touchdown for a second straight game, with James Conner doing the honors in this one via a 2-yard run past Javon Kinlaw up the middle. It was no surprise the Cardinals attacked the interior. Kinlaw and Kevin Givens started in place of Armstead and Hargrave; backup Kalia Davis left in the first half with an ankle injury.

Conner left with 86 yards, extending the 49ers’ streak to 41 consecutive games without allowing a 100-yard rusher. Kyler Murray (26-of-39, 211 yards) didn’t throw a touchdown pass until the final minute, to Elijah Higgins. The Cardinals repeatedly attacked the middle of a 49ers defense clearly missing Hargrave and Armstead, but sloppy tackling and loose containment on the edge also impacted things.

14,,,A Tesla Cybertruck gets stuck in California forest. Let the trolling begin,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-17/tesla-gets-trolled-by-forest-service,"After a video of a Tesla Cybertruck sliding down a snowy embankment with a Christmas tree tied to its roof went viral on social media last week, the U.S. Forest Service saw a golden opportunity.

The agency could use the resulting internet imbroglio to educate people about the best practices for off-road vehicles on public lands.

In a move that Forest Service spokesman Benjamin Cossel allowed was “a little bit cheeky,” the Stanislaus National Forest issued a news release offering to partner with Tesla on “an education campaign regarding off-road vehicle use on public lands.”

“We are always thrilled when new opportunities to explore our public lands become available,” Stanislaus National Forest Supervisor Jason Kuiken said in the release. “But we feel there may be work to be done in educating users about our Motor Vehicle Use Maps.”

Tesla has, so far, not responded, officials said. A request for comment to Tesla from The Times was also not answered Sunday.

The partnership offer came after a Tesla Cybertruck apparently lost traction and slid — a Christmas tree still jauntily attached to the roof — down an embankment off a well-known Off Highway Vehicle area in the Calaveras Ranger District. The Cybertruck was eventually rescued by a Ford truck, officials said.

“We feel confident that had the driver of the Cybertruck had a better understanding of the topographical feature indicated on our maps, practiced Leave No Trace principles, and generally been more prepared, this whole incident could have been not only avoided, but also provided much-needed education to many new off-road users,” officials said in the release.

The first Cybertrucks hit the streets a few weeks ago after being mired by production delays and questions about its design. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, called it “the most unique thing on the road.” Musk said the truck has the handling and speed of a sports car, with a towing capacity of 11,000 pounds and a 340-mile estimated range.

“Finally, the future will look like the future,” he said.",
15,,,Pomona church lost to fire that also burned hundreds of toys meant for giveaway,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-17/pomona-church-goes-up-in-flames-burning-hundreds-of-toys-for-children,"Victory Outreach Church in Pomona erupted in flames around 2:45 a.m. Sunday, resulting in a total loss of the structure built in 1981.

When Victory Outreach Church in Pomona went up in flames early Sunday morning, incinerating the church building along with more than 500 toys set to be given away later in the day , it didn’t take long for the spirit of Christmas to sweep through the community.

The Los Angeles County Fire Department sent 100 firefighters to fight the blaze and then to knock down walls, stamping out hot spots. But before the smoke had even cleared, fire officials hatched a plan to send two Search and Rescue trucks loaded with toys to the disaster site later in the day.

And after news of the disaster spread, all morning long, members of the community converged on the site with donated toys.

“We have to help save Christmas for this congregation,” said L.A. County Fire Captain Sheila Kelliher-Burkoh. “We know the building isn’t the church. The church is in the hearts of these people and we’re here to help.”

The blaze ignited a little after 2 a.m., burning so fiercely in the building’s attic that firefighters had to retreat. No one was injured, but when the flames were finally out, the building was gone, along with 500 toys the congregation had painstakingly collected for children in need. “That is the horrible timing of this one,” Kelliher-Burkoh said.

Officials at the L.A. County Fire department quickly decided they could help. The department, in conjunction with ABC7-TV, collects toys all season for the needy, storing them in a giant warehouse in Vernon before distributing them. As firefighters sent giant machines through the smoldering site to make it safe, officials back at headquarters made plans to dispatch two trucks’ worth of toys to the church by 5 p.m.

“We’re still going to do what we intended to do,” said Jose Montiel, a congregant who, along with his wife, Lourdes, helped organize the toy drive and signed up more than 600 needy families.

Meanwhile, all across Pomona and beyond, members of the community heard about the disaster and rushed to Victory Outreach to save the holiday for the church’s children.

Around 11 a.m., Steve Ybarra arrived at the scene of the disaster with a pickup truck stuffed with presents. Ybarra is a pastor of the nearby Abundant Living Family Church. His congregation held their toy drive a day earlier, he said, and had some leftover gifts. When he heard about the fire, he said, “it broke my heart.”

A few minutes later, another woman from the neighborhood, Carole Glass, walked up holding a toy to contribute — a stuffed dragon. “It’s more important to give to someone who really needs it,” she said.

Behind them stood the ruined church. At the spot where the door used to be, one element had survived: A small Christmas tree in a golden pot that somehow escaped the flames.

17,,,California prepares to transform sewage into pure drinking water under new rules,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-12-17/california-sewage-potable-reuse,"California is set to adopt regulations that will allow for sewage to be extensively treated, transformed into pure drinking water and delivered directly to people’s taps.

The regulations are expected to be approved Tuesday by the State Water Resources Control Board, enabling water suppliers to begin building advanced treatment plants that will turn wastewater into a source of clean drinking water.

The new rules represent a major milestone in California’s efforts to stretch supplies by recycling more of the water that flows down drains.

“We’re creating a new source of supply that we were previously discharging or thinking of as waste,” said Heather Cooley, director of research at the Pacific Institute, a water think tank in Oakland. “As we look to make our communities more resilient to drought, to climate change, this is really going to be an important part of that solution.”

Water agencies in many areas of California have been treating and reusing wastewater for decades, often piping effluent for outdoor irrigation or to facilities where treated water soaks into the ground to replenish aquifers.

The regulations will enable what’s known as “direct potable reuse,” putting highly treated water straight into the drinking-water system or mixing it with other supplies.

Cooley and other water experts say it’s inaccurate to call this “toilet to tap,” a term that was popularized in the 1990s by opponents of plans to use recycled water for replenishing groundwater in the San Gabriel Valley. They say the sewage undergoes an extremely sophisticated treatment process, and scientific research has shown that the highly purified water is safe to drink.

“This is really about recovering resources, not wasting precious resources,” Cooley said. “This is really, I think, an exciting opportunity for helping to realize that vision of a more circular sort of approach for water.”

The process of developing the regulations, which was required under legislation, has taken state regulators more than a decade. It included a review by a panel of experts.

“We wanted to absolutely make sure that we put public health first priority, so that the public had confidence,” said Darrin Polhemus, deputy director of the State Water Board’s Division of Drinking Water.

“We have a very thorough set of regulations,” Polhemus said. “It has broad support, and we think we’ve gotten it to a point where everybody is comfortable with what it presents.”

Building plants to purify wastewater is expensive, and it’s likely to be years before any Californians are drinking the treated water. But Los Angeles, San Diego and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California are all planning to pursue direct potable reuse as part of ongoing investments in recycling more wastewater.

The regulations detail requirements for infrastructure, treatment technologies and monitoring, Polhemus said, and ensure “triple redundancy for each of the areas we’re treating for,” including bacteria and viruses, as well as chemicals.

The water will go through various stages of treatment, passing through activated carbon filters and reverse-osmosis membranes, as well as undergoing disinfection with UV light, among other treatments.

The regulations require such thorough purification that at the end of the process, minerals will need to be added back to achieve a taste and chemistry resembling typical drinking water.

“This will be by far the most well-treated, highest-quality water served to the public,” Polhemus said. “It’s an incredible amount of treatment.”

Once the regulations are approved by the State Water Board, they need to be approved by the Office of Administrative Law; this is expected to happen next year.

The treatment technology is similar to the process used for desalinating seawater, but recycling wastewater requires less energy and is less costly than turning saltwater into freshwater. Polhemus said the costs for purifying wastewater will probably be about half those of desalinating ocean water.

Direct potable reuse has for years been a strategy in other water-scarce parts of the world, including Namibia and Singapore. Some communities in Texas are also doing it. Colorado has rules in place allowing potable reuse, while Arizona and Florida are developing regulations.

In California, some agencies have for years been conducting indirect potable reuse, in which highly treated water is used to replenish groundwater and is later pumped out, treated and delivered as drinking water.

Orange County, for example, has its Groundwater Replenishment System, the world’s largest project of its kind . The system purifies wastewater using a three-step advanced treatment process, and the water then percolates and is injected into the groundwater basin, where it becomes part of the supply.

While Orange County plans to stick with indirect potable reuse, Polhemus said, other water districts are looking at direct reuse as an approach that saves costs by using existing infrastructure rather than building separate systems for recycled water.

This strategy also offers cities and agencies a new route for reducing reliance on imported supplies and scaling up the use of recycled water — a source that managers view as relatively drought-proof.

“Our communities are always going to generate wastewater, even in the worst drought. And having this available can really augment that supply and add resiliency,” Polhemus said.

Recycling more wastewater brings other environmental benefits, reducing the amount of treated effluent that flows into coastal waters.

“It’s easier on the environment you’re taking the water from, it’s easier on the environment you’re discharging it to and sets us up to be better stewards of our environment overall,” Polhemus said.

The complexity and costs of the treatment plants mean that large, well-funded agencies will adopt the technology first, Polhemus said. Direct potable reuse also is suited to coastal areas, he said, because the reverse-osmosis treatment, like a desalination plant, generates brine that can be discharged offshore.

As for how much purified water might be used, if some coastal communities are able to get 10%-15% of their supply from treated wastewater during a drought, that would represent a significant improvement in diversifying supplies, Polhemus said.

“Someday, it could be 25% to 40% of some communities’ water supply,” Polhemus said. “At some point, we could recycle the majority of wastewater that now flows to the ocean just as treated wastewater.”

The Metropolitan Water District plans to start direct potable reuse as part of its Pure Water Southern California project, building a $6-billion facility in Carson that is slated to become the country’s largest water-recycling project.

It’s scheduled to deliver its first treated water as soon as 2028. Initially, the district says, the supplies will be used largely to replenish groundwater basins for later use, with some also going to serve oil refineries and other industrial users.

By 2032, MWD officials plan to be producing 115 million gallons of purified water a day. Of that, they expect to send 25 million gallons per day to a plant in La Verne to be mixed with other supplies from the Colorado River and Northern California, and delivered as drinking water throughout the region — an amount that’s projected to increase to 60 million gallons a day once the facility is operating at its full capacity of 150 million gallons .

Depending on how wet or dry a year is, the district will be able to store more water in aquifers or send more purified water directly into the distribution system, said Deven Upadhyay, the MWD’s executive officer and assistant general manager.

“We’re building that flexibility into the design of this program,” Upadhyay said. “If you needed to push more into direct potable reuse, you would be able to do that and back off of your deliveries to the groundwater basins.”

He said that flexibility is valuable as California deals with more extreme droughts fueled by climate change.

“Our view is that over time, those imported supplies will decline. And we want to take the water that is used, and reuse it as much as possible, and try to close that cycle of water use,” Upadhyay said. “Because it’s such a drought-proof supply, it really creates another degree of resilience for us.”

The Metropolitan Water District functions as Southern California’s wholesaler, delivering supplies to cities and agencies that serve 19 million people in six counties.

About 450,000 acre-feet of wastewater is now recycled in Metropolitan’s service area, an amount equivalent to the water use of about 1.3 million households.

The MWD’s recycling project, as well as Los Angeles’ Operation Next and San Diego’s Pure Water , will dramatically increase the use of recycled water once they are built out, Upadhyay said.

“We should expect a doubling of recycled water that Southern California is producing and drinking by the time those three projects are completed,” Upadhyay said.

And part of that will come thanks to the state’s new regulations that enable direct reuse, he said.

“It’s a major milestone for the state,” Upadhyay said. “This is going to lead to water agencies throughout the state starting to plan for potable reuse projects in a way that results in a more resilient California water future.”

In the Bay Area, the Santa Clara Valley Water District also plans to pursue potable reuse.

In a study last year, researchers at the Pacific Institute said California recycles about 23% of its municipal wastewater and has the potential to more than triple the amount that is recycled and reused.

Cooley said some portion of that will come through direct reuse where it pencils out for communities.

“It’s just part of the puzzle in terms of helping us to realize the full potential for recycled water,” Cooley said. “This is an important piece of helping make our communities more resilient.”

There has been growing public acceptance of recycling water as people have experienced more severe droughts and seen recycling projects expand, Cooley said.

Still, she said, acceptance isn’t universal, and “it’s important to really address openly concerns that people have as communities consider this as an option.”

She said reusing more water is one strategy that California should adopt, along with capturing more stormwater and improving efficiency.

Peter Gleick, the Pacific Institute’s co-founder and president emeritus, pointed out that the water-recycling technologies in use today are fundamentally the same approaches used by astronauts on the International Space Station.

“It’s not toilet to tap,” Gleick said, adding that it’s better described as “toilet to an unbelievably sophisticated system that produces incredibly pure water to tap.”

In his book “The Three Ages of Water,” Gleick wrote that reusing water provides a valuable new supply and should be part of a set of solutions for long-term sustainability.

“High-quality water produced from wastewater is an asset,” Gleick wrote. “We have the ability and technology to produce incredibly clean water from any quality of wastewater, and we should rapidly expand the capacity to do so.”",
18,,,"After Monterey Park shooting, pastor tried to de-stigmatize therapy for Asian immigrants",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-17/he-worked-as-a-pastor-in-san-gabriel-when-the-monterey-park-shooting-happened-he-sprung-into-action,"Eric Chen never met Yu Lun Kao. But in February, he helped bury the 72-year-old ballroom dancer known to his friends as “Mr. Nice.”

Kao, who went by Andy, was shielding his longtime dance partner from the hail of bullets when he was killed during the shooting at Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park. He’d been a fixture in the dance community since immigrating from Taiwan two decades ago.

Chen is a Taiwanese pastor in San Gabriel. His mother worked for Kao’s older brother and sister-in-law in the 1990s, which made the Jan. 21 Monterey Park massacre “not just news you read about.”

“It felt surreal that a tragedy like this would affect a family that I’ve known for 30 years,” Chen told The Times. “That’s where the tragedy hits even closer to home.”

After the shooting, Chen served as the liaison among Kao’s family, U.S. Rep. Judy Chu’s office and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles. Chu and Taiwanese Director General Amino Chi spoke at Kao’s funeral.

Can a play solve the mystery of the Monterey Park mass shooter? Survivors aren’t sure When mass shooters die, all answers die with them. Which means survivors of the Lunar New Year shooting in Monterey Park are struggling to make sense of the tragedy.

So did Chen, who translated the funeral sermon from Chinese to English and brought Kao’s old friends to tears.

“I want to exhort all of us, including myself, to take advantage of every opportunity available to spread this peace and shalom so that the hatred that caused the tragedy in Monterey Park will dissipate all around us,” Chen told the mourners.

Chen first got involved in the San Gabriel Valley dance community in December 2021, when a friend, who was active in the Latin dance scene, wanted to rent out Star Ballroom for a dance social.

Chen’s friend was hitting resistance because Maria Liang, the owner of the dance studio, was concerned the dancers would trash the place. Chen got involved and spoke with her in Mandarin to persuade her to rent out the venue.

Chen danced at Star a few more times over the years and was added to a WeChat group with several hundred others in the region’s dance community.

He had planned to go to the Lunar New Year festival in Monterey Park and then attend the party at Star Dance. But his girlfriend wanted to eat some hot pot in San Gabriel instead, so they shifted gears.

That night, messages started pouring into the WeChat group. It was how Chen learned that there had been a shooting.

Chen posted information from social media or local politicians into the group chat. He helped survivors get their belongings back, the car keys and passports they’d abandoned at Star Dance when they fled to safety.

Chen saw that the Langley Senior Citizen Center had been set up as a resource center for victims, but that the information wasn’t being offered in other languages online. So he translated it from English to Chinese and directed survivors to the center.

“I tried to be that glue, because as you know, it’s an immigrant community,” he said. “There’s a language barrier so I was just trying to bridge that gap.”

Chen was the thread that connected the group of about 40 survivors with representatives from the county, the state and even the White House. During President Biden’s visit to Monterey Park, Chen helped reach out to survivors and families of the deceased to make sure they were invited.

Chen saw a gap between what service providers were offering and what the victims could navigate. Survivors were trying to get money from the California Victim Compensation Board, the agency that provides up to $70,000 to victims of violence. Victims have to fill out forms that include proof of crime-related expenses such as mental health treatment, income loss or job training.

But some of the survivors had trouble figuring out how to do that.

Chen tried to help the survivors as best he could by answering their questions, providing translation and helping them get the necessary paperwork for compensation.

“You’re already going through this trauma,” Chen said.”The last thing you need is for them to try to get all the paperwork and try to call the doctors and say, ‘Hey do you have my confirmation that I was shot in the leg?’”

Chen also met Lloyd Gock, who survived the massacre, through the WeChat group. Right after the shooting, Gock called Chen, saying that he was having nightmares and couldn’t sleep. He texted Chen throughout the night, until 2 or 3 a.m. Chen was there for Gock during the immediate crisis but also stressed that he isn’t a licensed clinician. He encouraged Gock to go to the Langley Center to seek professional help.

Gock went to a few counseling sessions at first, but eventually stopped, he told The Times. He said he wants to go back because he’s “quietly traumatized” by what happened. Life after the tragedy hasn’t been the same.

Sometimes, Gock said, he will forget to lock his door or drive to a restaurant and accidentally leave his car engine on. Other times, he’ll feel afraid to walk through the parking lot back to his house because it’s dark. He lost motivation to work and his clothing company suffered.

“The things that have to do with my business, have to do with my memory, sometimes my temper. I’m not that great,” he said. “I end up picking up fights with people. I get irritated very easily. And I’m sure that has something to do with it.”

California Authorities identify 72-year-old man as suspected gunman in Lunar New Year mass shooting A deadly mass shooting inside a Monterey Park dance studio led authorities to Torrance on Sunday, where the suspected gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a strip mall parking lot.

Chen’s main focus has been on de-stigmatizing mental health for older Asian immigrants. He and Gock started a monthly support group for survivors. The first meeting took place in April.

The survivors have opened up about what happened to them. Some say they’re still struggling with trauma but have gone back to dancing. Others prefer to go on walks or to the gym to stay active. Some don’t say much at all.

“We were able to create a space for people to share and to talk about whatever it is they want to talk about,” Chen said. “In that sense, it’s a formation of a new family, a new community in and of itself.”

The group hasn’t met since the summer, but Chen is hoping to set up another meeting in the next few weeks to celebrate Christmas, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the shooting.

Chen helped organize a Feb. 3 news conference with nonprofit organizations, such as Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-based Violence, Family Keepers and Love and Conflict Peacemaking Ministries. He invited Chu’s office and had psychologists and attorneys speak. The event, called “Reflection on the Chinese American Shooting Incident,” was held at the SunnyDay Adult Day Health Care in El Monte.

“I think that as a pastor in the community who spoke Chinese, he could reach some people that would otherwise have been reluctant to talk about the trauma that they’ve gone through,” Rep. Chu said. “They weren’t reaching out to people, they kept to themselves and it took them a while to recognize that they really needed to talk to others about their situation.”

Chen has persuaded some of the survivors to go to counseling by saying that, if they want to apply for compensation or if there’s ever a lawsuit, they need to prove they were traumatized.

“It’s a year later and the cameras are gone for the most part, but the recovery for the people directly affected by it, it’s gonna take years and years and years to walk alongside them,” he said. “This is something that’s going to affect people for the rest of their lives.”

Chen has been trying to take his own advice and has dialed back his involvement in the community for the sake of his mental health. He said he “hit a wall” about a month ago and felt overwhelmed.

Chen is still getting himself out of it. To unwind, he bought a season pass to Magic Mountain. He’s been to one therapy session and even that, he said, took a lot of his energy.

“I’m in the situation,” he said, “where I’ve come to realize I’ve experienced vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue and burnout.”",

No thanks, say Nevada Democrats, who have a big voice in 2024",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-12-17/newsom-challenge-biden-democrats-president-primary-nevada,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been touted as a possible replacement for President Biden on the 2024 Democratic ticket. But the idea was a nonstarter among Democrats in next-door Nevada.

When David Mulcrone looks to the 2024 presidential race, he’s filled with a combination of resignation and determination.

Gay and Latino, he no longer feels comfortable in Donald Trump’s Republican Party. So he’ll vote for President Biden if that’s what it takes to keep Trump out of the White House a second time — even though Mulcrone is not terribly enthused about the prospect.

“Too old,” Mulcrone said of the 81-year-old incumbent. But then again, “Democrats didn’t put themselves in a position to put anyone else forward.”

In an alternative universe — one where things like money, filing deadlines and other practicalities don’t matter — there is wishful talk of a late entry in the Democratic contest, a savior to swoop in and electrify the party with a jolt of energy and passion.

Someone like, say, Gavin Newsom.

California’s 56-year-old governor has repeatedly, adamantly insisted he has no plans whatsoever to challenge the president.

Still, the talk of a 2024 candidacy persists, fueled not just by Newsom’s words and deeds — a snarky debate with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, turns on the national and international stages — but also the chatter of political gossips and frustration of Democrats despairing over Biden’s reelection bid.

If you ignored Newsom’s protestations and looked for a place he might launch an insurgent campaign, next-door Nevada and its early primary would seem a good place to start.

But Mulcrone wants no part of that scenario.

And he’s not alone among fellow Democrats regarding California as more of a curse than a cure for their political anxieties.

“The last time I was in San Francisco was about five years ago,” Mulcrone, 52, said as he led his three pet beagles on a walk in Green Valley, a well-to-do Las Vegas suburb.

Mulcrone, who works in sales, recalled stepping from his car and immediately being hit with a pungent whiff of urine rising from the street. He blamed Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor, for the city’s decay.

“I think his policies were too liberal and that kind of laid the foundation for why S.F. is the mess it is now,” Mulcrone said. “I don’t care if I ever set foot there again.”

Michele Hoffman shared his political sentiments.

She voted for Biden in 2020 and appreciates him “keeping the country on an even keel.” But Hoffman would have preferred Biden not seek reelection — again, because of the incumbent’s advanced age.

At this point, however, she sees no viable alternative to the president — and can’t imagine Newsom replacing Biden atop the Democratic ticket.

“He’s got that California stigma,” said Hoffman, 66, who retired to Henderson after working 30 years at a university in Kansas. “I’m from Missouri, from a very conservative area, and I don’t think he would get the support from the rest of the country that he would need to beat Joe Biden.”

Nevada is poised to play a major role in 2024 as one of a handful of battlegrounds that will decide the presidential race. Before that, it will be the first Western state to weigh in on the Democratic nomination.

New Hampshire votes on Jan. 23, though Biden has kept his name off the ballot to boost the import of subsequent states. South Carolina, which salvaged Biden’s candidacy in 2020, will follow on Feb 3. Nevada votes three days later.

But the place is not exactly teeming with Newsom supporters.

In nearly three dozen interviews with voters in and around Las Vegas, the election epicenter where most Nevada voters live, not one of them mentioned California’s governor as a substitute for Biden.

(There was also no clamor for Vice President Kamala Harris to step in as the Democratic nominee. “I just don’t think she’s been the strong presence that I envisioned,” said Hoffman, who backed Harris’ 2020 presidential bid.)

Biden had his defenders.

Ian Flashner, a Las Vegas Democrat, said too much has been made of the president’s age.

“I understand why people have concerns, but the guy’s getting the job done,” said Flashner, 52, who makes his living selling grocery store equipment. “If he was 10 years younger, no one would say a word.”

Most, however, were like Courtney Pruitt.

The 35-year-old Democrat voted for Biden in 2020 — “Trump made it easy” — but would prefer a nominee in 2024 who is younger and more vibrant. “He just doesn’t seem like he’s doing anything,” she said of the president.

Newsom is nowhere on her list of possibilities.

Pruitt often visits Los Angeles for business — she sells vintage antiques in Las Vegas — and the state’s extended pandemic lockdown soured her on California’s governor.

“He really screwed over a lot of people,” said Pruitt, who is leaning toward Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist mounting an independent — and decidedly long-shot — bid for the White House.

Democrat Cindy Manchee thought Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, would make a fine replacement for Biden: “She’s middle of the road, she understands there needs to be give and take.” But, alas, Manchee lamented, it’s too late for that to happen.

The 65-year-old retiree moved to Henderson about 10 years ago from the San Francisco Bay Area. Manchee misses California; on a chilly afternoon she wore a blue fleece with “Monterey” stitched on the front.

But she doesn’t miss the taxes and high cost of California living, and considers Newsom too liberal to win the White House. Besides, Manchee said, “I don’t think he’s done that great a job” as governor.

Not surprisingly, Republicans had even less use for Newsom.

The sun was setting as Tim Foley stopped by the post office in Spring Valley, a multiracial community five miles west of the Las Vegas Strip, where earth-movers and other heavy equipment mark development’s relentless march through the desert.

Foley, 49, considers Biden “horrendous” but said Newsom was even worse.

“Biden’s not running the country,” said Foley, who owns a Las Vegas healthcare firm. “They parade him around and there’s a group of people who are making decisions for him. Newsom has his own ideas, which is scarier to me.”

There were a few fans of the governor.

One of them was Brian V., 41, who manages a chain retailer at an upscale Henderson shopping mall. (He declined to give his last name, to avoid hassle for sharing his political views.)

“I love Gavin Newsom,” Brian said during a vape-and-coffee break. “He’s young. He’s intelligent. He’s done a lot of great things for California.”

But that doesn’t mean he wants him to step in for Biden on the Democratic ticket.

“We’re already a little too late into that game,” Brian said. “We need to rally behind Joe Biden, get him reelected, so that we can stave off another four years of potentially going into a fascist state.”

A few shoppers trickled past, as Christmas music played from speakers tucked amid the palm trees and agave.

Maybe 2028 will be Newsom’s time. Maybe not.

“Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Gavin Newsom,” Brian said, ticking off the Democrats he might consider for president.

All sorts of choices. Just not now.",
20,,,Environmentalists investing in Big Oil? Inside the surprising stock portfolios of California lawmakers,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-17/environmentalists-investing-in-big-oil-how-california-lawmakers-stocks-dont-align-with-their-politics,"Environmentalists with stock in oil companies. A vocal social media critic with hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in the owners of Facebook and YouTube. Union-backed Democrats making money off the very companies whose worker policies they’ve criticized.

A third of the members in the California Legislature collectively reported at least $14 million worth of investments on their most recent financial disclosures — but their stocks don’t always align with their political values, a Times analysis found.

Their collective holdings could total tens of millions of dollars more, but exact amounts are unclear because financial disclosure forms required by the state allow politicians to report a wide range of minimum and maximum fair market values.

Elected officials and other public employees who influence government decisions are required to report investments including stocks, bonds and business partnerships, along with income, properties and gifts they’ve accepted on annual statements of economic interests. Diversified investments, such as certain retirement accounts and mutual funds, are not required to be disclosed.

The requirement is meant to hold officials accountable for any potential conflicts of interest and to ensure their decisions are “in the best interest of the public and not enhancing their personal finances,” according to the California Fair Political Practices Commission , the state’s political ethics watchdog.

But it also reveals when officials’ financial investments run counter to their purported political mission or differ from how they represented themselves to voters during their campaigns.

Democratic state Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, for instance, has a record as an environmentalist but owns stock in major oil, chemical and mining companies that have been criticized for their contributions to climate change. Her colleague Assemblymember Josh Lowenthal (D-Long Beach) has publicly criticized social media platforms for being harmful to children, and wrote legislation aimed at addressing their potential mental health risks. Yet he invests in the companies that own Instagram and YouTube.

That’s not illegal, but it raises questions about why some officials manage their personal finances in ways that clash with their public positions. In these cases, lawmakers are often voting for policies that go against their personal financial interests. While some voters may see them taking a principled stance, others see hypocrisy.

“A lot of these people tell their constituents what they think they want to hear even if they don’t necessarily believe in it or they’re not doing necessarily what’s in the best interest of the public, but themselves,” said Sean McMorris, who focuses on transparency, ethics and accountability at California Common Cause, a government watchdog group.

The Times analysis also found that some legislators are invested in companies that could be affected by the laws they influence and vote on.

According to the most recent financial disclosures, 40 of California’s 120 state lawmakers reported at least $2,000 in investments in 2022 — about 30% of Democrats and about 46% of Republicans. Data on lawmakers’ finances were collected by CalMatters, a nonpartisan nonprofit news outlet, and analyzed by The Times.

All the lawmakers contacted by The Times defended their investments and said they do not weaken their policy stance related to the industries they hold stock in or create conflicts of interest. Many pinned the investments on their spouses.

Federal legislation has been introduced that would ban members of Congress from trading stocks, though no such law has been pitched in California, home to one of the largest economies in the world. In 2020, U.S. representatives who were privy to COVID-19 information ahead of the general public faced backlash for selling stocks just before the virus slammed the economy.

Politics Support grows for limiting Congress members’ ability to own stocks Dozens of lawmakers have come out in support of competing but similar bills that would limit their ability to hold or trade stocks while in office.

Delaney Marsco, senior legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, which supports legislation to ban members of Congress from trading stocks, said investments by state lawmakers should be scrutinized too.

“Individual stock holdings can absolutely, regardless of what level of government you’re in, cause those conflicts of interest that raise serious problems with the public’s trust in government,” Marsco said.

Disclosing investments also shows voters if lawmakers are “essentially putting their money where their mouth is,” she said.

Democrats and Big Oil

Assemblymember Pellerin (D-Santa Cruz) was endorsed by environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club when she was elected last year, heralded for her climate policy goals, including a commitment to end the state’s dependence on fossil fuels.

“A vote for Gail Pellerin is a vote for the environment,” Clean Water Action California said in an endorsement in 2022.

But among the roughly $2 million the freshman lawmaker has invested in stocks are holdings in several oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell, according to financial disclosure forms.

California filed a lawsuit against those companies this year, alleging that they have led a “campaign of deception” about their role in climate change and the environmental risks of fossil fuels.

According to state disclosure forms, Pellerin also has invested at least $10,000 in Freeport-McMoRan, a metal mining company that was fined millions of dollars by the federal government after an Arizona copper mine allegedly polluted rivers and streams.

Another $10,000 or more is invested in Dow Chemical Co., which manufactured napalm used as a weapon by the U.S. in the Vietnam War and urged the Trump administration to ignore findings that its pesticides are harmful to endangered species.

Pellerin is the only California lawmaker who invests in Philip Morris, the tobacco maker that manufactures Marlboro cigarettes, according to financial disclosure records. Oil and tobacco companies are viewed as so anathema to California Democrats’ agenda that party leaders have in some years prohibited donations from them .

When asked about her stock portfolio, Pellerin said her husband, who died in 2018, was an “avid investor.”

“I vote with only one interest, and that is for what is best for the constituents of the 28th Assembly District,” Pellerin said in a statement, pointing to her support for environmental legislation this year, including a bill that increased penalties against oil and gas companies that violate regulations.

Pellerin pointed out that companies she invests in, including Exxon and Chevron, recently received positive environmental, social and governance scores, an index used by investors to evaluate stocks.

“With my financial advisor, I continue to align these investments with my values,” said Pellerin, who chaired the committee on natural resources and the water, parks and wildlife committee until last month and has written bills that established California Ocean Day and supported environmental restoration projects .

Sen. Richard Roth (D-Riverside) also invests in oil and gas companies. According to his 2022 filings, he has at least $730,000 in investments, including thousands in Chevron and Phillips66, a Texas energy company that paid millions to settle a lawsuit that alleged its gas stations violated California’s anti-pollution laws.

Roth, who declined to comment for this story, also invests tens of thousands more in NuStar, one of the largest petroleum pipeline operators in the nation, and HF Sinclair, which manufactures and sells gasoline and jet fuel.

Roth is a moderate Democrat with a mixed record on environmental legislation. He voted last year to speed up the state’s greenhouse gas reduction goals, which pleased environmentalists, but did not support a bill they championed this year to require corporations to report their climate impacts.

Mike Young, senior director of California Environmental Voters, which endorsed Pellerin last year, called for all lawmakers to divest from oil companies.

The organization supports a bill that aims to prohibit the state’s retirement systems from investing in fossil fuels. The expectation should be the same for elected officials, Young said.

“It certainly is our recommendation that everyone should divest away from fossil fuels however they can,” Young said. “The less hold that oil has, the better.”

Critics of Big Tech

The environment isn’t the only issue in which lawmakers’ investments seem to be at odds with their public-facing politics.

Assemblymember Lowenthal spoke passionately this summer about the harms of social media, telling lobbyists they should be ashamed for opposing legislation he supported to hold tech companies more accountable.

“I’ve seen in my children’s social media the presentation of diet pills, of other things that make them question their own self-worth and their own body image. I’ve seen it firsthand,” Lowenthal said at a hearing this summer. “It is totally and completely inappropriate.”

To opponents of attempts at social media regulation, he said, “Shame on you.”

However, Lowenthal himself has invested at least $100,000 in Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and at least another $100,000 in the company that owns YouTube.

“As a legislator, my job is to protect and improve the quality of life for all Californians. While as a shareholder, I and many other shareholders have exercised our responsibility to be vocal and use our positions to ensure the best product,” Lowenthal said in a statement, adding that he does not trade the stocks that he owns.

In November, California joined dozens of states in a lawsuit against Meta, with Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta alleging the company “designed and deployed harmful features” for youth.

Lowenthal wrote a bill this year that directs a commission to report a statewide strategy that would address the mental health risks of social media. He’s also supported proposals aimed at protecting young people on social media that the companies he’s personally financially invested in opposed.

Tech regulation is a perennial issue in the California Capitol, with companies frequently fighting lawmakers’ attempts to govern social media, data privacy and artificial intelligence. Yet Lowenthal is not the only legislator who owns tech stock.

Ten legislators collectively own at least $372,000 in Apple shares; four legislators collectively have invested at least $212,000 in Meta; and six legislators collectively own at least $118,000 in stock in Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, according to disclosure forms.

Labor-friendly Democrats

Perhaps no issue dominated this year’s legislative session more than worker rights, as strikes took off across many industries during what was coined as a “hot labor summer.”

But even vocal union-supporting Democrats in the state Capitol who were rallying alongside union leaders this year invest in some of the companies they have publicly criticized for their treatment of workers. That includes:

At least $1.2 million in Amazon stock collectively owned by seven lawmakers, including Democrats who voted for a 2021 law backed by unions to crack down on alleged quotas in the e-commerce company’s warehouses amid criticism that workers did not have time to take bathroom breaks. Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin (D-Thousand Oaks) owns at least $1 million in Amazon stock and voted for that legislation. The lawmaker, who was endorsed by some unions, said the stock was provided to her husband as part of his compensation when his former employer was acquired by Amazon. “My voting record and my long-standing support for and from unions speaks for itself,” she said in a statement.



At least $12,000 in McDonald’s stock owned by two Democrats, Roth and Pellerin, who voted for union-backed legislation to raise wages and improve conditions for fast-food workers, which the restaurants fiercely opposed.



to raise wages and improve conditions for fast-food workers, which the restaurants fiercely opposed. At least $100,000 in Disney shares owned by Sen. Anthony Portantino (D-Burbank), who wrote a controversial bill that would have allowed workers on strike to collect unemployment as the company battled with employees over pay and benefits. He marched alongside Hollywood actors and writers as they went on strike against Disney. The California Chamber of Commerce, whose board of directors includes a Disney executive, opposed the bill as a “job killer.” A spokesperson for Portantino said that the Disney stock was part of his wife’s compensation when she worked for the company years ago, and that the lawmaker “does not engage in the trading of stocks and rigorously follows all ethics and disclosure laws.”

Lawmakers who spoke to The Times for this article said that their investments do not negate their calls for change, and that their holdings do not influence their work in any way.

Instead, it’s their voting records that count, they said, including instances when they have pushed for policies in Sacramento that could be bad for the bottom line of the companies they’re invested in.

Although many lawmakers discounted their investments as their spouses’ and not their own, Ann Ravel, former chair of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, rejected that argument.

California is a “community property” state, which means any income is considered to be owned by both spouses equally.

“They have a self-interest in it,” Ravel said.

When do stocks pose a conflict?

Voters may be unhappy that some politicians hold investments inconsistent with their rhetoric or their party’s values, but it is not a crime.

A potential legal problem occurs, Ravel said, when the companies that lawmakers financially invest in are directly affected by the laws they help craft, and vice versa.

“That’s where the conflicts of interest arise, is when you’re investing in a particular company and then not only are you giving them money for the stock investments but you are also using that company for your own self-interest if you vote in favor of what they do,” Ravel said.

It’s difficult to determine what amounts to an explicit conflict of interest for lawmakers under the ethical guidelines laid out by the Fair Political Practices Commission.

Advertisement

The law defines a conflict of interest as a decision in which the financial impact or effect “is foreseeable” and is “significant enough to be considered material.” That includes when it comes to personal finances, including that of an official’s immediate family.

Some lawmakers own stock in companies that could be affected by legislation they have voted on or oversee committees in charge of decisions regarding those companies, The Times’ analysis found.

Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris (D-Irvine) has invested at least $100,000 in Comcast Corp., her only stock holding, according to disclosure forms. She was recently named the chair of the state Assembly’s Committee on Utilities and Energy, which oversees legislation related to the California Public Utilities Commission, the body in charge of regulating telecommunications companies such as Comcast.

In a statement, Petrie-Norris said her committee is unlikely to deal with any issues directly related to Comcast. Her husband works for a company that was acquired by Comcast, she said, “and was given stock as part of that acquisition.”

“I take my obligation as a State Assemblymember very seriously, and I would never allow a family member’s employment to influence my position on legislation,” Petrie-Norris said in a statement. “I will continue to recuse myself from voting on any legislation that specifically relates to Comcast.”

State Sen. Roger W. Niello (R-Fair Oaks) last year reported nearly $3.4 million in investments in dozens of companies in industries that include insurance, technology, banking, real estate and defense contractors.

He has voted against legislation aiming to tighten regulation of oil and gas companies, including attempts to penalize refineries and cap their profits , while investing tens of thousands of dollars in companies including Chevron and ConocoPhillips.

Niello said his holdings do not have any effect on how he votes on bills. His financial disclosure form shows that he sold many of his stocks in individual companies last year. Niello said he shifted most of his investments to professionally managed diverse portfolios, which do not require public disclosure because they are independently managed and do not focus on a specific industry.

“The complete pain in the neck of doing that [financial disclosure] report, the detail, gets to be just oppressive, number one,” Niello said as to why he made the shift. “And number two, to the extent that there’s any appearance of conflict, it helps to minimize that.”

Niello isn’t the first politician to move stock holdings to diversified accounts that don’t require detailed reporting to the public.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, who reported $1.7 million in income on recent tax disclosures, placed his financial investments in a blind trust in 2018 , a move sometimes used by public officials to shield them from any violations by limiting their knowledge of their own financial interests.

Concerns over public officials’ stocks have arisen in California before.

In 2001, when the state was hit with widespread power outages amid an electricity shortage, Gov. Gray Davis fired several consultants over conflict-of-interest concerns regarding their stock holdings in power companies.

That year, Steve Maviglio, a Democratic strategist in Sacramento who was serving as Davis’ spokesperson, sold his 300 shares of stock in a California power company over criticism that his ownership constituted a conflict of interest.

For public officials, “ignorance is bliss,” Maviglio said, pointing to mutual funds as a way to avoid conflict. Still, those funds could include investments that concern the public — they’re just not required to be reported in the way that stocks in individual companies are.

All that the public knows is what is reported on financial disclosure forms each year.

“In a perfect world, you’d practice what you preach with your own funds,” Maviglio said.

“But it’s not like they’re trying to hide the ball. They’re ripe for criticism — they know that when they fill out that form.”",
21,,,Can a play solve the mystery of the Monterey Park mass shooter? Survivors aren’t sure,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-17/monterey-park-searching-for-answers,"The search for answers played out in a Rowland Heights home, in a room the owners use for karaoke. On this day, it was the stage for reenacting the worst mass shooting in modern Los Angeles County history.

Full-length mirrors covered a wall. Chinese lanterns hung from the ceiling. A disco ball reflected light on the tile floor below. And a middle-aged Asian man, head in hands, dispelled the mystery that hangs over Monterey Park to this day: why a 72-year-old would shoot 11 people to death, turning a celebration into a bloodbath and shattering a tightknit community.

“I’ve thought about suicide and even thought about killing someone, because I often hear voices in my head telling me to kill someone,” Kaidy Kuna told his friend.

But Kuna is an actor. And on this Saturday he was rehearsing a play called “Dance with New Year’s Eve.” His character, AhGen, was written to parallel Huu Can Tran, who fired 42 rounds in the Star Ballroom Dance Studio during a Lunar New Year’s Eve celebration before taking his own life.

The play was created with limited input from those tied to the Jan. 21 Monterey Park massacre — and despite the concerns of many survivors. Its aim is to help a community struggling to heal and grappling with the unknowable.

Because when mass shooters die, the answers often die with them.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department investigation remains open, with no clear sense of when it will be over. A letter recovered from Tran’s home — written in Chinese and addressed to law enforcement — has yet to be released.

Investigators handed over Tran’s letter, surveillance video, witness and victim statements and other evidence to the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit to determine a motive and complete a post-shooting analysis. The FBI declined to comment on the letter.

“Do you remember at the very beginning when all these things happened?” asked Lloyd Gock, who survived the shooting by hiding under a table. “The police already said that the truth may probably never come out. We’ll probably never know why he did it...

“We can only guess.”

Like the character meant to parallel his life, Huu Can Tran lacked a sense of belonging.

He was born to a wealthy family in Vietnam five years before war tore the country apart. He told his friend William Chen that, as a teenager, he had chopped a person’s hand off during a fight. His family sent him to Taiwan to avoid jail.

Tran studied electrical engineering, but he told a former friend that he also got in trouble, joined a gang, kidnapped people. He moved to Hong Kong, but he stayed in the gang life there.

At least that’s the story Tran told.

He was considered the “black sheep” of his family and fell short of expectations, according to his former friend, who did not want his name linked to Tran. So fraught was the relationship that his father once threatened to cut him out of his inheritance.

California Monterey Park shooter: Glimpses into a life ‘so miserable and desperate’ Investigators continued to puzzle over what pushed Huu Can Tran to carry out a mass shooting at a Monterey Park dance studio, focusing on the possibility he was driven by jealousy.

Life in the U.S. wasn’t any easier for Tran. He lived in Texas for years before moving to Southern California, where he bought a small, white stucco home in San Gabriel in August 1989. He bounced from job to job, working as a carpet cleaner, at a supermarket, as a delivery driver for an auto parts company and a property manager for an apartment complex in Arcadia.

The same year he submitted a petition for naturalization, 1990, a San Gabriel police officer arrested him after patting him down and finding a loaded RG40 .38-caliber revolver. He had been trying to notify police that a nearby liquor store had been robbed at the time of his arrest, according to a police report.

Dancing was the bright spot in Tran’s ordinary life. He was proud of his abilities, boasting to friends that he’d been professionally trained in Texas.

Star Dance was one of his favorite places. It’s where he met Chen around the late 1990s; they visited the studio at least three times a week. Tran, who went by Andy, danced with partnerless women, a grin at times splitting his face from ear to ear.

“Andy always had a smile on his face, and he was friendly to other people,” Chen said. “He liked to make friends.”

The studio is where Tran met his future wife. They married in June 2001. The following year, he started Tran’s Trucking Inc., registering the company in San Gabriel and working as a driver.

But his life began to unravel. He dissolved his company in 2004 and filed for divorce a year later. He had told his former friend that he didn’t get along with his ex-wife’s family and had secretly made audio recordings that he threatened to use against her in the divorce. Tran’s ex-wife did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

After Monterey Park shooting, pastor tried to de-stigmatize therapy for Asian immigrants Eric Chen, a San Gabriel pastor, tried to help survivors get access to resources and encouraged them to seek counseling after the Monterey Park mass shooting at Star Ballroom Dance Studio.

Through it all, Tran kept dancing.

He offered to teach women how to ballroom dance for free, according to his former friend. But he had two requirements: They had to show up every day. They could only dance with him.

Shally Ung, who started going to Star Dance in 2006, said a friend complained Tran was too controlling. Eventually her friend quit dancing with him. She warned Tran that, if he kept it up, he wouldn’t have anyone left to teach.

Tran often complained about the studio’s Chinese dance instructors. He said they were hostile because he was stealing potential students, which meant a loss in revenue. He also complained to his friends about Ming Wei Ma, the studio’s former manager.

Chen noted a growing sense of paranoia in his friend, evidenced by Tran’s fears about his family. He told Chen they were going to kill him. He was frightened of his brother and wove tales that Chen said seemed irrational.

He changed his phone number every month, Chen said, and believed people were listening in on his calls.

“He always had a problem of the mind,” Chen said.

Eventually, Tran stopped going to Star Dance. After he sold his San Gabriel home in 2013, Tran told Chen he was going to drive around and live out of his van.

The ensuing years are a mystery to those who knew Tran. Some heard he had gone to live with his brother in Northern California.

California How the Lunar New Year massacre unfolded: A night of ballroom dancing, terror, manhunt A gunman opened fire at a Monterey Park dance studio late Saturday, killing 10 people and wounding 10. He went to another dance studio in Alhambra but was disarmed by two people and later killed himself in Torrance.

But in the first weeks of 2023, nearly 100 miles southeast of Star Dance, his life was barreling toward darkness.

He lived at the time in a mobile home in Hemet, where he stockpiled hundreds of rounds of ammunition, along with supplies to make suppressors that muffle a firearm’s blast.

He twice visited his local police department, accusing his family of fraud, theft and poisoning, crimes he alleged had happened in L.A. decades earlier.

He said he’d come back with proof. He never did.

Twelve days after his last police visit, on Jan. 21, Tran returned to Star Dance.

Gone was the smile captured in a photo from the old days and in the memories of people who had once shared the ballroom with him. That night, he looked haggard, aged beyond recognition, according to surveillance video and witness accounts.

He carried a modified Cobray model CM11-9 pistol.

First, he killed Mymy Nhan, 65, in the parking lot. Then he went into the studio, where he fired 42 rounds over several minutes. Eleven people died. Nine others were injured.

Then he headed to Lai Lai Ballroom & Studio in Alhambra, where he had also once danced. Brandon Tsay, whose family owns the studio, wrested the gun from Tran’s hands.

Twelve hours later, Tran sat in his van in a Torrance parking lot. Officers closed in on him.

He turned his gun on himself.

On a Friday afternoon in a cramped room in Temple City, Tuen-Ping Yang coached the star of “Dance with New Year’s Eve” on the character he would need to become.

“We put the gunman’s background in you,” he told Jonathan Lim, the actor playing AhGen in the Mandarin version of the play.

“The audience, do they know?” Lim asked.

“They don’t know,” Yang said, with a shake of his head. “They will not know.”

Yang is the executive producer of the controversial play, which he also helped write. It will be performed by two different casts, in English and Mandarin, ending on the anniversary of the Monterey Park massacre.

The play revolves around AhGen and Linda, a couple who lost contact after AhGen emigrated to the U.S. The onetime lovers encounter each other more than 30 years later at a Lunar New Year’s Eve celebration at Star Dance, where AhGen tells Linda about his failures in America.

Like Tran, AhGen is an immigrant. They share mental health struggles. He too bought a truck and worked as a carpet cleaner. He and his wife split up and also never had children.

AhGen tells Linda that he called 911 to turn himself in three months earlier because he believed the FBI wanted him to kill President Trump.

“I always thought you took all my savings and ran away to America, avoiding me,” Lee Chen said, reading the role of Linda during a rehearsal for the play’s English version. “I didn’t realize you went through so much suffering.”

Yang, the director, interrupted the actors to remind Chen of the importance of this scene, intended to redeem AhGen in the audience’s eyes.

“Make him from a bad person, become a good person,” Yang said, before resting his hands on Kuna’s shoulders as the actor crouched on the floor. “At this moment, the audience will be on his side. It’s very important.”

By the end of “Dance with New Year’s Eve,” AhGen and Linda will be shot to death.

Yang began to imagine the play weeks after the Star Dance shooting.

When he first floated the idea of bringing the tragedy to the stage, Maria Liang, the owner of Star Dance, shut him down. Weeks later, he tried again, telling her “it’s for Chinese people. For our next generation. ... We want people to remember.” Liang eventually agreed.

Angela Sheng, president of Elite Performing Arts Group USA, which is staging the performance, said she and Yang talked to about 20 people as they worked on the drama, including survivors and Liang.

A survivor named Gao, who asked to be identified only by her last name because of safety concerns, is among the performers. Tran had given her free dance lessons a decade ago. As he reloaded his gun during the shooting, she said, she ran for safety through the studio’s side exit.

“I want to participate because it will alleviate my sadness, stress and help me get out of the shadow of the shooting,” Gao said.

The performance will consist of three parts: 70 minutes of a play; about 20 minutes of the survivors telling their own stories, along with news footage of the shooting; and about 40 minutes of music, with a choir and dancers.

Nearly a dozen cameras will record the show; Yang hopes to make it available on streaming platforms.

As the play came together, Yang said, people in Monterey Park were divided into two factions: those who wanted it so they could remember the victims, and those who felt the play would be traumatizing.

Yang said he’s directing it to remember the lives of “11 innocent people he killed with no reason.” He also wants to let people know Chinese Americans are part of the U.S. just like everyone else.

“It’s a mass shooting in our home, our community. We don’t know what’s the reason. ... But he killed people. That’s the truth,” Yang said. “So please remember this happened.”

Liang showed her support for the play at a news conference last month in Pasadena. Although she wasn’t at the ballroom during the shooting, her brother was shot in the arm. She lost Ma, her “best friend” and “public relations manager,” as well as treasured clients.

Liang — who emigrated from China — said she knows and trusts those who created the play to tell the story of Star Dance, which she called a “social hub” for many Chinese immigrants. She plans to speak on stage about that night.

The play can’t explain why Tran shot up the ballroom, Sheng said. But the story is about immigrants and what happens when their dreams die.

It’s also about isolation and loneliness, she said, referring not just to what happened in Monterey Park but also to a mass shooting in Half Moon Bay that occurred less than 48 hours later. In that case, 66-year-old Chunli Zhao, who emigrated from China more than a decade earlier, killed seven people.

“That … led us to think it’s a big problem,” Sheng said. “Elders and their isolation, so we want to raise that awareness.”

Shally Ung spun her dance partners, Soo Wong and Sally, across the tile floor, leading them in the cha-cha-cha and rhumba on a recent Thursday.

They joined more than 50 others for the first ballroom dance workshop at the MPK Hope Resiliency Center, which opened in August to help survivors and community members who are grappling with the shooting.

Along with their love of dancing, Ung, Wong and Sally shared something else: They all survived the Star Dance massacre.

During the shooting, Ung, 58, lost Andy Kao, her decades-long dance partner; Sally had been grazed by bullets; Wong, 69, lost her best friend, Diana Tom. Sally asked not to be identified by her full name due to safety concerns.

It had taken Ung four months to begin dancing again, and then only after she started seeing a psychologist. She initially resisted mental health treatment; her husband encouraged her to go. She’s now completed 16 sessions.

“It’s helping,” Ung said. “After that, I relaxed a lot.”

The horror of that evening felt far off as the women danced with ease borne of years of practice. Ung’s crystal-embellished pants glittered as she moved across the makeshift dance floor; they were the same pants she’d worn the night of the shooting.

She knew the men’s and women’s dance steps and spent the four hours partnering with her two friends. When she caught a break, she sank into a chair and fanned herself with a napkin.

“I’m so tired,” she said, sighing. But she spent most of the afternoon smiling.

As the event wound down, Yang arrived with fliers in hand. He wanted to ask the survivors in attendance if they’d be open to sharing their stories of that night on stage. Initially Wong, Ung and Sally agreed. But after Yang left, as they sat down to talk it through, their feelings shifted.

“Originally we thought the play was to lift up spirits. But listening to it, it’s like reenacting the trauma,” Ung said in Cantonese.

“Always repeating it. I’m not mentally prepared for it,” Sally said. “I don’t want to think about that day.”

By the end of the conversation, the women had decided not to participate.

The same concerns have played out among other survivors and families of the deceased, who expressed frustration that they have not been able to read the script to better understand the play.

Lloyd Gock survived the shooting by hiding under a table. “I think it’s very distasteful to try to remind people what happened or reenact what went on,” he said. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)

Gock, a survivor, also questioned where the money from ticket sales will wind up; some tickets cost more than $200. (Yang said the performing arts group has invested more than $100,000 in the play and will likely lose money, “because we don’t know how much tickets we can sell.”)

“I think it’s very distasteful to try to remind people what happened or reenact what went on,” Gock said. “It’s not a funny matter. It’s gonna bring up a lot for people.”

Fonda Quan, whose aunt was the first person killed outside Star Dance, said her family hasn’t been contacted or asked for their input. She said she was under the impression that a lot of survivors and even those injured would be involved.

Kristenne Reidy, whose father, Valentino Alvero, was killed in the shooting, said she found the flier for the play — which reads “Dance with New Year’s Eve Cheer or Fear, Which Fate is Near? — to be “too on the nose.” It depicts silhouettes of dancers and partygoers at a Lunar New Year’s Eve celebration and a man lurking in the foreground holding a gun. A Chinese version of the flier reads: “Which will come first: The sound of bells or gunshots?”

She and her father’s friends had nightmares after the shooting, she said, adding: “I can’t imagine for the people who were actually there to have to see this flier.”

The play was initially presented to Reidy as a ballroom dance performance, which she fully supported. Then, she heard secondhand that one of the protagonists is meant to represent Tran. Reidy no longer supports the play and said she doesn’t plan to attend.

“The intention, I think, is good. We want to see everybody as a human being. This man was also an immigrant and was part of the immigrant community, and there is this idea of forgiveness and humanizing him, because he was human,” she said. “But he also made the decision to kill my dad and those people.”

Instead of attending the play, Reidy said, she and her family will pray at her father’s grave.

For months, a banner on Garfield Avenue, a block north of the building that housed Star Dance, read “United We Dance” in memory of the massacre.

The city has reverted to a sort-of normal — although the mass shooting has permanently marked many here, including first responders.

Out of 17 firefighters at the scene that night, two remain on extended leave, said Fire Chief Matthew Hallock.

The department has provided peer counseling and mental health services to its staff. But with the one-year anniversary nearing, Hallock said, there will be “setbacks.”

“There was never going to be a quick fix,” Hallock said of the department’s recovery process. “This was the call that had such a tremendous impact on the first responders.”

Lt. Bob Hung, a 15-year veteran of the city’s Police Department, was among a half-dozen Chinese-speaking police officers who responded to the 911 calls and talked to dozens of survivors, victims’ relatives and bystanders who didn’t speak English or felt more comfortable with Mandarin or Cantonese.

Inside the ravaged studio, he listened as cellphones rang, owned by people who would never answer them.

It fell on Chief Scott Wiese to ensure his officers were getting rest. He spoke with officers individually the night of the shooting to see how they were feeling.

“Everybody was emotional. They are human beings. None of them had ever seen that level of trauma before,” Wiese said. “They understood the impact it was going to have on the community.”

In the months that followed, each officer handled the trauma differently, the chief said. Some talked to their families. Others talked to their peers. Some didn’t want to talk at all.

Wiese said he tried to make sure his officers had therapy and peer support available. Most took advantage of the help, he said.

No one has left the department in the aftermath of the shooting. No officers requested leaves of absence, even though the department offered them.

The police chief acknowledged that the community “will never know the complete reason” behind the shooting.

“We can speculate all we want,” Wiese said, “but no one will ever know, because no one got a chance to talk to him about what he did.”

Hung said it’s normal for people to look for explanations. But heading into the anniversary, he also wants people to think about those who lost loved ones.

“The burden that we carry is very small compared to what those family members have to carry,” he said.

Since that day, they — like Americans across the country — have watched in horror as gun violence continues unabated.

In nearby Orange County, where a retired Ventura Police Department sergeant killed three people at a bar. In Lewiston, Maine, where a gunman killed 18 at a bar and a bowling alley. Most recently, on a university campus in Las Vegas, where an academic fatally shot three people.

Councilmember Henry Lo, who served as the Monterey Park mayor at the time of the shooting, called the mayor of Lewiston after the October attack there. Lo had attended Colby College, about an hour away from the city.

“This seems to be a very uniquely American phenomenon,” Lo told The Times. “It seems like, when we try to have a conversation, we all go into our little quarters, and it comes down to: Are you against the 2nd Amendment or what can we do to stop having” mass shootings.

Advertisement

“What we can’t allow to happen is for people to suggest just move on and say this happened and there’s nothing we can do,” he said. “We have the responsibility to make sure that we are part of the conversation and then we will not forget.”

All signs of the Monterey Park massacre have long since been cleared away. The space that housed the studio sits empty, chairs and tables gone. There are no plans to open another business there anytime soon.

It is unclear whether Star Dance will reopen in a new location.

But on a stage in San Gabriel next month, in a Star Dance of the imagination, music for dancing will play once more.",

Flores is in custody of White Settlement police, with criminal charges pending review by the Dallas County Criminal District Attorney’s Office. Medical examiners from Dallas and Tarrant counties will work together to identify the passenger and cause of death, following notification of family.

Here’s what students need to know,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2023/12/04/the-new-fafsa-application-is-set-to-open-up-this-month-heres-what-students-need-to-know/,"The federal financial aid application submitted by millions of students each year is receiving a major makeover for the 2024-25 academic year that will allow more students to receive grants to help pay for college.

Federal legislation passed in 2020 kicked off an exhaustive redesign of the FAFSA form and the systems used to award federal student aid.

Advertisement

The main impact of the changes will be to expand federal student aid eligibility by updating aid calculations, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

Advertisement

About 610,000 new, low-income college students will now be able to receive Federal Pell Grants, according to the Department of Education’s estimates. About 1.5 million more students will also be able to receive the maximum Pell Grant award, bringing the total number of students eligible for the top amount to more than 5.2 million.

It’s also shorter. Depending on their circumstances, applicants could skip up to 26 FAFSA questions, lightening the often overwhelming load of applying for financial aid.

Some applicants will only need to respond to about 18 questions.

Advertisement

Some education advocates, however, worry the overhaul could cause confusion among applicants.

“Although they’re simplifying the process, the fact that there’s so many changes … could potentially act as another barrier to completing the form,” said ShaCara Telemaque, the director of training and curriculum for the higher education accessibility nonprofit Bottom Line.

As the new FAFSA is set to open this month, here’s what families and students need to know about the application and how they can prepare ahead of its launch:

Advertisement

When will students be able to start applying for financial aid?

The FAFSA application, which usually is available in October, will not launch until Dec. 31, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

Advertisement

What are other major changes?

A new formula — called the Student Aid Index — will be used to measure students’ and their families’ ability to pay for college and to determine aid. It replaces what was previously known as the Expected Family Contribution.

Previously, the FAFSA was only available in English and Spanish. The new application will be available in the 11 most common languages spoken by English learner students and their parents.

The new need analysis formula will no longer consider the number of family members in college in its calculation.

Applicants and each of their contributors — such as parents, guardians or spouses — who will include information in a FAFSA application will now need to create their own Federal Student Aid ID , or FSA ID, account to access the form and answer questions.

Regardless of whether they file a U.S. tax return, all applicants and contributors will be required to check a box that grants the Internal Revenue Service permission to transfer any data they have directly into the FAFSA form. Contributors providing information on the form must grant permission or the student will not be eligible for any federal student aid.

Families with an adjusted gross income of $60,000 or higher will be required to answer questions on their assets.

Applicants will now be able to list up to 20 colleges and universities when submitting the FAFSA instead of only 10.

How can applicants prepare to complete the FAFSA?

Applicants and their contributors should make sure to create their FSA ID accounts as soon as possible because it can take up to three days for it to go through the verification process.

Advertisement

Accounts can be created by visiting StudentAid.gov. Those who don’t have a Social Security number will be able to create an account when the form goes live, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

Ana Gonzalez, Grand Prairie ISD’s college readiness lead and dual credit coordinator, advises students to “talk to their counselor.”

She suggests families reach out to their school’s counselor with any questions ahead of the winter break and look out for upcoming district events that may be offered on the FAFSA.

The Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid office has published several videos on YouTube to help applicants through the process.

Advertisement

When will students receive their financial aid offers?

Processing delays will likely lead to aid offers arriving much later than in previous years, according to the National College Attainment Network, a nonprofit that seeks to increase college access.

Aid offers may not be sent out until late February or March at the earliest.

Applicants can use the Federal Student Aid Estimator at studentaid.gov/aid-estimator to get an early idea of what their aid package could look like after submitting the new form.

Michael Downs, a 71-year-old from Fort Worth, pleaded guilty in July to two counts of sexual exploitation of children. In addition to his prison sentence, Downs, a retired Cook Children’s Medical Center chaplain, was also ordered to a lifetime of supervised release.

According to plea papers, the investigation began in January after a 17-year-old girl told her aunt she had been sexually abused by Downs. The U.S. attorney’s office said the teen reported Downs recorded the abuse on an iPad.

A family member of Downs’ gave several electronic devices to authorities. According to the U.S. attorney’s office, a hard drive contained numerous videos and photos of Downs engaging in “sexually explicit conduct” with the teen.

“This is an incredibly important case involving shocking and abhorrent conduct,” U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton said in a written statement. “Let this be a message to others who seek to prey on children in this way: We will do everything in our power to incapacitate you by locking you away in prison for as long as possible.”

Downs worked for Cook Children’s from November 1997 to February 2022, the hospital said, adding that it has “fully cooperated” with law enforcement in the investigation. The hospital said it encourages anyone concerned that their child was abused by anyone to immediately contact law enforcement.

“We are grateful for their impeccable work ensuring he will not be able to hurt another innocent child,” the statement said.

32,,,New photo shows Bill Gates posing with Epstein accuser years after his 2008 conviction: report,https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/news/new-photo-shows-bill-gates-posing-with-epstein-accuser-years-after-his-2008-conviction-report/,"Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was pictured posing with one of Jeffrey Epstein’s accusers — part of the well-connected sex offender’s use of photos to manipulate the women he abused and control the narrative around his nefarious behavior, according to a new report.

The photo — believed to be among the first showing Gates with an alleged Epstein victim — was allegedly taken by the shady financier himself at Gates’ Seattle office in March 2014, years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution, The Wall Street Journal reported.

In the image, published by the Journal Sunday, Gates is seen smiling and fiddling with the zipper of his dark quarter-zip sweater as a woman identified as a Polish model, then in her 20s, stands erect at his side in a grey jacket and blue scarf with her chest nearly pressed up against him.

The woman, whose face was obscured in the published photo, told the Journal she met Epstein, a registered sex offender, months before the snap was taken and that he then quickly began showering her with promises that he could help her career with his powerful connections.

At least three other photos exist allegedly showing Gates with Epstein accusers, the Journal reported, saying it reviewed images of a Russian model who claims she was abused by Epstein posing with the tech titan at locations including the Four Seasons Hotel in New York City and Epstein’s Upper East Side townhouse.

Gates, 68, was not the only prominent figure to appear in newly emerged photos with alleged victims of Epstein, who hanged himself in his Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10, 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

The Polish model was also pictured alongside director Woody Allen at Epstein’s townhouse, with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud in 2014, and with former CBS News journalist Charlie Rose, among others, according to the Journal.

The model did not accuse Gates or any of the other men of sexual misconduct.

But her attorneys told the Journal that even if unbeknownst to her, Epstein was using his powerful connections to further his alleged sex trafficking operation.

“Without having legitimate connections to so many high-powered people, Jeffrey Epstein would not have been able to traffic most of these women after 2008,” said Brad Edwards, who alongside his law firm partner Brittany Henderson represents the model and more than 150 of Epstein’s accusers.

“He used the powerful people he was intermingling with to further facilitate his sex trafficking scheme, whether those people knew it or not,” Henderson added. “He was using everyone around him to create this façade of legitimacy.”

A number of Epstein accusers have previously been seen in photos with powerful men, including the now-infamous shot of Britain’s Prince Andrew with his arm around the bare midriff of then-17-year-old Virginia Roberts Giuffre, with convicted Epstein madam Ghislaine Maxwell smiling in the background.

Another photo features former President Bill Clinton getting a massage from former Epstein employee and accuser Chauntae Davies during a trip aboard Epstein’s private jet, known as the “Lolita Express.”

In the cases of the Polish and Russian models, Epstein accumulated images of the young women with business leaders and other prominent men, telling them the snaps could advance their careers — but then used those images to support his narrative of being powerfully connected, which he in turn used to lure in more victims, the Journal reported.

6 Gates posing with Epstein in the sex offender’s Manhattan apartment in 2011.

The models told the newspaper that Epstein would push them to post the images to their social media accounts, and would then string them along with promises of being given work through those connections.

But those promises would nearly always fall through in the end.

For the Polish model, Epstein’s drawn-out line of promises ended with an offer to be the mistress of one of his friends, which he said could earn her millions, she told the paper.

She declined the offer shortly before escaping home to Poland in 2015, only for Epstein to use her photo with Gates to try to draw her back.

He sent her the snap in March 2015, telling her that instead of the life she used to live, “now you are back in your room, as you only follow your own advice,” the report said.

“My impression is that becoming a mistress was the only one job proposition you were really serious about,” she wrote to him a few months later. “Meeting Gates or Woody was great — thank you — will never forget it – although nobody hire me just because I have a nice pictures with them.”

Gates has previously admitted to and expressed regret for having several meetings with Epstein in the 2010s — after Epstein’s 2008 conviction in Florida — as part of efforts to raise money for the Gates Foundation.

A representative for Gates reiterated that the businessman and philanthropist “only ever met with Epstein for philanthropic purposes, which he regrets.”

“Epstein tried, unsuccessfully, to connect himself to Mr. Gates by any means possible, including spontaneously bringing in people for photos with Bill, whom Bill did not know or interact with further,” the spokesperson said.

Allen, in a statement to the Journal, said he was never aware that Epstein was using Allen’s name to manipulate victims.

“At no time did he ever request I cast anyone in a movie — and I never did it,” the director said.

Representatives for Wexner, whose fortune Epstein managed for years before being hit with sex crimes in 2006, said the billionaire “severed all ties with Epstein in 2007 and never spoke with him again.”

6 Epstein pictured with former President Bill Clinton.

Epstein was constantly meeting with new potential victims to draw into his web of lies and abuse, often targeting young women from Russia and eastern Europe who had histories of sexual abuse.

Many would be given piles of cash from Epstein, assurances that their visas would be taken care of, that he would pay for their education in the US or that they would be put up in apartments near his townhouse, the Journal reported.

Before long, however, they found themselves being jetted to Epstein’s private Caribbean island where they would be made to spend their days naked, the report said.

He would advise some to abandon their modeling goals and consider massage therapy, which he had them practice on him. It was in those massage sessions Epstein often began his sexual assaults, according to his alleged victims.

“He knew they weren’t going to report it because they were trained not to report abuse,” Henderson, the victims’ attorney, told the Journal, adding that Epstein engaged in “insidious mental manipulation” that exploited their insecurities and pasts to control them.

The Russian model told the paper she was constantly harassed by Epstein about her weight — sometimes being told she needed to lose weight, then being told she needed to gain it back, though she was around 5 feet 10 inches and just 130 pounds.

“There was always something with my body that was not right.”

Even as his promises for help turned to abuse, Epstein was leaving a paper trail seemingly intended to reinforce the image he’d created of himself as a champion of women looking for their big break.

He demanded written thank you notes from the women every time he did anything for them, the Russian model told the Journal, and would force them to smile while he took nude photos and filmed them.

“It was almost like he was documenting everything so we can’t go against him,” the woman said.

“If you’re not smiley and positive, he was going to give you a talk, because then you’re acting ungrateful,” she added. “And those gratitude letters, I’m sure he was using them as just another guarantee that we wouldn’t go against him.”

No matter how much they thanked him or what they did for him, Epstein’s promises always fell through.

“After a couple of years in the JE circle, none of us had any legitimate things to add to our résumés, and none of the jobs he promised ever materialized,” the Russian model said.",

Novilee Williams, 79, was charged with disorderly conduct and harassment after a testy exchange during the Dec. 4 meeting’s public comment portion, which was filmed and later posted to the city’s Facebook page.

“That’s a pity and a shame,” Tarrant Councilwoman Veronica Bandy Freeman told AL.com, who the outlet says burst into tears upon hearing of Williams’ arrest.

“And I feel so bad. That could be somebody’s grandmama, great grandmama.”

In the video, Williams can be seen in a mostly empty council chamber sitting behind a woman identified as Shayla Myricks, an accountant for Tarrant, Ala., a small city of around 6,000 residents just outside of Birmingham.

As Williams strongly criticizes Tarrant Mayor Wayman Newton, accusing him of engaging in corruption over the recent suspension and reinstatement of Tarrant Police Chief Wendell Major, Myricks repeatedly turns in her seat to challenge the septuagenarian’s assertions.

“Turn around, honey,” Williams chides Myricks at one point in the video.

Seconds later, Myricks again turns to face Williams and gestures with her hand, which Williams lightly pushes away as she repeats her demand that she turn around.

“Don’t put your hands on me, ma’am,” Myricks can be heard saying in the video.

According to AL.com, that physical contact led Myricks to file misdemeanor charges against Williams, which alleged she “did engage in fighting and threatening behavior in a public place.”

The police report obtained by the outlet says Williams “did, without lawful authority, direct Myricks to turn around” and “did shove Myricks, by making physical contact, in an attempt to force her to do so.”

An email sent to Myricks by The Post seeking comment was not immediately returned Sunday evening.

In the final portions of the video, Williams briefly rose to her feet with her hands placed on her hips as she glowered at Myricks.

After the meeting wrapped up, a uniformed police officer approaches Williams and she presents him with her identification, which she produces from a fanny pack around her waist.

The officer takes her ID and walks out of the frame as the footage ends.

According to AL.com, Williams is a regular fixture at Tarrant council meetings and has frequently sparred with Mayor Newton, who was not in the room during the public comment period.

Newton later told the outlet that although he wasn’t involved with Williams’ arrest, “you can’t go putting your hands on people.”

“I wasn’t there, and she was arrested when she put her hands on the city accountant. It was the city accountant who wanted to press charges against her. I didn’t even know that it had happened until people started calling me,” he said.

Newton could not be immediately reached by email.

Williams declined to speak on the incident to AL.com but said she had retained an attorney.

“Everything is well, and I don’t have a grudge against Wayman and that young lady,” Williams told AL.com after her arrest. “I pray for them.”

Speaking to the outlet, Councilwoman Freeman vowed to “fight for” Williams.

“There are some rules for some and then there are rules for others,” she said.

“I can only go by my experience. When a certain person gets attacked, it is a problem. They went overboard in doing that to Ms. Williams.”",

George Santos is threatening to sue late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and ABC for alleged misuse of his Cameo clips, The Post has learned.

An attorney for the expelled House member sent a “cease and desist” letter to Kimmel, ABC and executive producer of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Doug Deluca after several of Santos’ Cameos were played on the show.

“We are writing to congratulate you — your ‘dream’ of being sued by Mr. Santos may indeed come true,” Santos lawyer Andrew Mancilla wrote in the Dec. 12 letter, obtained by The Post.

“While your comedic efforts are much appreciated, you should have obtained Mr. Santos’ consent, as he is not camera shy, nor is he blind to the comedic irony of suing you for fraud,” the letter said.

It comes amid an ongoing feud between the host and Santos, which became public last week when Kimmel claimed the embattled former New York congressman had demanded $20,000 for using the videos on the late-night show.

“[George Santos] has claimed he’s made more money in seven days than he did in Congress for a year, and part of that money came from me,” Kimmel told his audience during last Monday’s episode.

The host said he had anonymously submitted Cameo requests to Santos.

“I sent him a bunch of crazy video requests because I wanted to see what he would read and what he wouldn’t read,” Kimmel went on. “I showed some of them on the air on Thursday, and now he’s demanding $20,000 from me to be paid a commercial rate.”

Kimmel titled the segment “Will Santos Say It?” and claimed the ousted lawmaker increased the rates of his videos to $500 each.

“He should be thanking me for buying these videos,” he quipped.

Santos, of all people, knows about misrepresentation, having lied about nearly his entire background during his run for Congress.

He became the sixth member ever to be expelled from the House of Representatives on Dec. 1, a little more than a year after he won election.

Since then, Santos — who has also been accused of lying about his campaign’s finances and defrauding donors, which he denies — has launched an account on Cameo, a platform where people can pay to get personalized videos from celebrities.

In the cease and desist letter, Santos’ lawyer told Kimmel and ABC that the fabulist ex-politician might get the last laugh in court over Kimmel’s “prank.”

“Such ‘pranks’ are frequently known by a different name in the legal community: fraud,” Mancilla charged.

He called Kimmel a “sneaky little trickster” who may have earned “some hearty laughs” and boosted ratings, but claimed his actions “constitute fraudulent inducement, breach of contract and unjust enrichment as well as violations of New York State’s Civil Rights Law.”

“You also breached Cameo’s Terms of Service, which we understand they already contacted you about,” the attorney alleged.

“We trust you will take this letter as seriously as Mr. Santos takes his Cameo commitments. Let’s resolve this. Call us.”

Deluca, Kimmel’s producer, had no immediate comment to the Dec. 12 cease and desist letter.",
35,,,North Korea shoots ballistic missile into sea 1 day after Biden warns nuke launch would end Kim Jon Un’s regime,https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/news/north-korea-shoots-ballistic-missile-into-the-sea-after-biden-warning-that-nuke-use-would-be-the-end-of-dictators-regime/,"North Korea reportedly sent a short-range ballistic missile into the sea Sunday — just one day after a stern warning from President Biden about the rogue nation’s use of nuclear weapons against the United States.

The North Korean military fired the missile off the country’s eastern coast, near the capital of Pyongyang, on Sunday night in what South Korean officials called a “clear violation” of UN Security Council resolutions.

The missile, which was in the air for about 20 minutes, reportedly careened about 354 miles before it splashed down.

The launch came one day after the Biden administration warned any nuclear attacks against the United States or its allies would be “unacceptable” and seal the “end” of Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship.

South Korea pilloried the launch as a clear violation of international agreements intended to bar Kim Jong Un’s regime from using ballistic missiles.

5 The White House issued a joint statement warning any attack by North Korea on the US or its allies would be “unacceptable.” AP

But in a statement issued shortly after the launch, North Korea blamed the US for destabilizing the peninsula and creating a “reckless military threat” by deploying strategic bombers and nuclear-powered subs to South Korea.

“The armed forces of the DPRK will thoroughly neutralize the US and its vassal forces’ attempt to ignite a nuclear war and thus reliably ensure peace and security in the Korean peninsula,” a spokesman for the nation’s defense ministry said in a statement.

The country — once named by former President George W. Bush as a central cog in an “axis of evil” that included Iran and Iraq — also attacked the US for working with South Korea on nuclear operation scenarios during joint drills, according to Fox News.

Pyongyang described the missile maneuvers as a threat against the country and promised it would prepare “offensive countermeasures” against the phantom danger.

Biden administration’s warning said that any attack North Korea mounts against the South “will be met with a swift, overwhelming, and decisive response.”

5 The launch followed months of saber-rattling between the US and North Korea. AP

The statement also said any nuclear attack against the US, South Korea or any of their allies would be unacceptable and “result in the end of the Un regime,” Fox said.

The sharp message followed months of saber-rattling that included North Korea revealing in August that it had simulated “scorched earth” nuclear strikes on South Korea with ballistic missiles.

The country said it conducted the tests because the US flew B-1B bombers to the peninsula during a joint drill with its southern neighbor.

36,,,Freed Hamas hostages warn of ‘colossal danger’ in Gaza tunnels as they push for cease-fire,https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/news/former-hamas-hostages-warn-of-colossal-danger-in-gaza-tunnels/,"Former Hamas hostages have warned the Israeli army of the “colossal danger” hidden in Gaza’s 300-mile-long tunnel system — as they called for a new cease-fire deal to free the remaining captives.

Several of the more than 100 hostages who were freed last month met with Israeli officials Saturday night to discuss what they went through in Gaza, the Times of Israel reports.

One former hostage, who was not publicly named, told Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and fellow war cabinet Minister Benny Gantz that their weeks in captivity were spent in fear that they could die any day.

“There’s no time. Every passing day is terrifying,” the freed Israeli said. “You have no idea what kind of monsters we are dealing with.”

The former hostage claimed that Hamas told them that the Israel Defense Forces would employ the infamous “Hannibal Directive” on civilians, a revoked protocol that once allegedly called on troops to prioritize taking out terrorists even if it meant killing a kidnapped soldier.

5 The former captives warned about the amount of movement in Hamas’ underground tunnels, where some corridors are large enough to let vehicles pass. IDF

“We were scared when the [IDF] bombings were close,” the ex-hostage said. “They were so close that we begged them to take us into the tunnels [for safety], and at one stage they did.”

The person added that Israeli soldiers should avoid the tunnels at all cost, as Hamas will not hesitate to hide behind its hostages.

“Don’t go into the tunnels,” the freed hostage warned. “They are moving around in there in vast numbers. It’s a colossal danger to soldiers and to hostages.”

With the constant danger facing those who were kidnapped Oct. 7, the former hostage said the Jewish state needed to do everything possible to free the more than 100 Israelis still being held in Gaza.

Gallant and Gantz assured those at the meeting, which included relatives of the captives, that freeing the hostages was their top priority.

“First, the hostages have to be returned. We’ll have a lifetime to battle Hamas,” Gantz said.

The war cabinet minister added that capturing Hamas’ top commander in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, would only be a symbolic victory and that the real fight would be to remove his ideals from Gaza.

The safety of the hostages has become a heated topic especially after three Israeli hostages were mistakenly killed by the IDF.

Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka and Alon Shamriz were shot dead when they were accidentally “targeted” in Shejaiya by Israeli soldiers..

It believed the three hostages “fled or were abandoned by the terrorists who held them captive,” according to the IDF.

Shamriz, 26, was buried Sunday in a funeral that saw hundreds gather at a cemetery in Shafiim. It’s unclear if any government officials attended the funeral.

37,,,2 motorists were racing on Pa. highway before collision with school van that killed 15-year-old girl: police,https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/news/2-men-charged-in-pennsylvania-school-van-crash-that-killed-teenage-girl-injured-5/,"PITTSBURGH — Two men accused of racing on a public highway in western Pennsylvania are facing charges in a crash involving a school van that left a teenage girl dead.

The crash also sent three other juveniles and two critically injured adults — including one of the defendants — to hospitals.

Allegheny County police said the Serra Catholic High School van was trying to make a left turn when it was struck by a northbound sedan on Sept. 20 in Dravosburg.

The medical examiner’s office said 15-year-old Samantha Lee Kalkbrenner died at the scene.

Authorities said three of the four students in the van, including Kalkbrenner, were ejected and the van driver also was seriously injured.

William Soliday II, 43, of Irwin, whose car struck the van, is charged with criminal homicide, vehicular homicide, and multiple counts of aggravated assault and reckless endangering, authorities said.

Andrew Voigt, 37, of Pittsburgh, whose vehicle entered the intersection moments after the crash, is charged with accidents involving death or injury and reckless endangering, authorities said.

Both men, who worked at the same place nearby, are charged with racing on highways.

Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala said authorities believe the two drivers were racing and that the vehicle had been turned “into a deadly weapon.”

Investigators said the first car is believed to have been traveling more than 100 mph just before the crash and the second vehicle was about two seconds behind.

Soliday’s attorney, Casey White, told reporters his client sustained some head trauma and has no memory of the crash or even leaving home that day.

38,,,Irish PM ‘deeply concerned’ by fire at property earmarked for migrants,https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/news/irish-pm-deeply-concerned-by-fire-at-property-earmarked-for-migrants/,"DUBLIN — Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar expressed his “deep concern” on Sunday about reports of suspected criminal damage at properties earmarked for accommodating migrants, including a fire at a former hotel in the county of Galway overnight.

Police said on Sunday that they are investigating a “criminal damage incident by fire” which occurred at the former hotel in the small western village of Rosscahill shortly before midnight on Saturday.

A video broadcast by national broadcaster RTE and the Irish Times showed flames engulfing the premises, with parts of the building destroyed.

Nobody was inside the building at the time, police said.

Protesters had gathered earlier on Saturday to blockade the entrance of the hotel in opposition to government plans to house 70 asylum seekers there from next week, RTE reported.

“I am deeply concerned about recent reports of suspected criminal damage at a number of properties around the country which have been earmarked for accommodating those seeking international protection here, including in County Galway last night,” Varadkar said in a statement.

“There is no justification for violence, arson or vandalism in our Republic. Ever. Garda (police) investigations are underway.”

Similar, mostly peaceful campaigns have grown across the country in recent months as Ireland tries to accommodate record numbers of refugees in the middle of a housing crisis.

The government agency responsible for housing asylum seekers began handing out tents to some new arrivals last week after running out of accommodation.

Unprecedented riots also erupted in Dublin last month after a small group of far-right activists attacked police following the stabbing of three young children by a man Irish newspapers have identified as Algerian born.

Varadkar sought to assure people that all asylum-seekers are registered, fingerprinted, checked against watch lists, and the circumstances surrounding their requests are examined thoroughly.

“The response from many communities has been incredible. We’ve seen people open their homes, schools, clubs and communities to help those most in need. The people carrying out these crimes are a very small minority,” he said.",

40,,,Florida Republican Party suspends chairman and demands his resignation amid rape investigation,https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/news/florida-republican-party-suspends-chairman-and-demands-his-resignation-amid-rape-investigation/,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The Republican Party of Florida suspended Chairman Christian Ziegler and demanded his resignation during an emergency meeting Sunday, adding to calls by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top officials for him to step down as police investigate a rape accusation against him.

Ziegler is accused of raping a woman with whom he and his wife, Moms for Liberty co-founder Bridget Ziegler, had a prior consensual sexual relationship, according to police records.

“Christian Ziegler has engaged in conduct that renders him unfit for the office,” the party’s motion to censure Ziegler said, according to a document posted on the social media platform X by Lee County GOP Chairman Michael Thomason.

Ziegler tried to defend himself during the closed-door meeting, but the party board quickly took the action against him, Thompson said.

“Ziegler on soap box trying to defend himself, not working,” Thompson posted before confirming the votes.

The party’s executive committee will hold another vote in the future on whether to remove Ziegler.

The Sarasota Police Department is investigating the woman’s accusation that Ziegler raped her at her apartment in October.

Police documents say the Zieglers and the woman had planned a sexual threesome that day, but Bridget Ziegler was unable to make it. The accuser says Christian Ziegler arrived anyway and assaulted her.

Christian Ziegler has not been charged with a crime and says he is innocent, contending the encounter was consensual.

The accusation also has caused turmoil for Bridget Ziegler, an elected member of the Sarasota School Board, though she is not accused of any crime.

On Tuesday the board voted to ask her to resign. She refused.

The couple have been outspoken opponents of LGBTQ+ rights, and their relationship with another woman has sparked criticism and accusations of hypocrisy.

In addition to DeSantis, Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, US Rep. Matt Gaetz and Florida’s Republican House and Senate leaders have all called for Christian Ziegler’s resignation.",
41,,,FBI secretly taped James Biden as it probed attorney who paid $100K to his consulting firm: report,https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/news/fbi-bribery-inquiry-taped-james-biden-who-took-money-from-attorney-pursuing-tobacco-bill-in-congress/,"President Biden’s brother James was secretly recorded by the FBI during a bribery investigation into a Mississippi trial attorney who shelled out $100,000 to his consulting firm in the late 1990s, a report said on Sunday.

Richard Scruggs, the trial attorney, hired James and Sara Biden’s DC consulting firm while seeking to gin up support for tobacco legislation being contemplated by Congress in 1998, the Washington Post reported.

Neither James, 74, nor his brother President Joe Biden, 81, were implicated in any major criminal wrongdoing in the case. But the revelation comes amid an impeachment probe into alleged influence-peddling by the president’s family members.

“I probably wouldn’t have hired him if he wasn’t the senator’s brother,” Scruggs told the Washington Post about why he forked over cash to James Biden’s firm.

“Jim was never untoward about his influence,” he added. “He didn’t brag about it or talk about it. He didn’t have to. He was the man’s brother.”

Scruggs, who was later sent to prison over a separate bribery scheme, had been closing in on a deal to push the tobacco companies to cough up billions of dollars in a lawsuit alleging they withheld information that their products were addictive.

Seeking some $368 billion, Scruggs needed Congress to waive antitrust provisions as part of a settlement deal. Joe Biden in 1997, initially said, he was “not yet convinced that this settlement is a good deal.”

Despite initially being reluctant, Joe Biden, who sat on the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee as the ranking member, ultimately became one of its most significant backers.

Ultimately, the bill failed to clear Congress. Biden, at the time, cited an intense campaign by the tobacco industry that he claimed swayed Republicans.

Lion Hall

While seeking support from the then-Delaware senator, Scruggs made multiple $10,000 payments to Lion Hall, James and Sara Biden’s consulting firm, over roughly a year, according to the Washington Post.

Scruggs was unsure if James convinced his brother to back the bill, but told The Washington Post, “I hope he did.”

A lawyer for James Biden was adamant that his “work has never involved speaking with or providing access to his brother.” The lawyer has not responded to requests for additional comment from The Post.

Lion Hall has come into focus for Republican congressional investigators looking into whether the president’s brother has used the company to filter money to the rest of the Biden family.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) has flagged a $40,000 check marked as a “loan repayment” from James to Joe in 2017.

Comer alleges that the payment was “laundered” money from the Chinese government-linked CEFC. As evidence, Comer points to a series of transactions to the president’s brother’s account.

The White House, however, has forcefully rejected that notion and highlighted bank records that indicate the president did indeed make a loan to his brother.

In November House GOP impeachment inquiry subpoenaed both James and Hunter Biden for testimony this month, but both men skipped it. Hunter Biden offered to testify publicly, but Republicans slapped that down, insisting that he appear behind closed doors.

Last week, the GOP-led House voted to formally authorize the impeachment probe into Biden over the alleged dealings.

Republicans have been mulling the possibility of holding Hunter Biden in contempt, which would then go to the Justice Department to decide whether or not to press charges.

The taping

Years after the tobacco bill hubbub, FBI authorities began to investigate Scruggs over an alleged bribery scheme involving supposed plans to funnel $40,000 to a local judge.

During that investigation, agents recorded phone calls, including ones from James Biden, according to the report. At the time, James Biden was reportedly attempting to create a firm with Scruggs partners.

Although James Biden was never implicated in the bribery scheme, Scruggs and some of his partners were ultimately sent to jail.

A lawyer for the president’s brother insisted he was never aware of that scheme and nascent plans for a partnership “never got off the ground.”

Recordings reviewed by the Washington Post showed much of the recorded calls James Biden was on, discussed the potential partnership.

“I told him we had formalized our relationship with you guys,” lawyer Tim Balducci told him during one call.

“I told him about the real Washington presence, that this was not going to be a bulls––, you know, a shingle hung somewhere in the window,” he added. “That this was a real deal, that Sara was coming on, you know, as a named partner, an equity share in the venture, that we were changing the name of the firm to include her.”

“Hunter was going to be involved, and you were going to be involved.”

Scruggs told the Washington Post that he never really intended to be part of that potential venture.

How Scruggs met the Bidens

Scruggs became chummy with Biden’s brother due to his ties with Steve Patterson, an aide to former Sen. John Stennis (D-Miss.), the Washington Post reported.

Stennis was a segregationist who differed dramatically from Biden during his early days in the upper chamber.

The eventual president became friendly with Patterson in the years that followed, as did his brother James. Patterson reportedly connected James and Scruggs during the 1990s.

“Biden wouldn’t have known anybody in Mississippi if not for me. That’s just a fact. I take ownership of that,” Patterson told the outlet. “Biden loved Mississippi.”

5 The president has insisted he was not ensnared in the financial maneuverings of his family. AP

The Post contacted the White House for comment. Scruggs was not available for comment.

The White House has contended there isn’t sufficient evidence to launch an impeachment probe and amplified several Republicans who have publicly aired their misgivings about the inquiry.",
42,,,New York Times reporters form ‘Independence Caucus’ over concerns about union interference,https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/media/new-york-times-reporters-form-independence-caucus-over-concerns-about-union-interference/,"Dozens of New York Times employees have formed a group to stand up for journalistic independence amid concerns the union representing the Times and hundreds of other news organizations is becoming too much of an advocate for various issues.

The newly-formed “Independence Caucus” comprises high-profile journalists like Megan Twohey, Julian Barnes and Emily Bazelon.

It would work within the confines of the NewsGuild-CWA, and would be open to staffers of rival publications, the Wall Street Journal reports.

“We want to articulate the standards many members are required to follow, and why we think they’re important, and undermining them and compromising them for us is a problem,” said Twohey, who was part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team uncovering sexual assault allegations against former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

The caucus “believes that journalists must be able to report freely, following the facts where they lead with an open mind and without outside interference,” according to a document sent by organizers to the Times Guild, a subsidiary of the larger NewsGuild.

According to the Journal, the founding members of the new union were upset by the NewsGuild’s recent actions, including when the union became involved in its coverage of transgender issues and at a recent virtual meeting in which union members debated the merits of issuing a statement calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and an end to US government aid to Israel.

Those in support of the new union said such a move would compromise their neutrality and put colleagues in war zones at risk.

Jacob Bernstein, a reporter for the Styles section, argued that it was a mistake for the union to host such a debate without war correspondents who could speak to the safety concerns.

“What does that say about your commitment to discovery to facts and to our welfare?” he asked.

Others argued that the idea of releasing a statement violates New York Times policy, which states, “Staff members may not march or rally in support of public causes or movements,” the Journal reports.

It also served to some as a reminder that the NewsGuild represents groups with conflicting philosophies and rules.

In the aftermath, Twohey messaged her colleagues on Slack about forming the “Independence Caucus.”

“Our national union has grown by leaps and bounds, and some members do not work at media organizations,” she wrote, according to the message reviewed by the Journal.

“We see this caucus as, in part, a way to continue important conversations in our union about how to respect and balance the different priorities of our broad memberships.”

Matthew Rosenberg, who has been covering the war in Gaza, then replied that he agreed.

“I wish we lived at a time where we could let our work speak for ourselves,” he wrote, according to the Journal.

“We don’t and all too often we sit in silence while colleagues in the media (mostly outside the NYT) take overtly political stances.

“Some of us felt it was time that we spoke up.”

5 The organizers, including Julian Barnes, were especially upset over a recent NewsGuild virtual meeting discussing the possibility of releasing a statement to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. X/@julianbarnes

Others went even further and are reportedly considering ways of breaking away from the NewsGuild altogether, and have even held meetings with lawyers about that possibility, according to the Journal.

Speaking to the outlet, NewsGuild President Jon Schleuss said he supports the forming of a new caucus “and will always support workers coming together debating issues and making our union stronger.”

As to those thinking about leaving the union, he said: “It’s not the way I handle fixing problems. I’m more of the mind, if I want to change something, I get more involved.”

He also denied that the union was taking a stance on the war in Israel, saying the NewsGuild was not actually considering issuing a statement and it simply held the meeting to listen to members who wanted to issue a statement and those who were opposed to the idea.

“We had hundreds of people write to us and call us on all sides,” he told the Journal. “What we had was a listening session to hear from people directly.”

5 The Independence Caucus will exist under the current Times Guild and would be open to journalists from other outlets. AFP via Getty Images

He also said that the NewsGuild has represented organizations “outside of media for a very long time,” saying he believes it’s “good for us” to hold debates.

And he noted that the union’s members and leaders have issued statements and resolutions going back 90 years, when its convention passed a resolution stating that abortion and contraception “should be a personal matter for a woman to decide.”

It reaffirmed that statement last year, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

As state lawmakers wrap up this year’s “lame duck” legislative season, one of the bills being considered is a clean-energy measure. The bill, S2978/A4658, is one of the most ambitious in the country, moving New Jersey toward 100% clean electricity by 2035. But there are still some questions about what counts as “clean” power.

In a packed Senate committee hearing room in Trenton shortly before Thanksgiving, I listened as environmental advocates warned that the bill as written includes “dirty energy” subsidies that benefit corporate polluters and perpetuate environmental injustices in New Jersey’s poorest communities.",
47,,,The truth about Tammy Murphy: Her core claim is bogus | Editorial,https://www.nj.com/opinion/2023/12/the-truth-about-tammy-murphy-her-core-claim-is-bogus-editorial.html,"Tammy Murphy wants to be New Jersey’s first woman to reach the U. S. Senate, and having never held office, she’s presenting herself as the leader of a successful fight to combat our state’s “shameful” maternal death rate and narrow the racial gap that is cursing the Black community today.

Here’s the problem: Neither claim is true. We are making slow progress in some areas, and none in others, still lagging behind neighboring states and the nation as a whole on maternal mortality. As for the racial gap, it is as profound as ever.

While her intentions are obviously good, she cannot reasonably claim success. And while she’s been an important champion of the cause, her claim to be the leader of this effort falls apart under closer examination.

Long before Murphy became the state’s First Lady in 2018, advocates and lawmakers had worked to reduce maternal and infant deaths, as well as the number of unnecessary Cesarean section births, which can cause dangerous complications, with some success. In fact, there is some resentment in the Black community from leaders and advocates who feel pushed aside by the governor’s wife, and sometimes ignored.

“I guess the best way to describe it is, Black women are the implementers, not the leaders and the creators of what should be done. And that, to me, is the error in how this work is being done,” said Nastassia Harris, a registered nurse with a PhD who runs a grassroots organization focused on maternal health in East Orange.

“We’re not deciding the community needs this, we’re not advising the state at that level,” she added. “You know, this is what this pot of money should be spent on.”

* * * * *

The First Lady has made herself a sturdy advocate for the cause, and supports some promising reforms, most of them initiated by the Legislature. One program sends nurses to the homes of mothers with newborns, a pilot program now that will soon be expanded. Another supports the work of doulas, who are trained to provide help before, during, and after a birth.

But some Black lawmakers, once granted anonymity, expressed frustration that the First Lady is taking more credit than she deserves, and has elbowed them out of the spotlight while ignoring some of their own initiatives.

“A lot of times the stuff is just headlines, and she searches for women of color to be the face to give the look of collaboration,” said one legislator.

And while money allocated as part of the First Lady’s campaign, Nurture NJ, has been trickling down through hospital-affiliated associations, Black women trying to provide services to Black mothers and babies in their own communities say change needs to come from the ground up.

“We’re not here to, you know, just have a soundbite,” said Dr. Nicola Pemberton, a Black obstetrician-gynecologist who runs a birthing center for women of color in Union.

The truth is the racial gap has barely budged. Data on maternal and infant health, like first-time, low risk births that end in c-sections, pregnancy complications, premature births and infant deaths, shows virtually no progress on this gap since the Murphys arrived.

“Let’s not forget why this work was being done in the first place,” Harris wrote. “These changes were made to impact Black maternal and infant health outcomes, and you know what? Based on the data, those stats remain unchanged.”

* * * * *

The key statistic Tammy Murphy cites as evidence of her success is that New Jersey has moved up in the national ranking on one important measure, maternal deaths.

“In just three years, the state has gone from ranking 47th in maternal deaths now to 29th. We’ve got a long way to go, but we’ve made real progress on this initiative and so many others. And I’m really proud that New Jersey is now a safer place give birth to a child,” her campaign announcement video said.

But this is a mirage. That sudden jump isn’t because New Jersey improved, said Dr. Ravi Johar, a chief medical officer with United Healthcare, which produces America’s Health Rankings. It’s because other states are doing worse. They’re now seeing more maternal deaths from factors like drug abuse, covid and gun violence.

A spokesperson for the Murphy administration argues that our state did a relatively better job of vaccinating pregnant women, for instance, which is one reason that our maternal death rate didn’t worsen as much as it might have otherwise. Maybe. But even if that’s true, does Tammy Murphy deserve credit for that?

The bottom line is that New Jersey did not make progress on maternal deaths, as she claims. During the same year spans that we made this big leap in the rankings, our state actually went from 23.8 to 24.1 deaths annually, America’s Health Rankings found – a slight increase.

“You’re not better just because others are worse,” Dr. Stacie Geller, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Illinois College of Medicine and a leading expert on maternal mortality, confirmed.

That’s not to say there’s no progress anywhere: Our rates of first-time, low risk births that end in c-sections, premature births and infant death overall have continued to decline slightly, a positive sign. But this all began before she arrived.

“We are absolutely focused on the Black and brown communities; that is the number one group we are working on,” Tammy Murphy told us. “You had mentioned earlier that the statistics haven’t changed – I believe they have changed, but time will tell when we have better benchmarks.”

And of course, the time frame we’re looking at includes the pandemic, she noted, which added its own challenges.

The First Lady, though, is grabbing more than her share of credit. In her campaign announcement video, a newscaster declares that “In New Jersey, First Lady Tammy Murphy has been leading the charge” in this fight to improve maternal health. But when you drill down on the details, it becomes clear that she is not leading this fight. She is more of a promoter and endorser.

Certainly, she’s been doing constructive work, encouraging the investment of private philanthropy, convening experts, helping to develop a playbook with policy recommendations on maternal health to share with other governors, and backing some good initiatives. And, of course, she has the governor’s ear and his support.

In 2019, the Legislature passed a law that established that Medicaid and the state health benefits plan will no longer reimburse for early elective c-sections unless there’s a medical need, to discourage unnecessary surgeries. Tammy Murphy advocated for it and the governor signed it.

Other good initiatives include a newly expanded, voluntary program that sends nurses to the homes of anyone with a newborn, recently adopted child or stillbirth; something formerly done only for families identified as high risk.

The bill that created that program, modeled after Oregon’s, was drafted before the Murphys arrived by Sen. Teresa Ruiz, although they were an asset in the later stages, helping to get it passed and lending the expertise of state agencies to ensure Medicaid coverage for the program. It was signed into law in 2021 and will be rolled out to more counties starting next month.

Tammy Murphy has also championed the use of midwives – clinicians who care for mothers – and birthing coaches called doulas who advocate for patients, with the goal of recruiting more women of color. While most hospitals already allow doulas, she asked legislators to sponsor a bill that would require them to post rules clarifying their right of access.

And as part of a pilot program, the state Department of Health trained more than 260 doulas from cities like Newark and Trenton who have assisted in 655 births. About 80 of those doulas are registered as Medicaid providers after New Jersey joined other states in requiring Medicaid to cover benefits for doulas and midwives in 2021.

The governor included $15 million in his 2023 budget to increase their Medicaid reimbursement rates, a good first step. But doulas say it’s still not a living wage for the amount of hours they put in, and because of red tape, few have actually been able to get reimbursed. Many struggle to stay afloat and serve the women most in need.

“She recognized something needed to be done and she took action,” said Cynthia Hillocs in Camden County, one of the doulas of color trained by the state. “It’s just that all the other pieces need to come together and follow, so that the whole thing can be worthwhile.”

The state has also compiled $75 million for a new maternal health hub planned in Trenton, a key element of Tammy Murphy’s campaign. Its mission is still taking shape, but it will be run by a newly created state authority headed by Ria Rodney, a well credentialed former maternity nurse and doula, and a Black woman.

Many other Black leaders have felt sidelined by the First Lady. Like a group of women at a prominent Black church in Trenton, Greater Mount Zion AME, who want to build a birthing center in a low-income area of the city that has no local birthing options.

“One of the things that I have actually said to the First Lady directly: Our program is just a little drop in the bucket compared to the initiative that she envisions, that they are working to build in the capital city,” said Jeannine LaRue, who chairs the church’s community development board. “We’re too small to even be competitive. We just want to be a partner.”

Murphy failed to acknowledge the AME project when she visited the church in May to talk about her own initiatives. Her office finally put out a strong statement of support for the project in November, after questions from a reporter at NJ Spotlight News.

“That recognition that I have seen in writing speaks volumes of how I feel she should have been talking about our program in the past,” LaRue said.

This is about more than just optics. While hospital-affiliated associations have the capacity to apply for large grants, and are therefore the most sustainable programs, grassroots organizations led by Black women have the trust of their communities, many told us. They should be the primary stakeholders; it can’t be the government or white-led organizations. It has to be the community first.

“We don’t need a champion that’s an ally to tell us how to fix problems,” said Toshira Maldonado, an experienced doula who leads a small group providing services to mothers in Atlantic City. “What we need is our allies, like Tammy Murphy, to champion us and support us, so that we can come up with our own solutions.”

Otherwise, Rosalee Boyer of the AME Church added, “It’s like they’re saying that we are not capable of making decisions for our own selves.”

After these women publicly vented their frustration, the Star-Ledger editorial board pressed the First Lady about it on Dec. 6th.

“I’m not the one on the ground doing the work. I’m the one who’s trying to promote it and to expand upon it,” she said. A Black-run birthing center “is exactly what we need.”

Boyer, who is also known as the “First Lady” as the wife of the minister at AME, was among those picked last week to serve on the board of Tammy Murphy’s maternal health hub in Trenton, another good step.

Community members “are going to have as big a role on this board and this authority as anybody else in the state,” Tammy Murphy told us. “If somebody’s heading in the wrong direction with that authority, in that center, those people are the ones who are able to pull us back and make sure that we are focused on that community.”

* * * * *

All of which leaves us with the final question: How does this work qualify Tammy Murphy for the Senate?

She won’t discuss that. And the answer, in our view, is that it doesn’t come close. Voters have very little to latch onto when assessing this campaign, given that Tammy Murphy has no voting record to scrutinize. She was a Republican for most of her adult life, switching parties at age 49 when her husband began soliciting Democratic support for his 2017 campaign. She wouldn’t discuss that either.

What we are witnessing now is a power play by the governor and Democratic bosses, who are rushing to endorse Tammy Murphy despite her obvious shortcomings because she is the wife of the governor, a man with important leverage over them. Two county chairmen, in Essex and Middlesex, are lobbyists with business before the governor. Others are lawyers with state business. In Bergen, chairman Paul Juliano got a job from Murphy running the NJ Sports and Exposition Authority with a salary of $280,000.

This is not a fair competition, and it is not based on the merits. And thanks to the support of party bosses, she will get a prime spot on the ballot, in a column under Democrats like Joe Biden, and is virtually certain to win the primary against underdog Andy Kim, a three-term House member.

Yes, we’re glad that Tammy Murphy picked the issue of maternal health to champion as First Lady, one that’s important to vulnerable people. She’s done good work and has promising initiatives still unfolding.

But the stats don’t lie: This is not the success that she claims. And even if it were, that’s not enough to qualify her for a seat in the United States Senate.

All three Spirit Airlines flight attendants were sent to an area hospital for further medical evaluation, Jeffrey Lebron, a detective and State Police spokesperson, said in a statement Sunday.

Lebron noted that troopers initially responded at 5:47 a.m. on Sunday to a “medical assist” at the Egg Harbor Township airport.

He added that the flight attendants were performing their preflight checks inside the aircraft when the incident took place.

“The Spirit Airline aircraft was empty at the time of the fumes exposure,” Lebron said Sunday afternoon. “The status of the three flight attendants is unknown at this time.”

The State Police spokesman did not provide more details on the incident or say what exactly the employees came in contact with.

Lebron said all three flight attendants were sent to the hospital for “non-life-threatening injuries.”

Asked about the incident, the South Jersey Transportation Authority — which oversees airport operations — referred questions to Spirit Airlines. The airline did not immediately provide comment.

“Deck the Halls” blares from the speakers in the back lot behind Brooklawn’s Empire Diner. Chappell’s team at Santa’s Tree Lot has just sold another $72 Douglas fir. And a family of four merrily strolls to its minivan as Chappell warms his hands over an open fire.

But the 64-year-old tree salesman isn’t full of Christmas cheer. He can’t unsee the egregious violation of protocol he just witnessed before his blue eyes.

“Yo,” Chappell shouts incredulously, raising his voice for the first and only time all night. “Candy canes!”

A teenager in a pine green hoodie grabs a handful of peppermint and races toward the family to correct the mistake.

The children smile. Christmas crisis averted.

“I live for this,” Chappell said later, huddled inside an old camper turned office lit by the glow of Christmas lights. “This is my time of year.”

Meet Frank “The Tree Guy,” keeper of yuletide spirit. Defender of holiday tradition. Self-styled advocate for the greatest Christmas ritual of all time.

Don’t panic if you don’t see a Fraser fir, he says. Don’t spend $115 for a Douglas in the next town over. And don’t buy a fake tree unless you want “fake Christmas,” the Gloucester City man tells me. With the real Christmas tree market under siege from all sides, Chappell is fighting to preserve an experience he grew up with: buying the perfect parking lot Christmas tree.

At least that’s his pitch. And in the free-wheeling world of Christmas tree lots, the owner is always right.

NJ Advance Media spent a recent Friday evening — the kickoff to one of the busiest tree-selling weekends of the season — at Chappell’s lot for an inside look at an independent Christmas tree operation.

But this life ain’t easy. Rising Christmas tree prices and a national shortage of Fraser and balsam firs could hinder sales this season across the industry. Chappell’s family business also faces competition from larger conglomerates that run several lots. And the existential threat of customers switching to artificial trees swirls in the December wind.

Sales this season are running slightly behind last year’s, Chappell says. But tonight brings a whiplash of skipping children and cautious adults scrutinizing every branch and needle in his Camden County lot.

“I need this weekend,” Chappell tells me during a quiet moment in the four hours I spent with him.

21 1 / 21 Frank Chappell's tree lot behind Empire Diner is buzzing with generations of family members.

A Christmas gamble

Christmas tree lots — sometimes run by independent entrepreneurs like Chappell or fundraising Boys Scouts or local volunteer squads — have long been the retail face connecting rural tree farms and wholesalers to customers in big cities and beyond. Yet there is no association to represent this crucial link in the industry. No data tracking how many lots exist. No regulation aside from the local permitting process, according to Chappell.

Prices vary by city and town, even by the block, giving owners like Chappell free rein to create whatever atmosphere and pricing they want as long as customers keep buying.

Chappell runs Santa’s Tree Lot as part of his Four C’s Seasonal Sales business, which includes Mother’s Day flowers, Halloween pumpkins and mums. But Christmas trees are where the money is.

The secret to his success is twofold, he says: customer service and prices you can stomach. Chappell, who also works in the electronic sign business, has earned a loyal following, it seems.

“Reasonable prices,” said customer Linda Mann of Mount Royal.

“We’re never disappointed,” adds Philadelphia’s Jesse Kahn, a regular.

“I was here yesterday with my cousin, and we got my tree and we got his tree,” said Nick Carney, of West Deptford. “I had to come back again and get one for my mom.”

Chappell puts down a $15,000 deposit every September to order up to 1,000 trees from the same Philadelphia-based wholesaler. The first batches arrive from Oregon and Canada just before Thanksgiving. Every few weeks, Chappell picks up another fresh truckload of the popular Douglas and Fraser firs and pays down his balance as he goes.

An 8-foot tree elsewhere could cost close to $150 this year if you’re searching for the limited supply of Fraser or balsam fir. Chappell wanted 130 Fraser firs this year and received only 30. Yet for those who are less picky — which is most customers — there are more than enough trees to go around.

Tonight Chappell offers just one kind of tree, Douglas fir, at $72 for 6-7 feet, $82 for 7-8 feet and $92 for 8-9 feet.

He hopes to clear about $20 in profit per tree. If he sells 1,000 this season, he’ll realize a $20,000 return on a roughly $35,000 investment, depending on the sizes and types of trees.

But tree lots are built on risk. Unseasonably warm weather can damage the trees. A competitor down the street can undercut prices. Bad weather can devastate turnout. And one or two slow weekends will destroy an entire season.

“Tree lots are kind of a gamble,” said Timothy Waller, an agricultural agent for the Rutgers Cooperative Extension. “Say you buy 100 trees that are cut, and you only sell 50 of them. That’s a 50% loss.”

Heavy rains flooded Santa’s Tree Lot last December right before Christmas and killed business, Chappell said.

He was left with 100 unsold trees, a roughly $5,000 hit to his bottom line.

A family business

Chappell wouldn’t grind in the cold every year if he didn’t make money. But he loves seeing families come together full of holiday cheer, eager to find the perfect tree.

“I grew up that way. My dad would never put a fake tree in,” he said, sounding like many of his customers. “I mean, I’d rather not have a tree at all.”

Chappell’s family went to the same Northeast Philadelphia tree lot every year in the 1960s. His dad would keep the tree in the garage until Christmas Eve morning, then his parents would put it up and give each child their special ornaments for decorating.

As an adult, Chappell turned to tree lots to make extra money when he became a father. He began hauling trees to cars and tying them on roofs beginning in the late 1980s, a natural side job for a man working in construction.

As Chappell learned the business, he realized he could create his own side hustle. He opened his first tree lot around 2010 in a space next to a nearby KFC. He later moved behind the diner at the request of a friend who owned the restaurant at the time. When the diner was sold a few years ago, Chappell’s rent-free agreement came with the property.

In exchange, he plows the lot, decorates the diner with floral and pumpkin arrangements, and this year, donated a Christmas tree.

“I love this,” said diner owner Dervis Akturk, stopping by the lot to chat. “When I see this, families coming together, I’m happy.”

Chappell tries to control what he can. Free candy canes. Free Christmas tree bags. He used to offer tree delivery until the cost and time commitment became too much.

Bellmawr’s Donna Smith has been buying trees from Chappell since his first year. Chappell didn’t have a Fraser fir for her this season, so he got one from Philadelphia and saved it for her at his lot.

“When you have it in the front window, it’s gotta look good all the way around,” Smith tells me as Chappell’s son Frank Chappell III trims the base of the trunk. “I’m so excited about this tree.”

A tree isn’t just a tree, said Mickleton’s Valerie Ryan. It’s a “family identity.”

Ryan wants a skinnier tree. For Mann, it’s a full one. Nine-year-old Kylie Formisano can’t quite describe what she’s looking for. But she’ll know it when she sees it.

“It’s instinct,” the Bellmawr fourth grader said, smiling from ear to ear.

Santa’s Tree Lot is located behind Empire Diner in Brooklawn.Joe Lamberti | For NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Aubrey Bartley, 10, finds exactly what she is looking for, a tall tree with strong branches to hang her favorite “A” ornament right in the middle surrounded by white lights. Her family is in and out in 15 minutes.

Chappell doesn’t try to hard sell his customers. He’s been doing this long enough to realize “they know what they want.” Returning customers are met with a “good to see you again.” Otherwise, his staff simply greets everyone who walks in and says they’re available to help.

“I don’t have to do anything,” Chappell said. “All I have to do is hang (the trees) and let them drop. And they kind of sell themselves.”

These are the memories that the Christmas tree business runs on, according to Chappell. And it’s not only for customers.

Chappell’s three adult children help out at Santa’s Tree Lot. They grew up working with their dad on cold winter nights. Now Chappell’s grandson AJ Fuentes, 2, runs through the trees as Frank’s daughter Taylor Fuentes reminisces.

“We know that Thanksgiving, that’s when tree season starts,” said Fuentes, 24. “It’s my favorite part of Christmas.”

But this season might be one to forget.

When I call Chappell five days later, he said last weekend’s drenching rain forced him to close almost five hours early. He’s now 200 sales behind schedule.

There might be time to make it up. But when you work in the tree lot business, nothing is guaranteed.

“It’s just a roll of the dice,” he said.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — It’s over, yet it’s still going. These games don’t matter, yet they still count. Meager results have made everything about the future of the Washington Commanders’ leadership an obvious decision — fire at will — yet nothing will probably be official until next month. Uncover your Newsprint: Find out what your 2023 reading says about you. ArrowRight The Commanders lost for the 10th time in their past 12 games Sunday. The Los Angeles Rams mostly toyed with them during a 28-20 victory at SoFi Stadium, and let it be known that these Rams shouldn’t be capable of toying with anyone. The Commanders must endure three more weeks of limbo, which is down from four this time a week ago, so at least time still melts away at the same pace.

It feels slower, but I swear it isn’t.

It’s an awkward, irritating, pointless time. For decades, contemptible ownership obstructed any chance to enjoy football, and now that the tumor has been excised, unenjoyable football loiters alone as the problem. You could hibernate until Jan. 6 or 7, when the agonizing season will end against the Dallas Cowboys, and miss little beyond formality. At 4-10 and regressing in every tangible area, the Commanders have created their version of an out-of-office reply for the remainder of the year.

Ron Rivera, the coach and top personnel executive, is more babysitter than architect at this point. This was supposed to be a dignified way to exit. This was supposed to be viewed as the new ownership group showing Rivera respect for helping to hold the organization together by allowing him to finish out a year of wild but promising change. Yet like everything else, the timing of Rivera’s departure seems inconsequential now.

Why keep Rivera? Why fire him? Why do anything besides spike eggnog, eat Christmas cookies and watch sentimental holiday movies? As long as Josh Harris and the new ownership group are prepared to move decisively through a tricky search for a new general manager and head coach, they can delay the inevitable.

Clearly, Harris wants to remain the anti-Daniel Snyder. He wants to be methodical and set a proper organizational tone with how he treats people in a cutthroat sports business that flashes success and failure on a scoreboard. He doesn’t want to be the rash man in charge, to exhaust this honeymoon period with the kind of heedless hiring and firing whims that have tarnished the reputation of Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper. If Harris and the rest of Washington’s new would-be saviors are using the long evaluation period to refine their standards for franchise stability, then this cumbersome period will be forgotten quickly.

Nevertheless, the wait stinks.

The defense, which Rivera took over after firing coordinator Jack Del Rio three weeks ago, allowed the Rams to gain 445 yards. If the Commanders hadn’t forced two fumbles from running back Kyren Williams and played solidly in the red zone in the first half, they would’ve allowed more than 28 points. Los Angeles converted seven of its first eight third down attempts and finished 9 of 16 for the game. Williams ran for 152 of the Rams’ 196 rushing yards. Quarterback Matthew Stafford did what he wanted during a clean 258-yard, two-touchdown performance. Receiver Cooper Kupp discovered his 2021 form, catching eight passes for 111 yards and burning Washington’s benevolent defense for a 62-yard touchdown early in the third quarter.

On special teams, Washington long snapper Camaron Cheeseman — the sixth-round pick Rivera’s front office traded up to draft in 2021 — was terrible all afternoon. Late in the second quarter, he delivered a snap that went dribbling to punter Tress Way, who got clobbered and suffered a back injury and was evaluated for a possible concussion. The Rams turned the mistake into a 27-yard Lucas Havrisik field goal just before halftime.

“That’s not good enough,” Rivera said of Cheeseman’s performance, “and we’re going to evaluate that.”

It’s hard to muster much emotion about whether Rivera will cut a long snapper when the Commanders’ boat is so full of leaks. Cheeseman’s struggles are just another annoyance to throw into a pile of aggravating issues. He was just the player on this day who signified the poor personnel decisions that left Rivera’s team incapable of scaling mediocrity before the collapse this season.

Sadly, someone else figures to be an avatar for mismanagement next week. That’s how the year has gone.

Young quarterback Sam Howell had been reason for hope, and overall, he still has had a productive season for a first-time starter. But for those who were ready to anoint him the franchise quarterback, it’s time to calm down. Howell isn’t putting up deceptively flashy stats anymore in coordinator Eric Bieniemy’s offense.

Advertisement

He completed 11 of 26 passes for a season-low 102 yards against the Rams, connecting on less than 50 percent of his passes for the first time this season. He also threw an interception. In his previous game, on Dec. 3 against the Miami Dolphins, Howell recorded only 127 yards and completed an inefficient 12 of 23 passes in a blowout loss. He has thrown at least one pick in his last four games. During that span, he has two touchdowns and six interceptions.

Since surpassing 300 yards during a splendid three-game stretch against Philadelphia, New England and Seattle, Howell hasn’t been the same player. He looks like a quarterback who has absorbed 59 sacks and been asked to do too much to overcome Washington’s offensive line woes and Bieniemy’s disregard for balance.

On Sunday, he played so poorly that Rivera sat him in the fourth quarter, with the Rams ahead 28-7. Backup Jacoby Brissett proceeded to lead Washington on two touchdown drives that made the game interesting. Afterward, Rivera said Howell remains the starter. There is no quarterback controversy, and if there were one, well, everything is about to change anyway.

“Just trying to take care of him a little,” Rivera said of the switch. “We were pinned back and didn’t want to see anything crazy happen.”

Never knew the phrase “didn’t want to see anything crazy happen” was in the Quarterback Endorsement Guidebook.

But, yeah, whatever.

“It is what it is,” Howell said. “I’ve got to play better, execute better. I know I’m not defined by this one game.”

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The Washington Commanders’ trudge to the end of the season continued Sunday afternoon in a 28-20 loss to the Los Angeles Rams — a loss that was close only because of two fourth-quarter touchdown passes by Jacoby Brissett. The backup quarterback took over in the final quarter after the team sat starter Sam Howell in an effort to protect him; Brissett promptly connected with Terry McLaurin on a 29-yard touchdown and Curtis Samuel for a three-yard score.

The rally from a 28-7 deficit came up short but was impressive enough to raise more questions about the team’s future as it dropped to 4-10 and was officially eliminated from playoff contention.

What now for Howell, the young quarterback Coach Ron Rivera has stood staunchly behind throughout the season? Rivera assured he remains the starter, even though the offense was inept much of the game. And what about the injuries that cropped up in the loss? Defensive tackle John Ridgeway suffered a foot injury in warmups but played through it; left tackle Charles Leno Jr. (calf), center Tyler Larsen (knee) and running back Jonathan Williams (concussion) were ruled out early; and punter Tress Way was nearly taken out while scrambling to recover a botched snap.

More significant: What is actually salvageable from Sunday’s loss — and for this team after its fifth consecutive defeat? Here are three thoughts:

The defense is still a mess.

Washington’s defense remains confounding. On Sunday, it gave up nine explosive plays (defined as runs of at least 12 yards or passes of at least 16 yards), including a 62-yard touchdown reception by wide receiver Cooper Kupp, and it allowed the Rams to collect 445 yards. Washington has given up more than 400 yards to four of its past five opponents and has allowed a 53.0 percent or better conversion rate on third down in each of its past three games.

In the first half Sunday, the Commanders held the Rams to one touchdown on three trips to the red zone and forced two fumbles. Yet they let the Rams convert 7 of 9 third-down attempts in that span. So while they stepped up late in drives, they were a mess early.

The issue continued into the third quarter, when Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford capitalized on a busted coverage for the long touchdown to Kupp only 53 seconds into the half.

Taking a page from the Miami Dolphins, who put Tyreek Hill in motion before sending him outside for a touchdown in Week 13, Stafford went deep to Kupp after he crossed the formation and ran a go route down the sideline. Cornerback Benjamin St-Juste shifted inside on wide receiver Demarcus Robinson and safety Kam Curl hung back, perhaps thinking he had help over the top — but deep safety Percy Butler had moved inside and was in no position to sprint back to the outside and cover Kupp. As the Rams (7-7) celebrated, Butler stood at the goal line with his arms raised as if to say, “What just happened?”

“We just have to switch the receivers, so it was kind of like a miscommunication,” St-Juste explained. “We have two different ways of playing it, and we couldn’t get on the same page at that time. Those types of plays, we just have to completely eliminate those.”

Washington’s secondary cleaned up its play from there, allowing the Rams to convert just 2 of 7 third-down attempts in the half. St-Juste and fellow cornerback Kendall Fuller said that improvement was tied at least in part to a tweak in the scheme.

“I think early on we were running more zone, and when you have a smart quarterback in Matthew Stafford, a smart receiver in Cooper Kupp, they’re able to find the weak spots in the zones,” Fuller said. “... Once we kind of realized that, we realized we had to go to more man coverage.”

But the defensive backs have been out of sync for much of the season, and despite Rivera’s attempt to simplify the defense after firing coordinator Jack Del Rio, the same issues persist.

“We just got to be more disciplined,” Fuller said.

But the offense with Howell was worse.

The defense gave Washington chances by forcing two fumbles. But the offense went three-and-out after each and was a disaster for most of the first three quarters. It wasn’t until Howell sat in the fourth — a decision Rivera said was made in an effort “to take care of him a little bit” — that the offense moved the ball.

In the first half, the Commanders went 1 for 7 on third down and had just 83 yards (44 passing) compared with the Rams’ 242. Washington mustered three first downs in that span as the Rams collected 14.

Worse: The Commanders had four three-and-outs in the first half and squandered their lone trip to the red zone. They made it to the Los Angeles 12-yard line late in the first quarter, but Howell’s pass to tight end Logan Thomas on fourth and one was batted away.

Washington finally got on the board in the third quarter, when Howell threw a 19-yard dart to Samuel. But the Commanders went three-and-out on their subsequent drive, and the Rams padded their lead before Rivera pulled Howell.

“Just kind of how the game was going,” Howell said. “… I got to play better.”

The second-year quarterback has flashed enough potential to maybe warrant a longer look in 2024. But amid the Commanders’ spiral over the past six weeks, his consistency has taken a hit.

Early against the Rams, he appeared to miss at least two opportunities to connect on deep plays — McLaurin seemed to have his defender beaten on Washington’s opening drive, and Williams was open another time. Howell also has thrown at least one interception in four consecutive games; he tossed one Sunday in the fourth quarter when he sailed a pass to McLaurin that the wide receiver tipped before the ball landed in the arms of safety John Johnson III.

When Howell came out in the fourth quarter, the offense started to roll. Brissett quickly connected with McLaurin for the 29-yard score, then found Samuel for another touchdown to pull the Commanders within eight with 1:46 left. The Rams sealed their win by notching a first down after an onside kick went awry.

“Football is football no matter what scheme you’re in, so he understands leverages, he understands where he needs to release the ball,” McLaurin said of Brissett. “... I think with myself being a vet, him being a vet, we just have one of those connections where he feels like he’s comfortable with where I’m going to be and I know how he’s going to place the ball up in the air.”

Howell finished 11 for 26 (42.3 percent) for 102 yards and a 50.5 passer rating. He took one sack (his 59th of the season) and ran for 22 yards. Brissett racked up 124 yards and two touchdowns on 8-for-10 passing. He finished with a 157.9 passer rating — not bad for his first real action of the season.

Asked postgame what has gone wrong with the offense, Rivera said he needs to watch the tape.

“We’re just going to go and evaluate it,” he said.

Long snapping is a major issue.

The good news is that Way is fine. Or, at least, he was good enough to finish the game after getting clobbered late in the second quarter. Long snapper Camaron Cheeseman, who has been inconsistent since training camp, botched his snap so badly that the ball bounced to Way. As he scrambled to cover it, Rams linebacker Troy Reeder came down hard on him.

Way was evaluated for a concussion and a back injury, prompting kicker (and emergency punter) Joey Slye to begin taking snaps from Cheeseman on the sideline at halftime to prepare for the worst-case scenario. But when the Commanders returned, Washington announced that Way was cleared to play, and to quash any doubt he dropped a punt at the Rams’ 8-yard line minutes later.

Washington averted a crisis but has to decide what to do for the season’s final three games.

The botched snap was the second bad one by Cheeseman in the first half but not his last on the day. He added a third on the extra-point attempt in the third quarter and a fourth in the final two minutes, leading to Slye’s try being blocked.

The issues that hindered Cheeseman in training camp are clearly still there — and now they’re putting one of Washington’s best players at risk.

“That’s not good enough, and we’re going to evaluate that,” Rivera said.",[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/
56,,,"North Korea fires another missile in a resumption of weapons testing, South Korea says",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/north-korea-fires-another-missile-in-resumption-of/,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired a second ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast Monday, the South Korean military said.

The South Korean military said in a statement only that the launch was made Monday morning, and gave no further details, such as how far the weapon flew.

Japan’s Defense Ministry also said it detected a suspected ballistic missile launch by North Korea.

The launch came hours after South Korea reported North Korea conducting a short-range ballistic missile test into the sea in a resumption of its weapons testing activities in about a month.

Observers said the North’s back-to-back launches were likely a protest against the moves by South Korea and the United States to bolster their nuclear deterrence plans in the face of North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats.

Senior U.S. and South Korean officials met in Washington over the weekend and agreed to update their nuclear deterrence and contingency strategies and incorporate nuclear operation scenarios in their combined military exercises next summer.

On Sunday, North Korea‘s Defense Ministry slammed its rivals’ move to include nuclear operation scenarios in their joint drills, describing it as an open threat to potentially use nuclear weapons against the North. It vowed to prepare unspecified “offensive countermeasures.”

Animosities between the two Koreas deepened after North Korea launched its first military reconnaissance satellite into space Nov. 21 in violation of U.N. bans.

South Korea, the U.S. and Japan strongly condemned the launch, viewing it as an attempt by the North to improve its missile technology as well as establish a space-based surveillance system.

South Korea announced plans to resume front-line aerial surveillance in response. North Korea quickly retaliated by restoring border guard posts, officials in Seoul said. Both steps would breach a 2018 inter-Korean deal on easing front-line military tensions.",
57,,,Chile rejects conservative constitution after defeating leftist charter,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/chile-rejects-conservative-constitution-after-defe/,"SANTIAGO, Chile — Chilean voters rejected on Sunday a proposed conservative constitution to replace the country’s dictatorship-era charter.

With 96% of votes counted late Sunday, about 55.8% had voted “no” to the new charter, with about 44.2% in favor.

The vote came more than a year after Chileans resoundingly rejected a proposed constitution written by a left-leaning convention and one that many characterized as one of the world’s most progressive charters.

The new document, largely written by conservative councilors, was more conservative than the one it had sought to replace, because it would have deepened free-market principles, reduced state intervention and might have limited some women’s rights.

Javier Macaya, the leader of the conservative Independent Democratic Union party, recognized the defeat and urged the government not to raise the issue again.

“From a perspective of coherence and respect for democracy, we recognize the results,” Macaya said.

If the new charter winds up being rejected, the Pinochet-era constitution - which was amended over the years — will remain in effect.

That is what ex-President Michelle Bachelet had hoped for when she voted early Sunday.

“I prefer something bad to something worse,” said Bachelet, who has campaigned to reject the new constitution.

One of the most controversial articles in the proposed new draft said that “the law protects the life of the unborn,” with a slight change in wording from the current document that some have warned could make abortion fully illegal in the South American country. Chilean law currently allows the interruption of pregnancies for three reasons: rape, an unviable fetus and risk to the life of the mother.

Another article in the proposed document that sparked controversy said prisoners who suffer a terminal illness and aren’t deemed to be a danger to society at large can be granted house arrest. Members of the left-wing opposition have said the measure could end up benefiting those who have been convicted of crimes against humanity during the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.

The new proposed document, which says Chile is a social and democratic state that “promotes the progressive development of social rights” through state and private institutions, was also opposed by many local leaders who say it would scrap tax on houses that are primary residences, a vital source of state revenue that is paid by the wealthiest.

It also would have established new law enforcement institutions and says irregular immigrants should be expelled “as soon as possible.”

César Campos, a 70-year-old taxi driver, turned out early to support the new constitution. He viewed it as a vote against the left, whose ideas largely dominated the first, rejected draft.

“(President Gabriel) Boric wants everybody to be equal,” Campos said. “Why should anyone who studies or works their entire life have to share that?”

The process to write a new constitution began after 2019 street protests, when thousands of people complained about inequality in one of Latin America’s most politically stable and economically strongest countries.

But in 2022, 62% of voters rejected the proposed constitution that would have characterized Chile as a plurinational state, established autonomous Indigenous territories and prioritized the environment and gender parity.

One of the most recent polls, by the local firm Cadem in late November, indicated 46% of those surveyed said they would vote against the new constitution, while 38% were in favor. The difference was much closer than three months ago when the “no” vote was 20 points ahead of the “yes” side.

In Santiago, the capital, talk before the vote often turned to security rather than the proposed charter. State statistics show an uptick in robberies and other violent crimes, a development that tends to benefit conservative forces.

“This whole process has been a waste of government money … it’s a joke,” said government employee Johanna Anríquez, who voted against the new constitution, calling “it is very extremist.”

“Let’s keep the one we have and, please, let’s get on with the work of providing public safety,” Anríquez said.

There appeared to be little enthusiasm for Sunday’s vote. Most citizens are exhausted after 10 elections of various types in less than 2½ years, but voting is compulsory in Chile.

Malen Riveros, 19, a law student at the University of Chile, said the fervor that was ignited by the 2019 street protests has been lost and for her, the choice on Sunday was between the bad or the worse.

“The hopes were lost with the passing of time,” Riveros said. “People have already forgotten why we went into the streets.”",
58,,,Mideast turmoil: Israel criticized after killing hostages; U.S. fends off Houthi drones in Red Sea,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/israel-under-fire-after-hostage-deaths-us-fights-o/,"Israel faced growing pressure Sunday to scale back its relentless military campaign against Hamas while American warships once again clashed with Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, as the U.S. and its allies raced to contain multiple interconnected conflicts raging across the Middle East.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to Israel over the weekend and privately pressed the government to more precisely define its goals in the Gaza Strip and to offer clear metrics for how and when it can shift to the next phase of the campaign.

Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Affairs Minister Annalena Baerbock publicly called for a “sustainable cease-fire” in the Israel-Hamas war. They underscored the rapidly rising global sentiment that it is time for Israel to change course. That sentiment strengthened after Israeli troops mistakenly killed three Hamas-held hostages in Gaza on Friday.

The U.S. and its allies also must contend with escalation elsewhere in the region. An American warship on Saturday shot down 14 attack drones launched by Houthi forces operating in Yemen, Pentagon officials said, marking yet another direct clash between U.S. troops and the Iran-backed rebel group.

The Houthis have launched repeated missile and drone attacks at Israel in the months since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. U.S. warships have intercepted those Houthi attacks multiple times. An American ship came under direct fire from Houthi forces at least once. The Houthis also shot down a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone operating in international airspace off the coast of Yemen.

The downing of the drones on Saturday was especially significant because Mr. Austin arrived in the region. After visiting Israel, Mr. Austin will travel to Bahrain to discuss efforts to stop the Houthi attacks, which pose threats to Israel and the U.S. and international shipping vessels in the densely crowded waterways of the Persian Gulf.

The Houthi attacks have grown more common and more brazen as Israel’s campaign in Gaza drags on. The pressure to wind down that campaign is nearing a fever pitch after the hostage deaths.

The three hostages were reportedly shirtless and waving a white flag when they were shot by Israel Defense Forces personnel.

Israeli officials have publicly apologized for the incident and stressed the chaotic, violent circumstances on the ground in Gaza. Still, the incident has given more fuel to critics who say it’s time for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to adjust his approach, with civilian casualties rising each day and unclear metrics for a clear victory.

Calls for a cease-fire are rising and coming from more prominent voices. On Sunday, Mr. Cameron and Ms. Baerbock penned a joint op-ed for The Sunday Times of London calling for a cessation of hostilities.

“Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today. It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations,” the two European officials said. “We therefore support a cease-fire, but only if it is sustainable.”

Mr. Netanyahu rejected such calls. He said the deaths of the three hostages “broke the hearts of the nation,” but he stressed that now is not the time to end Israel’s war on Hamas.

“We are fighting for our existence, and we have to continue until victory,” he said Sunday, according to The Times of Israel.

U.S. officials also are becoming more vocal about a change in Israel’s approach.

“We do have unacceptably high levels of civilian casualties. We see very loose rules of engagement — way looser than anything the United States would exercise,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Maryland Democrat, told ABC’s “This Week” program on Sunday.

He said the U.S. has a vested interest in the issue because of its strong alliance with Israel and because it is providing direct military aid to the Israeli war effort in Gaza.

“We are with them entirely in the objective of ending the military threat [from Hamas]. But again, we need to make sure that our values are reflected in this so long as we are providing all of this equipment,” Mr. Van Hollen said.

Mr. Austin privately conveyed a similar message to Israeli military officials, though the Pentagon has been careful not to publicly second-guess Israel’s strategy in its counteroffensive against Hamas.

Mr. Austin and his regional counterparts also must contend with the intensifying Houthi threat. During the incident on Saturday, U.S. Central Command said the USS Carney in the Red Sea “successfully engaged 14 unmanned aerial systems launched as a drone wave from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.”

“The UAS were assessed to be one-way attack drones and were shot down with no damage to ships in the area or reported injuries. Regional Red Sea partners were alerted to the threat,” CENTCOM said in a statement on social media.

The White House has accused the Houthis of reckless behavior that could spark a wider war, though the U.S. has opted against direct strikes on Houthi targets inside Yemen. Such a move could escalate the Middle East conflict and derail intensive United Nations-backed peace talks aimed at ending Yemen’s long-running civil war.

Analysts warn that the Houthis have little incentive to stop their attacks. The group is widely seen as even more unpredictable than other Iran-backed outfits in the region, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Shiite militias that have repeatedly targeted U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.

“What’s different about the Houthis is, they don’t have to be careful,” Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who closely tracks Iran-linked militias, told The Washington Times recently.

“The Houthis are just sitting there in Yemen, much farther away than Lebanese Hezbollah is from Israel,” Mr. Knights said. “They’ve been bombed for the last eight, nine years. They have a very high pain threshold. All their leadership is extremely well hidden so the Saudis couldn’t assassinate them during the war. They’re locked down. And they’re actually much more ideologically pure and determined than Lebanese Hezbollah or the militias” backed by Iran.

Mr. Knights described the Houthis as the true “hard-liners” of the Iranian axis of resistance across the Middle East. He said the group has “less to lose” and is “more crazy” than other actors threatening the U.S. and Israel.

But officials made clear that a key topic of discussion will be how and when the current phase of the military campaign ends and the next one begins.

Mr. Austin “has been having discussions with his Israeli counterparts the entire time about the different phases of their campaign, how they assess the different phases of their campaign, and what their operational milestones are in order to feel that their population can be secure enough given their stated objective of the military dismantlement of Hamas,” a U.S. defense official told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday. “He wants to talk to them about how you move through those different phases.”

60,,,‘Absolutely absurd’: Putin rejects Biden’s warning that Russia could attack NATO,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/absolutely-absurd-putin-rejects-bidens-warning-tha/,"American warnings that Russia could launch an attack on NATO‘s eastern flank are “absolutely” absurd” and designed only to justify more U.S. financial support for Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday.

In an interview with Russia‘s Rossiya-1 news outlet, the Russian leader fired back at President Biden’s recent warning that Russian forces could eventually move into Europe and EVEN potentially attack U.S. troops stationed there.

Mr. Biden made those remarks as part of his public justification for a $61.4 billion financial aid package for Ukraine. That plan remains stalled in Congress as Republicans demand that Washington and Kyiv provide a roadmap for how the Ukraine-Russia war eventually ends.

Mr. Biden has not provided such a roadmap but has stressed that U.S.dollars are a key element in keeping Russia from defeating Ukraine and pressing deeper into Europe.

But Mr. Putin said that is little more than fantasy.

“This is absolutely absurd. I believe that President Biden is aware of this. This is merely a figure of speech to support his incorrect strategy against Russia,” Mr. Putin said, according to Russian state-controlled media.

Mr. Biden laid out the nightmarish scenario during remarks at the White House earlier this month.

“If Putin takes Ukraine, he won’t stop there. It’s important to see the long run here. He’s going to keep going. He’s made that pretty clear,” the president said on Dec. 8. “If Putin attacks a NATO ally — if he keeps going and then he attacks a NATO ally — well, we’ve committed as a NATO member that we’d defend every inch of NATO territory. Then we’ll have something that we don’t seek and that we don’t have today: American troops fighting Russian troops, American troops fighting Russian troops if he moves into other parts of NATO.”

Republicans in the House are demanding that the president articulate a clear path to victory for Ukraine before they sign off on the administration’s $61.4 billion funding request. Republicans in both the House and Senate also want more money for U.S.-Mexico border security as part of any Ukraine funding package.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Washington last week to press for more U.S. funding. Since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022, the U.S. has given Ukraine $111 billion.

61,,,U.S. warship shoots down Houthi attack drones as Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin arrives in Middle East,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/us-warship-shoots-down-houthi-attack-drones-as-pen/,"An American warship on Saturday shot down 14 attack drones launched by Houthi forces operating in Yemen, Pentagon officials said, marking yet another direct clash between U.S. troops and the Iran-backed rebel group.

U.S. Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the region, said the Houthis launched the “drone wave” over the Red Sea. Officials did not say what the targets were believed to be, but the Houthis have launched repeated missile and drone attacks aimed at Israel in the months since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an Oct. 7 terror attack on the Jewish state. U.S. warships have intercepted those Houthi attacks multiple times. On at least one occasion, an American ship came under direct fire from Houthi forces.

Saturday’s clash was especially significant because Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in the Middle East over the weekend for a brief multi-nation visit. His trip to the region will include a stop in Bahrain to discuss efforts to stop the Houthi attacks.

“We will talk with them in a multinational framework about the work we’re doing, particularly in light of increasing Houthi aggression in the Red Sea,” a U.S. defense official told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday, previewing the secretary’s trip.

Mr. Austin also is expected to visit the USS Gerald R. Ford, which was dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea shortly after the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. That warship, like other U.S. military assets sent to the Middle East in the weeks after the attack, is meant to deter other actors from capitalizing on the Israel-Hamas clash in the Gaza Strip and expanding the conflict into a wider regional war.

But in the case of the Houthis, America’s deterrence does not seem to be working. Saturday’s incident was the latest in a string of dangerous clashes that have put U.S. troops and commercial shipping vessels in the region’s busy waterways in danger. No one was injured and no ships damaged during Saturday’s incident, officials said.

During the incident, CENTCOM said the USS Carney in the Red Sea “successfully engaged 14 unmanned aerial systems launched as a drone wave from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.”

“The UAS were assessed to be one-way attack drones and were shot down with no damage to ships in the area or reported injuries. Regional Red Sea partners were alerted to the threat,” CENTCOM said in a statement posted on social media.

Earlier this month, a Navy destroyer and three commercial ships came under missile-and-drone fire from the Houthis. In another recent incident, missiles fired by the Houthis landed near American ships in the region, though Pentagon officials say the U.S. vessels weren’t the intended target. And last month, the Houthis shot down a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone operating in international airspace off the coast of Yemen.

The White House has accused the Houthis of reckless behavior that could spark a wider war, though the U.S. so far has opted against direct strikes on Houthi targets inside Yemen. Such a move could itself escalate the Middle East conflict and could derail intensive United Nations-backed peace talks aimed at ending Yemen‘s long-running civil war.

62,,,"Finland seeks jailing, probe of Russian man wanted in Ukraine over alleged war crimes in 2014-2015",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/finland-seeks-jailing-probe-of-russian-man-yan-pet/,"HELSINKI — Finnish police on Sunday sought a court order to imprison a Russian man who had been living under an alias in the Nordic country and is accused of committing war crimes against wounded or surrendered soldiers in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015.

Yan Petrovsky, who had been living in Finland under the name Voislav Torden, is already in Finnish custody but authorities are asking that he be formally jailed while they conduct an investigation into his alleged crimes against Ukrainian soldiers. A court ruling on his imprisonment is expected on Monday.

Finland‘s Supreme Court has ruled that Petrovsky cannot be extradited to Ukraine, where he faces an arrest warrant, due to the risk of inhumane prison conditions there. Sunday’s decision indicates Finnish authorities plan to investigate and possibly try the Russian in Finland, which has signed treaties allowing it to try international crimes.

Petrovsky is currently on the European Union’s sanctions list against Russia for allegedly being a founding member of the far-right group Rusich that is suspected of terrorism crimes in Ukraine and is connected with Russia’s mercenary Wagner Group, the Finnish news agency STT reported.

Petrovsky, who earlier resided in Norway, was taken into custody by Finnish authorities after he was caught at Helsinki Airport in July shortly before he was fly to Nice, France together with his family.

Media reports said he managed to enter Finland despite an EU-wide entry ban with the help of a new identity and his wife’s student status in the Nordic country.

The National Bureau of Investigation - a unit of the Finnish police - provided the imprisonment request for Petrovsky, aged 36, to the Helsinki District Court on Sunday, STT said.

Citing his Finnish lawyer, STT said Petrovsky has denied all war crimes charges against him.

Finland’s National Prosecution Authority on Friday said Petrovsky is suspected of war crimes “committed against wounded or surrendered Ukrainian soldiers during the armed conflict in Ukraine” in 2014-2015 before the start of Moscow’s ongoing assault on Ukraine in February 2022.

“The crimes will be investigated by Finnish authorities, because the suspect cannot be extradited to Ukraine, and the case, as an international crime, falls under the jurisdiction of Finland,” the Finnish prosecutors said in a statement.",
63,,,"Israel finds large tunnel adjacent to Gaza border, raising new questions about prewar intelligence",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/israel-finds-25-mile-tunnel-adjacent-to-gaza-borde/,"BEIT HANOUN, Gaza Strip — The Israeli military said Sunday it has discovered a large tunnel shaft in Gaza close to what was once a busy crossing into Israel, raising new questions about how Israeli surveillance missed such conspicuous preparations by Hamas for the militants’ deadly Oct. 7 assault.

The entryway to the tunnel is just a few hundred yards from the heavily fortified Erez crossing and a nearby Israeli military base.

The military said it stretches for over 2.5 miles, links up with a sprawling tunnel network across Gaza and is wide enough for cars to pass through. The army said Sunday that the tunnel facilitated the transit of vehicles, militants, and supplies in preparation for the Oct. 7 attack.

That day, militants used a rocket-propelled grenade to break past the portion of wall close to the Erez crossing and stormed the base, killing at least three soldiers and kidnapping some back to Gaza, the army said. It was one of several places along the border wall where militants easily blew past Israel’s security defenses, entered Israeli territory and killed some 1,200 people and took about 240 others hostage.

The unprecedented attack triggered a devastating war that has raged for over 10 weeks and claimed over 18,000 lives in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials. Israel says destruction of Hamas’ tunnel network is a major objective and that much of the underground network runs beneath schools, hospitals and residential areas.

Israel’s military, intelligence and political officials have come under heavy criticism for failing to detect the attack ahead of time.

Maj. Nir Dinar, a military spokesperson, said that Israeli security services did not know about the tunnel before Oct. 7 because Israel’s border defenses only detected tunnels meant to enter Israel.

“As far as I know, this tunnel doesn’t cross from Gaza into Israel and stops within 400 meters from the border, which means the indicators won’t indicate that a tunnel is being built,” Dinar said. He added that the entrance, a circular cement opening leading to a cavernous passageway, was located under a garage, hiding it from Israeli drones and satellite images.

While the military was aware that Hamas had an extensive tunnel network, Dinar said they did not think the militants would be able to carry out their plans for a large-scale attack.

“It’s no surprise that this was the Hamas strategy all along,” Dinar said. “The surprise is that they have succeeded and the size of this tunnel … was really shocking.”

The Erez crossing, a fortress-like facility that processed the movement of Palestinians into Israel for work, medical care and transit to neighboring Jordan, held great symbolic value for Hamas. The massive crossing was protected by security cameras and military patrols and the adjacent military base. The crossing suffered heavy damage on Oct. 7 and has not reopened.

The army said its special “Yahalom” unit, which specializes in tunnel warfare, has worked to excavate the tunnel since it was first detected. They say they’ve found weapons inside.

“At this point, this is the biggest tunnel in Gaza,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, told reporters in a tour of the tunnel’s entrance on Friday.

It is unclear if the tunnel was used on Oct. 7.

The army also showed reporters soldiers’ barracks at the nearby base that it said were set ablaze by the militants. They looked like the ashes of a furnace, with blackened walls and smelted bunks. The military announced Friday that it had recovered in Gaza the bodies of two soldiers who were working at the base on Oct. 7.

Dinar, who visited the tunnel Friday, said it was twice the height and three times the width of other tunnels found in Gaza. He said it is equipped with ventilation and electricity and dives 55 yards underground in some points. He said it was clear that millions of dollars as well as a great deal of fuel and workforce had been needed to build and sustain the tunnel.

Hagari said the military planned to destroy the tunnel and continue to “hunt” militants hiding in others.

“We will hunt them even if we need to go down to the tunnels,” Hagari said. “We also need to do it with attention to the rescue of our hostages and the understanding that maybe some of them are in the tunnels.”",
64,,,Serbia’s populists look to further tighten grip on power in tense election,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/serbias-populists-president-aleksandar-vuc-look-to/,"BELGRADE, Serbia — President Aleksandar Vucic is looking to further tighten his grip on power in Serbia in an election on Sunday that has been marred by reports of major irregularities during a tense campaign.

The main contest in the parliamentary and local elections is expected to be between Vucic’s governing Serbian Progressive Party, or SNS, and a centrist coalition that is trying to undermine the populists who have ruled the troubled Balkan state since 2012.

The Serbia Against Violence opposition coalition group of parties is expected to mount the biggest challenge for the city council in Belgrade. An opposition victory in the capital would seriously dent Vucic’s hard-line rule in the country, analysts say.

“Changes in Serbia have started and there is no force that can stop that,” said Dragan Djilas, the opposition coalition leader, after he voted in Belgrade. “We, as the strongest opposition list, will defend people’s will by all democratic means.”

Vucic said that he expects “a convincing victory” in the vote and that his ruling party “will be close to an absolute majority” in the parliamentary election.

“This is a very important precondition for Serbia to continue on the path of prosperity and success,” he said after he cast his ballot.

Some irregularities were reported by election monitors and independent media during the vote on Sunday, including Serbs from neighboring Bosnia voting at a sports hall in Belgrade that isn’t an official polling station and a monitoring team being attacked and their car being bashed with baseball bats in a town in northern Serbia.

Several right-wing groups, including pro-Russia parties and Socialists allied with Vucic are also running for control of the 250-seat parliament and local councils in around 60 cities and towns, as well as regional authorities in the northern Vojvodina province.

The election doesn’t include the presidency, but governing authorities backed by dominant pro-government media have run the campaign as a referendum on Vucic.

Although he isn’t formally on the ballot, the Serbian president has campaigned relentlessly for the SNS, which appears on the ballot under the name “Aleksandar Vucic - Serbia must not stop!” The main opposition Serbia Against Violence, a pro-European Union bloc, includes parties that were behind months of street protests this year triggered by two back-to-back mass shootings in May.

The Serbian president has been touring the country and attending his party’s rallies, promising new roads, hospitals and one-off cash bonuses. Vucic’s image is seen on billboards all over the country, though he has stepped down as SNS party leader.

Even before the vote started on Sunday, campaign monitors reported pressure on voters, fearmongering and abuse of public office and institutions fostered by the authorities. There have also been reports of vote-buying and voter-bribing.

Serbia, a Balkan country that has maintained warm relations with Russia and President Vladimir Putin, has been a candidate for EU membership since 2014, but has faced allegations of steadily eroding democratic freedoms and rules over the past years.

Both Vucic and the SNS have denied allegations of campaign abuse and attempted vote-rigging, as well as charges that Vucic as president is violating the constitution by campaigning for one party.

Hardly any of the complaints or recommendations by local and foreign observers have resulted in changes in the voting process.

Vucic called the Dec. 17 early vote only a year and a half after a previous parliamentary and presidential election, although his party holds a comfortable majority in the parliament.

Analysts say Vucic is seeking to consolidate power after two back-to-back shootings triggered months of anti-government protests, and as high inflation and rampant corruption fueled public discontent. Vucic has also faced criticism over his handling of a crisis in Kosovo, a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008, a move that Belgrade doesn’t recognize.

His supporters view Vucic as the only leader who can maintain stability and lead the country into a better future.

“I think it’s time that Serbia goes forward with full steam,” retiree Lazar Mitrovic said after he voted. “That means that it should focus on its youth, on young people, education and of course discipline.”

Major polling agencies have refrained from publishing preelection surveys, citing fear among Serbia’s 6.5 million eligible voters and high polarization.

65,,,Russia’s ruling party backs Putin’s reelection bid while a pro-peace candidate clears first hurdle,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/russias-ruling-party-backs-vladimir-putins-reelect/,"MOSCOW — Delegates from Russia’s ruling party unanimously backed President Vladimir Putin’s bid for reelection at a party conference in Moscow on Sunday, state agencies reported, just a day after the Kremlin leader’s supporters formally nominated him to run in the 2024 presidential election as an independent.

A little-known Russian presidential hopeful who calls for peace in Ukraine also inched closer to formally registering as a candidate, securing a nomination from a group of more than 500 supporters in the Russian capital.

Dmitry Medvedev, United Russia’s chairman and a former Russian president and prime minister, called on fellow party members to “mobilize all activists and supporters” in support of Putin before the vote, scheduled for March 15-17, according to reports by Russian state agencies.

In a speech at the conference, Medvedev referred to Putin as “our candidate,” and asserted that his reelection for a fifth term as head of state “should be absolutely logical, legitimate and absolutely indisputable.”

“We must mobilize all activists, all supporters in order to prevent any disruptions during the election campaign, stop any attempts to influence the course of the campaign from the outside, arrange provocations, disseminate false, harmful information or violate public order,” Medvedev said.

Analysts have described Putin’s reelection as all but assured, given the tight control he has established over Russia’s political system during his 24 years in power. Prominent critics who could challenge him on the ballot are either in jail or living abroad, and most independent media have been banned within Russia.

On Saturday, a group including top officials from the United Russia party, prominent Russian actors, singers, athletes and other public figures formally nominated Putin to run as an independent.

The nomination by a group of at least 500 supporters is mandatory under Russian election law for those not running on a party ticket. Independent candidates also need to gather signatures from at least 300,000 supporters in 40 or more Russian regions.

Hours before United Russia delegates announced their endorsement of Putin on Sunday, a former journalist and mom-of-three from a small town in western Russia cleared the initial hurdle, according to Telegram updates by Sota, a Russian news publication covering the opposition, protests and human rights issues. Yekaterina Duntsova’s candidacy was formally backed by a group of 521 supporters at a meeting in Moscow, Sota reported.

A former local legislator who calls for peace in Ukraine and the release of imprisoned Kremlin critics, Duntsova has spoken of being “afraid” following the launch of her bid for the presidency, and fears that Russian authorities might break up the supporters’ meeting set to advance it.

According to Sota, electricity briefly went out at the venue where Duntsova’s supporters were gathered, but the meeting was otherwise unimpeded.

The Kremlin leader has used different election tactics over the years. He ran as an independent in 2018 and his campaign gathered signatures. In 2012, he ran as a United Russia nominee instead.

At least one party - A Just Russia, which has 27 seats in the 450-seat State Duma - was willing to nominate Putin as its candidate this year. But its leader, Sergei Mironov, was quoted by the state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday as saying that Putin will be running as an independent and will be gathering signatures.

Under constitutional reforms he orchestrated, the 71-year-old Putin is eligible to seek two more six-year terms after his current term expires next year, potentially allowing him to remain in power until 2036.",
66,,,European diplomacy steps up calls for Gaza cease-fire,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/european-allies-step-up-calls-for-gaza-cease-fire/,"JERUSALEM — Some of Israel’s closest European allies pressed for a cease-fire in the war with Hamas on Sunday, underscoring growing international unease with the devastating impact of the conflict on Gaza’s civilian population.

The concerted push by top European diplomats comes before a visit to Israel on Monday by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is also expected to put pressure on Israeli leaders to end the war’s most intense phase and transition to a more targeted strategy against Hamas.

Western allies of Israel have increasingly expressed concern with civilian casualties and the mass displacement of 1.9 million Palestinians - nearly 85% of Gaza’s population - though the U.S. has continued to provide vital military and diplomatic support to its close ally.

In a joint article in British newspaper The Sunday Times, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Affairs Minister Annalena Baerbock called for a cease-fire and said “too many civilians have been killed. The Israeli government should do more to discriminate sufficiently between terrorists and civilians, ensuring its campaign targets Hamas leaders and operatives.”

“Israel will not win this war if its operations destroy the prospect of peaceful coexistence with Palestinians,” they said. They said the cease-fire should take place as soon as possible, but also said it must be “sustainable.”

At a news conference with her Israeli counterpart in Tel Aviv on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna also pushed for a cease-fire.

“An immediate truce is necessary, allowing progress to be made toward a cease-fire to obtain the release of the hostages, to allow access and the delivery of more humanitarian aid to the suffering civilian population of Gaza, and in fact to move toward a humanitarian cease-fire and the beginning of a political solution,” she said.

Britain has previously called for “humanitarian pauses” in the conflict but stopped short of urging an immediate cease-fire. It abstained last week when the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly voted for a cease-fire.

France and Germany both supported the call for a cease-fire at the U.N., and French President Emmanuel Macron said at the beginning of November that Israel couldn’t fight terrorism by killing innocent people.

The increase in diplomatic pressure comes as domestic calls are also likely to grow for renewed negotiations with Hamas, following the killing of three Israeli hostages by the military on Friday.

The air and ground war has flattened vast swaths of northern Gaza and driven most of the population to the southern part of the besieged territory, where many are packed into crowded shelters and tent camps. The offensive has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants.

Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets in all parts of Gaza. It has vowed to continue operations until it dismantles Hamas, which triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel, in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel has also vowed to return the estimated 129 hostages still held in Gaza.

A group of European lawmakers also called for a cease-fire in Gaza following their trip to the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt over the weekend to see how European aid is helping Palestinians in Gaza. The four are centrist members of the European Parliament from Sweden, France, and Ireland.

Abir Al Sahlani of Sweden that said a cease-fire is urgently needed to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

“We found out that no matter how much we are going to send, it doesn’t matter, because there is no cease-fire and there is no security as long as there are bombs - Israeli bombs falling on the Palestinian people,” Al Sahlani said.

“The only way is political pressure on both sides,” she added, urging international players “to pressure, first and foremost, the (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu government and (his) Likud (party) and his right-wing government to stop the bombing of civilians and respect and follow international humanitarian law.”",
67,,,"Church of England blesses same-sex couples for the first time, but they still can’t wed in church",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/church-of-england-blesses-same-sex-couples-for-fir/,"LONDON — Church of England priests offered officially sanctioned blessings of same-sex partnerships for the first time on Sunday, though a ban on church weddings for gay couples remains in place amid deep divisions within global Anglicanism over marriage and sexuality.

In one of the first ceremonies, the Rev. Catherine Bond and the Rev. Jane Pearce had their union blessed at St John the Baptist church, in Felixstowe, eastern England, where both are associate priests.

The couple knelt in front of Canon Andrew Dotchin, who held their heads as he gave “thanks for Catherine and Jane, to the love and friendship they share, and their commitment to one another as they come before you on this day.”

The church’s national assembly voted in February to allow clergy to bless the unions of same-sex couples who have had civil weddings or partnerships. The words used for the blessings, known as prayers of love and faith, were approved by the church’s House of Bishops on Tuesday and used for the first time on Sunday.

The compromise was struck following five years of discussions about the church’s position on sexuality. Church leaders offered an apology for the church’s failure to welcome LGBTQ people, but also endorsed the doctrine that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. Clergy won’t be required to perform same-sex blessings if they disagree with them.

The blessings can be used in regular church services. The church’s governing body has also drawn up a plan for separate “services of prayer and dedication” for same-sex couples that would resemble weddings, but it has not yet been formally approved.

Public opinion surveys consistently show that a majority of people in England support same-sex marriage, which has been legal since 2013. The church didn’t alter its teaching on marriage when the law changed.

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said he won’t personally bless any same-sex couples because it’s his job to unify the world’s 85 million Anglicans. Welby is the spiritual leader of both the Church of England and the global Anglican Communion of which it is a member.

Several Anglican bishops from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific said after the February decision that they no longer recognize Welby as their leader.",
68,,,Israel faces new calls for truce after killing of hostages raises alarm about its conduct in Gaza,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/israel-faces-new-calls-for-truce-after-killing-of-/,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel‘s government faced calls for a cease-fire from some of its closest European allies and from protesters at home on Sunday after a series of shootings, including of three hostages who waved a white flag, added to mounting concerns about its conduct in the 10-week-old war in Gaza.

The protesters urge the government to renew hostage negotiations with Gaza‘s Hamas rulers, whom it has vowed to destroy. Israel could also face pressure to scale back major combat operations when U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visits this week, as Washington has expressed growing unease with civilian casualties even while providing vital military and diplomatic support.

The air and ground war has flattened large parts of northern Gaza, killed thousands of civilians and driven most of the population to the southern part of the besieged territory, where many are packed into crowded shelters and tent camps. Some 1.9 million Palestinians - nearly 85% of Gaza’s population - have fled their homes.

They are surviving off a trickle of humanitarian aid. Israel said that starting Sunday, U.N. aid trucks would be able to enter Gaza from a second location, Kerem Shalom.

In a sign of desperation, dozens of Palestinians surrounded aid trucks after they drove in through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, forcing some to stop before climbing aboard, pulling boxes down and carrying them off. Other trucks appeared to be guarded by masked people carrying sticks.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “will continue to fight until the end,” with the goal of eliminating Hamas, which triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and captured scores of hostages.

PHOTOS: Israel faces new calls for truce after killing of hostages raises alarm about its conduct in Gaza

Netanyahu vowed to bring back the estimated 129 hostages still in captivity. Anger over the mistaken killing of hostages is likely to increase pressure on him to renew Qatar-mediated negotiations with Hamas over swapping more of the remaining captives for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.

Israeli media reported that David Barnea, the head of Israel‘s Mossad spy agency, met over the weekend with Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who has mediated with Hamas, to discuss renewed talks.

Gaza meanwhile remained under a communications blackout for a fourth straight day, the longest of several outages during the war. Aid groups say they complicate rescue efforts and make it even more difficult to monitor the toll on civilians.

In Israel on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna called for an “immediate truce” aimed at releasing more hostages, getting larger amounts of aid into Gaza and moving toward “the beginning of a political solution.”

France’s Foreign Ministry earlier said one of its employees was killed in an Israeli strike on a home in Rafah on Wednesday. It condemned the strike, which it said had killed several civilians, and demanded clarification from Israeli authorities.

The foreign ministers of the U.K. and Germany, meanwhile, called for a “sustainable” cease-fire, saying “too many civilians have been killed.”

“Israel will not win this war if its operations destroy the prospect of peaceful co-existence with Palestinians,” British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote in the U.K.’s Sunday Times.

The U.S. defense secretary is set to travel to Israel to continue discussions on a timetable for ending the war’s most intense phase. Israeli and U.S. officials have spoken of a transition to more targeted strikes aimed at killing Hamas leaders and rescuing hostages, without saying when it would occur.

Scores of protesters set up tents outside the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on Saturday, saying they would stay until the government resumed hostage negotiations with Hamas. “The hostages are experiencing hell and they are in mortal peril,” said Raz Ben-Ami, a hostage released in the last exchange. “Israel must offer another hostage-release deal.”

Hamas has said no more hostages will be released until the war ends, and that in exchange it will demand the release of large numbers of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile militants.

Hamas released over 100 of more than 240 hostages captured on Oct. 7 in exchange for the release of scores of Palestinian prisoners during a brief cease-fire in November. Nearly all freed on both sides were women and minors. Israel has rescued one hostage.

Military officials said Saturday that the three hostages who were mistakenly shot by Israeli troops had tried to signal that they posed no harm. It was Israel‘s first such acknowledgement of harming hostages in a war that it says is largely aimed at rescuing them.

The three hostages, all in their 20s, were killed Friday in the Gaza City area of Shijaiyah, where troops are engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas. An Israeli military official said the shootings were against the army’s rules of engagement and were being investigated at the highest level.

Israel says it makes every effort to avoid harming civilians and accuses Hamas of using them as human shields. But Palestinians and rights groups have repeatedly accused Israeli forces of recklessly endangering civilians and firing on those who do not threaten them, both in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, which has seen a surge of violence since the start of the war.

Pope Francis on Sunday called for peace, saying “unarmed civilians are being bombed and shot at, and this has even happened inside the Holy Family parish complex, where there are no terrorists but families, children and sick people with disabilities, nuns.” He spoke after the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women at a church compound in Gaza were killed by Israeli sniper fire.

At least five Palestinians were killed during an Israeli raid in a built-up refugee camp in the West Bank town of Tulkarem, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Sunday.

In Gaza, Palestinians on several occasions have said Israeli soldiers opened fire at fleeing civilians. Hamas has claimed other hostages were killed by Israeli fire or airstrikes, without presenting evidence.

The offensive has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory said Thursday. It has not been able to update the toll since then because of the communications blackout, and has said for weeks that thousands more casualties are buried under the rubble.

The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but throughout the war has said that most of those killed were women and children.

The plight of Palestinian civilians has gotten little attention inside Israel, where many are still deeply traumatized by the Oct. 7 attack and where support for the war remains strong.

Israel‘s military says 121 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive. It says it has killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence.

69,,,The jungle between Colombia and Panama becomes a highway for migrants from around the world,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/darien-jungle-between-colombia-panama-becomes-high/,"MEXICO CITY — Once nearly impenetrable for migrants heading north from Latin America, the jungle between Colombia and Panama this year became a speedy but still treacherous highway for hundreds of thousands of people from around the world.

Driven by economic crises, government repression and violence, migrants from China to Haiti decided to risk three days of deep mud, rushing rivers and bandits. Enterprising locals offered guides and porters set up campsites and sold supplies to migrants, using color-coded wristbands to track who had paid for what.

Enabled by social media and Colombian organized crime, more than 506,000 migrants - nearly two-thirds Venezuelans - had crossed the Darien jungle by mid-December, double the 248,000 who set a record the previous year. Before last year, the record was barely 30,000 in 2016.

Dana Graber Ladek, the Mexico chief for the United Nation’s International Organization for Migration, said migration flows through the region this year were “historic numbers that we have never seen.”

It wasn’t only in Latin America.

The number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean or the Atlantic on small boats to reach Europe this year has surged. More than 250,000 irregular arrivals were registered in 2023, according to the European Commission.

PHOTOS: The jungle between Colombia and Panama becomes a highway for migrants from around the world

A significant increase from recent years, the number remains well below levels seen in the 2015 refugee crisis, when more than 1 million people landed in Europe, most fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. Still, the rise has fed anti-migrant sentiment and laid the groundwork for tougher legislation.

Earlier this month, the British government announced tough new immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people able to move to the U.K. each year by hundreds of thousands. Authorized immigration to the U.K. set a record in 2022 with nearly 750,000.

A week later, French opposition lawmakers rejected an immigration bill from President Emmanuel Macron without even debating it. It had been intended to make it easier for France to expel foreigners considered undesirable. Far-right politicians alleged the bill would have increased the number of migrants coming to the country, while migrant advocates said it threatened the rights of asylum-seekers.

In Washington, the debate has shifted from efforts early in the year to open new legal pathways largely toward measures to keep migrants out as Republicans try to take advantage of the Biden administration’s push for more aid to Ukraine to tighten the U.S. southern border.

The U.S. started the year opening limited spaces to Venezuelans - as well as Cubans, Nicaraguans and Haitians - in January to enter legally for two years with a sponsor, while expelling those who didn’t qualify to Mexico. Their numbers dropped somewhat for a time before climbing again with renewed vigor.

Venezuelan Alexander Mercado had only been back in his country for a month after losing his job in Peru before he and his partner decided to set off for the United States with their infant son.

Venezuela’s minimum wage was the equivalent of about $4 a month then, while 2.2 pounds of beef was about $5, said Angelis Flores, his 28-year-old wife.

“Imagine how someone with a salary of $4 a month survives,” she said.

Mercado, 27, and Flores were already on their way when in September the U.S. announced it was granting temporary legal status to more than 470,000 Venezuelans already in the country. Weeks later, the Biden administration said it was resuming deportation flights to the South American nation.

Mercado and Flores hiked the well-trod trail through the jungle, managing to push through in three days. Flores and their son, in particular, got very sick. She believes they were infected by the contaminated water they drank along the way.

“There was a body in the middle of river and the ‘zamuros’, those black birds, were eating it and picking it apart … all of that was running in the river,” she said.

For Mercado and Flores, the journey accelerated once they left the jungle. In October, Panama and Costa Rica announced a deal to speed migrants across their countries. Panama bused migrants to a center in Costa Rica where they were held until they could buy a bus ticket to Nicaragua.

Nicaragua also seemed to opt for speeding migrants through its territory. Mercado said they crossed on buses in a day.

After discovering that Nicaragua had lax visa requirements, Cubans and Haitians poured into Nicaragua on charter flights, purchasing roundtrip tickets they never intended. Citizens of African nations made circuitous series of connecting flights through Africa, Europe and Latin America to arrive in Managua to start travelling overland toward the United States, avoiding the Darien.

In Honduras, Mercado and Flores were given a pass from authorities allowing them five days to transit the country.

Adam Isacson, an analyst tracking migration at the Washington Office on Latin America, said that Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras grant migrants legal status while they’re transiting the countries, which have limited resources, and by letting migrants pass legally the countries make them less vulnerable to extortion from authorities and smugglers.

Then there are Guatemala and Mexico, which Isacson called the “we’re-going-to-make-a-show-of-blocking-you countries” attempting to score points with the U.S. government.

For many that has meant spending money to hire smugglers to cross Guatemala and Mexico, or exposing themselves to repeated extortion attempts.

Mercado didn’t hire a smuggler and paid the price. It was “very difficult to get through Guatemala,” he said. “The police kept taking money.”

But that was just a taste of what was to come.

Standing outside a Mexico City shelter with their son on a recent afternoon, Flores recounted all of the countries they had traversed.

“But they don’t rob you as much, extort you as much, send you back like when you arrive here to Mexico,” she said. “Here the real nightmare starts, because as soon as you enter they start taking a lot of your money.”

Mexico‘s immigration system was thrown into chaos on March 27, when migrants held in a detention center in the border city Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, set mattresses on fire inside their cell in apparent protest. The highly flammable foam mattresses filled the cell with thick smoke in an instant. Guards did not open the cell and 40 migrants died.

The immigration agency’s director was among several officials charged with crimes ranging from negligence to homicide. The agency closed 33 of its smaller detention centers while it conducted a review.

Unable to detain many migrants, Mexico instead circulated them around the country, using brief, repeat detentions, each an opportunity for extortion, said Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental legal services organization. Advocates called it the “politica de desgaste” or wearing down policy.

Mercado and Flores made it all the way to Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, where they were detained, held for a night in an immigration facility in the border city of Reynosa and then flown the next morning 650 miles south to Villahermosa.

There they were released, but without their cell phones, shoelaces and money. Mercado had to wait for his brother to send $100 so they could start trying to make their way back to Mexico City through an indirect route that required them to travel by truck, motorbike and even horse.

In late November, they had just made it back to Mexico City again. This time Mercado was unequivocal: They would not leave Mexico City until the U.S. government gave them an appointment to request asylum at a border port of entry.

“It is really hard to make it back here again,” he said. “If they manage to send me back again I don’t know what I would do.”

70,,,South Korea’s military says North Korea has fired a ballistic missile toward its eastern waters,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/south-korea-says-north-korea-has-fired-ballistic-m/,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s military said Sunday that it had detected that North Korea fired at least one ballistic missile toward its eastern waters, adding to a torrent of weapons’ tests in recent months that has elevated tensions.

South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t immediately say what type of missile it was or how far it flew.

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest in years, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerating the expansion of his nuclear and missile program, and flaunting an escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons.

The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by increasing the visibility of their trilateral partnership in the region, and strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim condemns as invasion rehearsals.

North Korea’s latest launch followed high-level security talks between American and South Korean officials in Washington over the weekend, where they agreed on plans to incorporate nuclear operation scenarios in their combined military exercises next year to cope with the North’s evolving threats, according to details announced by Seoul’s presidential office.

In the face of North Korean threats, South Korea has been seeking stronger reassurances from the United States that it would swiftly and decisively use its nuclear capabilities to defend its ally in the event of a North Korean nuclear attack.

The North has test-fired more than 100 missiles since the start of 2022 as Kim used the distraction caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine to speed up the expansion of his military nuclear program, which he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.

The weapons that North Korea tested in recent months included intercontinental ballistic missiles that demonstrated a potential range to reach the U.S. mainland, and a series of launch events the North described as simulated nuclear attacks on targets in South Korea.

Last month, North Korea also launched its first military reconnaissance satellite, which Kim described as a crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles.

Washington and its allies have also expressed concerns about a potential arms alignment between North Korea and Russia. They worry that Kim is providing badly needed munitions to help Russian President Vladimir Putin wage war in Ukraine in exchange for Russian technology assistance to upgrade his nuclear-armed military.",
71,,,Russia and Ukraine launch numerous drone attacks targeting a Russian air base and Black Sea coast,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/russia-ukraine-launch-numerous-drone-attacks-targe/,"KYIV, Ukraine — Russia and Ukraine launched over a dozen drones at each other’s territory for a second straight day Sunday, one of which apparently targeted a Russian military airport.

At least 35 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight over three regions in southwestern Russia, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a post on the messaging app Telegram.

A Russian air base hosting bomber aircraft used in the war in Ukraine was among the targets, according to a Russian Telegram channel critical of the Kremlin. The channel posted short videos of drones flying over low-rise housing in what it claimed was the Russian town of Morozovsk, whose air base is home to Russia’s 559th Bomber Aviation Regiment.

Vasily Golubev, the governor of Russia’s Rostov province, separately reported “mass drone strikes” near Morozovsk and another town farther west, but did not mention the air base. Golubev said most of the drones were shot down and there were no casualties. He did not comment on damage.

Also Sunday morning, Ukraine’s air force said it shot down 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched overnight by Russian troops in southern and western Ukraine, as well as one X-59 cruise missile launched from the country’s occupied south.

A civilian was killed overnight near Odesa, a key port on Ukraine’s southern Black Sea coast, after the remnants of a destroyed drone fell on his house, Ukraine’s military said.

Stepped-up drone attacks over the past month come as both sides are keen to show they aren’t deadlocked as the war approaches the two-year mark. Neither side has gained much ground despite a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June.

Russian shelling on Sunday also killed an 81-year-old man in central Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that was recaptured by Kyiv‘s forces last fall, according to the head of its municipal military administration.

Ukrainian and Russian forces exchanged fire outside Terebreno, a Russian village just miles from the Ukrainian border, according to Telegram posts by Gov. Vasily Gladkov. He did not provide details, but insisted Russian authorities had the situation “under control.”

According to Baza, a Telegram news channel set up by Russian journalists critical of the Kremlin, fighting between Russian troops and a “Ukrainian diversionary group” began around 11 a.m. near Terebreno, home to some 200 people, forcing residents to hide in shelters.

While cross-border raids on Russian territory from Ukraine are rare, the Russian military claimed in May to have killed more than 70 attackers, describing them as Ukrainian military saboteurs, in a 24-hour battle. Kyiv portrayed the incident as an uprising against the Kremlin by Russian partisans.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, meanwhile, welcomed what he called a sea change in Germany’s approach toward Kyiv’s EU membership bid.

In an interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper, Dmytro Kuleba said that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has won “sincere and well-deserved admiration” among Ukrainians for his role in the EU’s recent decision to open membership talks for Kyiv.

Ukraine has long faced strong opposition in its attempts to join the 27-member bloc from Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has repeatedly spoken of his desire to maintain close ties with Russia.

Scholz said that at an EU summit last week he proposed that Orban leave the room to enable the summit to launch accession talks with Ukraine, something the Hungarian leader agreed to do.

“What German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did at the summit to remove the threatened Hungarian veto will go down in history as an act of German leadership in the interests of Europe. The chancellor has this week won a lot of sincere and well-deserved admiration in the hearts of Ukrainians,” Kuleba told Bild.

He also voiced hope that Scholz’ actions would mark a “broader and irreversible shift” in Berlin’s approach towards EU negotiations with Kyiv.

“When I campaigned in Berlin last May to grant Ukraine EU candidate status, my appeals to Germany to take the lead in this process mostly fell on deaf ears. ‘Germany doesn’t want to lead,’ experts and politicians in Berlin told me. I am glad that German political decisions have changed since then,” Kuleba said.

The Ukrainian government has long cast EU and NATO membership as key foreign policy goals and the EU’s decision to start accelerated negotiations gave Kyiv a major boost - although it could be years before it is able to join. NATO leaders, meanwhile, have so far set no clear timeline for Kyiv‘s membership bid, even as Moscow’s all-out aggression against Ukraine led another of Russia‘s neighbors, Finland, to be accepted into the military alliance in April.

Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to build up military units near the Russian-Finnish border. The Kremlin leader declared, without giving details, that Helsinki’s NATO accession would create “problems” for the Nordic country.

“There were no problems (between Russia and Finland). Now, there will be. Because we will create (a new) military district and concentrate certain military units there,” he told Russian state TV on Sunday morning.

72,,,"Convent-made delicacies, a Christmas favorite, help monks and nuns win fans and pay the bills",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/convent-made-christmas-favorites-help-monks-and-nu/,"MEXICO CITY — It’s the fortnight before Christmas and all through the world’s Catholic convents, nuns and monks are extra busy preparing the traditional delicacies they sell to a loyal fan base even in rapidly secularizing countries.

For many monastic communities, especially those devoted to contemplative life and with vows of poverty, producing cookies, fruitcakes, even beer for sale is the only means to keep the lights on.

But it’s also an enticing way to strengthen their ties with lay people who flock to their doors - and in some cases their websites - in the holiday season.

“Our kitchen is a witness to God’s love to those outside,” said Sister Abigail, one of the 10 cloistered nuns of the Perpetual Adorers of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Mexico City.

“We are in the Lord’s presence, and we’re always thinking that it will make someone happy, the person who will eat this, or they will gift it and someone will receive it with joy,” added the sister, whose convent makes sweets, eggnog and its bestseller, tamales.

Most monasteries have to be financially self-sufficient. Many in countries like Spain have to maintain not only an aging, shrinking cohort of monks and nuns, but also monumental, centuries-old buildings, said Fermín Labarga, a professor of church history at the University of Navarra in Pamplona.

Since the small-scale farming with which they supported themselves for centuries stopped being profitable decades ago, most have turned to crafts, including the wildly popular gourmet food production that uses only homemade ingredients and recipes passed down generations.

“An immense majority of people goes to buy the nuns’ sweets,” said Pipa Algarra, who in her 90 years in the southern Spanish city of Granada has come to know each of the dozens of convents’ specialties. Among the oldest is alfajor, a cookie with roots dating back more than a thousand years when this region was a Muslim kingdom, while this year’s novelty is sushi rolls introduced by Filipino sisters.

“The nuns, aside from supporting themselves with this, make really good sweets. And the prayer that comes with it is priceless,” added Algarra, who remembers as a child going to convents with her friends to get dough trimmings from the Communion wafers the nuns also produced.

As a cloistered order, the 14 Poor Clares sisters in Carmona, Spain, have to work to earn their daily bread - in their case, making some 300 “English cakes” and 20 other kinds of sweets a month to sell at their 15th-century convent turnstile, said the abbess, Veronicah Nzula.

There’s a summer slowdown when southern Spain is so sweltering nobody takes coffee breaks with cookies, Nzula quipped. But the production revs up for Christmas as the sweets are also sold at a special market devoted to convent products in nearby Seville.

“While we work, we pray the rosary and we think of the people who will eat each sweet,” said Nzula. She learned the recipes from older sisters after arriving more than 20 years ago from Kenya, like all but one of the current sisters.

Most nuns and monks involved in preparing the delicacies are quick to point out that their main mission is to pray, not to cook - and that doing both involves finding a delicate balance.

“We brew to live, we don’t live to brew,” said Brother Joris, who supervises the brewery at Saint-Sixtus Abbey in Westvleteren, Belgium. “There needs to be equilibrium between monastic life and economic life. We don’t want to end up as a brewery with a little abbey on the side.”

For that reason, production remains limited even though the beer brings the monks’ only income - and it’s considered by connoisseurs one of the choicest brews in the world, especially popular as a Christmas and Father’s Day gift.

Monks started making it in the 1830s to supply lay workers building the abbey with the daily pint their contract guaranteed. Aficionados still need to come to the abbey or its cafe to get their crate, giving the contemplative order a chance to bear witness too.

“By simply existing, we remind people ‘they’re still here,’” Brother Joris said.

A fellow Trappist at the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky - where the renowned monk and author Thomas Merton once lived - similarly said that producing their bourbon-infused delicacies is just a part of the “ora et labora” (work and pray) commitment under St. Benedict’s rule.

“Our ideal is to pray always,” said Brother Paul Quenon, who joined the abbey in the late 1950s when the bourbon fruitcake was already being produced, and has worked on the more recently introduced bourbon fudge.

The abbey now makes some 60,000 pounds per year of each, most sold between Thanksgiving and Christmas - when the bakery is so busy that silent prayer becomes a challenge.

To also strike a balance, the two dozen Benedictine sisters at the 15th-century Monastery of San Paio de Antealtares in Santiago de Compostela, one of Europe’s top pilgrimage cities, only work on sweets in the morning.

“It’s not the purpose of our life, lest we break the equilibrium - rather, it’s to turn work into prayer,” said the abbess, Almudena Vilariño. “When I’m working, I pray that these sweets may be catalysts of union and peace in the house or office where they will go.”

Following the same recipe dating from the late 1700s, the nuns make their signature almond cake known as tarta de Santiago. A few decades ago, local women would bring ingredients to the convent so the nuns could bake cakes in their wooden oven. Today, pilgrims from around the world who have finished their “camino” in the magnificent cathedral across the square are among the crowds ringing the bell by the nuns’ simple wooden turnstile.

“The turnstile puts in touch the interior world with the exterior. They’re not disconnected,” Labarga said.

Back in Mexico City, the sisters preparing their popular Christmas buñuelos - a sort of flat donut made with flour, water and cinnamon - also connect their community labor with their faith. During the Advent season, they pray thousands of Hail Marys as they roll the dough or cover the sweets with sugar.

“This is how we live the liturgy,” Sister Abigail said. “This is the objective in our work, and work for people outside the convent - that we feed them, and they help us so we can eat.”

73,,,"Pope Francis’ 87th birthday closes out a big year of efforts to reform the church, cement his legacy",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/pope-francis-turns-87-closes-out-big-year-of-effor/,"ROME — Pope Francis turned 87 on Sunday, closing out a year that saw big milestones in his efforts to reform the Catholic Church as well as health scares that raise questions about his future as pope.

Francis celebrated his birthday with cake during a festive audience with children Sunday morning, and there were “Happy Birthday” banners in St. Peter’s Square during his weekly noon blessing.

One early present came Saturday, when a Vatican tribunal handed down a mix of guilty verdicts and acquittals in a complicated trial that Francis had supported as evidence of his financial reforms. The biggest-name defendant, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to 5½ years in prison.

“It was quite a year for a pope who’s obviously thinking about legacy and finishing up,” said Christopher Bellitto, professor of history at Kean University in New Jersey.

Only seven popes are known to have been older than Francis at the time of their deaths, according to the online resource Catholic Hierarchy. Francis is fast closing in on one of them, Pope Gregory XII, perhaps best known for having been the most recent pope to resign until Pope Benedict XVI stepped down in 2013.

Gregory was 88½ when he voluntarily stepped down in 1415 in a bid to end the Western Schism, in which there were three rival claimants to the papacy. Francis has said he, too, would consider resigning if his health made him unable to carry on, but more recently he said the job of pope is for life.

Twice this year, however, Francis’ less-than-robust respiratory health forced him to cancel big events: In spring, a bout of acute bronchitis landed him in the hospital for three days and made him miss the Good Friday procession at the Colosseum.

More recently, a new case of bronchitis forced him to cancel a planned trip to Dubai to participate in the U.N. climate conference. Francis had part of one lung removed as a young man and seems to be increasingly prone to respiratory problems that make breathing difficult and speaking even more so.

In between those events, he was hospitalized again in June for nine days for surgeons to repair an abdominal hernia and remove scar tissue from previous intestinal surgeries.

The hospitalizations have raised questions about Francis’ ability to continue the globetrotting rigors of the modern-day papacy, which is increasingly dependent on the person of the pope, said David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University.

“It’s a great improvement from the time when the pope was just a king in his throne surrounded by a royal court,” he said. “But with such expectations can any pope govern into his 80s and even 90s and be effective?”

While Francis’ health scares punctuated his 87th year, perhaps the biggest milestone of all, and one that is likely to shape the remainder of Francis’ pontificate, was Benedict’s Dec. 31 death.

Benedict largely stuck to his promise to live “hidden to the world” and allow Francis to govern unimpeded. But his death after 10 years of retirement removed the shadow of a more conservative pope looking over Francis’ shoulder from the other side of the Vatican gardens.

His death has seemingly freed up Francis to accelerate his reform agenda and crack down on his right-wing opponents.

For starters, Francis presided over the first stage of his legacy-making meeting on the future of the Catholic Church. The synod aims to make the church more inclusive and reflective of and responsive to the needs of rank-and-file Catholics. The first session ended with “urgent” calls to include women in decision-making roles in the church. The next phase is scheduled for October 2024.

“The effort to change the rigidly top-down nature of governance in Catholicism is the main reform project of the Francis papacy and its success or failure will likely be his chief legacy,” said Fordham’s Gibson. He said the jury was still out on whether it would succeed, since the transition period is “messy and absolutely exhausting.”

“Will the sense of exhaustion overcome the inspiration that invigorates so many?” he asked.

Alongside the synod, Francis this year appointed an unusually progressive theologian as the Vatican’s chief doctrine watchdog, and he has already begun setting a very new tone for the church’s teachings that could have big effects on the church going forward.

Cardinal Victor Fernandez has issued decrees on everything from how to care for cremated ashes (in a defined and sacred place) to membership in Masonic lodges (forbidden) and whether transgender people can be godparents (they can).

At the same time, Francis has begun hitting back at his conservative critics, for whom Benedict was a point of reference for the past 10 years.

Francis exiled Benedict’s longtime secretary, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, to his native Germany after a series of infractions culminating with a tell-all memoir published in the days after Benedict’s death that was highly critical of Francis.

Then, he forcibly removed the bishop of Tyler, Texas, Bishop Joseph Strickland, whose social media posts were highly critical of the pope. And most recently, he cut off the former Vatican high court judge, Cardinal Raymond Burke, after he warned that Francis’ reform-minded synod risked dividing the faithful.

Natalia Imperatori-Lee, professor of religious studies at Manhattan College, said the pushback against Burke was less of a “smackdown” and would have little tangible effect, since he has plenty of wealthy backers in the U.S.

But she said it was part of an important year that had as its high point the synod, the conclusion of which will drive Francis at least for another year.

“I think the Pope is thinking about his legacy in a way he hasn’t done before. Perhaps that has to do with Benedict’s death, maybe it’s more a matter of his own mortality becoming more real given his recent illnesses,” she said. “The synod is a huge part of that legacy, obviously, and you can see his investment in having it succeed. I’m willing to bet that seeing part 2 of the synod to fruition is a huge motivator for him right now.”",
74,,,Japan and ASEAN bolster ties at a summit focused on security and economy amid tensions with China,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/japan-asean-bolster-ties-at-summit-focused-on-secu/,"TOKYO — Leaders from Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, at a special summit in Tokyo on Sunday, adopted a joint vision that emphasizes security and economic cooperation while respecting the rule of law, amid growing tensions with China in regional seas.

Ties between Japan and the 10-member ASEAN bloc used to be largely based on Japanese assistance to the developing economies, in part due to lingering bitterness over Japan’s wartime actions. But in recent years the relationship has focused more on security amid China’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, while Japan’s postwar pacifist stance and trust-building efforts have fostered friendlier relations.

The summit marks the 50th anniversary of official Japan-ASEAN ties, which started in 1973 with trade talks over Japanese synthetic rubber exports

The leaders, in a joint statement, called for strengthening their “mutually beneficial” partnership and working together for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, especially in maritime security. They also called for economic security and greater supply chain resilience for the region and to promote the movement of one another’s nationals.

“We affirm the shared view to promote a rules-based Indo-Pacific region that is free and open (and) embraces key principles such as ASEAN’s unity and centrality, inclusiveness (and) transparency,” according to the joint statement.

The leaders stressed “respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, settlement of differences or disputes by peaceful means and renunciation of the threat or use of force.”

They did not specifically mention China. During the summit meeting, they raised concerns over the “situation in East and South China Sea” and noted the importance of upholding international law, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The leaders adopted an implementation plan for 130 projects. Japan called for stepping up security and defense cooperation, such as arms technology and equipment transfers, cybersecurity and tackling disinformation. Tokyo also pledged to reinforce support for efforts against climate change, green technology and digital transformation, as well as investment, including in the region’s automotive industry.

“As divisions and confrontations deepen and the world faces compounded crises, Japan will tackle the issues together with ASEAN, which is the linchpin of a ‘free and open Indo-Pacific,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a joint news conference with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, this year’s ASEAN chair.

“Based on our mutual trust, we will tackle new issues, and contribute to peace and prosperity of the region in order to create a world where people can benefit while their dignity is respected.”

Japan adopted a new security strategy last year and has been rapidly building up its military and expanding its military partnerships to better counter China‘s growing assertiveness in the region.

On Saturday, on the sidelines of the summit, Kishida held a series of bilateral talks as Japan seeks to step up bilateral security ties with ASEAN countries.

Kishida and his Malaysian counterpart, Anwar Ibrahim, signed a $2.8 million deal to bolster Malaysia’s maritime security capability as part of a Japanese official security assistance program specifically for militaries of friendly nations to help strengthen their law enforcement and security capabilities.

The assistance includes provisions of rescue boats and other equipment to help improve the military capability of Malaysia, which sits at a crucial location on sea lanes connecting the Indian Ocean and East Asia and serves a vital role in warning and surveillance operations for the entire region.

Separately on Saturday, Kishida signed a deal with Widodo, offering a grant of up to $63.7 million to fund Indonesia’s maritime security capability advancement plan, including a Japanese-built large-scale maritime patrol boat.

In November, Japan announced a provision of coastal surveillance radars to the Philippine navy, and the two sides also agreed to start talks for a key defense pact called the Reciprocal Access Agreement designed to smooth their troops’ entry into each other’s territory for joint military exercises. On Sunday, Japan and the Philippines signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation between their coast guards.

Also last month, Japan and Vietnam agreed to elevate the status of their relationship to a top-level comprehensive strategic partnership, under which they will discuss details of a possible deal to broaden their defense cooperation.

But ASEAN countries are not in lockstep in their stance toward China, with which many have strong ties and are reluctant to choose sides. Japanese officials say they are mindful of the situation.

On Monday, Japan also hopes to push forward energy cooperation with ASEAN leaders at a summit for the Asian Zero Emission Community initiative. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is expected to join online.",
75,,,"In Hamas captivity, an Israeli mother found the strength to survive in her 2 young daughters",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/17/in-hamas-captivity-israeli-doron-katz-asher-found-/,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Tantrums, tears, temperature, toilet accidents. These travails of childhood are familiar to any parent. But for Doron Katz Asher, the daily whims of children took on a new, frightening dimension while in Hamas captivity with her two young daughters.

If the girls cried, militants would bang on the door of the room where she was being held. When they were hungry, she didn’t always have anything to feed them. She slept with one eye open, always keeping watch over her daughters.

“(I felt) Fear. Fear that maybe because my daughters are crying and are making some noise they’ll get some directive from above to take them, to do something to them,” Katz Asher told Israel Channel 12 TV in a lengthy interview broadcast Saturday night. “Constant fear.”

Her account builds on a growing number of freed captives who are sharing their harrowing stories of weeks in captivity even as roughly 129 hostages remain.

Katz Asher, 34, and her daughters Raz, 4, and Aviv, 2, were visiting family in Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas attacked the sleepy farming community on Oct. 7. Katz Asher, her daughters and her mother were put on a tractor and driven to Gaza. An exchange of fire erupted between the militants who snatched them and Israeli forces, killing her mother and leaving her and Aviv lightly wounded, she said in the interview. They were part of some 240 people taken captive that day whose plight has stunned and gripped Israelis.

After they made it to Gaza, Katz Asher said she and her daughters were taken to a family’s apartment, where her wounds were stitched up without anesthetics on a couch as her girls looked on. She did not say if Aviv was treated.

The father of the house spoke Hebrew, which he said he had learned years earlier working in Israel. A Palestinian mother and two daughters served as their guards for the 16 days they were held in the home. They were told to keep quiet, but were given coloring pencils and paper and passed the time drawing. Katz Asher said she started teaching her 4-year-old how to write in Hebrew. The first word she taught was “aba,” or “dad.”

As the sounds of the Israeli military’s fierce bombing campaign rang out around them, her captors fed her false hope, telling her a deal was imminent for their release. She and her daughters would eventually be freed in a temporary cease-fire deal in late November.

With food running low at the family home, one night she was dressed in Muslim attire that concealed her identity and she and her daughters were forced to walk for 15 minutes to a hospital that was not named in the interview, where they were sealed in a room with other Israeli captives who she recognized. Ten people were locked together in a 130-square-foot room with a sink but no mattresses. The window was sealed shut, food was inconsistent and using a toilet hinged on the permission of the captors.

“They could open after five minutes or after an hour and a half,” she said, echoing similar testimony from other freed captives. But, she added, “small girls can’t hold it.”

Katz Asher said one of her daughters had a fever of 104 degrees Fahrenheit for three days straight. To bring it down, she ran cold water over her forehead.

They made a deck of cards and drew the foods they badly missed to pass the time. Katz Asher saved her own small portions of food - pita with spreadable cheese and spiced rice with meat - so that her daughters wouldn’t go hungry.

Her daughters had an incessant list of questions about their ordeal, the innocence of a child’s curiosity colliding with an inexplicable calamity. “When will we return to dad at home? And when will they return to day care? And why is the door locked? Why can’t we just go home? And how will we even know the way home?”

All the while, with dread engulfing her, Katz Asher said she projected calm to her daughters, promising them, and perhaps herself, they would go home soon.

“What helped me survive there was that my daughters were with me,” she said. “I had something to fight for.”",
76,,,Car plows into parked SUV in Biden's motorcade outside Delaware campaign headquarters,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-17/car-plows-into-parked-suv-in-bidens-motorcade-outside-delaware-campaign-headquarters,"WILMINGTON, Del. — A car plowed into a parked SUV that was guarding President Joe Biden's motorcade Sunday night while the president was leaving a visit to his campaign headquarters. The president and first lady Jill Biden were unharmed.

While Biden was walking from the campaign office to his waiting armored SUV, a sedan hit a U.S. Secret Service vehicle that was being used to close off intersections near the headquarters for the president's departure. The sedan then tried to continue into a closed-off intersection, before Secret Service personnel surrounded the vehicle with weapons drawn and instructed the driver to put his hands up.

Biden was ushered into his waiting vehicle, where his wife was already seated, before being driven swiftly back to their home. His schedule was otherwise unaffected by the incident.

The Secret Service did not immediately comment on the incident.

77,,,Florida GOP suspends chairman and demands his resignation amid rape investigation,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-17/florida-gop-suspends-chairman-and-demands-his-resignation-amid-rape-investigation,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The Republican Party of Florida suspended Chairman Christian Ziegler and demanded his resignation during an emergency meeting Sunday, adding to calls by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top officials for him to step down as police investigate a rape accusation against him.

Ziegler is accused of raping a woman with whom he and his wife, Moms for Liberty co-founder Bridget Ziegler, had a prior consensual sexual relationship, according to police records.

""Christian Ziegler has engaged in conduct that renders him unfit for the office,"" the party's motion to censure Ziegler said, according to a document posted on the social media platform X by Lee County GOP Chairman Michael Thomason.

Ziegler tried to defend himself during the closed-door meeting, but the party board quickly took the action against him, Thompson said.

""Ziegler on soap box trying to defend himself, not working,"" Thompson posted before confirming the votes.

The party's executive committee will hold another vote in the future on whether to remove Ziegler.

The Sarasota Police Department is investigating the woman's accusation that Ziegler raped her at her apartment in October. Police documents say the Zieglers and the woman had planned a sexual threesome that day, but Bridget Ziegler was unable to make it. The accuser says Christian Ziegler arrived anyway and assaulted her.

Christian Ziegler has not been charged with a crime and says he is innocent, contending the encounter was consensual.

The accusation also has caused turmoil for Bridget Ziegler, an elected member of the Sarasota School Board, though she is not accused of any crime. On Tuesday the board voted to ask her to resign. She refused.

The couple have been outspoken opponents of LGBTQ+ rights, and their relationship with another woman has sparked criticism and accusations of hypocrisy.

In addition to DeSantis, Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz and Florida's Republican House and Senate leaders have all called for Christian Ziegler's resignation.

78,,,All Music Considered: This is what our show directors listened to in 2023,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-17/all-music-considered-this-is-what-our-show-directors-listened-to-in-2023,"SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

The directors of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, they do a lot behind the scenes. They've got the very powerful job of being the person who tells me when to talk and when not to talk. And beyond that, they also pick the wonderful music breaks that you hear every single show. We're taking some time on the program at the end of the year to talk with our show directors about some of the music they listened to the most in 2023. Think about it as ALL THINGS CONSIDERED Wrapped. And this weekend, we are talking to producer Elena Burnett. Hey, Elena.

ELENA BURNETT, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.

DETROW: OK, so in this series, every director has had a theme. And your theme, I am told, is dance parties.

BURNETT: Yes. So this started for me at the beginning of the pandemic. I live and I still do in a small studio apartment. And to sort of keep myself sane, I decided that every single day, I was going to dance to a song.

DETROW: So this started as something you did around your apartment. Does this mean the dance parties are coming with? Does this mean you're just breaking out into dance all over the place?

BURNETT: Yeah, it is. It is.

DETROW: Oh, OK.

BURNETT: And then, like, a big part of this, I should preface, is I'm really bad at keeping track of popular music - like, really bad. So I get very excited and I start dancing when a song that I actually know plays on the radio.

DETROW: Makes sense.

BURNETT: And that happened a lot this year with my most listened to band, Lake Street Dive.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""AUTOMATIC"")

LAKE STREET DIVE: (Singing) I'm walking blindfolded.

BURNETT: They are everywhere - in D.C. grocery stores and Albuquerque outdoor malls and Edinburgh stationary stores. And, I mean, those are all places that now have been graced by an Elena Burnett dance party.

DETROW: How far did you extend this? Like, what was the outer limit of a place that you were like, you know what? I'm just going to dance.

BURNETT: I mean, you know, it got pretty - I was in the U.K. a lot this year, and I danced my way through it. But, you know, sometimes you don't really feel like dancing in public. Sometimes you just want to have it just for yourself. That's where running comes in for me. It's kind of like a socially sanctioned dance party. It's kind of like everybody around you is listening to the same song, like a silent disco. And so I think that's why The Head and the Heart's ""Every Shade Of Blue"" was my top song this year.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""EVERY SHADE OF BLUE"")

THE HEAD AND THE HEART: It's been a long year, the wrong year to be left alone.

BURNETT: Then the beat kicks in and there's this kind of like, da, da, da, da, da, da (ph) that just, like, zaps right through you, and the drums are just running right along with you.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""EVERY SHADE OF BLUE"")

THE HEAD AND THE HEART: (Singing) You, you.

DETROW: I would like to point out that I feel like I'm dancing to the music more than you are during this interview, and I feel like that's ironic. And I just want to address that and see if we can fix it.

BURNETT: (Laughter).

DETROW: You mentioned you traveled a lot this year. How did the music follow you?

BURNETT: While I was away, I missed a lot of concerts that I would have loved to see. And the most devastating one that I missed was Sammy Rae & The Friends. Their music is just so infectious. It's like fireworks. But thankfully, they released a concert album of their tour, ""If It All Goes South,"" and that album became what I listened to on repeat every plane ride I took this year. And the live just added this great element to it. Listening to them riff together, it's an actual party on stage. In fact, there's a song literally called ""Let's Throw A Party.""

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LET'S THROW A PARTY"")

SAMMY RAE AND THE FRIENDS: (Singing) Let's throw a party. Somebody's turning 30.

BURNETT: And it kind of crescendos into this, like, glorious, joyful, chaotic beauty. And it's just the exact go-for-broke vibe that you want from a good dance party. But, I mean, the dance mantra is go put a smile on somebody's face, go tell somebody they've got a place in this world, go tell somebody you want to be friends with them. And that is just the kind of pure human joy and connection that their music makes you feel. And I also think that's what these bursts of dancing have been for me, kind of a way to be a friend to myself and make myself smile and, this year more than ever, to connect and smile with friends and family and even strangers.

DETROW: I really like this approach.

BURNETT: Thank you.

DETROW: That is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED producer and director Elena Burnett. Thank you.

79,,,Iowa caucuses roundtable,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-17/iowa-caucuses-roundtable,"SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

We are just weeks away from the Republican Iowa caucus, the official kickoff to the presidential primary season. In many years, Iowa provides a golden opportunity for a candidate to break out from the pack or establish him or herself with a surprise strong finish. This year is different.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Looking at the race in Iowa, former President Donald Trump up by 30 points now.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Former President Donald Trump's lead is growing in the state.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Fifty-one percent of Iowa voters now support the former president as the nominee, while...

DETROW: In this race, the Republican field has only ever had one leader - former President Donald Trump. And that is despite the fact that he is currently facing 91 felony charges from state and federal jurisdictions and that he has not participated in a single Republican presidential debate so far. Republican candidates who are running against Trump to try and be the presidential nominee themselves, they've been reluctant to criticize or challenge the former president. Vivek Ramaswamy often goes out of his way, in fact, to praise Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VIVEK RAMASWAMY: President Trump, I believe, was the best president of the 21st century. It's a fact.

DETROW: Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, is the only candidate who has consistently criticized Trump and criticized his fellow candidates for not doing the same.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS CHRISTIE: The fact is that when you go and you say the truth about somebody who is a dictator, a bully, who has taken shots at everybody, whether they've given him great service or not over time, who dares to disagree with him, then I understand why these three are timid to say anything about it.

DETROW: But perhaps as a result, Christie has often found himself at the back of the pack, struggling to stay relevant to the race. Trump, for his part, often seems to be ignoring the primary altogether when he does campaign.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: We have to send a great signal, and then maybe these people just say, OK, it's over now. It's over. We got to end it because we have to focus on crooked Joe Biden and the Democrats.

DETROW: Trump has reshaped just about every piece of the Republican Party. And about a month out, it looks like he's reshaping the Iowa caucuses too. To look at how strange Iowa has been this year and what it tells us about Republicans in 2023, I'm joined by two Iowa caucus experts, Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters and J. Ann Selzer, who's president of the Selzer & Company polling firm and who is widely viewed as the pollster with the sharpest understanding of Iowa's electorate.

So I'm going to start with you, Clay. You've covered a few caucuses now at this point. Does this one feel different to you?

CLAY MASTERS, BYLINE: Well, definitely it feels a lot different. It's unprecedented, which is kind of a phrase that gets used almost to the point where it's exhausted.

DETROW: Yes.

MASTERS: But this is a very unprecedented time to have a former president indicted on several criminal charges and who is far away the front-runner of the race for the Iowa caucuses. You're not seeing a whole lot of growth within the crowds when you go see some of the other second-tier candidates. And those second-tier candidates are just really far down from where Donald Trump has been in the polls this entire caucus cycle throughout the year. So very, very strange caucus cycle, unlike any of the others that I've covered.

DETROW: Ann, you are the Iowa pollster. How different is the caucus compared to previous ones you've studied when it comes to the numbers, when it comes to where the candidates are at this point in time, about a month out?

J ANN SELZER: Right. Well, it's different in a couple of ways. For one thing, we've had sort of more, like, chaotic caucuses in terms of the polling, with a lot of candidates taking the lead with different polls. And this time, it's a consistent lead for Donald Trump. Significantly, in this poll, he cracked the 50% mark. He's standing at 51% of likely Republican caucusgoers saying he is their first choice. And that's meaningful for two reasons. One is that it's symbolic. If - anybody that cracks 50%, that's an emotional feeling there. But then secondly, it's algebraically significant, which is there aren't enough percentage points left over among the other candidates at this point to appear to be able to mount a charge.

DETROW: This latest survey that you put together was interesting on a lot of different fronts. I think, as we were talking before, a lot of your surveys have very aptly popped bubbles of the way people hypothesize about campaigns. And it said, well, that's not actually what's happening right now. You mentioned there was a few different ways that the data surprised you this time around.

SELZER: Right. I think one of the things that surprised us is - the theory was that if some of these lesser candidates would drop out, that would be good for other non-Trump candidates. And maybe that was a little bit of the three-point bump that Ron DeSantis got. But Donald Trump got an eight-point bump. So you kind of think that even though people are dropping out, they're coming, still more, to Donald Trump. I think another way is that we've heard people say, well, Donald Trump's got all he's got. He's got his group, and then you've just got to go get more people who've maybe never caucused before. Well, Donald Trump is 51% overall. He's 63% with first-time caucusgoers. So if anybody is out there apparently recruiting new caucusgoers, it appears to be former President Trump.

DETROW: So, Clay, Ann's talking about Trump with this 30-something point lead - again, over 50% in the latest survey. Again, this is somebody who is facing 91 felony counts right now. How does this translate to what you see and hear where you're at these events, particularly when you're at Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis events? How are people showing up at those events thinking about what's going on right now, making sense of this?

MASTERS: Well, most of the conversations that I have with the voters who are turning out to these Ron DeSantis or Nikki Haley events are looking for an alternative to the former president, and they're not talking about any kind of concerns that they might have about what another time for Trump in the White House would mean for democracy or anything like that. They're talking about trying to find an alternative to the divisiveness that Donald Trump has had. They're wanting to move on. But as I mentioned before, we're not really seeing the kind of groundswell you see for support in candidates of caucus cycles past. I'm thinking of, like, Barack Obama or Pete Buttigieg or even Mike Huckabee or Ted Cruz. You saw these - this kind of what felt like a grassroots growth that has happened.

And so on the non-Trump events, a lot of these people are still trying to make up their mind. But when Donald Trump is so far and away the front-runner, you wonder what kind of momentum somebody can have when they're coming in at polls like Ann's so low. You know, Ron DeSantis has done the kind of traditional model that has rewarded candidates in the past, where he's done all 99 counties where he's - that's every county in the state of Iowa. He's picked up the endorsement of Governor Kim Reynolds, and it's very rare for a sitting governor to endorse. But you're just really not seeing the kind of movement that you would expect in past cycles where that's given some candidates much more trajectory.

DETROW: I'm curious what both of you think about this other factor. You know, the way that people frame Iowa is so much that people their reward the retail campaigning. You have to put in the work, right? Not only does Trump have his legal problems, he has made campaigning kind of a minimal-effort thing. He's not participated in a single debate yet. He has not gone to Iowa anywhere near the amount of time that other candidates have spent there. And yet he doesn't seem to be being punished for it at all by caucusgoers. Does that surprise either of you?

SELZER: I'm aware that he's got a much more sophisticated campaign team, and that the rallies that he's holding - they're the big town halls - they're really working those crowds and getting commitments out of them. One rally could be - what? - six, seven, eight town halls that some of the other candidates would do. And I was visited by a reporter from CBS Miami the other day, and he told me that the DeSantis campaign has pledged to knock on 1 million doors in Iowa. And I looked surprised. And he said, are you surprised? I said, there are only - what? - 1.2 million households in Iowa. So what counts as a door knock?

MASTERS: That's right.

SELZER: But it could be that kind of massive effort, which I think we would see just observationally.

MASTERS: And I go to these different Trump events, and it is much different than it was eight years ago, where there is a video that plays that explains how the caucuses even work. I mean, I've talked to Iowa potential caucusgoers who have told me that they have never caucused before. And so the Trump campaign is signing people up. You see these people working the crowds. One volunteer I remember saying, hats and shirts don't translate to a victory. He put it much more eloquently and quicker than I just did. But you're seeing much more of an effort than you saw eight years ago, for sure.

DETROW: And this is the point in an interview with you in the month before a caucus where I'm contractually obligated to talk about Rick Santorum just for a moment, who...

SELZER: Oh, good.

DETROW: ...Is the patron saint of a candidate who comes from behind at the very last moment and surprises everybody with this huge last-minute surge of support. It's not just him who's accomplished that. This is something that has happened time and time again. When you look at the data of where caucusgoers are with this contest, do you see any possibility for anybody to pull that off over the next month?

SELZER: Well, the ghost of Rick Santorum whispers in my ear, never say never, because he was polling in, you know, 4, 5, 6% in our next-to-the-last poll. He only got double digits the first night of our final poll and then grew and then grew and then grew. And if you look at the overall number, it wasn't that astonishing. But the trajectory from those nights - that night after night building - you know, he ended up winning the Iowa caucuses.

DETROW: Clay, what have all the conversations that you've had at all of the events for DeSantis, for Haley, for Trump, for anybody else - the state of this race a month out, what do you think that tells us about the state of the Republican Party in 2023, going into 2024?

MASTERS: This is still very much the party of former President Donald Trump. Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are trying like heck to try to have some kind of a groundswell. But what the former president has done to take control of the Republican Party is still very alive and well. You're seeing it even, like I said earlier, the people that are showing up to these other candidates' events. They're not saying anything too negative about the former president. They're saying they just want to move on. And so it's kind of a miraculous thing to see where things were eight years ago and to see how much just his grip on the Republican Party has strengthened since his first presidency and as he's running for a third time.

DETROW: Yeah. That's Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters. Clay, thanks so much.

MASTERS: You're welcome.

DETROW: As well as J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Company polling firm. Thank you so much.

SELZER: My pleasure.

80,,,Why declining social invites is OK,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-17/why-declining-social-invites-is-ok,"SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

It's the holidays, and that means sometimes, we get invitations to events that we just can't attend or maybe, to be real, we just do not want to attend. But we worry - some of us too much - about the impact of saying no. Will my friends be angry? Will my colleagues think I don't want to spend time with them outside work? The anxiety can spiral. A new study suggests, though, that, actually, declining an invitation might not be as bad as you think. Julian Givi is an assistant professor of marketing at West Virginia University and one of the study's authors. Julian, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

JULIAN GIVI: Hey. Thanks for having me.

DETROW: I thought I was, you know, unique in just always worrying about the implications of saying no and trying not to disappoint people. But I guess enough people feel this way that you have thought to do a study on it. What was the inspiration here?

GIVI: I was invited to an event, and it was someone's wedding, you know, quite far away and quite a hassle to get to. And I really did not want to attend it, but I was like, man, I can't say no, right? They're going to kill me if I don't go. And so it got me wondering, you know, if people kind of worry a little bit too much about these negative ramifications. And so I was interested - you know, do they actually exist?

DETROW: And tell me what exactly the study looked at and what you found.

GIVI: Yeah. So in the study, we basically had two groups of participants. Some were what we called inviters, and others were what we called invitees. And so if you were in an inviter condition, you imagined that you invited someone to do a social activity - so it could be, you know, going to dinner, could be attending a museum, you know, whatever. And then what we did was we had invitees predict kind of the negative ramifications of what would happen if they said no. So, for example, how upset would the investor be? How disappointed would they be? How sad would they be? How angry? Would they invite them to do something again in the future? And then we also had inviters tell us, like, well, how would you actually feel, right? So they respond to all those same questions, only kind of assessing it for themselves. And what we kind of found consistently over and over, across several different studies, is that invitees tend to overestimate these various negative implications.

DETROW: So just summing this up, you asked both sides to kind of weigh what they thought would happen and then what would actually happen. And consistently, the person who was saying no overestimated how upset the other person would be.

GIVI: Yeah, that's 100% accurate.

DETROW: I have to ask, did - in any way at all, did you get into the pros and cons of making up an excuse when there isn't an excuse? Like, instead of, no, I don't want to go - oh, I'd love to, but I got a flu or whatever, you know?

GIVI: I think when it comes to offering excuses, I think three pieces sort of advice for people here. The first is the is the offer a reason why, so this is kind of a funny story. This happened before, the - before I started with this research project. But last year, I had, you know, texted my mother and asked her, hey, do you want to go get Chipotle? It was, like, a nice, you know, summer night. You want to go grab Chipotle? And all she responded with was, no thanks.

DETROW: Wow (laughter).

GIVI: I was sitting there like, wow, like, you can't even...

DETROW: No.

GIVI: ...Can't even give me anything. You know, like, you're busy or tired or something, right? And so...

DETROW: So one, give a reason, which your mom did not do.

GIVI: Yeah. No. 1 - yeah. So moral of the story, give a reason, right? And then the second piece is, you know, some events - right? - require you to spend money. So it's, you know, tickets to a football game, going to a show, out to eat, etc. If you cite a lack of money, people tend to be a lot more understanding than if you cite a lack of time. So in either case, they're rather understanding. But, you know, I think it makes sense - right? - that logically, we would think, OK, if someone can't afford it, then we're not going to, you know, put the pressure on them.

And then the third point is kind of the no-but strategy. And this is a very - this is one I use all the time in my own life. And so it's when someone invites you to do something and for whatever reason, you can't, right? You can always go with, say, you know, no, I can't make it, but I would love to do X, Y or Z with you, you know, in the coming weeks. And with this, it's kind of nice because in some cases - right? - we're declining events not necessarily because we have, like, another commitment or we can't afford to go or whatever, but really we just don't want to go to it, right? There's certain events that you just...

DETROW: Yeah.

GIVI: Don't want to attend. And with this, you can kind of point in the direction as to what you want to do, right? So I don't want to go to this holiday party with people I don't know all that well. But if the host would like to go out to lunch next week, I would - you know, let's do that.

DETROW: I'm wondering, has doing this research and seeing the results led you to change the way that you respond to invites?

GIVI: So I always try to use my own findings to kind of inform my day-to-day life. And as I kind of, you know - one, like I mentioned before, I use that no-but strategy all the time now. So I certainly - like everyone else, you know, the kind of - the way this research project came about was because of me fearing these negative implications. So when I saw these studies, I'm like, wow, it's really not that bad. And I kind of thought to myself, you know, whenever I invite people to do things and they turn me down, it doesn't really matter all that much to me, right? I can go on to the next person...

DETROW: Yeah.

GIVI: Or maybe I've already invited five others, and so it doesn't matter too, too much. So in my day-to-day life now, when I'm invited to do things, I feel more comfortable with turning people down. And also, I think that no-but strategy, you know, definitely is - helps in that regard, too.

DETROW: Well, Julian Givi, an assistant professor of marketing at West Virginia University, thank you for accepting our invitation to come on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED to talk about your new study about invitations.

GIVI: Absolutely. Well, I'm glad I didn't turn this one down...

DETROW: (Laughter).

GIVI: ...Turn this invitation down. Thanks for having me. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",
81,,,Talking cookies with 'The New York Times Cooking',https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-17/talking-cookies-with-the-new-york-times-cooking,"SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

In kitchens across the country, bakers are cranking out batches of treats for holiday parties, cookie swaps or just to eat off the cooling rack. It's undeniable December is all about cookies, and that is especially true for the team of food writers that puts together the lineup of new recipes featured in The New York Times' annual cookie week. So this year, armed with a stand mixer and a microphone, NPR producer Emma Klein set out to discover what it takes to make a knockout cookie recipe.

EMMA KLEIN, BYLINE: I love baking. Sometimes it's pies, cakes or bread, both sweet and salty. But every December as a kid, my mom and I would spend hours crafting cookies to fill festive tins for family and friends. Now, years later, I love to find new cookie recipes to try. So this year, I had some friends over to bake some of The New York Times holiday cookies. We made the matcha latte, Mexican hot chocolate and the Technicolor cookies, and I'll get into why they're called that later. After our baking party, I called up the people who actually created this year's cookies to hear how they come up with their recipes. New York Times food writer Eric Kim felt like he had a lot to live up to with his 2023 cookie offering.

ERIC KIM: I had a lot of pressure on myself this year 'cause my cookie last year was a gochujang caramel cookie, which truly went bonkers. That's the most viral I've ever had a recipe go. We were kind of, like, selling out gochujang in stores.

KLEIN: Kim and the rest of the team spent months trying to perfect their recipes. They start prepping for cookie week in the summer.

KIM: If people knew how much work went into each cookie - I mean, the first year, I almost lost it. My parents came downstairs and saw maybe 30 bowls of different batches, and they were kind of like, wait, you're still working on the cookies? And I was like, go away. Don't talk to me.

KLEIN: Kim's recipe this year was the result of a bit of experimentation.

KIM: These cookies started off as matcha blossom cookies because I was sort of playing around with - you know those, like, really old peanut butter blossom cookies that you had at your friend's house, maybe?

KLEIN: He eventually ended up with a matcha latte cookie, a combo of the popular green tea flavor baked into a cookie and topped with a creamy milk frosting.

Next up, we made Vaughn Vreeland's Mexican hot chocolate cookies. They're a chewy, spiced chocolate treat stuffed with marshmallows.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, this is good.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I got a little tingling sensation.

KLEIN: That's 'cause you can't handle spicy.

(LAUGHTER)

KLEIN: The Technicolor cookies, developed by New York Times contributor Sam Seneviratne, are the most striking-looking cookies of the seven recipes.

So pretty.

They're bright with psychedelic stripes and spiced up with cardamom and ginger.

SAM SENEVIRATNE: I think people really do eat with their eyes as much as they do with their mouths. And especially when you're trying to convince people to make your food - especially at this time, there's a million cookies on offer, so I think it is important to make things that are visually appealing. And then the taste has to match. It's not worth it if it's only pretty.

KLEIN: If she gets the recipe right, readers will be making batches and batches of these cookies for the holidays. But Sam - she won't be.

SENEVIRATNE: By the time it comes to the actual holiday, I've made so many baked goods that I usually just take a full-on break from it.

KLEIN: So were this year's cookies a hit? Here at NPR headquarters, we had our own little taste test at the ALL THINGS CONSIDERED holiday potluck.

Can I get you guys to taste this and tell me what you think?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Oh, good. I like the texture, kind of buttery cookie. It's really nice. It was supposed to give matcha?

KLEIN: It was supposed to give matcha.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: It was supposed to give matcha. It wasn't giving that much, but it was giving, you know, like, a little ginger moment. That's what it was giving for me. I ate all of it, though.

KLEIN: So pretty popular - but I might need to make these one more time to get it right for the next holiday party.

83,,,Son of first Black female fallen officer talks legacy and life behind bars,https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/son-first-black-female-dc-police-fallen-officer-killed-in-the-line-of-duty-damon-gail-cobb-way-mpd-crime-maryland-eastern-shore-prison-prince-georges-county-md-shooting-gerald-weaver-life-behind-bars,"It's a story that started in 1974.

""I had come home from nursery school and everybody was sitting around the living room crying and stuff.”

Fifty-three-year-old Damon Cobb remembers 49 years ago when his mother, 24-year-old MPD Officer Gail Cobb became the first female officer in the U.S. killed in the line of duty. She followed a bank robbery suspect into a downtown parking garage, who shot her as she tried to call for backup.

“She would say give me an Eskimos smooch,” said Damon Cobb remembering, “ and we would rub our noses together like Eskimos. ”

A single mom, she and her son lived with her parents, Gloria and Clinton Cobb, married now for 75 years.

They still keep a memorial to Gail in their living room including, the letter of condolence sent by then President Gerald Ford, her badge number 321 from MPD, and the boots she wore when she was killed.

Also, a street outside the house has been renamed Gail Cobb Way in the slain officer’s honor.





“He loved to visit his mother’s grave, quite often we would go there just so he could visit with her,"" Cobb's grandfather, Clinton, said.



In 1974, the death of a female police officer was big news, and money poured in from around the country for four-year-old Damon’s benefit. There was $140,000 raised for Damon, which is nearly $900,000 in today’s money. His grandparents put all the money in a trust for Damon until he became 18 years old.





When he reached 18, he demanded all of it, which he promptly spent on cars, parties, and friends and it was gone in six months.

“It wasn’t my intention to just blow the money. I was going to spend some and save the rest to make investments or whatever,” he said.

These days, Cobb is an inmate at Eastern Correctional Institute, a state prison on the Maryland Eastern Shore, for the shooting death of 21-year-old Gerald Weaver in Prince George's. Prosecutors say Damon Cobb did it to impress his friends.

“I’ve been in prison now 31 years, for something I didn’t do,” he told 7 News reporter Sam Ford.





Ford: “You had two trials and a hung jury in the first.”

Cobb: “10 to 2 in favor of acquittal”

Ford:” And then the second time you were convicted”

Damon Cobb’s grandparents say they saw it coming with those “friends” who came with the money.



“You could see right through them and tell they were thugs,” said grandmother Gloria Cobb, “ and he was well on his way to being one too.”

Damon Cobb points out that he has been in prison twice as long as John Bryant, his mother’s killer who only served 15 years. The parole board has looked at Damon Cobb’s case but so far no luck.

Ford: “Do you think you will eventually get out?”

Cobb: “Prayerfully so. Confident. But it seems like the way of my life is, ain’t no telling. Just keeping the faith.”

His grandparents say they hope he can get out of prison before they die. They are 92 and 94 years old.",
