0,Trial of Jimmy Lai Under the Hong Kong National Security Law,https://www.state.gov/trial-of-jimmy-lai-under-the-hong-kong-national-security-law/,"The United States condemns the prosecution of pro-democracy advocate and media owner Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong under the PRC-imposed National Security Law. Lai has been held in pre-trial detention for more than 1,000 days, and Hong Kong and Beijing authorities have denied him his choice of legal representation.

We urge Beijing and Hong Kong authorities to respect press freedom in Hong Kong. Actions that stifle press freedom and restrict the free flow of information – as well as Beijing and local authorities’ changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system that reduce direct voting and preclude independent and pro-democracy party candidates from participating – have undermined Hong Kong’s democratic institutions and harmed Hong Kong’s reputation as an international business and financial hub.

We call on Hong Kong authorities to immediately release Jimmy Lai and all others imprisoned for defending their rights."

4,Bedford VA’s Women Veterans’ health clinic expands,https://news.va.gov/126587/bedford-women-veterans-health-clinic-expands/,"The sounds of renovation carry a hopeful tune at Bedford VA, where work will soon begin on a $15 million renovation, ushering in a new era of care for women Veterans.

Women are the fastest growing demographic at Bedford VA, and now comprise nearly 1500 patients served. With increasing demand, hospital leaders recognized infrastructure needed upgrading to meet sensitive needs.

“We are grateful to have won the contract to renovate this space for Bedford VA’s women Veterans clinic,” said Mark Voner, CEO of Veterans Development Corporation and a Veteran. For Voner, giving back touches close to home as he relies on VA for his own care.

Reviewing plans for clinic expansion

“We’ll offer more services than ever in a safe, welcoming space,” said Women Veterans Program Manager Cheryl Coviello. “Our staff and women Veterans are excited for this win-win. It’s been a long time coming.”

Renovation will add much needed space for female Veterans

The redesign adds privacy, more exam rooms, upgraded clinical equipment, and dedicated space to host group counseling supporting mental health. “This whole building renovation will add much needed space for our female Veterans,” said Charmaine Brooks, lead engineer. “I am thankful to be leading this important project.”

For Army Veteran Leanna Lynch, news of the expansion brought relief. As a member of the Massachusetts Governor’s Women Veterans Advisory Council, she hears concerns from fellow women Veterans needing access to quality care. “Women Veterans have a set of unique needs. Safety and privacy are very important to us,” Lynch said. “Over the moon about the clinic expansion for so many reasons. Most exciting is the expanded services and space that is safe and private.”

The project, expected to finish in spring 2025 after a year and a half of intense renovation, promises to transform access at the growing campus. It helps Bedford VA deliver the full spectrum of primary, specialty and gender-specific care women Veterans earned through their military service and sacrifice."
5,VA dietitian rooting for root vegetables,https://news.va.gov/126689/va-dietitian-rooting-for-root-vegetables/,"December is a perfect time to learn about a versatile vegetable group and how to enjoy them during the holidays and beyond. The benefits of root vegetables are often undervalued or misunderstood.

Traditional root vegetables grow underground and include carrots, radishes, rutabaga, beets, parsnips and turnips. Tubers are another common root vegetable and include potatoes, yams, cassava and jicama. Rhizomes, including wasabi, ginger and turmeric are often used as spices in cooking. Lastly are bulbs, which include garlic, shallots, and onion, which are often used as flavor powerhouses in cuisines around the world.

Different root vegetables are staple crops around the world. While taro is not a common root vegetable in the U.S., it is a staple in many Pacific Island nations, and is used to make poi. Cassava is a staple in many tropical countries and is one of the most common carbohydrate sources in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Many root vegetables have a longer shelf life than the more delicate vegetables like spinach and lettuce, and they provide energy and nutrients during leaner times when there is less to harvest.

Root veggies have fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants

Root vegetables like potatoes are good for you. They’re rich in fiber, keeping you feeling full, and they stabilize blood sugar, lower cholesterol and support a healthy gut. Each root veggie has its own mix of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Including a variety of them in your meals is a great way to enjoy their benefits.

Consider trying:

If you’re unsure how to incorporate root vegetables into your meals, VA offers cooking classes and resources for preparing vegetables and recipes and cookbooks on the Healthy Teaching Kitchen website.

Reach out to your local VA to schedule an appointment with a dietitian to gift yourself the benefits of a healthier diet with more root vegetables."
6,What you missed at the 2023 TAB Policy Conference,https://www.txbiz.org/post/what-you-missed-at-the-2023-tab-policy-conference,"Blog by Katie Zarate, Director of Communications The Texas Association of Business (TAB) rounded out its centennial celebration with our Annual Policy Conference on December 7, 2023.

This year’s theme was Texas on the Global Scale: How Policies Shape Our Future. With an impressive slate of C-suite executives from Texas’ hottest industries, the Policy Conference addressed employers’ most pressing challenges and celebrated newly minted legislation that strengthened Texas’ position as the Best State for Business.

The program began with an economic forecast by Jon Hockenyos, who emphasized the value of tech industry to our state’s economy. Due to a strong workforce, low cost of living, and a business-friendly regulatory environment, Texas is ripe for innovation. The Future of Tech & AI panelists spoke to the importance of good governance. Light taxes and reasonable regulations all contribute to the tech sector’s success.













TAB was fortunate to have Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione speak on the Tech & AI panel. A policy leader in this arena, Rep. Capriglione has passed several impactful pieces of legislation, including the Texas Cybercrime Act, the Texas Cybersecurity Act, and the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act. TAB advocates for tech regulations that balance individual freedoms while maximizing innovation.

In addition to the right regulatory climate, Amazon’s Rebecca Gonzales underlined the importance of human-centered AI. When developing these products, the goal should be to help people augment what they are already doing – not replace people altogether.

Panelists touched on the impact AI has, not only on retail and social media experiences, but also in education and the workplace. As McKinsey’s Saurabh Sanghvi said, “The future of work is already here and it's moving fast.”While we like to say everything is bigger in Texas, there is a technology champion across the globe that is worth mentioning. Our friend and ally, Israel, is an innovation giant, and Israeli Tech is a brand that has earned worldwide respect. Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem and Special Envoy for Innovation, Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, opened her remarks by saying, “Every single Israeli thinks they can save the world with some new technology. That is embedded in our DNA.” She explained how challenges with agriculture and water security led to creative solutions. “Necessity is the mother of invention,” she said.













While Fleur faced questions about her decision to travel to Texas during a war, she stood her ground. “Peace can be achieved through economic development and economic bridges.” The Deputy Mayor shared that Texas can help Israel strengthen its global partnerships, and Israel can serve as a gateway to the Middle East for Texas. TAB Chairman, Massey Villarreal, awarded Fleur the “Innovation Diplomacy Award” for strengthening economic ties and encouraging innovation through collaboration between the Start-Up Nation and the Scale-Up State.

Keeping with the international theme, TAB CEO Glenn Hamer moderated a conversation between IBC Bank’s Gerry Schwebel and former Texas Secretary of State Rolando Pablos on the value of Texas’ relationship with Mexico. $800 billion in trade flows between Texas and Mexico each year, and in 2022 alone, Texas and Mexico had a trade relationship of $285 billion. There is currently bipartisan legislation at the federal level, authored by Senator Ted Cruz, to streamline the presidential permitting process required for international bridges. Language for the bill was included in the Defense Authorization Act, a giant step forward for proponents. TAB’s CEO summarized the Association’s border policy position as “maximizing good goods and preventing bad people and bad goods.” IBC Bank’s Gerry Schwebel, a recognized trade and immigration expert, added that “migration is tied to trade whether we like it or not.” As the U.S. continues to navigate a labor shortage, there are legislative solutions, like commonsense immigration reform, that could help employers fill labor gaps. Any step forward should be celebrated, and as TAB advocates, border security can and must be achieved simultaneously.

















While immigration is one solution to labor gaps, there are also policy reforms in the education realm that can strengthen the future workforce. Commissioner Harrison Keller, Woody Hunt, and Grayson College President Dr. Jeremy P. McMillen joined former Secretary of State Ruth Hughs for the conversation. During the 88th Legislative Session, lawmakers transformed the way community colleges were funded through House Bill 8, which established an outcomes-based funding formula. Lawmakers also passed House Bill 1595 (Texas University Fund); both bills enjoyed immense support from the business community.

The Texas Association of Business celebrated the 88th Legislative Session as a historic success for economic development. Adriana Cruz, Governor Greg Abbott’s Executive Director for Economic Development and Tourism, applauded the Legislature’s passage of House Bill 5 (JETI Act) and the Texas CHIPS Act. The JETI Act will serve as the state’s new, transparent and accountable economic development incentive program. The tax tool will give communities a powerful leg-up in the competition to attract large capital-intensive investments to their regions. With Texas being the birthplace of the microchip, Adriana Cruz also emphasized the importance of the Texas CHIPS Act for reinforcing our state’s leadership on semiconductors. This is good for our supply chains, the broader manufacturing ecosystem, and the tens of thousands of Texans employed by the industry. Both bills were top priorities for TAB this session.













When it comes to business acumen, there is one family name that shines bright in the headlines: The Adelsons.

TAB Policy Conference were on the edge of their seats for Dr. Miriam Adelson’s keynote address. She recounted her recent travels to Israel and spared no detail in the brutalities of Hamas’ attack. Dr. Adelson applauded Texas’ support of Israel and said, like Texans, Israelis stand up and stick to their guns. Carrying on the legacy of her late husband and founder of Las Vegas Sands, Sheldon Adelson, Dr. Miriam Adelson is recognized as the most prominent philanthropist and advocate for encouraging a strong US-Israel relationship. She touted the Texas-Israel relationship as deeper than business, and with a smile she added, “and it even runs deeper than basketball.”To recognize her support of the world’s premiere Lone Star States, TAB CEO Glenn Hamer presented Dr. Adelson with the “Lone Star Champion Award.”













The 2023 TAB Policy Conference was attended by over 250 business leaders, state agency heads, and capitol staff.

7,Dr. Miriam Adelson Celebrates 'Shared Spirit' Between Texas and Israel at TAB Policy Conference,https://www.txbiz.org/post/dr-miriam-adelson-celebrates-shared-spirit-between-texas-and-israel-at-tab-policy-conference,"Blog by Glenn Hamer, President & CEO of TAB

The Texas Association of Business recently hosted its annual Policy Conference centralized on the importance of global relationships and policies for the Lone Star State. Texas’ partnership with Israel is undoubtedly one of the most prominent, and TAB was honored to host Dr. Miriam Adelson, a renowned doctor, business leader and powerful advocate of Israel, as a keynote speaker at the event.





Watch Dr. Adelson's keynote speech here .

""This is a critical time for Israel,” Dr. Miriam Adelson declared. “The support must be loud and clear, and nowhere has it been more so than right here in Texas. From the top office of my dear friend, Governor Abbott, and all the way down to ordinary churchgoers … Texans have turned out for Israel.”

These powerful words echo the sentiment shared by many who understand the depth of the bond between Texas and Israel. It's a relationship that goes beyond mere geopolitical alliances; it's a connection rooted in shared values, resilience, and a mutual commitment to freedom and prosperity.

Dr. Adelson acknowledged the booming commercial ties between Texas and Israel, while emphasizing that the relationship runs far deeper than business. The economic partnership between the two regions has indeed flourished, creating a beneficial situation for both parties. Texas, with its robust economy, and Israel, an innovative world leader in technology sector, are in a partnership that promises success and a prosperous future for both entities.













TAB, as a driving force behind this collaboration, is actively working to fortify the bonds between Texas and Israel. However, Israel is more than an important ally to Texas, they are also a friend.

Recognizing the challenges faced by Israel, TAB aims to play a pivotal role in continuing to provide steadfast support to Israel as they face unfathomable hardships and challenges. This alliance goes beyond economic growth and contributes to the broader canvas of international collaboration and shared prosperity.

In her address, Dr. Adelson touched upon the unique bond shared by Israelis and Texans. ""Look closer, and you’ll find that Israelis and Texans have a deep affinity,” she said. “It runs deeper than business, though commercial ties between Texas and Israel are truly booming. And it even runs deeper than basketball, though my family are huge fans of the Dallas Mavericks. It is a matter of shared spirit.""

This shared spirit, extending beyond business dealings and even beyond cultural and sporting interests, speaks to a deeper connection founded on shared values. It represents a unity that goes beyond borders, contributing to a harmonious collaboration that has and will continue to endure through the test of time.

At the conclusion of her remarks, TAB was proud to recognize Dr. Adelson with the ""Lone Star Champion"" award for supporting and strengthening the relationship between the world’s premiere Lone Star States – Texas and Israel.

8,Governor Hochul Reminds New Yorkers to Prepare as Heavy Rain and Strong Winds Move Into the State,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-reminds-new-yorkers-prepare-heavy-rain-and-strong-winds-move-state,"Governor Kathy Hochul today reminded New Yorkers to stay prepared as a storm system moves up the eastern coast and enters New York. This significant system will impact most of the state through Tuesday with heavy rain, strong winds and potential flooding, especially those in flood prone areas. The system is expected to produce 2-4 inches of rain and gusty winds in many locations, although parts of the eastern Catskills could see rainfall totals exceeding five inches. Rainfall rates are forecast to peak at 1-1.5 inches per hour during the storm’s duration, although there is the possibility for locally higher rates of rainfall at times. Flooding is likely in some locations, especially in the Mid-Hudson Valley, where recent rainfall and saturated ground is not able to absorb or hold the forecasted rainfall. Winds will be gusty, especially in New York City and Long Island, where gusts could reach 60 mph or more, especially in the far eastern portions of Long Island, which could cause power outages and worsen coastal flooding conditions. Governor Hochulcontinues to urge New Yorkers to prepare for heavy rain and gusty conditions, and to check on neighbors and family to ensure their safety through the storm.

“We have been tracking this storm system for several days and it remains on track to bring several inches of rain to New York, especially in the Mid-Hudson, where some places could see more than four inches of rain by Tuesday,” Governor Hochul said. “There is also a potential for very strong winds downstate in New York City and on Long Island, which could cause power outages. State agencies continue to monitor this system and are prepared to support our local partners. New Yorkers should continue to check the forecast for updates and take the steps necessary to stay safe.”

A Flood Watch is in effect for many locations through Monday evening. High Wind Warnings are in effect for Long Island, and Kings and Queens counties, and Coastal Flood Warnings are in effect for the coasts of Long Island and southern Queens County.
