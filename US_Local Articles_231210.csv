She’s a fit young lady, so she got out pretty easily. But she got scratched up pretty badly; it was pretty traumatic.” Walsh said that Camryn’s stress was so bad from the whole ordeal that she avoided freeway driving for weeks after.

Walsh was bewildered by what happened to his daughter. He wondered how this manhole could be simply left gaping like that. He thought about how much worse Camryn’s injuries could have been. What if she had hooked her chin on the edge on the way down, or what if someone less fit or larger had taken that unexpected plunge? What about panhandlers or landscapers that could walk there and get hurt?

So Walsh did what every citizen should do when confronted with a problem: He reached out to get it fixed. Walsh dialed 3-1-1, the City of Atlanta’s Department of Customer Service, and did not get very far. While he talked to several people, Walsh said he felt he got handed around and never to the right person.

He says he thinks this manhole is another accident waiting to happen.

Walsh is worried about people who truly need that strip of pavement for an emergency; it is an emergency lane. And while people should not normally walk along a freeway or a ramp, sometimes that is necessary.

“If you’re walking in that area, you’re not going to walk on the concrete where the traffic is and you’re not going to walk in the grass, because it is uncut and you could turn an ankle or something,” Walsh said. And then, unexpectedly, that slice of ground is gone. No cones, no signs.

Walsh has visited the site several times since Camryn’s June 2023 fall. The hole still sits unprotected. He has gone on Google Street View and seen that same hole in that spot dating back to 2011, the earliest Street View shots of that spot. So this unprotected void dates at least back to Obama’s first term. Kasim Reed was the Atlanta mayor. GA-400 still had a toll plaza. Freddie Freeman and Julio Jones were rookies and Chipper Jones was in his penultimate season. Taylor Swift was only a millionaire. And no one knew what “Snowmageddon” was.

Given the brick wall Walsh hit with the city, I recently reached out to Atlanta DOT and also to GDOT (since this manhole is along an interstate and the state maintains freeways) and am waiting to hear back.

Camryn Walsh is 5 feet, 6 inches tall. Her surprise manhole plunge saw her peeking up with only the top of her nose and above cresting the edge. This hole is on a busy stretch of I-285 that sees its fair share of wrecks and jams. Inevitably, a motorist or first responder is going to need that Cascade entrance ramp emergency lane. As long as that manhole remains uncovered, someone else is eventually going to get hurt worse than she did. Thank goodness that Jake Walsh has stayed on this small crusade for six months; we can all learn from him. Hopefully, the right people take notice and take action.

So, we do need common sense to prevail in those situations. And, of course, nothing good comes from drug activity. This department does its best to shut down drug operations. So, if anyone has tips or information, that’s why we ask that you send those our way so we can try to prevent incidents like this.”

Three of the men died at the scene and a fourth was alert while being taken to the hospital for treatment, police said.

The names of the victims were not released late Saturday. The shooting remains under investigation.

The shooting at the high-rise was the second this year and both incidents involved drug deals, according to Atlanta police. In a separate incident in February, a man was arrested after two people were shot during a drug deal, police previously said."

There is also the chance for brief tornadoes in North Georgia, but the risk remains low.

“We’re going to see some heavy downpours. But in addition to that, there is that risk that we could be dealing with some damaging wind gusts, hail and, a brief tornado cannot be ruled out,” Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Eboni Deon said."

The event was one of many across metro Atlanta involving law enforcement agencies partnering with community and corporate organizations to make the holidays brighter for children. Officers and deputies say building those relationships with the youngest citizens is crucial.

Also Saturday morning, the 25th Annual Paulding Cops for Kids event was held, coordinated by the sheriff’s office. More than 230 children were able to shop during the event. And on Wednesday, the City of Atlanta Fire and Rescue Department joined with other city groups to sponsor a Winter Resource Fair that offered groceries, gift cards and health screenings to those in need.

“We don’t necessarily want our first interactions with a young child to be a bad thing,” Labat told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution during Saturday’s event. “This is bringing hope and it’s an opportunity during the holidays for us to give back.”

Dexter Whiteside said he is focused on getting his 9-year-old son the things he needs, like a new belt and clothes. As he shopped with a deputy, Donte was focused on the Nerf guns.

While some children quickly went to the exact gifts they wanted — dolls, lego sets and even a bike — others deliberated longer, carefully choosing what to pick. Kaleb Whidby, 9, was overwhelmed with all of his options before settling on a boxing set, football, and walkie-talkies. He also picked out a board game he could play with his grandmother.

But Kaleb didn’t have time to stop and talk. There were more aisles of toys to check out.

Gladys Bush said she had no idea what she wanted before she arrived at the store with her mother. The 12-year-old quickly spotted two dolls she wanted, including one dressed in a Minnie Mouse outfit. Next, she wanted to look at lip gloss.

“This really came in handy because times are hard,” Elizabeth Bush, the sixth-grader’s mother, said as her daughter looked at her selections. “She’s the youngest of four, so it’s good to be able to be here and be able to let her get what she wants.”

The deputies also enjoyed the shopping, a different type of service than during their typical workday.

Sgt. Anthony Burgess works in the juvenile court division, where he says he focuses on trying to change the lives of children who have gotten into trouble.

“You can’t save everyone but if you save one, you did your job,” he said.

On Saturday, Burgess wore a different uniform. He was Santa Claus and spent the morning posing for pictures and hugging children.

“It brings joy to my heart,” he said. “It’s wonderful to see the kids in a different light.”

Meanwhile, Prentis was eager to play with his new toys and Play-doh. His sisters, Preyanna and Mielle, picked out dolls and some accessories, including a tiny crib and stroller.

“We’re gonna act like I’m making food for the dolls,” Prentis said.

But 10-year-old Preyanna wasn’t so sure of that plan.

“My baby’s not going to be eating Play-doh,” she said with a laugh."
4,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,"49ers roundup: McCloud shelved, Conley promoted, Greenlaw fined",https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/09/49ers-put-return-specialist-ray-ray-mccloud-on-shelf-dre-greenlaw-fined/,"SANTA CLARA — The 49ers will be without return specialist Ray-Ray McCloud for at least the rest of this month.

McCloud went on the Injured Reserve list Saturday and must miss a minimum of four games, which could prove consequential if the 49ers don’t find a sure-handed replacement in their playoff push.

Rookie Ronnie Bell filled in last game for McCloud and botched a punt return with the ball harmlessly bouncing out of bounds in last Sunday’s 42-19 win at Philadelphia.

Veteran wide receiver Chris Conley was promoted from the practice squad to fill McCloud’s roster spot.

McCloud was ruled out Friday, along with defensive tackle Arik Armstead and tight end Ross Dwelley, for this Sunday’s game between the 49ers (9-3) and the Seattle Seahawks (6-6) at Levi’s Stadium.

“He was limited on Wednesday, but didn’t feel great, so we’ve got to be safe with him,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday of McCloud.

McCloud injured his ribs in last month’s win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he played in the Thanksgiving night win at Seattle, where he fumbled a punt return that teammate Oren Burks recovered in the fourth quarter of that 31-13 win.

GREENLAW FINED

Linebacker Dre Greenlaw got fined $10,927 for his “unnecessary roughness” tackle that sparked an Eagles’ sideline scuffle with security chief Dom DiSandro, who’s reportedly not allowed on the Philadelphia sideline Sunday at Dallas. Also fined for unnecessary roughness in separate third-quarter plays from Sunday’s game: the 49ers’ Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles ($9,940, for a facemask violation) and the Eagles’ Jalen Carter ($16,937, for a violation on a point-after kick).

SEAHAWKS QB ISSUES

With starting quarterback Geno Smith (groin) questionable for Sunday’s game, the Seahawks elevated Foothill High-Pleasanton product Sean Mannion from the practice squad, as an option behind Drew Lock, Smith’s potential replacement starter. Also elevated was Patrick O’Connell as fellow linebacker Jordyn Brooks (ankle) is also questionable. Outside linebacker Frank Clark will not travel with the team for non-injury reasons, the Seahawks announced.

OTHER MOVES

Safety Erik Harris and running back Jeremy McNichols were elevated from the practice squad, likely for special-teams roles in Sunday’s games along with depth purposes at their specific positions. McNichols got the nod over fellow running back Ty Davis-Price, who was released Tuesday but re-signed to the practice squad. Also of note, the 49ers opted for Conley’s promotion rather than activate Danny Gray off Injured Reserve."
5,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,It's Sho-ver: Ohtani passes over SF Giants for record-breaking deal with Dodgers,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/09/its-sho-ver-ohtani-passes-over-sf-giants-for-record-breaking-deal-with-dodgers/,"Baseball’s highest-profile free agency ever is over, and the San Francisco Giants struck out once again.

Shohei Ohtani announced Saturday via his personal Instagram a record-shattering agreement that not only meant the Giants finished as runners-up, but will have to face the two-way megastar a dozen times a year as the Dodgers’ grip on the National League West grows even tighter.

Long perceived to be the favorites in the sweepstakes for the two-time MVP and global sensation, the Dodgers reeled in their prize one day after false reports that Ohtani was in agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays sent the sport into a frenzy. The terms of the contract, according to his agent, Nez Balelo: $700 million over 10 years, eclipsing the previous record held by Mike Trout, whose $426.5 million deal had been the largest in major-league history.

In a statement, Balelo called it a “unique, historic contract for a unique, historic player.”

Ohtani, whose decision has stalled the baseball offseason, addressed “all the fans and everyone involved in the baseball world” in his own statement, writing that “I apologize for taking so long to come to a decision,” adding a message to Dodgers fans. “I pledge to always do what’s best for the team and always continue to give it my all to be the best version of myself. Until the last day of my playing career, I want to continue to strive forward not only for the Dodgers but for the baseball world.”

The outcome couldn’t be worse for the Giants, who have been adamant about adding star power this offseason and now must pivot elsewhere while coming to terms with the game’s biggest attraction hitting 1-2-3 with Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman through at least 2027 (when Freeman’s contract expires).

Don’t forget they also share a division with the defending National League champion Diamondbacks, and while the Padres traded away Juan Soto, they still have Manny Machado, Fernando Tatis Jr., Xander Boegarts and Ha-Seong Kim.

If there’s one silver lining, the Dodgers are taking on considerable risk, given that Ohtani is ruled out from pitching in 2024 after what was reported to be a second Tommy John surgery and is no sure thing to ever be the same two-way player. However, there can only be so much downside to signing the game’s preeminent slugger.

While they were one of at least three teams reported to have received a meeting, the Giants’ final offer is unknown.

“Shohei and I want to thank all the organizations that reached out to us for their interest and respect, especially the wonderful people we got to know even better as this process unfolded,” Balelo said in a statement. “We know fans, media and the entire industry had a high degree of interest in this process, and we want to express our appreciation for their passion and their consideration as it played out.”

Ohtani was easily the top prize on the market, but the Giants should have enough funds earmarked for him that they can use to patch multiple holes on the roster.

They’re still seeking to upgrade their outfield, improve their defense and athleticism, and find a partner for Logan Webb at the top of the rotation.

The Giants have been linked to the top two center fielders available, Cody Bellinger and Jung-Hoo Lee, and general manager Pete Putila said at the Winter Meetings that “we have some internal options, but we’re scanning the entire market, as well.” Third baseman Matt Chapman has strong ties to manager Bob Melvin and would help stabilize the left side of the Giants’ infield and their lineup.

The top priority after Ohtani, though? It might be another Japanese sensation, Yoshinobu Yamamoto.

Only 25 years old, the right-hander has won the past three Sawamura Awards, given annually to the top pitcher in Nippon Pro Baseball. The idea of pairing him with Webb, who’s 26, and Kyle Harrison, 22, is an enticing proposition — but it will also likely be an expensive one, with the Mets and Yankees expected to be in the bidding.

Don’t rule out the Dodgers, either. The addition of Ohtani doesn’t address their biggest need for 2024 — the starting rotation — and the deal reportedly includes “unprecedented deferrals,” meaning they might not be done spending.

Given his age and ability, Yamamoto represents almost as much of a unicorn as Ohtani.

Almost.

This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
6,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,"As expected, Serra falls to Mater Dei in CIF Open state title game",https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/09/as-expected-serra-falls-to-mater-dei-in-cif-open-division-state-championship-game/,"MISSION VIEJO — One of the greatest teams in Central Coast Section history, a group of players led by a passionate and driven coach who knows how to motivate young men, took another shot at perfection Saturday night, another swing at the state’s top championship.

But like the past two years, Serra fell short, a second consecutive unbeaten season ending in defeat against one of Southern California’s superpowers.

This time, Mater Dei-Santa Ana took down the Padres, winning the CIF Open Division championship 35-0 at Saddleback College behind its all-star collection of major college talent. The final 11:50 was played with a running clock.

The Open title was Mater Dei’s fourth, all since 2017, and second at Serra’s expense.

A massive underdog on this stage for the third time in as many appearances, the Padres (12-1) pulled out every trick in their book to keep Mater Dei out of sorts and ran down the play clock before snaps to shorten the game.

It worked, to some degree.

Serra trailed 14-0 after the first quarter and didn’t give up a third touchdown until late in the second quarter.

The Padres played with spirited aggression, which was to be expected given the fire coach Patrick Walsh breathes into his program, but they simply were overmatched by a Mater Dei team that loaded four- and five-star talent.

When it was over and Walsh gathered the team in the locker room, he told his players that he loved them.

“One of the best teams I’ve ever coached, a great senior class,” Walsh said. “Full of heart. Full of integrity. Full of pride. Nothing to be ashamed of. The only thing I would fear is if this experience tore them apart. But that’s not going to happen because this team is too tight.”

Mater Dei was far from perfect, penalized 10 times for 80 yards in the first half alone and 16 times for 150 yards overall.

But the Monarchs caught their own break on their first possession when a roughing-the-punter infraction opened the door for a 16-yard touchdown pass from senior quarterback Elijah Brown, a Stanford commit, to freshman tight end Mark Bowman.

The lead stretched to 14-0 later in the quarter on a 74-yard pass down the sideline from Brown to Marcus Harris, a four-star junior. Harris caught the ball in stride and turned on the jets to reach the end zone.

Brown finished 17 of 22 for 298 yards and four touchdowns.

Serra used the Wildcat, spread five receivers to one side of the field, called a fake punt and field goal, recovered an onside kick but with minimal success on the scoreboard.

Mater Dei (13-1) crossed the goal line again late in the first half on a 12-yard TD pass from Brown to Jonah Smith that made it 21-0 at the midway break.

“It didn’t end how I wanted it to,” Serra two-way standout Jabari Mann said. “But I love my team. I love what we did this year. I’m proud of the guys. Proud of the coaches for getting us here every year.”

Last season, an undefeated Serra team that averaged 36.6 per game lost to St. John Bosco 45-0 in the state’s Open Division championship game.

The Padres averaged 43.25 points per game this season while going 12-0, which included victories over Folsom and De La Salle and West Catholic Athletic League and Central Coast Section championships.

Serra finished with 58 yards of offense on Saturday in 39 plays. Mater Dei had 386 yards in 43 plays.

So the story goes.

In California during this era, two teams play at a level nobody in Northern California and very few in Southern California have reached.

“It’s not the outcome we wanted the past three years,” senior safety Joseph Bey said. “But brotherhood is something you can’t buy. Some things just didn’t go our way. I thought we played a really good first half. That first drive we stopped them and then we rushed the punter. That really hurt.”

Mater Dei widened the margin to 28-0 on an 8-yard run by Jordon Davison, a four-star junior from the Bay Area, and 35-0 early in the fourth quarter on a 31-yard touchdown pass from Brown to Jack Ressler.

Before Serra took the field on Saturday night, it watched Folsom — a team it beat in August — hoist a state championship trophy by winning the Division 1-A title with a 20-14 victory over St. Bonaventure.

If Serra had lost to Folsom and/or De La Salle, it might have had a chance to win another division this weekend.

Instead, a senior class that included standouts such as Mann, Bey, Maealiuaki Smith and Danny Niu will leave Serra without a state title but as the top team in NorCal during their era.

Was that hard to watch?

“The best team in Northern California, hands down, bar none,” Walsh said. “We beat other teams that were down here. Not hard at all. No. 1 team in NorCal and if the cost of being the No. 1 team in our area is this, then we’re going to going to continue to strive to do this. That’s just the way it’s going to be.

“We’re the undisputed champs. We’ve gone undefeated back-to-back in the WCAL. That’s never been done since 1958. I’m so proud of this team. I am proud of these kids. I wish I could have done a better job coaching tonight, getting them in position to play better. But I have no regrets and I love the group.”"
7,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,The Warriors' 29 turnovers open up bigger questions about the offense,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/10/the-warriors-29-turnovers-open-up-bigger-questions-about-the-offense/,"The Warriors will have three days in Phoenix to help bond as a team and recover from their latest meltdown in Oklahoma City. They may watch some college hoops together. They will practice. Perhaps have a team dinner.

Written in stone on the schedule, though, is to gather and watch a horror film together.

That horror film: All 29 turnovers they committed Friday in a 138-136 overtime loss to the Thunder.

“We will watch all 29 as a team,” coach Steve Kerr told reporters on Friday. “I can tell you that. We will watch all 29 turnovers.”

What they’ll see is a well-rounded comedy of errors. Of the 10 Warriors that took the court, only Cory Joseph had a zero in the turnover column. Only Brandin Podziemski had one turnover and everyone else committed at least two. The full turnover breakdown:

Andrew Wiggins: 6

Draymond Green: 4

Klay Thompson: 4

Jonathan Kuminga: 3

Steph Curry: 3

Dario Šarić: 3

Kevon Looney: 2

Moses Moody: 2

Green, the facilitator, is often the one who shoulders the most turnovers in a heavy-motion offense. Wiggins and Thompson’s many turnovers are a little more baffling considering they aren’t ball handlers. Despite the 14-point lead the Warriors had and a three-point win in hand before Green’s costly foul, the bounty of turnovers reveals bigger flaws to the Warriors’ approach and explains why they have had trouble against longer, more athletic teams such as the Thunder.

A handful of the turnovers were just sloppy, moving screens, feet caught out of bounds. Just mistakes within the margin for error that happen in a day’s work. The majority, though, were more a product of the Thunder getting into the passing lanes with quick reads off the Warriors’ quintessential motion offense.

Turnovers are a cost the Warriors have paid in the past to make that motion offense flow. But as some within the team put it, the defense and offense have to be among the league’s best to render the turnovers just a minor casualty for the greater good.

At their peak, the Warriors boasted a top defense that could force turnovers, and turn chaos into transition offense that counteracted the errors from their motion offense.

Now, the Warriors have a league-average 114.4 defensive rating and 15.8% of their possessions result in a turnover, fourth worst in the league in the same club as the lowly San Antonio Spurs, Utah Jazz, Detroit Pistons, and Portland Trail Blazers. Swapping turnover aficionado Jordan Poole for ball-protector Chris Paul was supposed to fix the problem — but to little avail.

As those within the team also note, offensive structure isn’t the crux of the problem. However, the issue stems from individual shortcomings.

Of the 29 turnovers against Oklahoma City, 13 were labeled as bad passes. In this sit-down, those may be the clips the team focuses on. They may go over the 10 combined turnovers from Thompson and Wiggins to get to the root of what’s held both back as secondary scorers next to Curry. Neither have been aggressive attacking the rim and are almost sure-fires to make an extra pass.

For Golden State’s third turnover of the game, Wiggins received an entry pass from Green with a defender on him, and instead of using his size and athleticism to go up to the rim, he passed it out to nobody. In the third quarter, Wiggins had the ball with Josh Giddey in front of him and Jalen Williams patrolling, able to slide to the rim if Wiggins attacked — but also in place to intercept Wiggins’ extra pass to Green in the corner. Turnover.

Some of Thompson’s costlier turnovers came off entry passes that Thunder players were all over. Green’s four turnovers were mostly the same — Oklahoma City was all over the Warriors’ extra passes, guessing correctly that no one would challenge their defender one-on-one.

Trying to create opportunities off the ball, Green, Thompson, and Wiggins created a whirlwind of turnover chaos on their own.

Jonathan Kuminga has given Golden State life against Portland and the Thunder because he’s leaned into creating plays for himself — taking the ball to the paint and challenging defenses with his size and might, finishing with some craftiness at the rim. Curry is an all-timer at creating his own shot, too, but defenses know he could take over an entire game if need be and muzzle him.

As crazy as it sounds after a high-turnover game — the Warriors could have used what Poole brought offensively. Fearlessness attacking the rim is something the Warriors desperately miss from Poole, and that was the changeup pitch that paired well with Curry’s fastball throughout their 2022 title run. Of course, Poole’s propensity for head-scratching turnovers was one of a few reasons the organization traded him off for Paul.

But he left a scoring void. Wiggins, Kuminga, and Thompson could fill that void."
8,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,Troubled retailer Sears quietly reopens two stores. What is behind the comeback?,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/10/troubled-retailer-sears-quietly-reopens-two-stores-what-is-behind-the-comeback/,"Los Angeles — To the casual shopper, Sears, one of America’s oldest retailers, may appear to be on life support. The department store chain that once reinvented how Americans shopped now barely has a brick-and-mortar footprint after a 2018 bankruptcy and hundreds of store closures.

But talk of Sears’ demise may be premature: just two months ago, a previously shuttered Sears in Burbank, California, quietly turned the lights back on. Two weeks after that, another reopened in Union Gap, Washington.

I visited the newly opened Burbank store several times last month, including on Black Friday, retail’s busiest shopping day, to explore the storied brand. The new Sears looks much like the old one, a vestige from a time when department stores ruled America’s shopping landscape. While the store remained mostly devoid of shoppers when I visited, those who did drop in, along with some store associates, expressed hope and excitement of a new age for Sears.

Inside Sears’ revived Burbank store

The reborn Sears in Burbank looks like a typical American department store. Mattresses, appliances, and other home goods populate the ground floor. Up an escalator you find clothing, bags and accessories. Another escalator transports you up to a third floor, but it was roped off when I visited with signs promising something would be coming soon.

The store was clean and organized ­– but shoppers were sparse.

The newly reopened Burbank location, which initially closed one year ago, likely didn’t look so different from a typical Sears store in 2005, when hedge fund operator Eddie Lampert bought control of the chain for $11 billion and merged it with another retailer in his portfolio, Kmart. That year, the two brands counted 3,500 US stores between them and more than 300,000 employees.

Today’s Sears’ footprint is minuscule, with no more than 12 Sears stores remaining in the continental US, according to data from Google Maps. A November post in the Union Gap, WA Facebook group confirmed that store location’s reopening.

Some suggest that Lampert used the Sears acquisition as a play in the real estate market. His plans for the brand going forward are less clear. Attempts to get a clear answer proved unsuccessful. The brand exists under a holding company called Transformco. Calls and emails over several weeks to Transformco’s main line and executives went unanswered. The Burbank store’s manager passed along a phone number for Sears’ media department; the number was not in service.

One Burbank store associate, who asked not to be named since they weren’t permitted to speak to the media, told me they had worked at multiple Sears locations for decades and they were glad to be given the chance to come back.

“I love Sears. They’ve treated me well,” the person said.

I don’t remember Sears at the height of its influence: I was born just one year before the retailer discontinued its groundbreaking catalog in 1993. Half a century ago, the Sears catalog helped change the way Americans lived, allowing more people to shop from anywhere since they didn’t have to rely on nearby stores to buy goods. It was a proto-model of online shopping.

As Sears grew and pioneered its own brands such as Kenmore appliances, Craftsman tools and Allstate insurance, the company became a juggernaut, employing legions of workers to produce and sell the products in the rapidly expanding brick and mortar Sears stores. The Sears Tower in downtown Chicago, where the corporate parent operated, was the world’s tallest skyscraper until 1998.

More than one Burbank store associate said they thought their store might be a test for Sears’ parent company, Transformco, which is owned by Lampert, who is also Sears’ former CEO. They hoped that if their store proved successful, more locations would open and the brand might be revived.

How serious is Sears’ relaunch effort?

Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData’s retail division, had a different view of Sears’ relaunch.

“I don’t think it’s a serious attempt at revival,” he said.

Saunders said it’s likely Sears hasn’t found tenants for some Transformco-owned retail locations due to challenges facing the overall retail sector.

“I think there a lot of locations where retailers just don’t want to lease out that space, and so I think the view is ‘if no one is going to lease it out, rather than it sitting there idle, we might as well try and monetize it,’” Saunders said.

“For a very big space like Sears, you haven’t got many tenants. No department stores are really opening a lot of new outlets,” he added.

When I returned to Sears on Black Friday, few shoppers perused the aisles compared to other stores in the Burbank Town Center mall, where Sears is located. One Sears associate told me they hoped the store would be busier that day.

“Welcome back” signs lined the outside of the store, but perhaps people just hadn’t heard of its reopening: the announcement was made on Sears’ local Burbank Facebook page.

One shopper, Daisy Davis, said she only learned the Burbank location had reopened after a conversation with her neighbor about Sears prompted an internet search of whether any stores remained open.

“Sure enough, it said this one was opening. There’s still conflicting information too, because some of the maps say it’s closed,” she said.

In the years after Lampert’s takeover, sales at the 137-year-old retailer slowed amid a lack of investment in store updates, a slower pivot to e-commerce, and increased competition from other big box retailers and newer online behemoths such as Amazon.

By 2018, the company had filed for bankruptcy. The next year, Lampert’s hedge fund bought the remains of the business out of bankruptcy and renamed its parent company Transformco. The retailer exited bankruptcy with 223 Sears and 202 Kmart stores nationwide. But four years later, most of those stores have closed.

Sears shoppers I spoke with shared the store employees’ excitement about the reopening.

“I’m just really happy they reopened. It feels like the Sears I remember, which is good,” said Katherine Sage, a shopper who stopped into Sears to pick up a polo shirt for her son. “I think they have good products; I think their mattresses are awesome.”

Armita Cohen, an 80-year-old retiree, said she visited the Burbank location often since its reopening after her local store in Glendale, CA closed.

“I don’t know why they closed that store. It was a wonderful store,” she said. “For Christmas I don’t have to go to any other place. I just go to Sears and I find everything.”

Cohen said she was “crossing her fingers” that the Glendale store would reopen.

Could Sears make a comeback?

Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said it was still possible for a store with strong brand-name recognition, like Sears, to make a comeback, even in the internet age.

“Big stores that offer a large variety of products, but do so in a curated way, putting together products that you want ­– those are thriving,” Siegel said.

“Recognizing that there is value in a brand name, even if that brand went out of business, is not something new,” he added. “You watched another company buy Bed Bath and Beyond’s intellectual property immediately after it went out because a brand is a tough thing to kill.”

At least one shopper was optimistic about a future for Sears if it embraces a more modern shopper.

“I think they need to consult with the younger generation to find out more of what they want,” Sage said, standing outside the Sears in Burbank. “Keep the products that people go in for, but innovate.”

9,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,"Three dead in outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, CDC warns",https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/10/three-dead-in-outbreak-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever-cdc-warns/,"An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

The five cases were identified in Southern California and involved people who had traveled to Tecate, Baja California, in the previous two weeks. Four were under age 18, and three were US residents, the agency said in a health alert. All five were hospitalized, and three died.

The CDC is warning health care providers that if a patient has symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and has recently traveled to northern Mexico, they should consider starting treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline right away, rather than waiting for test results to confirm the condition.

“RMSF is a severe, rapidly progressive, and often deadly disease transmitted by the bite of infected ticks, although many patients do not recall being bitten by a tick,” the agency notes. It’s endemic in northern Mexico and in parts of the southwestern US, where it can be transmitted by brown dog ticks. It does not spread from person to person.

On or after about five days, someone may develop changes in mental state, coma, brain swelling, respiratory problems and multiorgan damage. It’s fatal in 5% to 10% of cases, with about half of those deaths happening within eight days of the onset of illness.

Anyone who’s traveled to northern Mexico and develops symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever within two weeks of their return to the US should get medical attention right away, the CDC says. Protect against tick bites by treating pet dogs, using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing when outdoors. Check yourself and children for ticks after spending time outdoors or around dogs, and immediately remove any ticks you find.

CASPAR BEACH — A welding hammer strapped to her wrist, Joy Hollenback slipped on blue fins and swam into the churning, chilly Pacific surf one fall morning to do her part to save Northern California’s vanishing kelp forests.

Hollenback floated on the swaying surface to regulate her breathing before free diving into the murky depths toward the seafloor. There, she spotted her target: voracious, kelp-devouring purple urchins.

Within seconds she smashed 20 to smithereens. “If you’re angry, it’s a cathartic way to get it all out,” Hollenback joked. “It’s ecologically sanctioned mayhem.”

The veterinarian who lives in Berkeley, California is part of a crew of volunteers who swim, snorkel and dive armed with pick axes and hammers on a sole mission: To crush purple urchins that largely destroyed 96% of California’s iconic bull kelp forests between 2014 and 2020, and with it harmed red abalone and other sea life they supported.

The pilot project off the Mendocino County coast is one of many initiatives California is testing to save such leafy marine ecosystems, which are declining worldwide due to climate change.

Kelp forests play an integral role in the health of the world’s oceans, one of the issues being discussed at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai.

Based on early observations, efforts like urchin culling appear to be helping.

Biologists say they have started to see small successes with the experiments started several years ago, offering hope of reversing destruction likened to a rainforest being clear-cut.

Healthy patches of kelp and schools of fish returned this summer to small sections where urchins were crushed at Caspar Cove, 160 miles (200 kilometers) north of San Francisco.

Nearby at Albion Bay, where commercial divers removed many of the urchins in 2021, biologists put tiny kelp grown in a lab on 98-foot (30-meter) lines. In August, they discovered the kelp not only had reached the surface, but was reproducing.

“That’s the first time we know of that happening in an open coastal environment,” said Norah Eddy of The Nature Conservancy, one of several organizations participating in the experiment. “What we want is for the kelp to start putting out babies. This is showing these methods can be done in these kinds of rugged environments.”

There are still huge challenges to overcome before California’s bull kelp is on the path to recovery. But scientists say the progress has relieved fears the forests were lost forever.

“This is really setting the system up to hold on to the kelp that we do have until we’re in a better place,” said Kristen Elsmore, a senior scientist at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Scientists will be collecting data over the next three years to determine what methods are most effective as California builds its first plan to restore and manage kelp.

Kelp was so abundant that the state managed it solely as a fishery, overseeing commercial and recreational harvests. Under the plan, kelp will be managed now as an ecosystem, reflecting the heightened understanding of kelp’s importance.

“Kelp forms whole forests that are supporting so many other species and so it just has this cascading effect on the near-shore ecosystem when you lose your kelp,” Elsmore said. “You’re losing a whole forest, not just one species.”

The plan could inform restoration efforts from Australia to Chile, where kelp faces similar threats.

“The ultimate goal is for these systems to really be self-sustaining and the restoration part to really just be giving it a gentle nudge in the right direction,” the scientist said.

Kelp has been disappearing as a warming planet raises ocean temperatures.

Along the West Coast, the problem started after 2013 when a warm water mass nicknamed “the blob” developed off Alaska and stretched south, lingering for four years as it wreaked havoc on marine ecosystems all the way to Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.

At the same time, a mysterious wasting disease decimated sunflower sea stars, causing their arms to fall off and turning them into gooey masses, killing 90% of the population.

The star fish is the main purple urchin predator. After the disease killed more than 5 billion sea stars, the urchin population exploded, devouring kelp and leaving seascapes with almost nothing but the spiny, globular echinoderms.

The kelp loss prompted the California Fish and Game Commission to close its recreational red abalone fishery in 2018. Commercial harvests of red urchins have also been hurt. Red urchins are favored over the purple urchins because they contain more edible uni or roe inside, but commercial divers say the amount has shrunk with less kelp.

Bull kelp, an annual seaweed, starts as a microscopic spore that grows up to two feet (.6 meters) per day until it reaches up to 98 feet (30 meters) before dying off in the cooler months. It flourishes in cool, nutrient-rich waters.

California’s coast has bull and giant kelp, the world’s largest marine algae. Urchins have hurt both species, though giant kelp forests have fared better.

Some believe the only way to restore kelp is to reduce the purple urchins, which can go dormant for years only to remerge and eat new kelp growth. Chefs have started serving purple urchins to build a market.

“Sometime it does feel weird, like you’re killing this animal that’s a native species, but it’s for the greater good,” said Morgan Murphy-Cannella of Reef Check Foundation, the kelp restoration coordinator involved in the kelp planting at Albion Bay. Its volunteers monitor kelp forests from Canada to Mexico.

Josh Russo, a former abalone fisher and founder of the Watermen’s Alliance, a coalition of spearfishing clubs, helped start the urchin crushing.

After struggling to swing them underwater, they turned to small welding and furniture hammers and icepicks.

Volunteers have cleared 80% of purple urchins from a section at Caspar’s Cove, Russo said. It is one of two spots where California allows recreational licensed fishers to take an unlimited amount of purple urchins.

But the urchin crushing is not without controversy. Some fear it could spread urchin eggs, exacerbating the problem.

Russo’s seen no evidence of that. Instead, he said, the density of urchins has lessened in the 100-by-100 yard (91 by 91 meter) section, where schools of juvenile rock fish swished this summer amid the towering algae.

“This went from being urchin barren to just full of life again,” Russo said.

Scientists say nothing can replace natural predators, like the sunflower sea star.

After learning to breed it in captivity, biologists are building a stock to reintroduce it. Sunflower sea stars are at four California aquariums, including the Birch aquarium in San Diego that induced the spawning of three in October.

At least four sunflower star fish also were spotted off the Mendocino coast this year, which Elsmore said “is super exciting” since none were seen for years there.

There’s still much to learn. Kelp has not come back in all spots cleared of urchins, and scientists don’t know why.

But the crushing is helping buy time to find permanent solutions.

Events run April to September and draw people from across Northern California.

On a Saturday in September, volunteers included a paralegal, a factory worker, university students and a landscape contractor whose two Australian shepherds, “Swimmer” and “Breaker,” watched patiently from the beach. One artist collected the urchins to make purple dye for clothing.

Hollenback, the veterinarian, started participating in May 2022 after seeing the events on Facebook. She has hammered as many as 82 urchins in the 50 seconds she can hold her breath. On this day the sea was too turbulent at Caspar Cove so the group diverted to a neighboring bay to seek urchins.

“It can feel counterintuitive to kill animals when my job is to save them,” she said. “But this is helping to save the entire ecosystem.”

11,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,Trial date reset for Bay Area attorney charged with child sex crimes,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/10/trial-date-reset-for-former-vaca-attorney-charged-with-child-sex-crimes/,"A Solano County Superior Court judge has rescheduled the jury trial from January to February for a former Vacaville attorney accused in a felony child sex assault case.

Defendant James Glenn Haskell, 41, appeared Friday in Department 23 for a trial confirmation, and Judge John B. Ellis ordered him to return for the trial at 9 a.m. Feb. 13 in the Justice Center in Fairfield.

Haskell – who has entered not-guilty pleas to all allegations – enhancements and prior offenses, also must return for a trial management conference at 8:30 a.m. Feb. 9, court records show.

He is represented by Fairfield criminal defense attorney Thomas Maas. Deputy District Attorney Shelly Moore leads the prosecution.

The latest development in the case comes after a two-day April preliminary hearing and Haskell’s held-to-answer arraignment. He faces 16 counts, felonies and misdemeanors.

As previously reported, before the second day of the preliminary hearing, Ellis met briefly in chambers with Maas, Moore, and a social worker from Solano County Child Welfare Services.

Returning to the courtroom at the end of the meeting, Ellis said, “Given the nature of the case,” he would order the four victims — all minors when the District Attorney’s Office filed its criminal complaint in early May last year — to testify.

As testimony resumed for the second day, Sheriff’s Detective Daniel Schilling returned to the witness stand for more direct questioning by Moore.

He testified that one of the victims told him during an interview that Haskell allegedly had inserted his fingers into her vagina an estimated “20 or 30 times” while she was asleep, actions that started in January 2020 and occurred before her 16th birthday.

Upon cross-examination, however, Maas got Schilling to acknowledge that the girl was unsure if the crimes occurred before her 16th birthday.

To counter Moore’s allegations of child abuse, Maas called two county child welfare employees, one of them testifying that, during supervised visits in February 2022, the children “appeared to be happy” when meeting with Haskell and his wife, Emily.

Moore later enumerated the allegations, 18 in all, among them sexual penetration by a foreign object while the minor victim was unconscious; corporeal injury to a child; assault, including strangulation, likely to produce great bodily injury, and strikes with a belt; forcing two of the children to sleep on a bathroom floor, one of them for bed-wetting; four counts of lewd acts on a child; and cruelty to a child by inflicting injury, including pushing a child to the ground, then kicking the child, felonies and misdemeanors that allegedly occurred between October 2018 and up until early 2022, according to court documents and testimony.

Maas noted that one of the older victims delayed reporting sexual abuse, that some of the allegations were “suspect,” and that the four felony sexual assault claims were “the most overtly suspect set of claims.”

In the end, Ellis discharged two of the counts, leaving 16, including the four felony sexual assault charges.

On the first day of the preliminary hearing – April 12 – Moore called as her first witness Solano County Sheriff’s Deputy Wes Simpson. He said he responded to a Vacaville high school on a report that Haskell, a former attorney with the Reynolds Law firm, had injured a child by striking her with a belt.

Interviewed on Feb. 3, 2020, the child told Simpson that she had been spanked “about 20 times” during the previous nine months, bruising her buttocks and upper thighs.

Simpson testified that he left the school campus to speak with Haskell’s wife about the child’s statements and those of another child who heard the corporeal punishment.

Schilling, who also testified the first day, said he learned from a family friend the allegations of “sexual touching” by Haskell.

During the afternoon session, Schilling remained on the stand and Maas cross-examined him, with Schilling stating that the girl didn’t report the sexual assaults at the time because she was afraid she’d “be disciplined” like the other children.

Besides using video recordings of interviews with the children, Maas also repeatedly referred to investigator reports, specifically what the children said, in an effort to weaken Moore’s case.

Schilling admitted Maas was correct that, in the case of one child, she did not report the sexual abuse for fear of being returned to foster care.

Haskell’s most recent court dates follow a mid-September 2022 revelation that the case grew more complex not only with a motion to increase bail but also with Moore’s filing several new serious felony charges.

Haskell, reportedly now unemployed and living in Southern California, remains out of custody after posting $240,000 bail in May 2022.

Moore filed an amended criminal complaint on Sept. 15, adding five more counts, including the four felony charges alleging sexual abuse and one misdemeanor charge alleging physical abuse of a young victim and three of the victim’s siblings.

Court records show that Haskell was arrested by Solano County Sheriff’s deputies on a warrant issued May 3, 2022.

On May 4, Haskell also was subject to a criminal protective order, prohibiting him from having any contact with four youths listed in the order.

If convicted at trial, besides the possibility of two life sentences, Haskell will be required to register as a sex offender.

On the Reynolds Law website, before his information was deleted, Haskell was deemed a certified specialist in estate planning, probate and trust law, authorized to advise on business formation matters and a variety of other civil matters.

Haskell was raised in California but also lived in Alaska, Guadalajara, Mexico, and Washington, D.C. Before attending law school, he worked at the U.S. Senate and at his grandfather’s cattle and grain exporting business in Southern California.

While volunteering for the Boys Scouts of America in Solano County, Haskell served as a Scoutmaster and commissioner. Besides his memberships in Rotary and the Vacaville Chamber of Commerce, he was a member of Will C. Wood’s Pep Squad and the Play 4 All Park, among many other nonprofits.

Haskell also was, at one time, a bishop in a Vacaville ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly called the Mormon Church."
12,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,Widow blames suicide of LA County sheriff’s deputy on excessive overtime,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/10/widow-blames-suicide-of-la-county-sheriffs-deputy-on-excessive-overtime/,"The widow of a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who killed himself last month has filed a $20 million claim alleging her husband suffered from deep depression after he was forced to work exhaustive, mandatory overtime for a dozen years at a jail facility.

The claim, filed Friday, Dec. 8, against the county, blames the Sheriff’s Department for the death of Deputy Arturo Atilano-Valadez, who died from a gunshot wound at his home on Nov. 7. He is among eight current or former Sheriff’s Department employees to die by suicide this year, according to the agency, the largest sheriff’s department in the nation.

“What has happened to my family is going to continue to happen to any other deputies forced to work (in the jail) all the time,” Michele Atilano said at a news conference. “My husband is just one of many, many who are sick and are being forced to work in the jail all of the time.”

As of Friday, the Sheriff’s Department had not received a copy of the claim, which is a precursor to a formal lawsuit.

In a statement, Sheriff Robert Luna called Atilano-Valadez’s death tragic.

“A loss of a department family member is extremely tragic, and our continued thoughts are with the family during this difficult time,” Luna said. “The department has not received the official claim but is deeply committed to ensuring the well-being and safety of all its employees. The department values its personnel who are dedicated professionals who work tirelessly to keep our communities safe.”

The claim filed by attorney Brad Gage alleges Atilano-Valadez, a 21-year veteran of the Sheriff’s Department, often worked 12 hours a day or more at the jail, where he was “locked in like a prisoner” and was ordered to work even more hours of mandatory overtime.

“He asked to leave the jails, but his requests were repeatedly denied. He saw doctors and therapists, but the overtime and virtual imprisonment became too severe,” alleges the claim. “But for the intentional actions by the defendants, with forced overtime and forcing him to work in the jail for so long, he would not have been killed.”

Among the eight current or former L.A. County sheriff’s employees to die by suicide this year, four — including Atilano-Valadez — killed themselves during a 24-hour period in early November. Authorities have said the deaths are not believed to be related.

The number of suicides in unprecedented, according to Luna.

“We lost a sheriff’s commander, a deputy sheriff, a custody assistant and a retired employee, who are as just an important part of our family as anybody else,” Luna told KTLA in November. “As far as our records reflect, we have not seen anything like this.”

Atilano said the excessive mandatory overtime hours her husband was forced to work turned him into a “zombie,” adding that she believes LACSD’s work policies put other deputies and the public at risk. “The public is not safe,” she said. “All they have now is a bunch of deputies who are zombies walking around who are tired.”

Gage filed a similar $20 million wrongful death claim last month against the Sheriff’s Department on behalf of Los Angeles County sheriff’s Deputy Ryan Clinkunbroomer, who was shot and killed Sept. 16 during an ambush while waiting in his patrol SUV for a traffic light to change in Palmdale.

Kim and Michael Clinkunbroomer, the deputy’s parents, allege the killing could have been prevented if the Sheriff’s Department hadn’t required their son to work excessive overtime, which fatigued him and prevented him from adequately defending himself.

Kevin Eduardo Cataneo Salazar, 29, is charged with capital murder in the killing of Clinkunbroomer."

Ask Amy: After this man’s behavior at my wedding, I want my best friend to dump him Advice | Ask Amy: Now I realize what stay-at-home spouses are complaining about I’ve been struggling a bit lately with looking way down the road.

I used to be this very adventurous person. I was more or less up for anything. I’d describe myself as almost daring and unconventional.

Yesterday my husband and I had a lengthy (and I mean lengthy) conversation about granite countertops.

Our kids are 3 and 5 years old. Our world revolves around them, other families with children their ages, our jobs and our house.

I find myself wondering what happened to us and wondering how we can fix it.

– Safe But Not Sound

Dear Safe: First of all, even though you are deep into the wooliest part of your family life, you possess enough perspective to remember your earlier self with fondness – and you want to reclaim access to that person and those feelings.

Some people dive into the granite conversation, and they stay there, forever, locked into choices and actions that are ultimately superficial.

My first suggestion is that you might consider the perspective that raising children at this stage is actually loaded with tiny adventures and some big challenges. You and your husband are scaling small mountains every day.

Second, I think that you two should leave your children, and your home environment, for a weekend. Two whole days.

While away, you should rest, relax and make a determination to look at your larger life-goals. Reach for the sky and write down your list.

You want more adventure. What are some ways you can get that as individuals, as a couple, and as a family? How can you raise your children to be free, brave and bold souls?

When you’re young, adventure has a way of finding you. When you’re older, you have to deliberately seek it. I hope you will.

Dear Amy: I’m a girl in 11th grade.

In my freshman year, I made friends with “Ruby.” Over time I came to understand that I needed to end the friendship due to Ruby’s troubling behavior toward others and with me.

Now, two years later, I have a new friend, “Sammie,” who is also friends with Ruby.

I only hang out with Sammie when Ruby is not present.

On several occasions when I was talking with Sammie, Ruby joined the conversation. I was cordial, but I tried to limit my contact.

Now, when I see Ruby in the hall at school, Ruby waves enthusiastically and calls my name excitedly.

I don’t want any contact with Ruby. I don’t want any association with this person’s bad actions, including occasionally being violent.

I don’t want to confront Ruby to say I’m not interested in friendship, but Ruby keeps making attempts, suggesting renewing the friendship.

How can I gently distance myself from Ruby without causing conflict or hurting this person’s feelings?

– Desperate for Distance

Dear Desperate: I think that you should continue along the careful course you’ve already set. Be polite, non-committal and avoidant.

Ruby might have changed somewhat during the many months you’ve successfully been distant, and while you should stay open to that possibility, you should not hang out with someone – anyone– who makes you uncomfortable.

If Ruby confronts you about your distance, you might say something like, “I’m just hanging back, like usual.”

Don’t let yourself be drawn in. You don’t need to answer loaded questions. Just be quiet and polite.

You don’t seem to have discussed Ruby with Sammie in any depth, and I also think this is wise — although I caution you that if Ruby hasn’t really changed, Sammie might be drawn into a friendship drama-triangle with Ruby at one point, Sammie at another, and you at the third.

You might wonder if Sammie is making the right choice regarding a friendship with this challenging person, but that friendship decision should be up to Sammie.

All of this is a reminder of what a social mine-field high school can be, but you seem well-equipped to handle these challenges.

Dear Dismayed: “Wondering” already felt threatened by the relationship, and then the sister seemed to deliver an actual threat. I thought it was wisest to walk away.

During this time, I have brought new ideas and proposed new events. Everyone likes me, for which I am grateful.

The current president is stepping down because he is relocating. Following his announcement, everyone was abuzz and people started asking me to run for president. At last month’s meeting, the subject was again brought up, and we were asked if anyone was interested. Well, all eyes were on me, so I put in my bid.

I’m very close to several neighbors, and two of them have approached me and want to be the vice president. This presents a dilemma. I like them both, and either one would do a fine job. I told them I have to stay neutral, and they understood.

However, I see one more often and am much closer to this neighbor than to the other. I don’t know what to say or how to act when it keeps getting brought up.

15,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,CIF 2-A state championship: Central Valley Christian beats Los Gatos,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/09/incredible-los-gatos-rally-comes-up-just-short-in-wild-2-a-championship-loss-to-central-valley-christian/,"PASADENA — Los Gatos had reached the California Interscholastic Federation 2-A title game by showing championship grit against a varied cast of opponents.

The Wildcats had survived Riordan’s air raid, St. Ignatius and Wilcox’s power, and El Cerrito’s athleticism to earn the right to face Central Valley Christian.

Los Gatos had played close games throughout both the regular season and that playoff run, and even authored a couple of memorable second-half comebacks along the way.

But against the brutal Central Valley Christian running attack and its precise passing game, there would be no comeback in the South Bay school’s first state title game.

Los Gatos sure did try though.

Central Valley Christian defeated Los Gatos 45-42 in a thriller Saturday at Pasadena City College.

“Obviously it stings and it hurts like hell, but what are you gonna do,” Los Gatos coach Mark Krail said. “Football is like life. You get up.”

Los Gatos trailed 24-7 at halftime after it committed two turnovers and turned it over on downs one time. Though the Wildcats offense kept it competitive into the fourth quarter, that was just too much of a hole to dig out of, even for the seniors who carried the program to the title game.

Jaylen Thomas caught a 63-yard touchdown and Boxer Kopcsak-Yeung rushed for a 27-yard touchdown. Quarterback A.J. Minyard even started the fourth quarter with a nifty 12-yard reverse-field touchdown run to cut the lead to 38-28 with 10 minutes left.

“The moment wasn’t too big for us, and there was no panic,” Jaylen Thomas said.

But it seemed like every time the Wildcats got close, CVC’s offense would go on a long drive that inevitably ended with a touchdown.

Even when Los Gatos got a rare stop and had a chance to get the ball back with seven minutes left and down 10 points, the Wildcats muffed the punt. Bryson Donelson, a Fresno State commit, made them pay with his third rushing touchdown of the night, a 10-yard run with four minutes to go.

Donelson rushed for 195 yards and three touchdowns on 32 carries.

When Max Thomas scored a 24-yard touchdown with three minutes to go to cut the lead back to 10, the Wildcats didn’t get a lucky bounce on the onside kick.

But when Los Gatos got the ball back a few minutes later at the three-yard line, Minyard led the team downfield and threw a 24-yard touchdown to Owen Panu to cut the lead to just three with a little over a minute left in the game.

“It was in all of our hearts, and we wanted it so bad,” said Minyard, who threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for a touchdown, in the fourth quarter alone,.

CVC, though, recovered the onside kick to end the game.

“I was like dude, if they get this, they’ve been driving, so we gotta get this,” Piepgrass said.

Aside from Jaylen Thomas rushing for a 36-yard touchdown on an inside reverse midway through the second quarter, nothing went right for the Wildcats in the first half.

Donelson entered the game with over 3,700 yards from scrimmage and 53 total touchdowns — and showed why when he shrugged off tacklers to set up CVC’s efficient passing attack.

After starting the game with a field goal, the CVC defense forced a stop on fourth down on its 11-yard line. Scott Garwood briefly slowed Central’s roll with an interception, but Los Gatos threw a pick on the very next play to negate it.

The Cavaliers finished the short four-play drive with a Donelson touchdown run. After Los Gatos coughed the ball up on a fumble at the 37-yard line, Donelson caught a 63-yard touchdown from quarterback Brent Kroeze.

The running back shrugged off the Wildcat defender on the sideline and sped into the endzone. Thomas answered with his touchdown run with five minutes remaining in the half, but the Los Gatos defense could not get a stop.

Kroeze threw back-breaking third-down completions to Gunnar Piepgrass and Ryan Lewis on the drive, his 34-yard looping dime to Lewis in the corner of the endzone one that gave the Visalia team a 24-7 lead going into halftime.

After the second half rally, coming so close to the program’s first state title, its star running back reflected upon what his team had just done.

“I don’t have any regrets with this football team, because I gave it everything I had, and I know everyone around me did too,” Kopcsak-Yeung said."
16,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"After a year in office, L.A. County sheriff talks deputy gangs, jail deaths, overdoses",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-10/after-a-year-in-office-l-a-county-sheriff-talks-deputy-gangs-jail-deaths-overdoses,"L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna attends a Hall of Justice news conference in 2022 to discuss the dangers of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and the launch an innovative public awareness campaign using a PSA film titled “Bad Meds.”

By the time Sheriff Robert Luna ousted his predecessor and became L.A. County’s top cop in late 2022, the nation’s largest sheriff’s department was awash in controversy.

The half-century-old problem of deputy gangs had brought the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department under increasing national scrutiny. Jail conditions were becoming increasingly dire, and the decades-old lawsuits about them seemed no closer to resolution. On top of that, the department was short on staff, mired in scandal and often at odds with county leaders.

A year later, many of those problems remain unresolved — and critics say the new sheriff has little to show for his time in office. The department has yet to ban deputy gang tattoos, and the courts have stymied efforts to identify the gangs’ alleged members. County data show roughly 20% of sworn positions are effectively vacant, jail death rates are soaring and, in June, the county only narrowly avoided a contempt hearing over conditions inside its lockups.

Still, the signs of change are unmistakable. After taking office, Luna quickly opened up more access to oversight officials. He created the Office of Constitutional Policing to help the county comply with four federal consent decrees, eradicate gangs and overhaul policies that could help reform the department.

So far this year, deputy-involved shootings are down , and the jail population is falling. Deputies are using force against inmates less frequently, and the department created a timer system to make sure jailers stopped chaining mentally ill people to benches for days. And this week, in an interview at the Hall of Justice, Luna told The Times he’s formulating a plan to close the county’s oldest lockup.

“Men’s Central Jail needs to be replaced,” he said. “We need something that resembles a care campus that can deal with what custody should look like toward the future.”

Exactly how that would work is still fuzzy, and the sheriff would only promise more details in the future, hinting at something perhaps loosely inspired by the gentler prison systems of European countries. Making that a reality will be an uphill battle — just like some of the other lofty goals Luna has in mind.

“For a sheriff’s department or a police department to be successful, we need to be properly led and properly partnered, staffed, equipped and trained,” he said. “I was handed a department that has been deficient. ... And we have a lot of work to do. A lot of work.”

Over a little more than an hour, Luna explained what some pieces of that work could entail. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

*****

One of the issues that was pretty central in your campaign was eradicating deputy gangs. A year later, there’s still not a strong anti-gang policy in place. Why is that?

Advertisement

During the campaign I talked about deputy gangs. I raised my hand and said, “We have a problem.” So I’m admitting there’s an issue. That’s why we started the Office of Constitutional Policing. But remember this: any time we’re dealing with employees’ hours, working conditions or things that impact people’s daily lives, we have to go through a meet-and-confer process. When we started to draft the policy — although the Civilian Oversight Commission gave us their version of it — we still had to go through it and make sure that it was something that could work.

So [Office of Constitutional Policing director] Eileen Decker not only had to go through the Civilian Oversight Commission and the Office of Inspector General, but also the federal monitors. Once that was done, there were unofficial conversations going on with the different labor organizations. And then, I want to say sometime in October-ish, we gave it to them in a formal manner. That’s when it becomes official.

This problem has existed for 50 years. I’ve been in office now for a year. I want to fix this. That is my goal. Yes, it is taking a little bit longer than I would like to see, but our labor organizations have been good partners at the table. We don’t agree on everything, but I think we’re going to get to a good place.

Do you think you’ll have a new anti-gang policy in place at some point in this next year, during your second year in office?

That is my absolute expectation.

There was a widely criticized incident in Palmdale, where a deputy punched a woman with an infant in her arms. Can you tell me anything about if you’re making changes to policies about when deputies can punch civilians?

It’s still being worked out. But from my perspective, if one of my deputies is getting his butt kicked and it’s a fisticuffs, you have a right to defend yourself. And if you have to use personal weapons — punching somebody in the face — to do that, then you have to defend yourself. I would not take that very valuable tool away from our employees.

But if you have a suspect who is not fighting you but only resisting, that’s where I draw the line and say that you don’t just start punching people. I get it, sometimes it’s very difficult to handcuff people. And historically that has been allowed here and that’s what is catching a lot of employees off guard. The miscommunication is [they think], “Oh, he just wants to take it away from us.” No, there’s a time and place for it. Because when you’re using force on an individual, it’s to gain control, not to punish. There’s a difference there.

Was the incident in Palmdale what prompted you to evaluate the policies about punching people?

It was one of many things. We’ve had several incidents over the last year where personal weapons were used to overcome resistance, not in a fight.

According to a recent letter sent from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Board of Supervisors , the Sheriff’s Department has been finding uses of force against jail inmates to be within policy more than 98% of the time. But the federal court-appointed monitors agree only about two-thirds of the time. How do you explain that discrepancy?

I was told about that ACLU report probably about three or four hours ago. We’re making inquiries about if there is actually a discrepancy. But there are definitely challenges. When we’re talking about use of force, the federal monitors have said they don’t like the fact that they believe that our front-line supervisors are not holding employees accountable. So we are currently looking at that.

But as I’m talking to all of our supervisors, I’m talking about accountability. We have to be courageous and identify challenges that we’re having because that negatively impacts public trust and credibility. And honestly, it’s hanging our employees out to dry. Because if you’re not taking corrective actions or showing people that this is wrong, then other employees won’t believe it’s wrong.

A lot of the employees that I talk to when I visit stations, they’re frustrated with me because there’s been instances where people have been disciplined and they believe that you’re holding us to this standard, but yet you’re not providing the required training to get us there. So I’m doing an evaluation on our training — but I don’t need an evaluation to tell me we’re deficient.

One of the other issues with the jails has been the high death toll. As of today, the jails are a couple deaths away from having the highest death rate in at least 15 years. Why do you think that is?

Every time I see a notification that somebody dies in our custody, it’s like, “What the heck?” You don’t want to see any. I don’t want anything to go wrong while they’re in our custody.

I think there is a perception that people who are dying in our custody are dying due to force incidents or murders. Now, once in a while you will get somebody who does get murdered in our facility. This last year we attributed nine deaths to overdoses. And there are nine other autopsies that are still pending, but a lot of these cases look like they’re from natural causes.

A lot of the people that we take into custody, they’re probably getting the best healthcare they may have ever received in their entire life while they’re with us, which means that rarely does somebody go see a doctor. Then when they get to us, you get people who are ill, fall ill and then they end up dying in our custody. So if I have nine overdoses, how do I reduce those?

Some facilities have tried to minimize opioid overdoses by expanding access to medication-assisted treatment that reduces the urge to get high. Historically, this is something that your department has not broadly used. Do you have any plans to expand that?

I want to dig a little deeper. If there is resistance, is it from our department? Is it from Correctional Health Services? Is there a reason? I’d like to know. We have already gotten more canines to do drug detection. We need better body scanners. We’re working through our CFO to try and figure out how we can do that. We believe that a lot of the drugs are coming in through mail.

I envision — and I’m already working on this — all of our custody facilities getting really good internet service so that I can get tablets in and eliminate mail. Can you imagine if I can give a family the ability to FaceTime, what that would do? There’s so many opportunities.

17,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Column: Is L.A. actually solving homelessness? The answer will start with perception, not reality",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-10/homeless-unhoused-encampment-interim-housing-karen-bass,"Mayor Karen Bass, accompanied by HUD official Richard J. Monocchio, left, and City Councilmembers Nithya Raman, far left, Hugo Soto-Martinez and Bob Blumenfield, speak to reporters in Hollywood on Wednesday. Previously, it was the site of a homeless encampment.

For as long as people have watched tents take over sidewalks and RVs deteriorate under freeways, politicians have been making promises about solving homelessness in Los Angeles.

And for just as long, those same politicians have been breaking them.

This is undoubtedly why, back in March, as Mayor Karen Bass was approaching her first 100 days in office, only 17% of Angelenos believed her administration would make “a lot of progress” getting people off the streets, according to a Suffolk University/Los Angeles Times poll. Far more — 45% — predicted just “a little progress” would be made.

I was thinking about this deep well of public skepticism while listening to Bass, all smiles in a bright green suit on Wednesday morning, enthusiastically explain why the progress she has actually made is a reason for renewed optimism.

Flanked by members of the L.A. City Council outside a school in Hollywood, she announced that her administration had, in its first year, moved more than 21,694 people out of encampments and into interim housing. That’s an increase of 28% over the final year of former Mayor Eric Garcetti’s administration, taking into account the work of various government programs, including Bass’ signature one, Inside Safe.

In addition, the majority of those directed to motel and hotel rooms, congregate shelters and tiny homes have decided to stay, rather than head back out onto the streets.

“We have tried to set a new tone in the city. This is an example of that new tone. Forty-one people used to sleep here, and now it’s clear,” Bass said Wednesday over the shrieks of schoolchildren. “Students and parents don’t need to walk around tents on their way to school, and the Angelenos who were living here do not need to die on our streets.”

It was a convincing message, backed up by a thick packet of numbers distributed to reporters at City Hall a few hours later.

But numbers are funny. They can be crunched in many ways and interpreted to mean many different things.

As my Times colleague David Zahniser pointed out, all of the people who now live in interim housing are still considered homeless by the federal government. And while Bass had originally thought most of them would be there for only three to six months, it’s now looking more like 18 months to two years. Permanent housing is that scarce.

So, numbers-wise, don’t expect a decline in the next annual homelessness count, which is scheduled for January. There might even be an increase, thanks to the expiration of pandemic-era tenant protections. As of the last count, there were more than 46,000 unhoused people living in the city, mostly in encampments.

But again, numbers are funny. They tend not to mean half as much as what people see and experience for themselves, just like the disconnect between public perceptions of crime and actual crime data.

So, when Bass declares at a news conference that “we have proved this year that we will make change,” and she talks about the encampment that used to be where she’s standing, and all the encampments that her administration has cleared, even if a few more tents have popped up down the street, skeptical Angelenos just might believe her.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s not such a bad thing.

“What I see most powerfully is increased hope,” Va Lecia Adams Kellum, chief executive of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, told reporters on Wednesday. “Hope among the folks who are living in those encampments who had given up and [thought] they’ll always live in that level of despair. Hope that the community now believes that we could possibly get out of this terrible crisis.”

Kellie Waldon, 54, cries near what’s left of her encampment, left, as Skid Row West is dismantled under the 405 Freeway along Venice Boulevard in Los Angeles in October. Waldon was hoping to receive housing through the city’s Inside Safe program, like others in the encampment had. “You get your hopes up and you don’t know what to believe,” Waldon said. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times)

Hope is a thing difficult to quantify, especially among people who have been homeless for years, and have suffered so much and have been let down so often by government.

I’ve talked to some who took a chance and decided to leave their tents and RVs, and are now thrilled to be in a motel room with a door, running water and air conditioning. Others have had it with curfews and jail-like rules, and are getting tired of waiting on promised permanent housing.

I’ve also talked to those who have been booted out of interim housing for one reason or another, and are back on the streets. They are feeling hopeless, like many cash-strapped Angelenos who are on the verge of an eviction.

But peak hopelessness? That’s what we saw on the first days of December.

At a hastily called news conference, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore announced that officers were searching for a man who had fatally shot three homeless people — one sleeping on a couch in an alley and another while pushing a shopping cart.

“This is a killer preying on the unhoused,” Bass said.

Moore and Bass didn’t know then, but their suspect, Jerrid Joseph Powell, had already been arrested by Beverly Hills police after a traffic stop in which his $60,000 BMW was linked to a deadly follow-home robbery.

Police have yet to elaborate on Powell’s alleged motive, but Bass brought up the horrific case several times on Wednesday — and with good reason. Violence and acts of cruelty against people living on the streets are increasingly common not just locally, but nationally.

In addition to shootings, there have been stabbings and beheadings. And let’s not forget about the gallery owner in San Francisco who was caught on video spraying a homeless woman with a hose.

California The twisted path of Jerrid Powell, from jock to accused L.A. serial killer More than a week after the arrest of Jerrid Joseph Powell in connection with the shooting deaths of three homeless men and an L.A. county employee, much remains wrapped in mystery, including a motive in the slayings.

Advocates blame this trend of nastiness on the pandemic-era surge in homelessness, particularly in unsheltered homelessness, and the subsequent spike in interactions between housed and unhoused residents. Fear and frustration can lead to dehumanization and that, in turn, can lead to violence, said Dr. Margot Kushel, director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative.

“I do really worry that it’s become normalized in public discourse to speak about people experiencing homelessness as, like, a problem for those who are not homeless — as opposed to fundamentally a massive societal failure that’s left usually older, vulnerable people terrified and totally unprotected,” she told me. “And I do think that there is a connection, like the more we dehumanize people, the less protected they are.”

Stephanie Klasky-Gamer has watched this happen in real-time as president and CEO of L.A. Family Housing. The seeming permanency of encampments, and the trash, fires and unsanitary conditions they often generate, have led to what she describes as widespread impatience.

“I don’t mean big, systemic impatience, like ‘I wish we could end homelessness faster,’” she said. “It’s the ‘I’m just sick of seeing you in front of me’ kind of impatience.”

On some level, she gets it, though. As does Kushel. As do I.

“It has to be OK to say, ‘Yeah, this sucks that I’m walking my kids to school and I’m walking over people in tents,’” Kushel told me. “But there has to be a way to hold that with being able to recognize how we got to this position and also how we’re going to get out. And to sort of restore [our] collective humanity.”

For Klasky-Gamer, this has meant focusing on what has changed since Bass became mayor.

“I know how much good is getting done,” she told me. “The frustration I may feel at seeing the tent every day I turn the corner, at least I can temper it knowing that 10 people yesterday moved into an apartment. These three people haven’t. But these 10 did.”

The mayor has told me many times that getting people off the streets isn’t just a humanitarian imperative — and, as a serial killer reminded us, a safety imperative. It’s also a demonstration to a fed up public that progress is possible.

“What distresses Angelenos the most are encampments. That’s where people were dying on the street,” Bass told reporters. “And to me, what was clear, was that we come up with a way to get people out of the tents.”

Some will dismiss that. They’ll insist that all her administration is doing is reducing visible homelessness to score easy political points. And that instead of doing the hard work of actually helping L.A.’s most vulnerable residents get back on their feet, the mayor is hiding them so that they’ll be forgotten and abandoned in interim housing.

In this city, defined by its haves and have nots, I understand the cynicism and skepticism. But that’s why what Bass does next, namely expanding and stabilizing the city’s crumbling supply of permanent housing, will matter even more than what she has done thus far.

“We’ve got to somehow make people believe again that this is solvable,” Kushel told me, “and it is solvable.”

Hope can be elusive. But Annelisa Stephan was looking for it anyway when she came to the Ballona Wetlands on a recent Saturday morning.

She and more than 100 other volunteers — many of them from the nearby neighborhoods of Playa Vista and Playa del Rey — had descended on the Westside ecological reserve to dig holes, spread soil, and put in plants and trees.

Just a few months ago, RVs had been parked here along Jefferson Boulevard, bumper to bumper in a sprawling encampment that dozens of unhoused people had come to call home.

They built a close-knit community, looking out for one another and mourning one another after deadly fires. But they also decimated the Ballona Wetlands’ freshwater marsh with everything from battery acid to trash to human waste, and scared off nearby residents who once walked the trails.

And then one day, after almost three years, the encampment was gone, replaced by concrete barricades and metal fencing. The residents were mostly sent to interim housing and the RVs were mostly towed away.

“It’s like, hard to know what to think or feel,” Stephan told me. “I’m happy that the land is being stewarded, but just sad about the suffering that so many people face.”

She lamented the “fervent, anti-homeless mania” that she has heard from some of her neighbors.

“It’s just been really a painful time,” Stephan said.

Not far away, L.A. City Councilmember Traci Park, whose Westside district includes the Ballona Wetlands and got elected on promises to aggressively crack down on homeless encampments, was more circumspect.

“At the end of the day, everybody wants the same thing, which is to get folks off the streets and into safe settings and connected to the help that they need,” she said. “There’s a lot of different points of view about how we get there. And I think that’s where a lot of the conflict and the division lie.”

She paused, as traffic whizzed by on Jefferson Boulevard.

“But,” Park said, “we have great leadership.”"
18,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Southern California’s wildlife rehabilitators say they are in a fight for survival,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-12-10/socal-wildlife-rehabilitators-are-fighting-for-survival,"The unceremonious end of Robert Everett’s decades-long career as a pioneering wildlife rehabilitator came without warning recently as state investigators appeared suddenly at his San Dimas home.

After answering a sharp rap on the door early one morning in late October, the 80-year-old said he stood on his porch as California Department of Fish and Wildlife officers “came in, narco-style,” and began evaluating his injured, diseased and orphaned avian patients to determine which ones should be released, transferred elsewhere or euthanized.

Everett, who had just been discharged from the hospital and was learning to self-administer antibiotics intravenously in both arms, said he looked on with “shock and awe” as a peregrine falcon, red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, barn owl and saw-whet owl that he used as “educational animals” in school presentations and to attract donors were taken away.

Robert Everett, 80, said he is no longer rehabilitating injured birds after state officials shut down his shoestring operation. (Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times)

“They shut me down,” he said.

The enforcement action at Wild Wings of California — which Everett and his supporters described as a raid — has sent shock waves through Southern California’s close-knit community of wildlife rehabilitators. For decades, Everett and other rehab operators have stretched shoestring budgets and rallied ragtag groups of volunteers to care for the region’s injured and abused wildlife, including bald eagles, barn owls, geese, pelicans, foxes, bobcats, raccoons, squirrels, sea lions, tortoises, lizards and snakes.

But as California officials conduct a review of regulations concerning the possession of wild animals, Everett and other members of the rehabilitation community say the state is cracking down on small, independent facilities — many of which were created in the 1970s and ’80s to deal with the growing problem of animals that are wounded due to human encroachment. They say the enforcement actions are causing aging rehabilitators to throw in the towel, and will leave countless injured wild animals without help.

“There’s a perception that the department is cleaning house, ” said Ann Reams, founder of Wildlife Care of Southern California, in Sylmar.

Reams claims authorities have conducted multiple inspections that have left well-respected rehabbers “intimidated and traumatized,” and she has authored a petition to curtail the enforcement actions.

Wildlife are being confiscated and euthanized, while rehabilitators are being forced to abandon their work, she says. Rehabbers, she insists, are being treated like criminals and have not been given any time to address the alleged violations or the opportunity to explain their circumstances.

“Whatever happened to a slap on the wrist?” she said.

State wildlife officials deny that they are singling out rehab operations for punishment.

Jordan Traverso, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said, “There is no crackdown. But there is possibly a feeling of one based on the fact that there is still some catching up to do — our staff was unable to conduct routine inspections during the COVID pandemic. So, there is a backlog and we are addressing it.”

Everett started Wild Wings with his late wife Judy in 1978 after a neighbor had inadvertently tossed a nest containing three baby mockingbirds into a barrel along with a load of lawn trimmings.

For the couple, it was the beginning of a career of working together in their home as part of a sprawling network of veterinarians, volunteers, and licensed individuals who stay in steady contact with one another, often swapping accommodations, medicine and know-how to provide care and shelter for suffering animals until they can be returned to the wild.

The effort cost the couple about $50,000 a year to buy rodents from pet stores, laboratory animal dealers and feed stores to nourish their birds of prey. The Everetts struggled to meet expenses by securing donations from local supermarket chains and Southern California Edison, and by contracting with schools to give conservation lectures, during which they displayed permanently disabled birds.

They also won permission to build enclosures at the nearby San Dimas Canyon Nature Center for some of their injured owls, eagles and falcons. (The nature center will now care for birds that have been confiscated from Wild Wings. Everett will be allowed to work at the nature center as a docent, according to Noemi Navar, a Los Angeles County Fish and Game warden.)

Everett came to the attention of state wildlife authorities after his wife’s death earlier this year. They say he expressed an interest in transferring some of the birds in his care to Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation facilities.

“The county could not take those birds without permission from us,” said Heather Perry, wildlife rehabilitation coordinator for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

A review of the records on file, however, revealed that Wild Wings’ permit was issued in Judy Everett’s name. “That permit became null and void when she passed away,” Perry said.

Perry said she then asked law enforcement to go to Wild Wings and take an accounting of the birds. Officials said they tried to be as understanding as possible.

“We appreciate all the years of service he has provided as a rehabilitator,” said Vicky Monroe, conflict programs coordinator for the wildlife department.

The episode has had a chilling effect on the operations of other rehabilitation outfits, supporters say.

Reams, who specializes in treating native mammals with the exception of bears, deer and mountain lions, said she is not among those under investigation. But in a related matter, Duarte and Glendora have warned her to stop treating coyotes in the field for mange by feeding them raw meat and dead rats spiked with a medication, according to documents filed by city attorneys in both cities.

“I’m not doing that anymore,” Reams said.

Earlier this year, Linda York shut down her 37-year-old Coachella Valley Wild Bird Center, in Indio due to health problems. Ann Lynch, 81, founder of Southbay Wildlife Rehab in Rancho Palos Verdes, said she is challenging a criminal charge lodged against her operation by wildlife authorities.

Camella Wells, a spokeswoman for the 20-year-old California Council for Wildlife Rehabilitation, which is dedicated to advancing rehabilitation and supporting wildlife, declined to comment. Enforcement or investigation of permittees, she said, “is outside the scope of our mission.”

The controversy comes at a time when state wildlife authorities have begun the process of revising Section 679 of the California Code of Regulations, which allows for the possession of native animals for rehabilitation purposes. Final approval by the California Fish and Game Commission is expected sometime in 2025.

“In general, I think these changes to the regulations are going to bring us into a new era of professionalism,” said Rebecca Dmytryk, director of the nonprofit Wildlife Emergency Services, based in Monterey. “The process may be painful, but in the end, I think it will be a benefit to our profession and those we serve — California’s wildlife.”

Dmytryk said that there have been many “outrageous violations over the decades,” instances where licensed rehabilitators have done a disservice to their patients by keeping them alive and prolonging their suffering, when “the animals should have been put out of their misery.”

Some volunteer rehabilitators have come under investigation for illegally taking injured raccoons home to play with them as pets, and for dressing great horned owls up in Halloween costumes, authorities said.

The big question now is whether there will be enough wildlife rehabilitation centers left to “handle the overflow of native animals in need,” said Michael Chill, of Pasadena, who has spent decades working on the front lines of wildlife rehabilitation in the Los Angeles area.

Large, well-financed facilities such as the California Wildlife Center in Calabasas and International Bird Rescue in San Pedro are expected to remain in operation. But whether there will be people with the resources and training needed to safely transport “injured and sick animals to those centers remains uncertain,” Chill said.

Human activities and extreme weather events triggered by climate change are responsible for the deaths and injuries of billions of animals each year, according to a recent analysis of 674,320 digitized records from 94 wildlife rehab centers across the United States and Canada.

The findings, published in the journal Biological Conservation, identified major threats to over 1,000 species including iconic and threatened bald eagles, brown pelicans, big brown bats and common loons.

Window, building and vehicle collisions, as well as lead and pesticide exposure due to hunting with lead ammunition and rodenticide use, were listed as among the top threats.

“Across all species,” it says, “wildlife rehabilitators were able to return about a third of treated animals back to the wild.”

Meanwhile, the total number of wildlife rehabilitation facilities across Southern California has been falling since 2019. That’s when the long-struggling and high-profile Wildlife Waystation in the Angeles National Forest shut down after 43 years and began collaborating with state officials to relocate 470 mostly exotic animals.

“It took us years to rehouse those animals,” Traverso said. “We don’t want something like that to happen again.”

But behind the fences of dozens of local wildlife rehabilitation centers that live and die on the donations of others, “everyone is on pins and needles, waiting for a warden to knock on their door at dawn,” said Jim Vrieling, 87, who, along with his wife, Trudy, has successfully treated and released hundreds of raccoons at their Second Chance Critters facility in Los Angeles.

“It’s time to retire,” Vrieling said.

19,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,He turned his prison chess hobby into a wild street hustle. But can he beat the elites?,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2023-12-10/street-chess-in-south-los-angeles-vincent-hubbard,"Almost every day for the last two years, Vincent “VDogg” Hubbard has stood outside the Louisiana Fried Chicken at Manchester and Normandie avenues with a suitcase full of cocoa butter and a traveling chess set.

Slight in stature, with a gap-tooth smile and a blunt tucked into his beanie, the 44-year-old is South L.A.’s preeminent purveyor of everything from African black soap to charcoal toothpaste to bundles of sage. But if you’re a chess enthusiast, you’re more likely to stop by for an over-the-board “a— whooping,” where he’ll snap up your pieces with a side of smack talk before “leaving ’em with two pieces to go.”

“Just without the chicken,” he chuckled, while scanning the dinner rush for potential customers or competitors. “And I usually have ’em before their order’s up.”

As part of the tight-knit street chess community below the I-10, Hubbard is one of many formerly incarcerated gang members who used to play in prison to barter for contraband items or commissary goods. While others may drop the game upon release, chess continues to play a huge part in his life as a viable source of income in a job market that turns its back on people who’ve done time.

Hubbard usually measures his wins in $20 bills, earned from speed games against a curious onlooker or a cocky passerby. Unlike the regulars, they don’t know his losses are in the single digits, only that he looks like “a real thug from the ’hood” until he begins to attack, quickly picking off pieces and relentlessly checking his opponent.

“I’m on your head like hair,” Hubbard said, recalling a recent game against a flustered opponent.

“I’m coming out with missiles and whatever. I’m coming out strong,” Hubbard said, playfully boxing the air. And with his unfettered confidence, natural talent and unconventional play style, Hubbard wants to make it known that “nobody could f— with me.” In his mind, not even five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen.

After all, he’s already squared off against titled players and is a two-time champion of South L.A.’s Make a Move , but there’s a big difference between winning an amateur tournament like that one and being recognized as a professional player in the highly competitive chess world.

Hubbard is already a pro in the eyes of the United States Chess Federation, but if his ultimate goal is to be one of the very few to make chess a full-time job, he’ll need to receive a certified rating. Culled from the results of several tournaments, his rating will determine how much he can charge for lessons and whether he’ll be able to compete in certain competitions, where the prize money can be in the millions.

Hubbard — a self-taught player — started that path in October by competing in his first rated tournament against established professionals from the Santa Monica Bay Chess Club. It’s a small classical tournament, where one game can last upwards of six excruciating hours. The competition is fierce, mostly motivated by ego and ratings rather than the $200 prize. That’s less than a weekly grandmaster lesson or the entry fee for the upcoming North American Chess Open. For Hubbard, though, that money could be food or more merchandise to sell. It could be rent for the house he shares with several other people waiting for Section 8 vouchers. It could even be the bus fare for the two-hour ride from South L.A. or the $25 entry fee for the club’s next tournament, which he needs for experience if he wants to keep moving up in the chess world.

Chess offered escapism in prison

Born and raised in the Jordan Downs housing project in Watts, Hubbard spent his childhood bouncing between foster care, older relatives and juvenile hall. Initiated into the Grape Street Crips the first day of junior high, he spent his young-adult years in and out of L.A. County Jail, where he realized chess was not only “a good way to pass the time” but a way to obtain some of his favorite snacks, whether they be noodles or Little Debbie’s oatmeal pies.

However, things took a turn when he was arrested in Oklahoma on drug-trafficking charges in 2000, just three days shy of his 21st birthday. Sentenced to 10 years in the state penitentiary, Hubbard perfected his game over the next decade, studying Aron Nimzowitsch’s “My System” and playing correspondence chess with other inmates.

“In maximum security, we’d draw a board and then shape tissue with water into the pieces.” — Vincent Hubbard

“In maximum security, we’d draw a board and then shape tissue with water into the pieces,” he said, explaining that he’d send messages containing his moves via old chewing tobacco cans, thrown “24 cells down from the dude I’m trying to play.” And with not much else to do, Hubbard used chess as his “PlayStation,” a mental escape from prison life where he could focus on a singular goal — checkmating his opponent — by finding innovative ways to adapt to unexpected situations or setbacks.

“Chess is an outlet, and it’s a way for me to use my brain,” he said, adding that he eventually became known as the Oklahoma State Penitentiary’s “Evil Emperor.” With his ability to conquer the chessboard, Hubbard would immerse himself in the game, spending countless hours in his cell, treating his makeshift pieces like “those little feudal societies where the king’s gonna take over other kingdoms.”

He snickered, “I’m out there in the South, and I’m like, ‘Come through. Who thou plays me thou peasants?’”

In addition to playing $20 street chess, Vincent Hubbard also sells goods like cocoa butter, which he carries along with his chess set. (Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times)

Between these little quips and his winning streak, Hubbard is a beloved and well-respected figure within the street chess community, said Make a Move tournament founder Jerimiah Payne.

“Everyone loves V’s charisma, and it’s really good to see somebody like that in these kinds of spaces,” said the West Adams-raised player, who began the roving event as a more “comfortable” alternative to other L.A. chess events, which can feel unwelcoming to outsiders.

“[It’s for people] from the neighborhood that would probably never compete at one of those other chess tournaments, like the … rated ones,” he said. Because, contrary to stereotypes, Payne explained that chess is a “great unifier,” before adding that Make a Move was partially inspired by seeing Bloods and Crips play together when he went to jail for burglary.

At its core, Make a Move is a love letter to the street chess community, cultivating an environment that mirrors the players’ welcoming attitudes and willingness to help one another grow. Yet despite its increasing popularity within the L.A. chess scene, Hubbard said the warmth has rarely been reciprocated when he walks into an “established” chess event. Rather, he feels a palpable chill in the air. “People be clutching their purses or their wallets when they go by. You see their body language, freezing up,” he said. To him, the message is clear: You shouldn’t be here.

Breaking in as ‘the black sheep’

“When you think chess, you think of class and prestige ... respect and nobility,” Hubbard said, alluding to how he’s constantly underestimated by more affluent players.

The microaggressions happen irrespective of setting. At casual meetups in bars and cafes, they’ll inch closer together, avoiding direct eye contact in favor of pointed whispers and sideways glances. At the tournament, the room goes silent and everyone stares when they think he’s not looking, especially the helicopter moms waiting for their chess prodigies. Everyone seems both curious and afraid of what could be inside his suitcase.

“[I’m] the black sheep,” Hubbard shrugged. “But I’m used to being the bad guy in the movie anyway.”

It’s “TenTrey Day” — the biggest holiday for Grape Street Crips — and Hubbard is completely “graped out” to represent his roots at the Santa Monica Bay Chess Club tournament. Dressed in head-to-toe purple, he’s easy to spot inside the beige meeting room of a small Sawtelle church, with his bright bandanna and matching camo pants and T-shirt. This time, everyone seems too scared to look at him, even when his back is turned.

For this game, it’s his turn to play black pieces, which move second and, theoretically speaking, lose more often than white. The obvious symbolism doesn’t escape Hubbard while he’s outside taking a mid-game smoke, watching his opponent ponder their next move. Coincidentally, his competition is also in a purple shirt, which Hubbard finds almost as funny as the old man who tosses a barely smoked cigarette into the gutter to avoid him.

He makes a teasing comment about the other man’s eagerness to run back inside. It’s like the way he used to speed-walk to the other side of Watts, just to learn basic chess moves on a church computer. The only difference, he laughed, is that he was getting chased through rival gang territory.

“I had to figure out all the other s— for myself, honestly,” Hubbard said. He sounds tired, his voice missing its usual bravado as he admits to having a rough start to the tournament. He’s won one game and drawn another and, after a particularly disheartening defeat, he even skipped a round to save the last of his cash, opting to play on the street instead, “because why show up if I’m gonna lose anyway?”

“A lot of these dudes, all they do is study lines. They read books. Some of them got photographic memories,” Hubbard said while nodding toward the tournament hall.

“Whereas on the street, or in the ’hood, or whatever, the average player just plays,” he explained. “They don’t understand the intricacies or the fundamentals of chess,” Hubbard sighed. “Chess is so simple but complicated. It’s easier said than done.”

Evolving from a pawn

However, fellow street player and Hubbard’s longtime family friend, William “Chill” Somerville, used a more apt allegory to describe their intertwined chess journeys, explaining that everyone forgets a pawn’s innate potential — the power it has once it crosses the board.

“If you make the right moves in the right steps, it can become a rook, it can become a queen, it can become a bishop,” he said. “And life is like that.

“So if you make the right moves and steps, then you can be bigger than a pawn. Even if they looking at you as one.” — William Somerville

“So if you make the right moves and steps, then you can be bigger than a pawn. Even if they looking at you as one,” he continued, before explaining that this is why the two decided to create Prolific Chess, a new organization that aims to make the game accessible to everyone from schoolkids to people living on Skid Row.

With a gentle demeanor and a sprinkle of gray in his beard, Somerville similarly fell in love with chess in L.A. County Jail. While he was being held on two charges of attempted murder prior to his acquittal, chess became a way to “relax,” to create and think outside of the box, which ultimately helped him realize, “You’re bigger than what you’re looking at.

“You’re bigger than what the people say you are,” he said, almost like a mantra. “You’ll become what you want.”

Since then, he’s become a Watts community ambassador and mental health advocate who wants to help people gain confidence from chess. So after years of playing against Hubbard in a shipping container on the empty lot next to his house, Somerville refurbished a party bus with a stripper pole and alligator skin upholstery into a suave mobile chess center. He brings chess tournaments, workshops and seminars to every corner of South L.A. through Prolific Chess.

For both men, chess was a lifeline during hard times that turned into a lifelong passion. And now, Hubbard hopes to break further into the professional chess community so that he can build a career that extends beyond the streets. He has a provisional rating with the U.S. Chess Federation that puts him in the 80th percentile of members, but he must keep competing for that rating to become official.

“I represent a lot of [the] misfortunate, or underprivileged, or have-nots,” he said. “Regular people out here that might not have opportunities.

“So when I’m playing chess, I’m representing everybody in my neighborhood. Everybody in my city … Wattsangeles.”

Hubbard smiles down at his phone, looking up which bus will take him back to South L.A. “Because how many people there get to say that they play chess, and that they’re now a professional?”"
20,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Three injured after truck slams into spectators at Bakersfield Christmas parade,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-09/bakersfield-christmas-parade-spectators-injured,"A Ford F-150 hit and injured three people Thursday night before the Bakersfield Christmas Parade, authorities said. The accident happened at 21st and H streets about 15 minutes before the parade was set to begin.

A suspected drunk driver last week slammed into spectators waiting to watch a Christmas parade in downtown Bakersfield, injuring three people, police said.

On Thursday evening, about half an hour before the start of the annual Bakersfield Christmas Parade, a man in a white pickup truck drove backward through an alleyway near the parade route at a high rate of speed, coming to a stop next to a city fire station on 21st Street, the Bakersfield Police Department said in a statement.

The Ford F-150 hit three male parade spectators, ages 21, 42 and 77. Authorities have not released their names.

Bakersfield firefighters who were nearby “immediately rendered medical aid” to the men, who were taken to a local hospital and were in stable condition, authorities said.

The driver, Alan Booth, 72, of Bakersfield, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, police said.

Officer Francisco Esguerra, a Bakersfield police watch commander, told the Times on Saturday night that Booth was at a hospital being treated for injuries related to the crash and had not yet been booked into jail.

Booth could not be reached for comment.

Police officers who were preparing for the parade nearby heard the truck accelerate before the collision, authorities said.

The collision also damaged a food truck, Poppi’s Pastrami & More.

“He pushed my whole truck. He pushed it like 8 [feet],” Misti Cole, the food truck owner, told KBAK Fox58.

Photos on the Poppi’s Pastrami & More Facebook page show the Dodge Ram pickup truck that was hauling the food trailer with a smashed front end.

Cole told the news station that her children were in the food trailer at the time of the crash and that other children had been sitting in chairs nearby to watch the parade.

“Trucks can be replaced. Those people who got hit, they can’t be replaced,” Cole told KBAK.

Poppi’s Pastrami, she said, is her family’s main source of income.

The parade was rerouted and briefly delayed."

With flu season in full swing, Riverside County public health officials are urging residents to get their vaccines and to take other precautions against respiratory viruses after reporting the county’s first two flu-related deaths this winter.

The deaths include a 73-year-old man and a 79-year-old woman from mid- and western Riverside County, respectively. Both had underlying health issues and died at local hospitals, according to county officials. No further information was immediately provided.

Last month, Los Angeles County confirmed its first flu death of the season. The deceased was an elderly resident with multiple underlying conditions and had no record of influenza vaccination this season, according to county health officials.

According to Riverside County’s weekly influenza surveillance report, current influenza-like illnesses activity levels are moderate in the area. The county typically logs people aged 65 and older as the bulk of pneumonia and influenza deaths in the county with few occurring among those 24 and younger. Data collected between Nov. 19-25 show pneumonia contributed to the bulk of deaths, which were largely affected by other diseases such as COVID-19.

“These tragedies remind us that influenza can be serious, especially for those who have health issues or weakened immune systems,” Dr. Geoffrey Leung, public health officer for Riverside County, said in a statement. “There are simple steps that can be taken to protect ourselves. Most important of these is to get vaccinated. We recommend that everyone over 6 months of age receive the flu vaccine.”

Respiratory viruses such as the flu and COVID-19 spread year-round but are more common in the United States between October and March. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing. Anyone is prone to catch the virus but elderly people, children and those with weakened immune systems are more at risk.

Health officials urge people to stay up-to-date on vaccines, remain at home if sick, consider wearing a face mask, cover a cough or sneeze and wash hands throughout the day."

The family of a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy has filed a claim against the Sheriff’s Department, alleging that excessive overtime hours he was forced to work in the county jails drove him to suicide.

Deputy Arturo Atilano Valadez was one of four current and former Sheriff’s Department employees to die by suicide in a 24-hour span early last month. Atilano, who was about to turn 50, was assigned to the North County Correctional Facility at the time of his death.

“When it comes to him, he was working so much overtime, his wife said that he was like a zombie,” said Bradley Gage, an attorney representing Atilano’s widow and two daughters in the claim, which is a precursor to a lawsuit.

Gage said that sometimes, Atilano and other deputies were so exhausted that they took turns sleeping in jail cells. According to the claim, Atilano’s family is seeking $20 million in damages.

A statement provided by the Sheriff’s Department on Saturday did not address the allegations.

“A loss of a department family member is extremely tragic and our continued thoughts are with the family during this difficult time,” the statement said. “The department has not received the official claim, but is deeply committed to ensuring the well-being and safety of all its employees.”

At a news conference last week recounting his first year in office, Sheriff Robert Luna said his agency is in the midst of a “staffing crisis” that has left it short about 1,200 sworn deputies.

“The people who are working here are taking up that slack — they are working their tails off,” he told reporters. “I recognize that, we recognize that, and we have been working very hard behind the scenes to figure out a way to reduce overtime, because that’s how we’re filling in the gaps.”

The Sheriff’s Department on Saturday could not immediately provide information about the number of vacancies of sworn personnel at the jail where Atilano was assigned and overtime requirements for deputies there.

A request by The Times for Atilano’s work history, including his time sheets, overtime hours and assignments, is also pending.

Deputies sometimes volunteer for overtime shifts for extra money. Gage said that in Atilano’s case, those shifts were mandatory.

“It’s illusory to say it’s voluntary,” Gage told The Times. “They’re required to work eight overtime shifts in a month ... So if they don’t volunteer, then they get drafted.”

Gage said that Atilano joined the department more than 21 years ago and spent the last dozen working in the jails. Gage said Atilano asked to leave the custody assignment, but his transfer requests were repeatedly denied. He added that forced overtime is a problem department wide, beyond custody facilities.

Gage is also representing the parents of a deputy who was shot in the head while driving his patrol car in September. The family of Deputy Ryan Clinkunbroomer alleges that he was forced to work so much overtime that he struggled to stay alert.

“They’re so exhausted, working so much overtime, that they can’t function,” Gage said."
25,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Before UNLV shooting, former students say gunman fixated on Las Vegas",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-12-09/unlv-gunman-obsessed-with-las-vegas,"A police officer talks with students near the Student Union a day after three people died and one person was injured in a mass shooting at the UNLV campus.

Even before their former business professor carried out a mass shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, old students of Anthony Polito say his classes were not something they would forget.

There were the regular reminders to his students at East Carolina University to leave him flattering reviews on ratemyprofessors.com — and the disparaging of past “disgruntled” students who had left less-than-glowing ones. He was one of the few professors they knew who taught in a suit and cufflinks and the only one who smoked an e-cigarette — once wordlessly blowing the vapor on a bewildered student up front.

And what now feels like the most significant memory from those days: a deep love of — some say obsession with — Las Vegas.

Students at the Greenville, N.C., university say when Polito, 67, would boot up his computer screen, there was always a Las Vegas-themed backdrop. He would tell them about his upcoming bookings at The Wynn, a luxury hotel, and the steak from room service he planned to order upon arrival. Some say they would have entire classes dedicated exclusively to his weekend excursions.

“All the lectures just became based around Las Vegas,” said Paul Whittington, who took Polito’s class on supply chain management in 2014. “That’s what the class periods were. It was slideshows of ‘These are places that I’d stayed. These are things that I’ve done. These are clubs that I’ve been to.’”

But Polito would struggle transitioning from eager tourist to permanent Sin City resident. After moving to Vegas from North Carolina, law enforcement said Polito had difficulty finding a job and was at risk of losing his home in the city’s suburbs.

On Wednesday, with an eviction notice pinned to his front door, Polito walked onto the campus of UNLV — one of several Nevada schools that law enforcement say had rejected him for a job — with a 9mm handgun. In the span of a few minutes, he fatally shot three faculty members in the business school, identified as Cha-Jan “Jerry” Chang, 64, Patricia Navarro-Velez, 39, and Naoko Takemaru, 69. A visiting professor was critically injured. Law enforcement said Polito had maintained a list of targets of both UNLV and East Carolina University staff.

Greg Gibson, a neighbor of the UNLV gunman, said Anthony Polito stuck out at the “crummy” apartment complex in the suburbs of Las Vegas. Gibson saw Polito the morning of the shooting, pacing and smoking a cigarette in the parking lot. “He seemed agitated. That’s why I noticed him,” Gibson said. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)

Days after the shooting, law enforcement are still unpacking how a former professor so infatuated with Las Vegas that he made it part of his lectures had become the latest gunman to target its residents in a mass shooting.

Former students of Polito say they were shocked when national outlets began broadcasting the picture of their professor, with his gelled-back hair and signature crisp white shirt, above a banner announcing multiple gunshot deaths at a college campus.

“I recognized his face immediately. My mouth just dropped, and my heart just sank,” said Erick Smithwick, who took one of Polito’s courses around 2006 and remembered him as one of his more passionate and approachable professors. “I still don’t believe it.”

But one fact in the reports that surprised no one he’d taught: Sometime after they had finished school, Polito had left too and moved to the city he couldn’t get enough of.

“If you spend every day of your career just talking about it, why wouldn’t you move out there?” said Whittington, 33.

According to his LinkedIn page, Polito left East Carolina University around 2017 after more than a decade-and-a half with the school. On his personal website, he described himself as a “semi-retired” professor who had made two dozen trips to Las Vegas and had “collected more information and trivia about Vegas than probably anyone in this state east of I-95” thanks to his “steel trap mind.”

“I don’t gamble that much, but there is plenty to do there, that’s for sure !!” he wrote.

Upon arriving in the city, Polito landed at an apartment complex in Henderson, a far cry from the Strip he loved where neighbors said he seemed isolated and aloof.

“He was a little out of place for these crummy apartments,” said Greg Gibson, a neighbor who saw Polito the morning of the shooting, smoking and pacing in the parking lot.

While former students say Polito was known to “talk your ear off,” his neighbors found him decidedly uninterested in small talk. Most just knew him as the hermit-like guy with a briefcase and a vanity plate that read “KAPEESH,” a quirk that led some to refer to him as “mafia dude.”

On a list posted on his website titled ‘My Twenty-One Cars !!,’ Polito wrote that he wanted a plate that emphasized “persistence/determination.”

“I considered SENSEI, the Japanese term for teacher… but it was already taken,” he wrote on the list detailing every car he’d ever owned. “‘Kapeesh’ seemed to go with a big black car driven by a New York Italian.”

At the end of another week of fruitless job searching, Polito would often end up at the Village Pub, a 24-hour bar a few blocks from his house. Staff say he’d spend Friday nights alone nursing a beer or an iced tea and lamenting the difficult time he was having getting hired.

Sometimes, he was still there when Gina Stapley, the bar manger, showed up for her 7 a.m. shift. She said Polito would tell her his resume was not getting the warm reception he hoped for — despite him being “highly scholared.”

“I’m like, what’s taking so long?” she said. “I thought he was bull—. I didn’t really think he was a college professor.”

Village Pub Manager Gina Stapley, 45, said Polito used to come into her bar every Friday night up until about a year ago and would often unload about the difficulty he was having finding a job in Las Vegas. “He was just a very strange individual,” she said. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times)

Las Vegas Metropolitan Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters Thursday that Polito had applied “numerous times” for a job with Nevada schools and been rejected from each one.

Former students said they thought that repeated dead ends may have been especially bitter for Polito, who always seemed to have so much of his identity tied up with the city.

“I mean he loved Vegas,” said Robert Martin, a 38-year-old accountant who took Polito’s marketing class in 2011 and remembers him talking fondly about his stays at the Wynn. “Maybe he felt like this is where I belong. I love this town. Now I get to teach here then somebody took it away from me — that kind of thing.”"
26,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,L.A. County supervisors used to hold a ‘regular’ meeting every week. What happened?,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2023-12-09/la-on-the-record-newsletter-l-a-on-the-record,"Board of Supervisors Chair Lindsey Horvath, shown in June, has implemented a new meeting schedule that critics say does not fully meet the needs of the public.

Good morning, and welcome to our L.A. on the Record newsletter. It’s county reporter Jaclyn Cosgrove, writing about public access, assisted by county reporter Rebecca Ellis and City Hall colleagues David Zahniser, Dakota Smith, Dorany Pineda and Julia Wick (who, as we told you last week, has moved on to a state and national politics beat).

At this week’s L.A. County Board of Supervisors meeting, there was a seemingly innocuous motion on the agenda, easy to overlook as just a planning note for 2024.

In the motion, new board Chair Lindsey Horvath proposed canceling 13 meetings and thus sticking with the board’s most recent schedule of holding what the board calls “regular” meetings every other week.

Big whoop, right?

Wrong.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the board held weekly regular meetings with full agendas. But since the start of the pandemic, the most powerful local governmental body in America has switched its regular meetings to every other week.

By comparison, the 15-member L.A. City Council — which has a fraction of the budget of the county — holds public meetings three times a week.

The supervisors’ every-other-week schedule has led to longer meetings with packed agendas. Members of the public regularly leave before they can voice their opinions on their item of interest. Critics see this as overall less transparency for the already slow-turning wheels of government.

Before we delve further, it’s important to pause and explain how the supervisors operate.

The board generally holds three types of meetings:



Regular meetings, open to the public, with an agenda full of motions on a wide range of issues.

Public hearing meetings, where the public weighs in and the board votes on ordinances, housing projects and other matters that legally require public hearings; there are usually no motions on these agendas.

Closed sessions, where the supervisors discuss sensitive legal and personnel matters.

Horvath — who at 41 is the youngest board chair and first millennial at the helm — said in an interview that under her leadership the board will have weekly public meetings.

Horvath said the board will have its two regular meetings, and one public hearing meeting with a closed session if needed.

Now Horvath has implemented a new idea, a fourth meeting where the board and public will hear from L.A. County department heads on policy updates, followed by a closed session if needed.

Previously, this fourth meeting slot was for closed sessions, often canceled when the board didn’t need a second closed session in a month.

For years, the board has regularly had a “performance evaluation” scheduled for closed session on its agenda. Any reporter or gadfly worth their salt knew this was actually just a time for the board to call a department head onto the carpet and scream at them behind closed doors. (There was a specific place one could sit in the Hall of Administration to see which department head it was.)

Horvath’s proposal seemingly brings that conversation out into the open (albeit likely with less screaming). Horvath said that because these department heads have five bosses, they sometimes get mixed messages on what the supervisors actually want, as they meet with the board offices individually to follow state meeting laws.

Recently, Rafael Carbajal, who leads the county’s Department of Consumer and Business Affairs, got heat from Supervisors Kathryn Barger and Holly J. Mitchell because $45 million for “mom-and-pop property owners” hadn’t been distributed, despite the supervisors’ approving the money to be sent out nine months prior.

Horvath said part of the problem was that department got different messages from each of the supervisors about what a “mom-and-pop” landlord was.

Her hope for the fourth-Tuesday policy meeting is for the department heads to get clarity from the supervisors and feel safe being honest if something isn’t working. And for the public to see it all play out. It will also shorten the regular public meetings, as these policy discussions often last more than an hour, Horvath said.

“I have the ability to call more meetings,” Horvath said. “This is how we’re going to start it out and see if it helps us have more efficient discussion. I don’t want to say faster meetings — the goal isn’t a time clock. The goal is, are we having meaningful discussions? Are we able to get to everything and are we able to best use people’s [time]?”

Longtime local-government watchdog Eric Preven argued that this move is a bad idea.

Preven has long warned about the impact of the supervisors canceling meetings — including a 2013 debate with former Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas where Preven commented on the board’s vote that day to delay a meeting.

“Given that we have a limited number of Board of Supervisors meetings, that does seem like a trend we don’t want to be going in the direction of. What it does is piles up items on the day that the meeting does take place,” Preven said, before being interrupted by Ridley-Thomas, who demanded that Preven give examples of other canceled meetings before claiming there was a trend.

Ten years later, Preven said that before he monitored the board, it used to meet twice a week.

By dropping to regular public meetings every other week, the board has “huge, over-packed” meeting days, he said.

This could be resolved if the board “met three hours on a Tuesday and three hours on the next Tuesday, but what they do is meet seven hours on Tuesday. And then the following Tuesday they go into the back room for two hours,” Preven said. “That is not transparent.”

Janet Asante, JusticeLA media coordinator at the advocacy group Dignity and Power Now, is another regular presence at the supervisors’ meetings with concerns about access.

Asante’s group has successfully fought for criminal justice reforms, regularly bringing formerly incarcerated speakers and other directly affected residents to speak.

But since the board returned to in-person meetings, it’s been challenging for those community members to stay until the motion they’d like to speak on comes up, Asante said.

And these people wait hours — to speak for one minute. Previously, public speakers were allowed to yield their time to another speaker, allowing for one speaker to have several minutes to make their point, or the overall points of a group. That practice has also not returned to the board meetings.

Asante also pointed out that, beyond the long meetings, it’s also hard for most people to attend a meeting during the middle of the week, much less afford $25 parking downtown. (The board does not make free parking available for the public.) There is also a large law enforcement presence at meetings, where armed officers walk up and down the aisles of the meeting hall. Water bottles are not allowed in the meeting, and restroom breaks must be very strategic to not miss your moment.

“The people who we represent are the most marginalized, the most disenfranchised, and the lack of access to Board of Supervisors meetings that happen at 9 a.m. on a weekday is only further disenfranchising the people who need to be heard from most,” Asante said. “The people who have the most access and are the least impacted by the inequity in our county are the ones who are most able to attend.”

State of play

— TWO IN THE 12TH: On Friday afternoon, staffers in the City Clerk’s office were still checking the petitions for some of the candidates seeking to run for council in the March 5 election. But one thing we know for sure: The race in the 12th District, which covers the northwest San Fernando Valley, will have just two candidates on the ballot: Councilmember John Lee, seeking a second four-year term, and nonprofit policy executive Serena Oberstein, a former Ethics Commissioner. Unless an extremely potent write-in candidate somehow gets involved, the race won’t have a second round in November.

— FULL HOUSE: The ballot picture has also come into focus up in the 14th District, where Councilmember Kevin de León will face seven challengers: Assemblymembers Wendy Carrillo and Miguel Santiago, attorney Teresa Hillery, tenant rights attorney Ysabel Jurado, schoolteacher Eduardo “Lalo” Vargas, healthcare professional Nadine Diaz and community advocate Genny Guerrero.

— VYING FOR THE VALLEY: The candidate list is also firmed up in the 2nd District, which takes in North Hollywood and other East Valley neighborhoods. They are former Assemblymember Adrin Nazarian, housing advocate Manny Gonez, small businessman Sam Kbushyan, mental health professional Jon-Paul Bird, small business owner Jillian Burgos, attorney Marin Ghandilyan and laborer/artist Rudy Melendez.

— BUCK STOPS HERE: The City Council supported a ban on rodeos in the city, over the objections of some Latino equestrian groups and others who painted it as an attack on their culture.

— HOMELESS COUNT: Mayor Karen Bass, as part of her whirlwind tour marking her first year in office, announced that, during her tenure, more than 21,000 homeless Angelenos had been moved into interim housing — hotels, motels, tiny homes and other facilities. We explain what all that means here.

— BASS TO THE RESCUE: During a news conference Thursday, Bass jumped in to help a news photographer who collapsed suddenly and hit his head on the ground, KNX News reported. Bass, who was previously a physician assistant, rolled the photographer on his side and checked his breathing and pulse.

— DINING OUT: After more than a year of discussion, L.A. is ready to make outdoor dining permanent.

— SHELTER BED AUDIT: An audit has found that quality issues with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s interim housing data make it “nearly impossible” for unhoused people and the city to find available shelter beds. City Controller Kenneth Mejia said LAHSA’s dysfunctional system inhibits the city’s efforts to respond to the homeless crisis with urgency.

— WESTSIDE FACILITY: A Westside nonprofit group sued the city over a 33-bed homeless housing facility planned for Midvale Avenue and Pico Boulevard. The lawsuit by Fix the City argues that city officials failed to study the environmental effects of the project and didn’t follow a competitive bidding process. The city attorney’s office isn’t commenting.

— DONE REFLECTING: Former Councilmember Gil Cedillo has rarely been seen since last year’s audio scandal. But he was back in action this week, hobnobbing at BizFed’s holiday party at Central Library. Approached by a reporter while in line for beef birria tacos and asked if he planned to lobby in the future, Cedillo said: “No interviews, I’m with friends.”

27,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,California holds the key to GOP power in the House. McCarthy’s retirement makes everything harder,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-12-09/mccarthy-johnson-vulnerable-california-republicans-2024,"With Kevin McCarthy heading for the exits , his Republican colleagues are bracing for a falloff in campaign support and loss of granular institutional knowledge that could leave them at a disadvantage heading into next fall’s elections.

The fight for control of the closely divided House will likely be decided in California, the ex-speaker’s home state. Five of the state’s 12 Republicans — Young Kim of Anaheim Hills, David Valadao of Hanford, Mike Garcia of Santa Clarita, Michelle Steel of Seal Beach and John Duarte of Modesto — hold districts President Biden won in 2020. A sixth Golden State Republican, Rep. Ken Calvert of Corona, also faces a competitive race .

But McCarthy’s announcement that he’ll leave Congress at the end of the year means the GOP will be without the man who convinced many of them to run for office in the first place — not to mention one of the most prolific fundraisers in party history. That complicates Republicans’ path to maintaining their historically narrow majority. His replacement, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), is a neophyte at political leadership with a long history of hard-line social conservative stances that might not play well in the districts that will determine House control.

“It’s terrible. There’s nothing good about losing McCarthy,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) told The Times.

McCarthy’s greatest strength as a politician has been his political capability. He’s a campaign animal, more interested in and adept at recruiting candidates and raising money than crafting policy.

He played a key role in building out the House GOP’s super PAC efforts over the past decade-plus beginning in 2010, has deep ties to megadonors and K Street lobbyists, and his close relationships with swing-district lawmakers — many of whom he personally recruited to run for office — helped propel him to the speakership.

Now, he’s on the way out. And Johnson, his replacement, is learning on the fly what it means to be in charge of the party’s campaign efforts.

Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.), a close McCarthy ally, said he was worried about the steep learning curve his home-state colleague faces as he settles into the speakership, as well as the loss of connections and institutional knowledge that are leaving with McCarthy.

He called Johnson “very smart,” but said “there’s a lot to learn.”

“Obviously, the fundraising stuff is something that he doesn’t have the background on. But I think that there’s an apparatus that’s in place that McCarthy put together that is amazing, and I think that’s gonna give him a big head start,” Graves said.

Johnson has never spent much time fundraising — he hails from a safe seat and hasn’t done much campaigning for others in past years. Before he became speaker, Johnson had raised just over $5 million in his six-plus years in Congress. He’d brought in just over a half-million dollars in the first three quarters of 2023, compared to $15 million for McCarthy, who helped the National Republican Congressional Committee raise more than $40 million last cycle alone.

Republican lawmakers and campaign aides say Johnson is working hard to introduce himself to key donors and getting help from McCarthy in his circle — but concede that he starts at a disadvantage.

“Look, there’s going to be less money, I’m sure. How much, I don’t know,” Crenshaw said.

On top of that, McCarthy comes from California and knows the Golden State well. His exit means there are no GOP House leaders from either of the two states that strategists of both parties think will determine House control next fall. Six of the GOP’s 22 most vulnerable House seats in the Cook Political Report’s analysis are in California, while five are in New York. McCarthy’s deep understanding of California politics has been replaced by a man who built his career in the religious right and represents a deeply conservative Deep South district in northern Louisiana. That’s not good news for vulnerable California Republicans.

House GOP strategists acknowledge that McCarthy’s California expertise would have been invaluable, but say that his exit isn’t going to change their plans to heavily spend in the state.

“You look at the map, and the majority is won or lost in California and New York. We’re not going to throw out the baby with the bathwater,” said one House GOP advisor granted anonymity to give a candid assessment of the party’s strategy.

McCarthy has pledged to stay involved and help the GOP retain its House majority.

“I will continue to recruit our country’s best and brightest to run for elected office. The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders,” he wrote in his Wall Street Journal op-ed announcing his retirement.

He chaired a recent fundraising dinner for the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), and has helped introduce Johnson to some donors.

But he’s clearly taking a step back. McCarthy did not bother showing up to vote on a series of measures on Wednesday and Thursday following his announcement that he’d retire.

Johnson hasn’t looked to make waves with the GOP’s campaign apparatus. He kept in place the entire infrastructure of the CLF and American Action Network (AAN), the major outside groups that McCarthy and his predecessors have used to funnel large donations into campaign spending. He’s done the same with the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ official campaign arm, and has brought on NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson’s (R-N.C.) former chief of staff as his new political director. His first major D.C. fundraiser last week brought in $4 million, and House Republicans’ online fundraising has ticked up from its nadir during the speakership fight.

“Speaker Mike Johnson showed an immediate commitment to growing the majority when was handed the gavel, and we are thankful that his hard work is already delivering results,” said NRCC Communications Director Jack Pandol.

Johnson’s political team didn’t respond to an interview request.

Politics Kevin McCarthy will retire from Congress at end of year Rep. Kevin McCarthy will give up his Bakersfield seat after nearly two decades in Congress, leaving House Republicans with an even slimmer majority.

The CLF and AAN raised a combined total of $16 million in the first 10 days of Johnson’s speakership. (They’d brought in $80 million combined in the nine months before McCarthy’s ouster, outpacing their 2022 fundraising through September by $20 million; they raised $645 million total during McCarthy’s five years as the top House Republican).

Crenshaw said that major GOP donors have stepped up in recent weeks to “make a show of force” and “signal that this is not going to be a disaster for Republicans.”

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), a prodigious fundraiser herself, has stuck around since stepping down from House leadership to help the new generation of Democratic leaders through the transition — and has helped the party avoid a dropoff in fundraising. The 83-year-old is running for another term, and will still be there after the 58-year-old McCarthy departs.

Did she ever think she’d outlast her Republican colleague in the House? “I didn’t think about him at all. Period. Zero,” she told The Times. “Once you’re gone from here, you’re gone from here.”

She declined to further discuss the potential impact McCarthy’s exit would have on the fight for House control.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a conservative firebrand who emerged as one of McCarthy’s closest allies during his speakership fights, said she was frustrated with how Johnson is running the House so far.

“Anybody that’s paying attention should be noticing that there’s literally no change and if not things are worse,” Greene told reporters on Thursday.

But she didn’t think that losing McCarthy would have much impact on which party will win the House next year.

“Not at all,” she said when The Times asked whether McCarthy’s exit would hurt the GOP’s chances. “Trump’s going to drag everybody across the line. You’re going to see voter turnout like you’ve never seen before, so I’m not worried about that.”

Greene is likely at least partly correct. The presidential race will increase turnout in 2024, and control of the House, which appears to be on the knife’s edge, could well be determined much more by how voters feel about Trump and President Biden than by specific House candidates or fundraising.

Johnson’s hard-right views, especially on social issues, so far haven’t kept swing-district Republicans from wanting to campaign with him. He recently appeared at in-district fundraisers for a trio of vulnerable freshman Republicans from suburban New York.

But he raised eyebrows with a recent fundraising email. The email, which the NRCC sent out under his name, was steeped in hard-right Christian rhetoric and warned that God might take vengeance on America for its “depraved culture” if the U.S. doesn’t change course fast.

“I fear America may be beyond redemption,” he wrote, citing the rise in the number of teenagers who identify “as something other than straight.”

“America needs to recognize that we have much to repent for if we want to avoid the judgment we so clearly deserve, but that starts with returning America to God’s good graces once again,” Johnson declared in the fundraising email.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who has won a series of close races in his Omaha-based swing district, said he’d be happy to have Johnson come in and campaign for him.

But he said that the chaos of October “hurt us,” and McCarthy’s political acumen is irreplaceable.

“God made that guy to be a political maven. He does things nobody even thinks about,” Bacon said.

Bacon met McCarthy years before he ran for office, and said that McCarthy identified him as a possible House recruit long before he’d ever thought about running. McCarthy was also so astute at reading his colleagues that he intuited that Bacon might vote against Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan’s attempt to become speaker because he was so “pissed” about McCarthy’s ouster. As McCarthy delivered a floor speech, Bacon was stewing in his seat — until he got a text from his wife that McCarthy’s wife had called her to have her relay a message: “I know Don’s mad right now, tell him we love him,” and “please don’t be too mad.”

“We lost a talent,” he said. “Nobody can campaign like this guy. And nobody can raise money like this guy. And he recruits really good recruits. I think Mike Johnson can get there. But let’s be honest: McCarthy has worked this for like two decades. This guy has built this machine. So it’s a loss,” he said. “McCarthy is one of a kind.”"
28,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Gusty winds spark brush fires in Ventura and Riverside counties, triggering some evacuations",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-09/gusty-winds-spark-brush-fire-promoting-evacuations-in-ventura-county,"The South fire, fueled by Santa Ana winds, has burned more than 2,000 acres and triggered evacuations in the Somis area near Santa Paula.

Ventura County firefighters Saturday battled a brush fire fueled by Santa Ana winds that had burned more than 2,000 acres and triggered evacuations and road closures near the town of Somis.

The blaze, dubbed the South fire, was first reported about 9:38 a.m. on South Mountain near the 118 and 126 freeways, with initial reports indicating three to four aces in size.

By late morning, the wind-driven fire had ballooned to 300 acres, said Andrew Dowd, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department. By about 6:15 p.m., the blaze had grown to 2,444 acres, he said.

“Although the weather has lightened and the winds have lightened up here, we do expect crews to continue battling this blaze all throughout the evening, with hand crews, engine companies, dozers and helicopters with night-vision goggles in place to help us suppress this fire,” Dowd said in an evening video update shared on the social media platform X.

In an earlier update, Andy VanSciver, another Fire Department spokesman, said the blaze, which was initially burning on the south side of South Mountain, had crested the top of the mountain and was burning down toward the Santa Clara River.

Engine companies were providing structural protection at residents’ homes, VanSciver said.

Evacuation orders were issued in the south-side foothills for those on East La Loma Avenue and West La Loma Avenue; East Los Angeles Avenue; and Aggen Road and La Vista Avenue.

Evacuation warnings also were issued for the South Mission Rock Road area in Santa Paula and the Saticoy Country Club area.

A temporary evacuation shelter was established at Ventura Community College. Residents can contact the information hotline at (805) 465-6650.

Road closures are also in effect from West Los Angeles Avenue north to West La Loma Avenue. This includes La Vista and Walnut avenues and Price and Aggen roads. West La Loma Avenue east from La Vista Road is also closed.

As of 5:30 p.m., the county’s sheriff’s emergency services incident dashboard showed almost 51,000 customers potentially affected by Southern California Edison’s public safety power shutoffs. More than 5,000 households were left without power.

“This is happening amid Santa Ana conditions, but we have about 100 firefighters engaged in ... ground, air and hand crews,” Dowd said.

In Riverside County, firefighters were battling a vegetation fire reported shortly after 9 a.m. in the 51000 block of Ida Avenue in Cabazon.

The blaze had grown to 65 acres by early afternoon, according to social media updates from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Riverside County Fire Department. By 2:30 p.m., the fire had slowed and firefighters reported it was 15% contained.

“Firefighters will remain on scene throughout today and tonight continuing to work on building containment,” the post read.

The National Weather Service issued a red-flag warning until 3 p.m. Sunday for most of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Low humidity and northeast winds of 20-25 mph and gusts of 45 mph are expected at the site of the fire, said David Sweet, a meteorologist with the weather service in Oxnard.

High winds are expected in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys in L.A. County as well as portions of eastern Ventura County, according to the weather service. The strongest blasts will rip through mountain areas.

“We’re looking at low humidity, strong gusty winds, and that combination tends to create conditions where you can have rapidly spreading fires,” Sweet said.

Though Southern California’s wildfire season typically begins in late spring and runs through early fall, a December wildfire is still a risk.

In December 2017, a strong Santa Ana event helped spark the Thomas fire, which scorched more than 280,000 acres, destroyed more than 1,000 structures and killed two people. The fire is the eighth-largest in state history, according to the Western Fire Chiefs Assn.

29,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,South El Monte parents find stickers on their kids. Were they a reward or a ruse?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-08/the-kids-had-stickers-on-them-parents-say-a-south-el-monte-teacher-was-putting-calming-patches-them,"A parent of a student at an Options for Learning Head Start school in South El Monte holds a mood-calming patch that she claims was used on her son without her consent on Nov. 15.

Preschool students at a Head Start school in South El Monte thought a teacher was rewarding them with colorful stickers she placed on their bodies, but parents say they were actually mood-calming patches affixed to their children without their consent.

Parents at Options for Learning Head Start said they noticed behavioral changes in their children over the last several weeks, including erratic mood swings and changes in their sleep patterns, which they believe were caused by the patches.

In a statement, Paul Pulver, the chief executive for Options for Learning, confirmed that “aromatic stickers were given to a limited number of students — one class of 16 students.”

“Over our 40-year history, the safety and well-being of our students have been at the core of our mission at Options for Learning,” Pulver said. “The stickers are advertised as harmless; they contain natural aromas including lavender, orange, cedarwood, and mandarin.”

The stickers violated Options for Learning policy requiring parental consent, and the employee who used them was fired, Pulver said.

The school will arrange for an independent investigation, he said.

“We will not compromise when it comes to the care, safety, and peace of mind of our students and families,” Pulver said.

The controversy began Nov. 15 when a boy was picked up from the Head Start school and his mother noticed something on his back, according to parents who shared details of the incident in a group chat.

The boy’s mother noticed a strong herbal aroma on the patch and shared a picture of it with the other parents. The patch featured a lazy-eyed sloth.

California As teen suicide surges, school policies may be making things worse In the absence of meaningful access to care, an old superstition has taken root: that talking about suicide will cause kids in crisis to kill themselves.

Another parent, Stephanie Rodriguez, received the picture in the group chat and showed it to her 4-year-old son, Ethan. His face lighted up when he recognized it.

“His face was like an addict’s face,” Rodriguez said. “He said, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s the sticker. That’s the koala sticker.’”

He pointed to his foot and said his teacher would put it there and take it off before the end of the school day.

The California Department of Social Services, the state agency that licenses child-care facilities, confirmed it is investigating the South El Monte Head Start but could not comment further.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said it was aware of the parents’ complaints, which have been compiled in a report and assigned to a detective. In a statement, the department said it cannot comment on the investigation.

This was not an isolated incident, parents say. Their children recognized pictures of the patches, and some even grabbed their parents’ phones and tried to smell the picture, according to Rodriguez.

California Newport Beach student suspended for remarks to another student, including “Free Palestine” A Corona Del Mar Middle and High School student was suspended this week for remarks made to another student that included the words “Free Palestine,” according to school officials and social media posts.

The specific brand of patch the children recognized, ZenPatch Mood Calming Stickers, are promoted as including essential oils meant to calm children, and the product claims it’s all-natural. Online advertisements for the patches describe them as “safe, effective and chemical-free.”

The online reviews are mixed, with some reviewers saying the patches help regulate moods and others calling them a “complete waste of money.”

Fox 11 News first reported on the incident at Options for Learning.

Many parents said they noted red flags leading up to this incident.

Rodriguez said her son fell at school earlier this year and hit his head, but staff didn’t immediately call her, instead letting him take a nap. When she asked the staff why no one called her, they said that a teacher advised against it.

“I said that was the wrong decision,” Rodriguez said.

Claudia Rivera said that over the last few months, her 3-year-old daughter, Hannah, has woken up screaming in the middle of the night from nightmares.

When Hannah first started attending Options for Learning two years ago, her teachers commended her for being able to use the restroom and developing her speech patterns, Rivera said. But this year, a teacher told Rivera that Hannah was regressing, wetting herself in class, and she had a behavior problem.

Hannah complained to her mother that her teacher hit her and pulled her hair, Rivera said.

But when Rivera complained, she said, the teacher blamed it on another student.

Rivera asked for an incident report and claimed that the teacher chided her for asking and referred her to a supervisor. Rivera said the exchange with Hannah’s teacher was so tense that she expressed concern to the supervisor, fearing retaliation against her daughter.

“The [supervisor] assured me that wouldn’t happen,” Rivera said.

But when she picked up her daughter after school that day, Hannah told her mother, “You hate my teacher, don’t you?” Rivera said.

Rivera said she later learned that the supervisor told Hannah’s teacher about her complaint and that the teacher told Hannah her mother hated her.

A few weeks later, parents began learning about the mood-calming patches.

When Rivera asked her daughter where her teacher would place the sticker, Hannah lifted up her shirt and patted her chest.

“So, obviously, I’m devastated,” she said.

A spokesperson for Options for Learning declined to comment about the abuse allegations.

Monique Mata said her 4-year-old son, Ezra, seemed energetic and outgoing before this semester at Options for Learning.

Then, he grew irritable and cried in the mornings when it was time to go to school. His sleep and eating patterns were also erratic, Mata said.

“He’s never talkative. Before, he would talk about how his day went at school and answer questions. I asked him now, and he was just like, ‘I don’t know. I don’t want to talk about it.’ He’s very timid and really mellowed out,” Mata said.

Mata said it’s as if the school is trying to push past what happened, and she doesn’t know whether she can trust anything administrators say at this point.

“I just feel like they’re in on it,” she said. “They’re saying that everything is OK now, but it’s not. This is just the beginning.”"

“He (James Donald Hawkins II) said that they had made plans to go to Louisiana to elope, and things were moving faster than they originally expected,” Jackson County Sheriff Captain Kristen Johnson testified, according to WLOX.

Johnson said during her testimony that Hawkins II, 38, had admitted to having sex with the 17-year-old student at his home and in the parking lot of the Ocean Springs Walmart, according to the local news outlet.

Hawkins II, a high school physics teacher in the Ocean Springs school district, was arrested on Nov. 30 and charged with felony sexual battery, according to inmate records.

Law enforcement said that the investigation is ongoing and that more charges could be filed.

“The victim said that it began in the springtime of 2023 before the last school year ended,” Johnson told the courtroom during Hawkins II’s probable cause hearing on Tuesday.

Hawkins II was a high school physics teacher in the Ocean Springs school district. Facebook

“According to Mr. Hawkins, he admitted they had sex approximately one time a month, including at his house and in her car.”

It’s the same home he reportedly lives in with his wife and their toddler, the Sun Herald reported.

The bond was set at $150,000, according to inmate records. The judge also ordered him to stay away from the student and her family.

Hawkins II’s lawyer, Cameron McCormick, and the school district didn’t immediately return Fox News Digital’s request for comment, but the school district told local news outlets after his arrest that he had been fired.

School officials said in a statement that the accusations were “disturbing and intolerable.”

“OSSD is deeply troubled by the arrest and charges announced today by the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department involving one of our teachers,” the school district said in a statement.

“James Hawkins was terminated from OSSD when district officials were informed of his arrest and subsequent charges by the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department this evening.”"
34,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Person of interest sought after Texas teen Lizbeth Medina found dead in apartment,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/person-of-interest-sought-in-death-of-texas-teen-cheerleader-lizbeth-medina-found-inside-apartment/,"Texas police released chilling images of a person of interest tied to the mysterious death of a 16-year-old Texas cheerleader who was found dead inside her apartment.

The unidentified man who donned a black “Volcom” sweatshirt and has a distinctive tattoo behind his right ear, was photographed running, according to surveillance photos.

He was also seen driving a silver Ford Taurus, with model years ranging from 2010 to 2018.

Lizbeth Medina was found unresponsive in the Edna apartment she shared with her mother, Jacqueline, on Dec. 5 after she didn’t show up to a Christmas parade earlier that afternoon.

Edna Police did not specify the suspect’s photographed location in proximity to Medina’s apartment.

The young Edna High School cheerleader, whose mother said was a “loving, kind and big-hearted” girl, was declared dead at the scene.

“I lost it. She was my world, my everything. Everywhere, everything I do was for her,” her mother said.

Circumstances around the teen’s death remain unclear.

“We understand the community wants information in regards to the case, however, we have to keep the integrity of the investigation our number one priority,” the department wrote in a post on Facebook.

The Texas Department of Public Safety is assisting Edna police “in what investigators believe to be a capital murder,” the department said earlier this week.

An autopsy report has yet to be released.

The distraught mother of the bright teenager said upon finding her daughter in the bathtub, she “realized she was gone.”

“There was no laced drugs, there was nothing like that. My daughter was found in a way that no mother should ever find their child,” her mother, Jacqueline, said.

“Words can’t explain what I felt at that moment finding my daughter in the matter that she was. All I can say is that I hope with all my heart that there is justice for my daughter.”

Edna is home to around 6,000 people and is about 100 miles southwest of Houston.

“We also understand the community is concerned about the individual still being on the loose. Outside agencies are in the area and working with Edna Pd to provide extra patrol,” the department wrote.

A vigil was held for Medina Saturday at the Jackson County Courthouse, with attendees wearing white in remembrance of the slain cheerleader."
35,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Holiday shoppers warned of disturbing gift card scam likely padding Chinese bank accounts,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/holiday-shoppers-warned-of-disturbing-gift-card-scam-likely-padding-chinese-bank-accounts/,"The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is warning the public of a disturbing and “very sophisticated” gift card scam that has national and international implications.

The sheriff’s office told Fox News Digital this week it carried out a massive anti-retail theft operation at big box stores across the county, netting 285 felony and misdemeanor arrests in seven days.

Among those arrested was a Chinese national who was found to be in possession of thousands of Target and Apple gift cards.

“During our recent retail theft Operation Bad Elf, detectives observed an individual, later identified as Ningning Sun, acting suspiciously near the gift cards in the payment aisles in a Sacramento Target store,” the sheriff’s office said in a press release Wednesday.

The office said investigators witnessed Sun take all the gift cards off a rack in a Target store and put them inside his jacket.

Authorities said the suspect then replaced the missing cards with “another set of seemingly identical ones.”

Members of the sheriff’s office followed the suspect outside, where recently published footage shows detectives surrounding the man to make an arrest.

“That guy blew up like a piñata at a kid’s birthday party, spilling out gift cards from his jacket,” Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Amar Gandhi told Fox News Digital in a phone call this week.

After the arrest, detectives made their way to Sun’s car and found thousands of Apple and Target gift cards.

Gandhi explained that the suspect would obtain legitimate gift cards from store shelves and “surgically remove” the glue that covers the cards’ bar codes.

He would then allegedly record the PINs, re-conceal the bar codes with glue and return the cards to store shelves.

“[The] investigation revealed Sun was part of a scam that tampered with gift cards, scanned the bar code and stole money from the gift card as money was loaded on them. Victims are completely unaware it is happening, and the money is often siphoned to an offshore account within seconds. Their investigation revealed that the operation spanned across California and several regions nationwide,” a press release stated.

After the tampered gift cards were returned to shelves, unsuspecting shoppers would then purchase one of the cards and load funds onto it.

The money, however, would immediately transfer to a bank account, in this case likely a Chinese bank account, Gandhi said.

“It’s going to go unreported because are you going to confront somebody who gave you a $0 gift card? No, that’s rude. And then you’re sitting there fat, dumb and happy, thinking, ‘Oh, I did something nice for somebody,’ not knowing that your money’s gone,” he said.

The office said it has never seen such a crime before, and that Sun is likely a part of a larger gift card operation.

The sheriff’s office is asking the public to come forward with any tips on the case.

Shoppers were warned to keep alert for “any signs of tampering, especially scuff marks or scratches near the bar code,” when purchasing gift cards.

“The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office urges residents to be cautious when purchasing physical gift cards from any retailer,” the sheriff’s office said. “These operations are very sophisticated, and modifications to the gift cards are often virtually undetectable, even to the trained eye.

“Detectives suspect Sun has done this at many stores and are requesting the public’s help to potentially link him to other crimes.”

Authorities are still investigating Sun and his alleged crimes.

Retail theft crimes in California have continued rising in recent years. Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper told Fox News Digital in an interview last month crime is “way beyond crisis level,” while pinning the blame on Proposition 47.

Voters approved Prop 47 through a ballot initiative in 2014, which lowered shoplifting charges for thefts of $950 or less from felonies to misdemeanors.

Cooper is calling for a new ballot initiative to change California laws that “incentivize criminal behavior.”

“Retailers need to step up and make safety in their stores a priority. Bad laws that incentivize criminal behavior need to change, and only you, the voters, can make that happen. I’ve seen the polls. It will pass overwhelmingly if put on the ballot. Retailers, step up and fund the initiative,” Cooper said in a video spotlighting Operation Bad Elf this week."
36,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,‘SNL’ swings and misses with cold open attempting to skewer antisemitism hearings hours after UPenn President Liz Magill resigns: ‘Abysmal’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/entertainment/snl-swings-and-misses-with-cold-open-attempting-to-skewer-antisemitism-hearings-hours-after-upenn-president-liz-magill-resigns/,"Viewers blasted “Saturday Night Live’s” cold opener after the show mocked this week’s congressional hearings on antisemitism on college campuses — hours after University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned amid a flurry of backlash over her testimony.

The opening sketch, set up as a C-SPAN broadcast, tried to poke fun at the presidents of Harvard, UPenn and MIT — portrayed by Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner and Chloe Fineman, respectively — as they testified before the House Education Committee.

There were few laughs to be heard from the audience.

Viewers took to social media to slam the sketch, which some saw as undermining the seriousness of incidents of antisemitism on college campuses in recent weeks since Israel’s war with Hamas began on Oct. 7.

Others thought it was just flat-out bad.

Newcomer Chloe Troast played Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), an outspoken Donald Trump supporter, and targeted her line of questioning during the hearing as the butt of the sketch.

“I’m going to start yelling questions at these women like Billy Eichner,” she says.

“Antisemitism — yay or nay?” she screams at the three women. “Yes or no! Is calling for the genocide of Jews against the code of conduct for Harvard?”

“Well, it depends on the context,” answers Nwodim’s Dr. Claudine Gay, the president of Harvard.

“What? That can’t be your answer,” Troast’s Stefanik shoots back.

“UPenn lady, same question, yes or no?” she asks Gardner’s Magill.

“Well, we are serious about stopping all forms of hatred, anti-semitism, Islamophobia,” she answers. Stefanik then poses the same question to Fineman’s Dr. Sally Kornbluth, president of MIT.

“If you don’t say yes, you’re going to make me look good, which is really, really hard to do,” Troast’s Stefanik says. “So I will ask you straight up. Do you think genocide is bad?”

Fineman’s Kornbluth responds: “Could I submit an answer in writing at a later date?”

“Am I winning this hearing?” an incredulous Stefanik says. “Somebody pinch me!”

The three presidents breathe a sigh of relief when Stefanik learns her time is up, but another member of the committee yields their time back to her, giving her another chance to speak.

“I am here today because hate speech has no place on college campuses. Hate speech belongs in Congress, on Elon Musk’s Twitter, at private dinners with my donors and in public speeches by my work husband, Donald Trump,” Troast’s Stefanik says.

The sketch also ridiculed the vague, evasive answers from the academic leaders.

“Only a hate-filled, anti-Semitic SNL could do a sketch about the anti-Semitic college presidents testifying in front of Congress and make the questioner Congresswoman Stefanik the target of the sketch,” radio host Mark Simone tweeted.

“Rather remarkable how few laughs there were in #SNL’s Cold Open. They – oddly – tried to skewer Elise Stefanik (who by all accounts won the day) as shrill. I guess I was under the misapprehension that calling a woman “shrill” was sexist,” one X user posted.

“The worst cold open on SNL I’ve ever seen the audience was barely laughing,” another wrote.

“Gotta be the worst cold open I’ve ever seen on SNL absolutely abysmal,” another said.

Another user remarked: “SNL is taking a big swing in the cold open and it looks like it’s going to be a miss…”

While largely falling flat, the sketch was somewhat saved by an appearance from show veteran Kenan Thompson, who played the president of the online University of Phoenix.

“Can you take a moral stance on anything? Can anyone here say yes to a single question?” Troast’s Stefanik shouts.

“I am willing to say yes to anything,” Thompson says.

“See, see, finally. A real president of a real university,” Stefanik answers.

“That’s actually our school motto: U of P: We are a real university,” he answers.

Her Stefanik asks if he would promise to eliminate antisemitism from the school’s campus.

“My campus is the internet. Antisemitism is kind of our most popular major, and our mascot is porn,” Thompson quipped.

The show’s creator and longtime producer Lorne Michaels, 79, was born to a Jewish family on a kibbutz in then-British mandate Palestine before his family moved to Toronto.

The real Stefanik, meanwhile, gave a scorching response when news of Magill’s resignation broke.

“One down. Two to go,” the congresswoman posted on X."
37,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Tennessee aviation YouTuber Jenny Blalock, dad killed in plane crash",https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/tennessee-aviation-youtuber-jenny-blalock-dad-killed-in-plane-crash/,"A popular aviation YouTuber and her father were killed when their plane crashed in Tennessee Thursday — just one month after she posted a video of her facing an “aircraft malfunction” at 4,000 feet.

Jenny Blalock, 45, and her father James, 78, went down around 11 a.m. and crashed on a remote road in Pulaski, a city on the central-southern border of Alabama, according to federal and county officials.

Their bodies were discovered outside the plane, which landed in a “remote” area that was difficult for crews to reach.

“It was just devastating. It was significant damage again. Unfortunately, there were just no survivors,” Bill Myers, director of the Giles County Office of Emergency Management, told 10 News.

The father-and-daughter pair had traveled 180 miles from Knoxville when the aircraft plummeted, FlightAware data shows. They were roughly 10 miles short of landing at a city-owned airport.

The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but it comes just a month after Blalock — known in the community as TNFlyGirl — posted a video of herself executing an emergency landing during an “aircraft malfunction” from 4,000 feet in the air.

“Are we going to make it?” she eerily asks her flight instructor after he points out the plane’s battery had died mid-flight.

Later, she discovered that the plane also had screws loose on its regulator.

Despite the harrowing ordeal, Blalock remained calm and expertly landed the aircraft without issue.

“God bless and fly safe,” the well-known YouTuber told her 16,000 subscribers.

According to her account, she was a “private pilot, flying for fun in a Beechcraft Debonair.”

Blalock, who also is a luxury home builder and designer, frequently filmed her flying excursions with her father since launching her popular channel in 2021.

Their fatal flight appeared to be one of the first the pair had taken together “in a while,” according to a video Blalock posted in November.

“Jenny and her dad were not just daughter/father, they were best friends and did EVERYTHING together!” her partner, Brett Thees, said on Facebook.

The Blalock family issued a statement saying they take comfort in knowing the father-daughter pair “were together when they met our Lord and Savior!”"

“He’s opened up a Pandora’s box that will never let our country be the same. I can only say to Joe: Be very careful what you wish for, but you have done is a terrible thing,” Trump thundered to roughly 1,000 assembled guests, who dined on wild mushroom risotto and filet mignon.

The swanky event was sponsored by the New York Young Republican Club.

“I am being indicted for you. These are not indictments in the traditional sense. These are Biden indictments against their political opponent,” the 77-year-old 2024 frontrunner said.

Trump faces 91 felony counts from four separate state and federal probes — something he repeatedly bragged about.

“I am the first guy who ever got indicted whose poll number went up,” he said in jest while comparing himself to notorious gangster Al Capone.

Trump vowed to win the GOP primary and the White House in the 2024 presidential election — and said he would even win the deep blue Empire State.

“We’re going to take New York,” Trump said to applause. “I believe we have a great chance … With hundreds of thousands of people living on the sidewalks and streets and illegal aliens invading our city and state like nobody thought possible.”

Trump laced into his political enemies as well, mocking Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as “DeSanctimonious,” and his former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley as “birdbrain.” He savaged New York Attorney General Letitia James as “peekaboo James” and a “vicious lunatic.”

Trump spoke after a lengthy evening which also featured remarks from Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).

About 30 minutes before speaking, Trump enjoyed dinner at a roped-off table and was spotted in deep conversation with New York Young Republican Club President Gavin Wax. He was also briefly treated to a personal serenade from the aptly named Hungarian violinist Zoltan Maga.

Master of Ceremonies Alex Stein made light of Trump’s legal troubles by joking that he hoped the former president went to jail because it would help with “the black vote.”

Among those spotted in a VIP cocktail hour ahead of the ceremonies included Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Col.) and Andrew Giuliani. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon also purchased his own table for the event — where individual tickets ran about $700 a head.

New York City GOP Councilwomen Vickie Paladino and Inna Vernikov were also in attendance. Vernikov herself was honored by Trump on stage — who approvingly noted that he kept reading about her in the press.

“That’s why I wanted to see her,” Trump said after exchanging a kiss on both cheeks.

“Well, that was not planned,” Vernikov texted The Post from her table.

Former New England Patriots Defense End Jake Bequette was also on hand, carrying a Super Bowl ring he allowed admirers to pose for pictures with. Vish Burra, a top aide to former Rep. George Santos — who was expelled from Congress last week after a cascading series of corruption allegations — was also spotted schmoozing and defending his former boss, whom he lovingly called “the Princess Diana of our generation.”

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani sat at a table with his former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik.

As in years past, the event has an international flair. Miklos Szantho, the head of the right-leaning Hungarian Center for Fundamental Rights, and Hungary’s Ambassador to the US Szabolcs Takács both delivered brief remarks from the main stage."

“She was definitely my rock when it came to grandparents. She was there for all the graduations, all the birthdays,” Amy Rost told WREG.

“It’s definitely been difficult. It’s one of those things where we’re trying to weigh the pros of the situation,” Rost said.

Rost’s grandmother died in October. She was cremated, and her ashes were divided between Rost’s father, Jeff, and her aunt, who lives in Ohio, and shipped to Jeff’s home in Memphis’ Midtown neighborhood.

Tracking information showed that the package containing the ashes was delivered on Dec. 4 — but when Jeff went outside to get it off his front porch, there was nothing there.

He believes the irreplaceable package was snatched by a thief.

“We’ve had so many things stolen here. Everything from tables and chairs to a can of Raid. Someone is always coming up and grabbing whatever they can find,” he told the outlet.

Memphis is ranked the second worst city in the country for porch pirates, according to a report by Safewise last month.

Nationally, package thefts have led to losses of up to $6 billion nationwide, if the average package stolen was $50, according to Safewise. Over half of the packages stolen were from Amazon.

The family is now begging for whoever took the box to return it — no questions asked.

“If I saw somebody bring a box up and leave it on the porch, I’ll leave it til they’re gone,” Jeff told WREG. “I’m not trying to prosecute anybody, it’s just it would certainly be nice to have it back.”

The Rosts said they plan to install a security camera to scare off future thieves."
40,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Democrat John Whitmire elected Houston mayor, defeating congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee",https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/democrat-john-whitmire-elected-houston-mayor-defeating-congresswoman-sheila-jackson-lee/,"Houston elected Democratic state Sen. John Whitmire as its next mayor on Saturday night, elevating a Texas lawmaker who has represented the city for 50 years by giving him a victory over US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee in a runoff.

Whitmire, 74, who is one of Texas’ most powerful Democratic legislators, will now be at the helm of America’s fourth-largest city.

His campaign focused on reducing crime, improving streets and bringing people together. He heavily outspent Jackson Lee, who was running to become Houston’s first Black female mayor.

The congresswoman’s campaign also had to deal with the fallout from the release in October of an unverified audio recording that purported to capture her profanely berating staff.

Whitmire built an insurmountable lead among early voters, winning among those voters by 30 percentage points.

Standing before a ballroom full of cheering supporters in the city’s convention center, Whitmire said he was fired up and ready to go to work as mayor.

“I don’t mind telling folks what a great city we have. But we’ve got great challenges. If we will come together and realize it won’t be easy. In fact, we will face challenges. But I see that as an opportunity. And I need you to join hands with me. We’ll meet our challenges. It’ll be an opportunity to show the nation what the city of Houston can do,” Whitmire said.

At her election night party, Jackson Lee thanked her supporters, congratulated Whitmire and said she was committed to working with him. Jackson Lee said she planned to announce in the near future a decision on whether she would run for re-election next year for her congressional seat.

“It’s sweeter to be saying what a sweet victory it is. It’s equally as sweet to acknowledge we put up a good fight,” Jackson Lee said.

Whitmire and Jackson Lee had made it to Saturday’s runoff after emerging from a crowded field of nearly 20 candidates in the Nov. 7 general election.

Both candidates — two of Houston’s biggest political fixtures — touted their decades-long political experience as strong qualifications to lead a growing city facing challenges that include crime, crumbling infrastructure and potential budget shortfalls.

Whitmire started in the Texas Legislature in 1973, first as a state representative and the majority of his time as a state senator. Jackson Lee has represented Houston in Congress since 1995 and, before that, had served on Houston’s City Council.

Booming growth over the last decade has caused municipal headaches but has also turned the Houston area into an expanding stronghold for Texas Democrats. Although the mayoral race is nonpartisan, Whitmire and Jackson Lee are both Democrats.

Whitmire will be the oldest big city mayor in the US. He is set to lead a city that is becoming younger, with a median age of around 35 and with 25% of its population below 18, according to census figures.

The choice between Whitmire and Jackson Lee, who is 73, frustrated some Democratic voters, particularly younger ones, at a time when the party is searching for new political stars in Texas who might end 30 years of GOP dominance statewide.

The new mayor will have to deal with new laws from the GOP-led state government over control of local elections and the ability to impose local regulations.

Whitmire will replace Mayor Sylvester Turner, who has served eight years and can’t run again because of term limits.

Whitmire will also lead what is considered one of the country’s most diverse cities. Of the city’s 2.3 million residents, 45% are Latino, with 23% Black and 24% white. One in every four Houston residents was born outside the US.

Known as the energy capital of the world, Houston’s economy has long been tied mainly to the oil industry. But the city is working to become a leader in the transition to cleaner energy. Like other large US cities, Houston is also dealing with a lack of affordable housing and concerns among residents over growing gaps between the rich and poor."

Laneisha Shantrice Henderson, 26, is a veteran surface warfare specialist in the US Navy and received multiple awards during her service.

Henderson received a National Defense Service Medal and a Good Conduct medal during her service.

She was also given the Navy “E” ribbon, among other awards.

Henderson has been charged with attempted arson and interfering with government property after she was seen on camera pouring the flammable liquid out of a large red fuel container and onto the porch of the historic wooden property at around 5:45 p.m. Thursday.

The footage also shows the woman — who was dressed in all-black clothing — dousing plants and emptying the liquid against the windows of the Auburn Avenue house, which is located just blocks from the King Center, King National Historical Park and the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church.

Zachary Eugene Kempf, from Utah, who shot the shocking video and is one of the two tourists who stopped Henderson, said he was in Atlanta for work reasons when he decided to visit the house.

He began recording this footage as he noticed the woman pouring gasoline around the house.

The video also shows one of the NYPD cops holding Henderson down on the ground with her hands behind her back.

She is then escorted away by Atlanta police looking glum and not saying anything.

“If the witnesses hadn’t been here and interrupted what she was doing, I mean, it could have been a matter of seconds before the house was engulfed in flames,” said Atlanta Fire Battalion Chief Jerry DeBerry.

Taylor Justin Schulz, 44, allegedly brought several items to the counter of Oak Grove Grocery, a small neighborhood store near downtown Minneapolis, just before 1 p.m. before launching the unprovoked attack.

Schulz impaled the 66-year-old employee — identified by the community as dancer Robert Skafte — “through the torso” with the club before fleeing the building, the Minneapolis Police Department said.

Neighbor Tony Gutoski, who happened to walk into the store in the immediate aftermath, said Skafte was conscious and alert despite the brutal injuries.

“He was speaking, he answered questions,” Gutoski told The Post.

“He told me the dude that came in earlier that was acting crazy and yelling about s–t came back and attacked him.”

Skafte was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.

Schulz was tracked down to an apartment across the street, where he had barricaded himself inside.

After a six-hour standoff with negotiators, the SWAT team, the drone unit and the bomb squad, the alleged assailant was taken into custody.

He was booked in the Hennepin County Jail on probable cause murder, records show.

A motive for the gruesome attack is still under investigation, but Gutoski claims Schulz was just “a f–king crazy person” who had called 911 before the attack demanding to talk to the FBI.

“It’s completely f–ked up,” Gutoski said. “[Skafte] was a really good dude, never hurt no one and this guy just ran him through with a golf club … He’s a fixture in the neighborhood.”

Skafte was an avid dancer and well-known in the theater community, neighbors said.

A memorial adorned with candles, flowers and photos was set up outside the grocery store Friday."
43,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"California moving company that touts its young, fit staff sued by feds for age discrimination: ‘No idea we were doing anything wrong’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/meathead-movers-sued-by-feds-for-age-discrimination/,"A California-based moving company that boasts about its young, buff employees is being sued by the federal government for age discrimination.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit against Meathead Movers for violating age-discrimination law by not hiring enough older workers, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Since launching in 1997, the Fresno-based company’s mission has been to hire student-athletes. Its social media posts show its youthful, muscled employees lifting weights and lifting boxes.

The employees, dubbed “Meatheads,” annually face off against each other in the Meathead Olympics, racing to assemble and leap over boxes.

During moves, workers are required to run from the moving truck to the home when they’re empty-handed, according to the Journal.

The company states on its website that its “founding principle is to support athletes working in pursuit of their dream career path and that will never change.“

Meathead Movers executives deny that they discriminate against older workers, claiming the job is simply too demanding for those not in tip-top shape.

“We are 100% open to hiring anyone at any age if they can do the job,” company owner Aaron Steed told the Journal. “People love working at Meathead, or they are turned off by how hard it is. You have to move furniture and run to get more.”

The EEOC, chaired by Charlotte Burrows, alleges that Meathead Movers’ marketing and hiring practices discourage older workers from applying, WSJ reported. Current employees are asked to seek new potential hires at local gyms and colleges, the agency claims.

The agency told the outlet that discouragement bias can be present in job ads, marketing materials and intrusive job application questions, like asking about a student’s class schedule.

EEOC has been looking into the company since 2017 on its own and did not stem from a complaint as most of its investigations are. Last year, it received more than 70,000 complaints and filed 91 employment discrimination lawsuits, according to the newspaper.

The two sides tried to negotiate a settlement, with the agency demanding $15 million before lowering that to about $5 million, according to internal emails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

Meathead countered with a $750,000 offer to settle. The EEOC filed the suit in September.

“We had no idea we were doing anything wrong by being a moving company that hires a lot of student-athletes,” Steed told WSJ.

“We want to change and evolve, but we can’t agree to go out of business doing it.”

Burrows was appointed chair of the EEOC by President Biden. Since Democrats took control of the agency in August, commissioners have since voted seven times on age discrimination matters. They voted on age issues just three times this year before that.

She has vowed to enforce age-discrimination laws regarding age bias as nearly a quarter of the country’s workforce is aged 55 and older, and the agency appears to be aggressively pursuing age-discrimination cases.

According to the Labor Department, the number of seniors over the age of 65 in the workforce will grow by a third over the next 10 years.

The Post has reached out to the EEOC for comment on the lawsuit.

Advocates for older Americans lauded the agency taking on age discrimination.

“Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is over 50. I’m pretty sure he would be good at moving boxes,” Bill Alvarado Rivera, senior vice president for litigation at AARP, an association for the rights of older people, told the Journal.

“That kind of stereotype about who could be a good mover has no place in an economy that values individuals.”"

The Nashville Emergency Operation Center confirmed on social media that three people were killed by severe storms in the city.

Montgomery County officials said an additional 23 people were hospitalized after the severe storms.

“This is devastating news and our hearts are broken for the families of those who lost loved ones. The city stands ready to help them in their time of grief,” said Clarksville Mayor Joe Pitts in a statement.

The Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office said that a tornado touched down around 2 p.m. A shelter was set up at an area high school as responders searched for victims.

Photos posted by the Clarksville Fire Department on social media revealed the extensive damage the tornado left behind, including ravaged houses, a tractor-trailer flipped on its side on a highway and insulation ripped out of building walls.

Officials asked residents to remain in their homes as the search and rescue operation continues.

In a briefing shared on social media, Pitts said there was extensive damage around the city of about 170,000 people.

“If you need help, call 911 and help will be on the way immediately. But if you can, please stay home. Do not get out on the roads. Our first responders need time and space,” he said.

45,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Stores in crime-riddled San Francisco abandoning self-checkout lanes to combat thefts: report,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/san-francisco-stores-abandoning-self-checkout-lanes-to-combat-thefts/,"Retailers in crime-riddled San Francisco are abandoning their self-checkout lanes in a “defensive retailing” move to counter surging thefts in the city.

A Safeway supermarket in San Francisco’s Fillmore District and a Target on Mission Street closed their self-checkout kiosks to customers — a change that other stores across the troubled city may follow, SFGate reported.

“While I can’t speak for any one company, you see the trajectory of commerce over the last 10, 20, 5,000 years, it’s all about reducing friction for customers,” Daniel Conway, vice president of government relations for the California Grocers Association, told the outlet.

“But now you’re seeing a countervailing trend: armed guards and Tide Pods locked up,” he added.

Retail thefts and organized “smash-and-grab” robberies in the Golden Gate City — and major cities across the country — have skyrocketed in recent years, forcing many major stores to shut down certain locations.

Target blamed crime for shutting down three stores in San Francisco in September, according to SFGate. In 2021, Safeway said rampant thefts forced a city location to cut employees’ hours.

The Post has reached out to Target and Safeway for comment about the removal of the self-checkout machines as many retailers have linked the do-it-yourself kiosks to rising thefts.

There have been 29,739 cases of larceny and theft in 2023 — significantly down from 2022 when 61,715 were reported, according to the latest data from the San Francisco Police Department,

California announced in September it plans to spend $267 million to help dozens of local law enforcement agencies crack down on smash-and-grab robberies. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said at the time that since 2019, law enforcement in California has arrested more than 1,250 people and recovered $30.7 million in stolen merchandise.

In New York, store owners said they lost $4.4 billion last year as a result of retail theft, according to the The Retail Council of New York State, a lobbying group.

Retailers in other cities such as Chicago and Minneapolis, have also been targeted by large-scale thefts when groups of people show up in groups for mass shoplifting events or to enter stores and smash and grab from display cases.

In response, retailers have had to adapt, which may wind up making shopping ultimately more difficult, Conway told SFGate.

“All the things put in place to reduce friction are now being put back,” Conway said. “I can buy whatever I want on my phone, but now when I want to go to a store to buy it, it’s harder.

“It’s difficult to make a direct correlation, but I think in San Francisco it’s getting to the point that you are seeing stores closing, which is the ultimate form of defensive retailing,” she said."
46,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"US OKs $106M emergency tank ammunition sale to Israel, sidestepping congressional review",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/us-oks-106m-emergency-tank-ammunition-sale-to-israel/,"The Biden administration approved an “emergency sale” Saturday to send nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition to Israel as it ramps up its invasion of the Gaza Strip.

The State Department approved the massive offloading — worth more than $106 million — in a move that allowed it to circumvent Congress.

“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” the department said in a statement.

“Israel will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense,” it added.

For the price of $106.5 million, Israel will receive 13,981 120 mm High Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose with Tracer tank cartridges as well as US support, engineering and logistics, all of which will come from Army inventory.

Congress was notified of the sale late Friday after Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined an “emergency exists” in the Middle Eastern war that would affect US national security interests.

The urgency allowed Biden officials to sell the weaponry without the standard congressional review required for foreign military sales.

Although unusual, the emergency sale is not unprecedented. In 2019, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo similarly sold $8.1 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after it became clear that the Trump administration would have trouble overcoming lawmakers’ concerns about the Saudi- UAE-led war in Yemen.

The sale comes days after the Biden administration pleaded for Congress to approve a nearly $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs.

A hefty portion of the funding would go toward military and economic assistance in Ukraine, saying Kyiv’s war effort to defend itself from Russia’s invasion may grind to a halt without it.

The administration has faced a difficult reception on Capitol Hill, where there is growing skepticism about the magnitude of assistance for Ukraine and where even Republicans supportive of the funding are insisting on US-Mexico border policy changes to halt the flow of migrants as a condition for the assistance.

The GOP-controlled House has passed a $14.3 billion standalone assistance package for Israel.

More than 1,200 Israelis were killed when Hamas launched its surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, and 97 Israel Defense Force soldiers have been killed in the fighting since.

With the war entering its third month, the death toll in Gaza stands at more than 17,400, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip.

Truckers started blocking roads to border crossings on Nov. 6, creating lines stretching nearly 20 miles and lasting weeks in freezing temperatures, and hindering the transport of pickup trucks, tourniquets, night vision equipment, drone parts and other materials and medical supplies.

The Polish drivers are protesting competition from Ukrainian counterparts, who they say are undercutting their business amid relaxed European Union transport rules.

“This means that the Russian army will have the ability to kill Ukrainian soldiers and terrorize civilians for several weeks longer,” said Oleksandr Zadorozhnyi, operational director of the KOLO foundation, which assists the Ukrainian army with technology and is unable to get materials through.

Protestors deny holding up aid, according to reports, and the head of a truckers’ association in western Poland said there is no light at the end of the tunnel as authorities are paying little attention.

As the war wages on, Ukrainian authorities are also fighting plans for voting to take place in illegally annexed territories in the planned Russian election in March. The balloting could keep Russian President Vladimir Putin in power until at least 2030.

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry is calling on the international community to impose sanctions on those involved with the election.

Separately, Ukraine continued its effort to eliminate Russian influence on the homefront with its campaign to remove Soviet-era monuments. A statue of a Soviet field commander of the Russian Civil War was removed Saturday as “decommunization” efforts have been revamped ahead of the war’s two-year mark.

Bok, chairman of its board of trustees, “voluntarily” resigned their posts Saturday in a massive Ivy League shakeup, the school announced.

“I write to share that President Liz Magill has voluntarily tendered her resignation as President of the University of Pennsylvania,” Bok wrote in a surprise “University Notification” sent to staffers Saturday.

“She will remain a tenured faculty member at Penn Carey Law,” Bok continued.

“On behalf of the entire Penn community, I want to thank President Magill for her service to the University as President and wish her well.

“We will be in touch in the coming days to share plans for interim leadership of Penn. President Magill has agreed to stay on until an interim president is appointed.

“President Magill shared the following statement, which I include here: ‘It has been my privilege to serve as President of this remarkable institution. It has been an honor to work with our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and community members to advance Penn’s vital missions.’”

Bok’s separate resignation statement was obtained by the Daily Pennsylvanian, the school’s student newspaper.

“Working with [Magill] was one of the great pleasures of my life,” he wrote. “Worn down by months of relentless external attacks, she was not herself last Tuesday.”

Magill’s sudden departure came four days after her Tuesday appearance before the House Education Committee, when she and the presidents of Harvard and MIT were grilled by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) – who asked each of them whether calling for the genocide of Jews is considered to be “bullying and harassment” under their colleges’ codes of conduct.

“It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman,” Magill responded – sparking outrage among donors and others.A source close to situation told The Post that the mood was sad Saturday as 27 Penn trustees met for two hours without Magill’s or Bok’s knowledge and decided to recommend that she consider resignation.

Bok announced his resignation on the spot during a call with trustees, the source said – without giving any warning to vice chairman Julie Platt before hanging up.

Platt will serve as acting chair, and the executive committee will present a “plan forward” on Sunday.

Larry Jameson, dean of Penn’s medical school, was mentioned by some trustees as a possible interim president.

4 The University announced the news in a letter to the Penn community.

Stefanik issued a blistering response as news of Magill’s resignation broke.“One down. Two to go,” the congresswoman posted on X.

“This is only the very beginning of addressing the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has destroyed the most ‘prestigious’ higher education institutions in America,” Stefanik – a Harvard graduate – wrote.

The body of Sahar Baruch, an electrical engineering student kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7 from his kibbutz in southern Israel was featured in a Hamas propaganda video released Friday.

Hamas claimed that he was killed in an Israeli Defense Forces operation to free hostages.

The IDF denied the claims, and said Baruch had been murdered by Hamas.

On Saturday, Baruch’s death was confirmed by members of Kibbutz Be’eri, where he lived with his family, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.

“It is with great sadness and a broken heart that we announce the murder of Sahar Baruch (25), who was kidnapped from his home by Hamas terrorists to Gaza on the Black Sabbath and murdered there,” said the community in a statement.

The Ben Gurion University student’s family are demanding the return of his remains in any future hostage release deal, according to the Jerusalem Post.

Baruch, whose brother Idan was murdered by Hamas during the Oct. 7 massacre, was considered missing for weeks, until his family received the message that he was being held captive by Hamas.

“Sahar was at home with his brother Idan at his mother’s house,” said an aunt in an interview with Israeli media Saturday. “They woke up in the morning, like the rest of us, from alerts and the explosions.They entered and closed themselves in the mamad [protected space] but couldn’t close the door,” so they closed it with a closet” She continued.

“When the fire started, three grenades were thrown into the mamad – Idan was hit and Sahar treated him for hours.”

The brothers decided to jump from the home when it began to burn, the aunt continued. “In the beginning, Idan jumped and probably near that he was shot and killed. Sahar stayed behind for a few more minutes to bring him the inhaler because Idan was asthmatic.

50,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,George Soros funneled more than $50M to Iran-sympathizer groups linked to Robert Malley,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/iran-apologists-linked-to-robert-malley-got-50m-from-soros/,"Far-left billionaire George Soros has funneled more than $50 million to a network of Iran-sympathizer groups whose members have gained significant sway within the Biden White House — pushing to defang US sanctions on Tehran while advocating for a renewed nuclear deal.

A Post examination of Soros’ Open Society Foundations records shows the progressive kingmaker has given a staggering $46.7 million since 2016 to the International Crisis Group, a lefty think tank tied to an alleged Iranian plot to manipulate US policy.

Robert Malley, the former US special envoy to Iran now under FBI investigation for his alleged mishandling of classified material, was the ICG’s president until he joined the Biden administration in 2021.

“Soros has continually funded organizations that act as apologists for the Iranian regime – downplaying their severe human rights abuses while working to advance Iranian propaganda,” Gabriel Noronha of the Polaris National Security think tank told The Post.

Soros cash funded the ICG’s formation in 1994, and the billionaire was a trustee for years before handing the seat to his son and ideological heir Alexander Soros, 38, in 2018.

Three of Malley’s proteges were part of the Iran Experts Initiative, a covert network of Iranian-American academics established by Iran’s Foreign Ministry in 2014, according to Semafor.

Over the last decade, IEI participants have worked their way into Washington’s foreign policy establishment — while subtly persuading US policymakers to ease sanctions on Tehran and accede to its nuclear ambitions.

“If you were a regime running a game plan of how to subvert the United States’ political system from within, this would be it to a tee,” Noronha said.

Malley hired IEI participant Ariane Tabatabai as his top aide when Biden tapped him to lead the US team charged with negotiating a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Tabatabai then switched to a high-level job at the Pentagon with a top security clearance, where she remains, drawing Republican ire.

Ali Vaez, another IEI member and currently the director of Iran projects at ICG, reportedly sent some of his writings to Iranian officials for pre-publication review. Vaez has scored five White House meetings with Biden’s top national security officials, visitor logs show.

Malley hired Dina Esfandiary, a third IEI member, as a senior ICG advisor. In 2021, she and Vaez co-authored an essay cheering the election of Iran’s hardline president Ebrahim Raisi as “a real opportunity to make progress on the nuclear talks.”

Malley’s 2021 appointment coincided with the administration’s turn from former president Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Biden’s lax enforcement has reportedly earned the mullahs an estimated $95 billion.

In February 2023, Vaez scored two lengthy one-on-one meetings with Brett McGurk, Biden’s coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, while McGurk was secretly negotiating with his Iranian counterpart to restart the nuclear talks.

Soon after, the administration made a controversial deal to release $6 billion of frozen Iranian funds in exchange for five American hostages.

Meanwhile, Malley’s son, Blaise Malley, 25, works for an Iran-sympathizing think tank, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, that has also basked in Soros’ largesse — even though founder Trita Parsi was found by a US court to have been credibly accused of acting as “an advocate for the regime” through his nonprofit National Iranian American Council after he brought a defamation suit charging this was false.

Since 2019, Soros has given Quincy — which says it advocates “restraint” in US foreign policy — $1.8 million, plus $100,000 to Parsi’s NIAC.

“NIAC and Quincy are the Russia Today of the Iranian Regime,” Iranian dissident Masih Alinejad wrote in 2022.

Soros’s cash has also indirectly flowed to Iran apologists via lefty groups like the Ploughshares Fund and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

In 2021, for example, when OSF gave Ploughshares $300,000, Ploughshares in turn showered $225,000 — $75,000 each — on the ICG, NIAC Action, and the Quincy Institute.

This year, Ploughshares awarded Vaez a direct grant for an unspecified amount.

OSF and Soros have funneled more than $15 million since 2016 to groups behind recent pro-Hamas protests in the US, The Post has reported.

“We value the donations we receive from across the political spectrum and have always been transparent about that support on our website,” said Jessica Rosenblum of the Quincy Institute.

“These groups are committed to promoting both international and regional peace and security,” said an OSF spokesperson. “None has ever worked on behalf of the government of the Islamic Republic.”

“I don’t know what either Soros’s vision is regarding Iran,” Noronha said. “But the things they routinely fund are things that weaken America, both internally and externally.”"
51,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Redneck Christmas Parade brings cheer, charity to Louisiana town",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/redneck-christmas-parade-brings-cheer-charity-to-louisiana-town/,"Christmas came early for the “rednecks” in this Louisiana town.

The 17th annual Bawcomville Redneck Christmas Parade was held on Dec. 2 in the small town of 2,700 residents in West Monroe, Louisiana.

“This is part of our town — I don’t think there’s very many rules,” parade participant Zach Raybourn told CNN.

Floats that participated in the holiday revelry were decorated in redneck themes and included one with a man sitting on a toilet bowl and others filled with empty beer cans.

Some displayed signs with ‘country’ sayings like “Kiss ur cuzin” and “Crack is wak” scrawled upon them.

A tractor, trash truck, and multiple pickup trucks were also part of the festivities.

“We have Leroy the Redneck Reindeer,” reveler Bryan Baker told the outlet, gesturing to a stuffed deer head with a red nose on his float. “You can’t get anymore redneck than that.”

Baker went on to explain how to define rednecks. “We’d rather be out in the woods, be out in the country — sit back on the porch, bonfire, cold beer,” he said.

Those who march toss items like toothbrushes, ramen noodles, beads, toilet paper, and candy into the crowd of spectators.

Shane Wooten, a local realtor, dressed as the Grinch and brought hundreds of packages of ramen noodles to throw from a La-Z-Boy he fastened to a motorized scooter.

The noodles are a nod to a joke about rednecks, that claims they eat dry noodles since they are cheaper than chips.

“It’s just not your typical Christmas parade. It’s something to laugh about,” Wooten told the outlet.

All proceeds from the event benefit local children during the Christmas season, according to the parade’s Facebook page.

“We have over 100 children and their families that we are trying to provide Christmas for this year! Everything stays right here in this community and truly does make a difference,” the post explained.

“I understand that most of us don’t have to worry about where our next meal will come from or where our children’s happiness will come from on Christmas morning, but that is not the case for a lot of families in our area.”

5 A tractor, trash truck, and multiple pickup trucks were also part of the festivities. CNN

More than 30% of residents in Bawcomville, which is close to 200 miles from Louisiana’s capital, Baton Rogue, live below the poverty line.

This is apparent on the parade route, which is lined with RVs and tents, where some residents live, abandoned stores, a pawn shop, and a few Dollar General stores.

Nonprofit workers Debi Mayo and Rachel Holmes from Bawcomville Hope, which provides hot meals to those in need there, were at the parade doing outreach.

5 “This is part of our town,” said parade participant Zach Raybourn. CNN

“People don’t realize this is kind of like a Third World country,” Holmes told the outlet. There were many homeless people in the area, living in abandoned mobile homes.“

“And in the woods,” Mayo added. “Makeshift tents. It’s a terrible situation we’re in. Even people with jobs are suffering because of the high price of the economy.”"

The Friday fundraiser was held at the stately home of former U.S. ambassador to Spain James Costos and designer Michael Smith, whose guests were a who’s who of Democratic power players in the state, including Steven Spielberg, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

At nearby Holmby Park, where roughly 1,200-1,500 protesters chanted and jeered, parroting Hamas propaganda that Israel was committing “genocide” against Palestinians and denounced the Israel Defense Forces and the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Some carried giant likenesses of Biden with devil horns, and signs which read “End all U.S. aid to Israel,” “America, don’t let your tax $ fund killing babies.”

Police ultimately declared the event an unlawful assembly and cleared the protesters from the park.

Some cops later reported being hit with eggs and bottled water by the unruly crowd.

No arrests were reported.

Biden addressed his well-heeled audience for just 11 minutes.

He did not discuss Gaza and instead talked about his potentially looming rematch with former President Trump.

“Literally, I believe, the future of American democracy is at stake,” Biden said, CBSNews reported. “The greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy, because if we lost that, we lose everything. We will be one of those generations that can say, ‘We saved democracy.'”

A second fundraiser is scheduled for Biden in Los Angeles Saturday evening and he is expected to return to Washington D.C. on Sunday."

“On my watch, instead of Infrastructure Week, America is having Infrastructure Decade,” the president told a crowd of union members in Las Vegas on Friday, in a speech touting federally funded railroad projects.

“Over a billion three hundred million trillion three hundred million dollars!” Biden exclaimed. “Trump just talks the talk, we walk the walk.”

The jab was meant as a swipe at Biden’s predecessor, former president Donald Trump, who did not pass such spending bills through Congress during his tenure — but it drew mockery online.

“Why does the President of the United States sound exactly like my 4-year-old when he’s trying to come up with the highest possible number?” wondered Biden critic Oren Ross on X.

On Saturday, nearly 18 hours later, the White House press office released a transcript that papered over the error by expressing it numerically, as “over 1,300,000,000 — $1,000,300,000,000” — hinting that the president had merely missed a few zeroes on his teleprompter, rather than dabbling in some new form of budgetary math.

The verbal stumble was the latest in a long string of Biden gaffes that have contributed to widespread voter worries about the 81-year-old president’s mental acuity and fitness for office.

In the same speech, Biden shared for at least the 13th time since taking office a debunked story involving a late Amtrak conductor who supposedly exclaimed “Joey, baby!” while extolling Biden’s lifetime rail ridership."

The weapons were found at a school compound in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shejaia Friday after Israel Defense Forces engaged in heavy fighting with a Hamas terrorist cell in the area, Israeli news reports said.

A video released by the IDF showed soldiers pulling the giant teddy from a pile of furniture and other items strewn across the classroom, laying it down, and slicing it open.

Hidden among the stuffing was the long rifle and a box of ammunition.

The school was used for terror purposes by Hamas, according to the IDF.

Soldiers found more weaponry hidden in classrooms at an adjacent school, in bags labeled “UNRWA.”

The initials stand for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which provides assistance and protection for Palestinian refugees, according to its website.

5 A sniper rifle and ammunition were found in a teddy bear during an IDF raid on a school compound in Gaza City as Israel continued its bombing campaign in the area, according to a report.

A search of the school compound where the teddy bear was found also revealed a tunnel shaft inside of a classroom, according to a report in the Jerusalem Post.

The tunnel discovery adds to the evidence that Hamas uses civilian areas, such as hospitals and shelters, as a cover for its terrorist activities, the report said.

Earlier this week, the IDF said it had found one of the largest Hamas stockpiles of weapons in the history of its operations in Gaza next to a school and a hospital.

5 The video shows soldiers pulling the giant teddy from a pile of furniture and other items strewn across the classroom, laying it down, and slicing it open.

The weapons cache contained hundreds of missiles and explosives, among other weapons, according to reports.

“Who stores RPG missiles, anti-tank missiles, explosive devices, long-range missiles, grenades, and UAVs at a school and a medical facility in Gaza?” the IDF asked in a post on X Wednesday. “The answer: Hamas. Hamas doesn’t hide their terrorism. Stop excusing it.”

Saturday, Israeli warplanes continued to strike parts of the Gaza Strip by land, sea, and air.

5 Hidden among the stuffing was the long rifle and a box of ammunition.

Its aerial bombing campaign pounded some of the areas in the territory’s south that it had told Palestinians to evacuate, according to reports.

The airstrikes came a day after the US vetoed a UN resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire.

The Security Council vote was 13-1, with the United Kingdom abstaining.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that Gaza was at “a breaking point” with its humanitarian support system on the verge of collapse, and some Arab countries expressed deep dissatisfaction with the US veto.

5 The school where the bear was found was used for terror purposes by Hamas, according to the IDF.

5 Israeli forces pull the rifle out of the large stuffed bear.

Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, who the US has touted as a possible post-war governing authority for Gaza, said that the veto was a “mark of shame that will follow the United States for many years.”

With the war entering its third month, the death toll in Gaza stands at more than 17,400, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip.

So, he might face juvenile punishment despite being an adult.

That’s what happened to Hannah Tubbs, a 26-year-old child molester and convicted killer whose light sentence sought under Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon’s direction didn’t include the requirement he register as a sex offender.

Paz’s victims had been “groomed” for years, according to an attorney for two of their families, Kathleen Cady, and they came forward only recently, leading to his arrest as an adult.

“Were this case in any other county, I’m sure it would already be up in adult criminal court,” Cady told Fox News Digital. “But in LA County, it’s not. We don’t know why. And we don’t know what the parameters are that they would be considering. It’s not anywhere to be found.”

After stirring outrage with his office’s handling of the Tubbs case, Gascon rescinded his blanket policy against transferring any juvenile cases to adult court and instead created a panel of handpicked allies, many of them former public defenders, to review certain high-profile cases and determine what to do, Cady said.

4 Hannah Tubbs, when she was booked as James Tubbs, in November 2021.

The catch with that is the panel operates outside public view and ignores state law that lists the criteria prosecutors and judges should consider when deciding whether to try a juvenile as an adult.

“His policies are an epic failure, but the bigger picture to me is how his policies lack transparency,” Cady said. “And so the public doesn’t really understand what they mean. And he does that, I think, deliberately, in an attempt to sort of hide what he’s actually doing.”

And there’s precedent for the victims’ fears. Hannah Tubbs, also known as James Tubbs, was sentenced Thursday for beating his friend to death with a rock in a fight over $100. Tubbs spent years in adult jails in multiple states when Los Angeles authorities arrested him in 2021 for the 2014 sex assault of a little girl in a Denny’s bathroom.

Because the crime happened weeks before Tubbs’ 18th birthday, Gascon’s office prosecuted him as a juvenile.

Once in Los Angeles custody, Tubbs began to identify as female, telling his father to call him “Hannah” in jailhouse phone calls in which he mocked his child victim and the lenient punishment he expected to face. With this new gender identity, the child molester, who targeted young girls, sought to be housed in a female juvenile jail.

A deputy district attorney who blew the whistle on Tubbs’ claims was suspended five days without pay for “misgendering” and “deadnaming” him despite evidence Tubbs’ new gender identity was a ruse.

Gascon’s office also played a role in the early release of Andrew Cachu, a convicted killer who served just six years of a 50-year prison sentence. Cachu walked free last year after the DA’s office declined to present evidence at a hearing to determine whether he should remain in custody after aging out of the juvenile detention facility when he turned 25, Fox News Digital reported at the time.

Only the most severe juvenile crimes are eligible to transfer to adult court, Cady said, including murder and child molestation.

“There are multiple counts, it went on for a long time, [but] originally, it would appear as though the DA’s office did not intend to even think about sending this up to adult criminal court,” Cady said of the Paz case. “And that has changed. Now, apparently they’re at least considering it.”

Gascon’s office told Fox News Digital a decision on whether to transfer the case to adult court had not been reached as of Thursday.

“A provisional transfer motion was filed in the juvenile court at the time the case was filed, pending a final decision on seeking transfer,” a spokesperson said. “LADA has established protocols for making appropriate determinations on seeking transfer, and the decision in this case is advancing through those protocols. A final decision on transfer is still pending.”

Paz is being held without bail. He’s due back in court Dec. 18."

The attorney’s method left some organizations thinking it was a scam, and they lost out on a slice of the unorthodox bequest.

Indianapolis resident Terry Kahn, a 30-year employee of the Veterans Administration, died in 2021 with no immediate family to leave his fortune to.

Kahn said in his will that it should be donated to “charity,” but failed to designate any particular organizations he supported.

Kahn’s attorney Dwayne Isaacs, told CBS News Kahn “was unbelievably frugal,” and didn’t even own a cell phone because he thought it was too expensive.

After his client died, Isaacs was tasked with the job of cold-calling dozens of local nonprofits and essentially offering them millions.

“Probably three or four different entities that lost out because they just didn’t take my call,” Isaacs told the outlet.

He was not alone in being stunned by the calls.

“We hovered above our own bodies, thinking, like, is this real?” another recipient, Julie Henson, vice president of development for Coburn Place, which supports domestic violence survivors, told the outlet.

According to Isaacs, Kahn lived in a modest house, drove an old Honda, and asked that when he passed no money be spent on a death announcement.

“He’s smiling someplace, there’s no doubt about it,” Isaacs told the outlet. “He would be getting a kick out of this.”"

Biden trailed Trump 47% to 43% in the hypothetical match-up.

The lead widened from 37% to 31% when five potential third-party candidates were added to the mix.

The survey showed former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley whipping Biden 51% to 34%, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis only managing a 45-45% draw with Biden.

Deep pessimism about Biden’s job performance drove the dour numbers.

Barely one in five Americans said Biden’s policies have helped them personally while a majority, 53%, said they were “hurt” by Biden’s presidency.

More than six out of 10 voters said they disapproved of President Biden’s job performance.

Just over five out of 10 voters said they also disapproved of Trump’s performance as president.

Two-thirds of voters said they believed the economy was poor or not good and that it had gotten worse in the last two years.

On major issues including the economy, crime, inflation, border security, and Israel-Hamas, voters said they trusted Trump more than Biden.

The president received higher marks on abortion and “tone in politics.”

“We don’t have national elections, we have state elections. Trump is at 47%, which is about where he was in 2020. The question is can he get the extra 1.5% to be president,” said GOP consultant Ryan Girdusky — who warned that abortion could be a deadly issue.

“Abortion as an issue is a killer. Joe Biden is going to sit there and say Donald Trump appointed Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe V. Wade,” Girdusky said. “For a lot of women this is their big issue, for a lot of people this is their big issue. There is no way around that. “

Voters tended to see Trump as having more stamina than Biden and being more mentally up for the job.

Biden, 81, is the oldest president in American history.

More voters, however, said Biden was “honest” and “respects democracy.”

The poll was conducted by Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio and Democrat Michael Bocian.

Fabrizio is a longtime Trump pollster and currently works for a SuperPAC supporting the former president.

“If this race is about policy and performance, then Donald Trump has a significant advantage,” Fabrizio told the Journal. “If this race is about temperament and character, things like that, then Biden has an advantage.”

The poll also reconfirmed Trump’s dominance in the GOP presidential primary, where he has coasted far above his challengers throughout the year.

The survey found Trump leading his Republican rivals with 59% of GOP primary voters supporting him.

Navalny, 47, is imprisoned in a penal colony east of Moscow and has been sentenced to a total of more 30 years on what he says are trumped-up charges to silence his criticism of President Vladimir Putin.

His aides said Navalny’s lawyers had stood all day outside the colony but been refused entry to see him, and he did not appear at scheduled judicial hearings about his case.

“We have learned that last week he had a serious health-related incident. Navalny’s life is at great risk. He is in complete isolation right now,” Maria Pevchikh, chair of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, posted on social media platform X.

Navalny’s spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said prison staff had put him on a drip last week after he suffered a dizzy spell and lay down on the floor of his cell in what she said looked like a “hunger faint.”

“Now it’s the third day that we don’t know where he is. Before that, there were at least occasional letters from him, albeit censored ones, but there have been no letters all week,” she wrote on X.

Navalny has long-term health issues, having survived being poisoned with a nerve agent in Siberia in 2020. The Kremlin denied trying to kill him and refuses to comment on his case, saying he is treated like any other prisoner."

The area was established by the IDF as safe for civilians within the war-torn Gaza Strip.

Four rockets were fired from the al-Mawasi area Saturday, but “landed in the Gaza Strip and endangered many citizens in Gaza,” said a statement from the IDF.

“This is further proof that Hamas exploits the IDF’s humanitarian zone for terrorist activity,” the IDF said.

The IDF published a graphic showing the locations of the rocket launches from al-Mawasi, as well as an image showing a rocket launcher.

James Comer says Hunter Biden indictment was ‘to protect him’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/rep-james-comer-hunter-biden-indicted-to-protect-him/,"A top House Republican accused special counsel David Weiss of indicting Hunter Biden to protect him from the chamber’s sprawling investigation into the first family.

Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the House Oversight Committee chairman who is leading the congressional probe into Hunter Biden and President Biden, said Weiss was only bringing the minimum possible charges to spare father and son from potentially more damaging revelations from his committee.

Hunter Biden had been in talks to testify before the Oversight Committee next week.

“We think that this is just the tip of the iceberg. We think there are many more crimes,” Comer said on CNN Friday. “And my concern is that Weiss may have indicted Hunter Biden to protect him from having to be deposed in the House Oversight Committee.”

Network anchor Jake Tapper was skeptical of the argument.

3 Rep. James Comer floated the idea that Special Counsel David Weiss was trying to protect Hunter Biden by indicting him

“Yes. He indicted him to protect him. Yes. The classic rubric. He indicted him to protect him. I got it,” Tapper responded sarcastically. “He’s facing like 17 additional years in prison.”

“Jake, this whole thing’s been about a cover-up… You indicted him on the least little thing, the gun charge, and not paying taxes.” Comer shot back. “Anybody else in America would already be in prison, would already be in prison. You say he owes $2 million. He may owe $7 or $8 million, if these loans are fraudulent loans. I mean, a loan means you are going to pay it back.”

Team Hunter, however, did not appear happy with the decision by Weiss, who they noted just months ago was ready to let the first son off the hook with misdemeanor charges.

Hunter Biden’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said prosecutors only brought the new charges in response to “Republican pressure.”

“Now, after five years of investigating with no new evidence — and two years after Hunter paid his taxes in full — the U.S. Attorney has piled on nine new charges when he had agreed just months ago to resolve this matter with a pair of misdemeanors,” Lowell said in a statement."
61,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Hunter Biden’s top deputy and ‘go-between’ for businesses will testify in January,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/hunter-biden-deputy-eric-schwerin-to-testify-in-january/,"Eric Schwerin — one of Hunter Biden’s closest business associates — will testify before the House Oversight Committee in a closed hearing in January, the committee confirmed to The Post.

Schwerin, 54, who worked as president of Hunter Biden’s investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners, was served a subpoena to appear on Nov. 9, 2023.

Emails from the first son’s abandoned laptop show Schwerin was intimately involved with the personal finances of both Hunter Biden and his father, President Biden.

“Mr. Schwerin worked closely with the Biden family members, Biden associates, and Biden corporate entities that the committees have identified as transferring millions of dollars to the Bidens, often from foreign sources,” including “access to bank accounts,” the panel wrote to Schwerin’s attorney, William Farah, in their subpoena letter.

The letter was sent after months of negotiations between Schwerin, who lives in a three-bedroom townhouse in the upscale Glover Park neighborhood of Washington D.C., and the committee.

The closed-door nature of the hearing suggests the deposition will follow a similar format to Devon Archer, another Hunter Biden business partner who spoke to the committee in July.

News of the bombshell deposition comes just weeks after Hunter Biden was hit with a raft of new felony and misdemeanor charges for allegedly failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes while living the life of an “extravagant” nepo-baby.

The first son could face up to 17 years in prison.

Experts said Schwerin’s testimony could be explosive given how close he was to the Biden family’s finances.

“He was the go-between between Hunter’s business and Joe’s cash pots. He set up the shell companies. He was the one doing the cash transfers. He knows what money went where,” said Jim Hanson, an information security consultant who has studied Hunter Biden’s laptop. “If there is a smoking gun, he buried it.”

It is unclear what exactly Schwerin will say, but it is almost certain that members will seek answers to disclosures this week from the House Ways and Means Committee that Joe Biden used email pseudonyms to communicate covertly with family members — and Schwerin — between 2011 and 2019.

5 Schwerin is one of the Biden family’s closest business associates. AP

The elder Biden sent or was party to 327 emails with Schwerin.

Of those, 54 were exclusively between Joe Biden and Schwerin.

The committee has accused Schwerin of being the architect of “various shell companies that launder money around the world.”

Hunter Biden and Schwerin likely first met more than 20 years ago when they worked in former President Bill Clinton’s Commerce Department.

When George W. Bush became president, Hunter Biden went off to the private sector and started a lobbying firm with William Oldaker, a D.C. lawyer who worked on his father’s aborted 1988 presidential campaign.

Schwerin became a partner in the company in 2002, lobbying disclosure forms show.

In June 2009 — shortly after the elder Biden became vice president — Hunter Biden founded his investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners with Devon Archer, a former Abercrombie & Fitch model, and Chris Heinz, a ketchup heir and stepson of John Kerry.

5 Emails from Hunter Biden’s hard drive show that Eric Schwerin had intimate access to Joe Biden’s finances.

Schwerin signed on as president, and the fund aggressively pursued deals in Russia, Romania, Ukraine, China, and elsewhere.

The committee has intensely focused on China, particularly a 2017 deal between Hudson West III — an LLC Hunter Biden managed and invested in — and CEFC, a Chinese energy behemoth looking to sell American liquified natural gas to China.

President Biden, who had just finished his tenure as vice president under President Obama at the time, was involved in the deal, Comer told The Post last year.

“This is China trying to buy ownership into our American [energy] industry, which is a national security threat — and oh by the way it was being conducted by Joe Biden. That’s a problem and that’s why we’re concerned that this White House is compromised,” Comer said.

Unlike Archer and Heinz, Schwerin was deeply plugged into Vice President Biden’s orbit, records show.

On Nov. 17, 2010, Schwerin met with Biden in the West Wing — one of dozens of documented visits to the White House he made during the Obama/Biden years, according to visitor logs.

“He did financial stuff for the family but that’s really all I know,” Margaret Campbell, a former special assistant to Jill Biden, told The Post in April 2022.

Emails from Hunter Biden’s laptop show he also had access to then-Vice President Biden’s finances. Schwerin handled Joe Biden’s “Delaware tax refund check” and the two talked by phone.

“Your dad just called me [about his mortgage] and mentioned he’d be out a lot soon and not really back until Labor Day … He could use some positive news about his future earnings potential,” Schwerin wrote in a July 2010 email to Hunter Biden.

Schwerin previously met with the Oversight Committee in March to discuss furnishing documents. Committee Democrats said at the time Schwerin claimed “he was not aware of any involvement by President Biden in the financial conduct of the President’s relatives’ businesses.”

Republicans, however, disputed that characterization. His appearance in January will be his first transcribed interview.

Both Schwerin and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment from The Post.

FIVE QUESTIONS FOR SCHWERIN

1.

Hunter Biden has been indicted for allegedly dodging at least $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019. Is he guilty?

2. You made dozens of trips to the White House when Joe Biden was vice president. What was the purpose of these trips and what did you discuss?

3. You and Joe Biden exchanged at least 54 private emails when he was vice president. What were they about and why did he use a pseudonym?

5 Schwerin was deeply plugged into Vice President Biden’s orbit, records show. AP

4. Did you ever discuss anything about a foreign country, including issues relating to China, with Joe Biden?

5. Why did you have access to Joe Biden’s personal finances, including his tax returns and mortgage information?

6. Why was Hunter Biden placed on the board of Burisma in Ukraine? Why did the company slash his salary after Joe Biden left the vice presidency?

7. What was the purpose of the shell companies you set up for Hunter Biden and his family, who asked you to set them up, and how much money was involved?

8. How much money passed from Hunter Biden to his father, and why?"
62,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Megyn Kelly says Donald Trump has lost ‘multiple steps’ mentally,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/megyn-kelly-says-trump-has-lost-multiple-steps-mentally/,"Megyn Kelly said that former President Trump had lost “multiple steps” mentally and was no longer the same man he was in 2016.

The podcast host and former Fox News anchor said the 77-year-old former president was starting to show his age — and it wasn’t pretty.

“There’s no question Trump has lost a step or multiple steps,” Kelly told conservative commentator Glenn Beck Friday. “He is confusing Joe Biden for [Barack] Obama … I know he’s now saying he intentionally did that — go back and look at the clips, it wasn’t intentional.”

“The reference about how somebody is going to get us into World War II, confusing countries, confusing cities where he is, and it’s happening more and more,” she said.

“This is what happens when you’re 77-years-old. Trump seems inhuman, but he’s not inhuman. He’s a human. He’s a man,” Kelly continued. “DeSantis’ line about ‘Father Time spares no one,’ was a good one. So, look, if it’s between Trump and Biden, I don’t think there’s any question who’s more fit and more capable. But are we really going to pretend that Donald Trump is just as vibrant and mentally sharp as he was in ’16?”

The moment was immediately seized upon by Trump’s primary opponents — particularly Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who circulated the clip on X. Team DeSantis has tried to make hay of Trump’s age and has noted that ‘Father Time is undefeated’

Kelly and Trump have a long personal history dating to the 2016 presidential election. The former president famously dismissed her tough questions of him at the time by saying she had “blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever.“

Trump has repeatedly confused President Biden for Obama in recent public statements — but has insisted the slip-ups have been intentional.

“Whenever I sarcastically insert the name Obama for Biden as an indication that others may actually be having a very big influence in running our Country, Ron DeSanctimonious and his failing campaign apparatus, together with the Democrat’s Radical Left ‘Disinformation Machine,’ go wild saying that ‘Trump doesn’t know the name of our President, (CROOKED!) Joe Biden. He must be cognitively impaired,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post last month."

Two pairs of three-foot-long white socks worn by a revered leader in the Hasidic Jewish community brought in a haul of nearly $18,000 on eBay this week.

After an opening price of just 99 cents, socks worn by the late Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, the founder of the Satmar sect, sold for an impressive $11,600 on Sunday, after 88 bids.

Those amazing feet were followed by a second auction for another pair of Teitelbaum’s hose, which sold on Tuesday for $6,200 with 43 bids.

“Pair of long, white socks used by Rebbe Yoel Teitelbaum of Satmar,” the listing read. “Approx. 95 cm. Good condition. Stains.”

Teitelbaum died in 1979, and his stockings were handed down to his aide, Rabbi Mendel Greenberg, who subsequently gave them to Rabbi Leib Friedman of Lakewood, NJ, according to the listing.

A letter signed by Friedman confirmed the garments’ authenticity.

“There’s a lot of people buying stuff because . . . an item that a rabbi wore has something holy in it,” said David Knobloch, who runs Rarity Auction House in Spring Valley, NY, and handled the recent sales.

Many members of the Hasidic community splurge on prayer books and garments previously used by rabbinical leaders, which they might bust out on the high holidays or when attending weddings.

“They won’t wear it on a regular Monday … they’ll use it for special occasions,” said Brooklyn-based Judaica collector Israel Clapman, 37.

“In the Hasidic community, they’re not buying Ferraris or Bentleys, so rare Judaica is their way of flashing bling, of throwing money around.”"

Though Hamilton didn’t live to see his enemy’s final defeat at Waterloo, The Post cheered his downfall and brought coverage of his humiliation and exile on Saint Helena.

The books — for children as young as 3 — were prominently on display at the New York Public Library branch during “Read Palestine Week,” with several titles about Palestinians arranged in a “indigenous people’s” display with books about Native Americans.

“It’s pretty easy to understand what they’re doing. They are trying to connect between these two identities, and make Israel and Jews look as if we are colonizers and not indigenous to our land,” said Asaf Eyal, whose wife checked out the books on Dec. 3.

“Placing these books next to the Native American books is a very obvious move. The library manager created this display very purposely,” Eyal, 47, added.

Among the showcased books were “We’re in This Together,” a title by anti-Israel activist Linda Sarsour — which offered her view of the situation.

6 The Roosevelt Island branch of the New York Public Library put this display out last month.

“An international organization called the United Nations decided that Jewish people from Europe, many of whom had experienced the horrors and tragedies of the Holocaust, needed a safe place to live,” she wrote. “But there was one big problem: Palestinians had lived on that land for centuries.

“Of course, if someone took your land, you would do everything in your power to get it back. So, ever since their displacement, Palestinians and other people of Arab descent have been fighting back against this injustice,” she continued, failing to address decades of Palestinian terrorism.

“This is called intifada — the uprising against the Israeli Occupation of places where Palestinians have historically lived.”

Also on the list is “These Olive Trees,” about a Palestinian girl driven off her land by an unnamed “war” — an enemy depicted throughout the book with ghostly white hands snatching her things.

“To this day, Palestinians are being forcibly removed from their homes, as the occupying state slowly swallows the land in its entirety,” Aya Ghanameh writes in the author’s note.

When Eyal’s wife confronted a library employee about the display, the staffer accused Israel of being an “apartheid” state.

“It is the truth. [Palestinians] are indigenous to that land,” the employee told her, according to video obtained by The Post. “Publishers put out a call for read Palestine Week … It’s always a practice of the library to highlight a certain experience at a certain time.”

The New York Public Library was recently defaced by Hamas-loving protesters who painted red hands at the flagship Stephen A. Schwarzman building. The vandalism could cost up to $75,000 to clean up.

Critics said taxpayer-backed non-profits like the NYPL are promoting their own agendas.

“These institutions are basically saying we don’t care about the public, we are doing what we think is good for you regardless of what you think,” said Jay Greene, a senior research fellow at the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation. “They are imposing their agenda on others with other people’s money and that’s wrong.”

6 The New York Public Library condemned the display J.C. Rice

At an Upper West Side library this week, the Post observed “These Olive Trees” on display along with other woke titles including “If You’re a Drag Queen and You Know It” and “Hear My Voice: The Testimonies of Children Detained at the Southern Border of the United States.”

“Our libraries seem shamefully intent on propagandizing young people. Whether it’s gender confusion or pro-Palestine propaganda, it’s supremely disappointing to see New York City libraries pushing highly politicized content like these books, which are obviously designed to feed children a false narrative about Israel and the Gaza situation,” said Queens GOP Councilwoman Vickie Paladino. “These book displays should be removed immediately and those responsible must be held accountable.”

The NYPL officials condemned the Roosevelt Island display and said they “addressed” the issue with branch staff.

“The New York Public Library strives to present unbiased, objective perspectives and information for the public. These principles are the bedrock of our reputation as well as the trust the public has in us. This unacceptable display fell well short of these principles, which is especially distressing at a time when we are seeing a tragic rise in antisemitism,” a library spokeswoman said. “It is important to offer a range of perspectives for the patron, which is why this display fell so short. It was one-sided, and favored one perspective over another.”"
66,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Post’s critic panned ‘Napoleon’ movie, founder Alexander Hamilton panned the man",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/posts-critic-panned-napoleon-movie-alexander-hamilton-panned-leader/,"The Post recently panned Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” starring Joaquin Phoenix as “looney tunes” — an opinion largely unchanged from Post founder Alexander Hamilton’s assessment of the French leader 200 years ago.

The nation’s oldest continuously operating daily newspaper was established in the autumn of 1801.

The terror and anarchy of the French Revolution were mostly over and Napoleon was ruling France as first consul.

Alexander Hamilton and his Post successors were unequivocal in their distaste for the diminutive de-facto dictator:

“A Corsican has usurped the throne of [France]. Twenty-four millions are made to submit to the will of an obscure foreigner,” the paper wrote in December 1803, a year before Hamilton’s death.

“Suicides have become common. Murder is esteemed an amusement. Divorces daily take place,” the paper added in lurid descriptions of his misrule. “Fathers have poisoned their children, wives have murdered their husbands. Children have become parricides. Prostitutes are registered on the public records … Such is the present condition of the once flourishing France.”

Napoleon and his confederates had abandoned the principles of liberty and instead “planted the poisonous tree of despotism,” The Post wrote.

After treading gingerly in 1802, The Post’s reporting began to turn as the French ruler prepared for an invasion of England.

The coverage became sharply negative after he was crowned emperor at the end of 1804 and his armies fanned out across Europe.

“The touch of Napoleon is death,” The Post warned in July 1808. “When his arm shall be able to reach us . . . it would be madness to hope that the tyrant who has not only usurped the government of a subverted republic but has destroyed every republic on earth, except our own, would spare the United States.”

Over the years the paper unflinchingly bestowed several colorful sobriquets on the conquerer, including “the devil,” “the tyrant of Europe,” “the great bandit,” and “the great desolator,” while his armies were “like beasts of prey, devouring and destroying everything before them.”

By 1810, Napoleon was at the zenith of his powers and had imposed ferocious trade restrictions on the nations he occupied.

8 How do Alexander Hamilton and Napoleon stack up against each other?

The Post offered a furious condemnation — leaning into its Federalist free-market bonafides:

“The people will fight if it is necessary, but they will never submit again to be tied neck and heels and be kicked and cuffed by such fellows as Napoleon Bonaparte,” the paper thundered. “They will not submit to the commands of a foreign tyrant. They despise the threats of Napoleon the First as much as they do those of George the Third.”

Napoleon has committed “a series of unheard of frauds and perfidies, cruelties and crimes. Cruelties over which a Nero . . . would have wept, and crimes from the commission of which, even the soul of a Caligula would have recoiled,” the paper wrote in August 1810.

The Post’s coverage of the Battle of Waterloo came on Aug 2. 1815:

“IMPORTANT” blared the headline in all caps bringing news of the tyrant’s defeat. “The enemy fled in confusion leaving behind 150 cannons, with their ammunition, which fell into the hands of the Allies.”

The Post even carried a first-hand account of the battle, headlined “Defeat of Bonaparte,” from the Duke of Wellington, who led the victorious British forces.

Lord Andrew Roberts, author of a major new biography of Napoleon, said domestic US politics and Hamilton’s intense rivalry with Thomas Jefferson might have fueled the then-broadheet’s fire against the Frenchman.

“Jefferson — who was our second ambassador after Franklin — was considered very, very pro-French,” Roberts said.

Hamilton, the nation’s first Secretary of the Treasury, never met Napoleon and was killed in a duel by then-Vice President Aaron Burr in Weehawken, NJ, in July 1804.

In a curious twist of fate, Hamilton did have dinner with Napoleon’s playboy brother Jerome in 1804, according to his personal letters.

67,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Gambino mob hitman Anthony Senter paroled, set for 2024 release",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/gambino-mob-hitman-anthony-senter-paroled-set-for-2024-release/,"A “stone cold” Mafia hitman tied to at least 11 bodies, some of them dismembered, will be sprung from federal prison next year after serving just 35 years of a life sentence — outraging the families of his victims.

Former Gambino crime family button man Anthony Senter, 68, behind bars in Canaan, PA, was recently given the green light for release by the U.S. Parole Commission.

“The Commission determined that he had substantially observed the rules of the institution and that his release in June 2024 would not jeopardize the public welfare,” a Department of Justice spokeswoman told The Post.

But that’s a far cry from how federal authorities once viewed Senter, who was sentenced to life plus 20 years in 1989 after being convicted for participating in at least 11 murders.

Senter, along with six other mobsters, was also hit with racketeering charges, including narcotics trafficking, auto theft, loan sharking and extortion.

Senter was a member of a mob crew working under Roy DeMeo, a Gambino made man.

The crew operated out of the Gemini Lounge at 4021 Flatlands Ave. in Flatlands, Brooklyn, where many of their murders were committed during the 1970s and 1980s.

Federal and city authorities traced at least 75 deaths and disappearances to DeMeo’s crew — and independent researchers put their brutal toll at more than 200.

Rudy Giuliani, the then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York who initially brought the case against Senter and 20 other Gambino family members and associates — including then-godfather “Big Paul” Castellano — was astonished by the parole decision.

Senter “should die in jail,” Giuliani declared. “He displayed, without exaggeration, wanton disregard for human life.

“He was a stone-cold killer who liked to kill,” the former prosecutor said. “And I believe he liked to participate in some ways in the dismemberment of the bodies that took place afterwards.”

The “Gemini Method“

The Canarsie-born Senter was the son of Italian immigrants who had anglicized their original family name of Sente.

He and another crew member, longtime pal Joseph Testa, spent so much time in their boss DeMeo’s gin-mill hangout that they became known as the Gemini Twins.

“Gemini Lounge everybody knew was a house of horrors, don’t go in there, you might not come out,” recalled Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, who grew up playing stickball with Senter in Canarsie.

The future killer was widely known around the neighborhood as a hothead.

“He truly could flip the script — he could be having a conversation with you, and then all of a sudden one little thing would set him off,” Sliwa said. “Oftentimes Joey Testa would have to calm him down.”

DeMeo, who worked as a butcher’s apprentice before launching his criminal career, used his early training to devise a grisly murder procedure — later dubbed “the Gemini Method” — that Senter and the others gleefully followed.

Former gang member Dominick Mantigilio testified in Senter’s trial that those targeted for death would first be lured to an apartment-turned-abbatoir next to the Gemini Lounge that had been rented by mobster Joseph “Dracula” Guglielmo.

“When the [victim] would walk in, somebody would shoot him in the head with a silencer,” Mantigilio told the court. “Somebody would wrap a towel around to stop the blood and somebody would stab him in the heart to stop the blood from pumping.”

Crew members — often clad only in their underwear, to avoid staining their clothes — would drag the corpse into the shower and let it bleed out, like a hog in a slaughterhouse.

Then they would “pull him out, put him on a pool liner in the living room, take him apart, and package him,” Mantigilio said matter-of-factly.

The bloodless body parts were placed in cardboard boxes and taken to Brooklyn’s Fountain Avenue landfill — now Shirley Chisholm State Park in Canarsie — where they were buried under mounds of trash and lost forever.

Senter and his gang “engaged in wholesale murder,” U.S. Assistant Attorney Walter Mack said during their 17-month trial in 1988 and 1989 — committing “the most violent” crimes ever tried in a New York federal court, the prosecutor claimed.

Golden Years

The DeMeo crew’s heyday, from 1975 to 1983, spanned the final decade of the New York Mafia’s “golden years,” said historian Selwyn Raab.

“The New York families ran the country, ran the Mafia in the U.S.,” said Raab, author of the definitive mob chronicle “Five Families.”

“The Gambinos and the Genovese were the two largest and most powerful families,” Raab explained. The Gambino family, headed by Castellano, had about 100 official members, or “made men,” like DeMeo.

11 Castellano was publicly gunned down outside Midtown’s Sparks Steak House on Dec. 16, 1985, along with his driver and bodyguard Thomas Bilotti. Courtesy of the FBI

But “each made man had probably 10 people who worked for him,” Raab said — “associates” like Senter and Testa.

The sprawling structure made it possible for Castellano to maintain plausible deniability of the blood-drenched activities of the family’s associates, even while scoring $20,000 a week in cash from the lucrative luxury car-theft ring run by DeMeo and crew.

In January 1983, shortly after DeMeo was served with a grand-jury subpoena to testify in a federal racketeering case, his bullet-riddled body was found frozen in the trunk of his own Cadillac — rubbed out, investigators later learned, by members of his own crew.

DeMeo’s death did not halt the case.

In March 1984, Giuliani indicted Castellano, along with Senter and others, on a raft of racketeering charges, including drug trafficking, extortion and murder.

11 The Post reported Castellano’s death as front-page news on Dec. 17, 1985.

Eighteen months later, as the trial dragged on, Castellano himself was slain in a notorious public hit on the sidewalk outside Sparks Steak House in Midtown Manhattan, ordered by the man who would succeed him as Gambino family boss: John Gotti Jr.

Senter, then 30, emulated the style of the rising “Dapper Don” during his trial.

The “devilishly handsome” defendant, a Post fashion reporter wrote at the time, took care to display his “cool elegance” in Giorgio Armani suits and ties and “impeccable white shirts” whenever he appeared in court.

“You want to look good,” Senter smirked.

Scores of Victims

Most of the DeMeo crew’s scores of confirmed and suspected victims were rival gangsters, but not all.

Two of the murders that sent Senter to prison were those of Charles Mongitore and Daniel Scutaro, workers at a Brooklyn auto body shop.

Mongitore, 30, was pressing charges after being stabbed by the son of a Gambino family soldier in a personal dispute. On June 5, 1980, the DeMeo crew attacked Mongitore at his workplace, shooting him 14 times at close range and slitting his throat.

Soon after, Scutaro, 25, arrived at the body shop to start his workday — only to find the gangsters cleaning up the scene of the crime.

He too was gunned down.

Both victims were later discovered in the trunk of a car, Newsday reported.

11 Senter (left), then serving his life-plus-20-years sentence in a federal prison in Lompoc, Calif., posed with visitor Kevin Kelly in 1990.

In 1977, Senter and Testa shot and killed Cherie Golden after her boyfriend became a federal informant.

While Golden and Testa were chatting outside the lounge, Senter shot the woman twice in the back of the head, and once again in the face as her body whiplashed on the way to the ground, according to “Murder Machine,” a 1993 book about the DeMeo crew by Gene Mustaine and Jerry Capeci.

Jerome Hofaker was just 23 when he was killed outside his girlfriend’s home in 1977 by Testa and Senter after getting into a fight with one of Testa’s brothers, Mustaine and Capeci wrote.

Senter was never charged in Golden’s or Hofaker’s murders.

“We knew it was mob related,” cousin Denise Hofaker, 69, told The Post. “What I remember is being at the funeral and my aunt turning to me with fear in her eyes and saying, ‘Oh my God, what are we doing here?’ She was nervous that somebody would come after us.”

Hofaker was appalled by news of Senter’s impending release.

“That would be horrible,” she said. “From what I understood he had gotten a life sentence. He is 68. That’s not a life. He has an awful lot of life to live, and that’s not right.”"

Margalit, 77, was abducted, along with his horses, to Gaza. On Dec. 1, the Israeli military announced that Churchill had been murdered by the terror group while in captivity.

Only a day earlier, Churchill’s daughter Nili, 41, returned home from Gaza as part of the seventh tranche of released hostages in the temporary truce deal brokered with Hamas.

More than a quarter of Nir Oz’s 427 residents were either murdered or kidnapped on Black Shabbat, as it is known locally.

Of those, 31 are still in captivity in Gaza, including Kfir Bibas, the red-haired baby who, at 11 months old, has become a symbol of the hostage crisis as the youngest abductee.

The IDF announced last week that seven hostages had died while in captivity, four of whom — including Margalit — were from Nir Oz.

Life goes on for Margalit’s cowshed and on the day that his death was announced, a new calf was born.

The freshly delivered bovine isn’t the only sign of new life emerging from the devastation.

Last week saw new potato saplings planted and avocado harvests with volunteers from across Israel arriving at the fields to lend a hand.

The once-bucolic kibbutz, which lies only a mile from the border with Gaza, has 6 acres of farmland and is known for its potatoes, pomegranate, wheat, and peanut exports.

An oasis of green in the arid climes of the western Negev desert, the kibbutz is an ecological marvel and home to 900 species of flora.

Since the onset of the Second Intifada in 2001, Nir Oz — which was established in 1955 — has been plagued by rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza.

These attacks intensified significantly in both number and frequency after Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and Hamas subsequently took over the Strip in a bloody coup.

Still, kibbutz residents say that it was a price they were willing to pay for what they believed was a patch of heaven on earth.

“It was 99% paradise and 1% hell,” Benny Avital, a member of Nir Oz’s rapid response team, told The Post outside a row of burned-out houses on the kibbutz. “They [fire rockets] at us, we escape with the kids, sometimes for a few days or a couple of months, and then we come back and have quiet for a bit.

“But after that Saturday, it’s 1% paradise and 99% hell.”

Each of the nearly 20 communities targeted in the Oct. 7 massacre experienced the attack differently, leading to varied responses and differing perspectives about both rehabilitation and the possibility of returning.

In the case of Nir Oz, IDF forces took hours to arrive, leaving the terrorists to carry out an extended, systemic strategy of killing on sight, home invasions, and attempts to breach safe rooms.

When, in some cases, those attempts failed, terrorists set fire to Nir Oz homes, leaving residents with a terrible choice: face suffocation or confront the attackers.

According to Avital, who threw a wet towel on his head and ran into houses rescuing several dozen survivors, of the 700 Palestinians to enter the Kibbutz that day, only 150 were actual armed militants.

The rest were civilian men, women and children.

It later emerged that some of those civilians had taken kibbutz members hostage.

The relentlessness of the violence on October 7th is why many residents — Avital included — cannot answer whether they will eventually return to the kibbutz.

“We don’t want to think about it right now. There are still a lot of people kidnapped and the situation in Gaza is unknown,” Avital says. “We cannot continue living here when they are over there.”

Renana Gome Yaakov, whose children Yagil, 12, and Or Yaakov, 16, were returned to Israel on November 27 after enduring horrific abuse in Gaza for 54 days, including being branded by terrorists using motorbike exhaust pipes, said that for now, going back was not on the cards.

“Can you imagine bringing the children back to the house they were kidnapped from,” Gomeh Yaakov told The Post.

Nevertheless, a tentative plan for the eventual return to Nir Oz is already in place.

For the next month, the community will continue staying in a hotel in the Red Sea tourist resort of Eilat where they were evacuated after the massacre.

The resort town — which hugs Israel’s border with both Egypt and Jordan — has doubled its population since the war began, housing more than 60,000 of Israel’s estimated 300,000 evacuees.

A converted field school in Eilat has been transformed into a school for 600 children from Nir Oz and other battered Gaza envelope communities.

The hotel itself, which is sandwiched between a popular coral reef diving spot and the red Negev mountains, has undergone several modifications to adapt to its new function.

A dozen tents have been erected next to the pools, for everything from makeshift preschools to massage clinics and art therapy spaces.

In the beginning, clowns and singers were brought in an attempt to lift the mood, but according to Irit Lahav, the daughter of Nir Oz founders who has taken on the unofficial role of kibbutz spokeswoman, it didn’t feel right.

“There’s too much sadness,” she said.

Late into the night, the hotel lobby transforms into a gathering place where survivors, plagued by insomnia, swap stories of that fateful day.

Lahav’s own life – and that of her 22-year-old daughter, Lotus – was saved after she jammed an oar to block the handle of the safe door from being opened.

“Here we sit and cry,” she said, motioning towards the opulent lobby, which overlooks several swimming pools and meticulously groomed gardens.

After their sojourn in Eilat, the community, which Lahav said hopes to remain together, will relocate to newly constructed apartment blocks in the southern Israeli city of Kiryat Gat where they are expected to remain for eight months.

Relocating to high-rise apartments in a city setting is not ideal, Lahav said and would represent a significant shift for the kibbutz residents who are accustomed to large, open spaces, their own private homes, and a communal way of life.

According to the plan, the community will receive a kindergarten on an adjacent street. School-aged children will attend school in Gat, a nearby kibbutz.

The move is being done in conjunction with the Tekuma Authority — the governmental body tasked with rehabilitating the Gaza envelope region — and is partially funded by American Jewish groups.

Jewish communities in the US have also been matched with evacuated Israeli communities, with Chicago adopting Nir Oz. Similar efforts are underway for other Gaza-area communities hard-hit by Hamas.

Residents of Be’eri, for instance, have been relocated to resorts along the Dead Sea while those from Kfar Aza are in a hotel along Israel’s central Mediterranean coast.

The Nir Oz community will be housed for the better part of a year in Kiryat Gat.

During that time, a temporary settlement composed of trailers known as caravillas — a portmanteau of the words caravan and villa — will be built for the community in the Negev region, likely Irit near Lahav, a kibbutz some 60 miles east of Nir Oz.

According to the current plan, the community will remain in the caravillas for around two years.

Afterward, Lahav noted, and contingent upon a huge number of factors, the question of returning to their cherished kibbutz may have a more definitive answer.

“Will I come back and take the risk again? Right now I cannot even think about next week. I love this place. I love the fields, I love the people. But it’s too scary.” Lahav, who accompanied The Post on a tour of the smoldering ruins of the kibbutz, said.

Ron Bahat, 57, who grew up with Lahav in the kibbutz’s collective children’s home, has a different attitude and has already returned to Nir Oz.

“I came back because it’s home,” he said. But Bahat remains an anomaly.

For now, the most urgent priority is to ensure the kibbutz, and its output doesn’t collapse entirely.

The unit has crossed off 200 tasks a day towards that end, everything from scrubbing the surviving houses from blood to treating traumatized dogs to harvesting crops.

“One child requested that we feed his fish so we have soldiers doing that,” Boms said.

“Almost from day one, we were tasked with rebuilding. This is what we do. They tear down, we build. They won’t break our spirits.”"

Little Taryn Louis-Jean allegedly called 911 around 9:30 a.m., shortly after the school day began at Horizon Academy in Marion Oaks, located roughly 70 miles northwest of Orlando.

“Help, there is a school shooter walking through the hallway,” Louis-Jean can be heard not-so-convincingly telling a dispatcher in the released call.

When pressed for basic details — including what school he is claiming to be trapped in — Louis-Jean stutters and hesitates without giving up his location.

“He’s coming, he’s coming,” the boy says before hanging up the line.

Dispatchers rushed every available deputy to the middle school, which went under an immediate lockdown despite no indication a gunman was stalking through the building.

SWAT and Aviation teams, as well as several nearby state and federal law enforcement agencies arrived at the scene in anticipation of yet another tragic mass shooting at an educational institution.

Law enforcement cleared the scene just two hours later — finding no assailants or weapons, but rattled students and faculty whose “fear levels were visible.”

Investigators traced the 911 call to a student’s cell phone, which Louis-Jean allegedly snatched to make the call.

“Louis-Jean told his friend he wanted to go home early, and when that same friend left his cell phone unattended when he went to the clinic, Louis-Jean used the phone to call 911 to report an active shooter,” the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

“All of this was a prank.”

The 11-year-old was arrested and charged with making a false report of a mass shooting, utilizing a two-way communication device to facilitate a felony, disrupting a school function and misuse of a 911 emergency system.

The punishment was not too harsh for the young child, according to Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods, especially considering the overwhelming response to the hoax call.

“The law requires that any person who makes these types of false reports pay restitution for the cost of the law enforcement response, which, in this case, will equal hundreds upon hundreds of man-hours. This young man is going to need to mow a lot of lawns to pay that bill,” Woods said in a statement."
70,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"UPenn’s Jewish students still subjected to ‘anger and aggression,’ protesters chanting ‘we are Hamas’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/jewish-upenn-students-subjected-to-chants-of-we-are-hamas/,"The University of Pennsylvania campus is a hotbed of antisemitism, with students openly chanting, “We are Hamas,” and others accused of hate-motivated crimes still allowed in class, The Post has learned.

Students Eyal Yakoby and Jordan Davis this week filed a lawsuit claiming Penn broke federal civil rights law and selectively enforces its rules to “avoid protecting Jewish students from hatred and harassment.”

Yakoby, 21, claimed to The Post there are still “professors and students” at the university who he says are “openly antisemitic.”

“It’s madness — they’re still coming to class and employed by Penn,” he said. “We had one student who was back in class last Monday while facing [criminal] charges.

“I think it’s absolutely despicable and a failure of the university.

“I’m calling for anyone who violates school policies to be held accountable just like they would anything else.”

President Liz Magill told a congressional hearing Tuesday the university has formed an antisemitism task force, but her job hangs in the balance after she refused to say at the hearing calling for genocide against Jewish people violated the school’s code of conduct.

Tara Tarawneh, a 20-year-old college junior was still attending class this week, according to sources, despite praising terror group Hamas for its “glorious Oct. 7” terror attack on Israel which left 1,200 dead and over 200 more Israelis taken hostage.

10 University of Pennsylvania student Tara Tarawneh, who is from Jordan, has been identified as the woman who gave a fiery speech at a pro-Palestinian rally last month praising the Hamas terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Artmejo

She was also arrested for allegedly stealing an Israeli flag from the front of a Campus Apartments house near the Ivy League school.

Tarawneh has since been charged with theft and receiving stolen property, according to court documents viewed by The Post.

She did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Post, while her attorney Grace Harris said she was “not interested in talking” and also declined to speak. UPenn also did not return calls or emails Friday.

10 “I remember feelings so empowered and happy,” Tarawneh said at the rally about Hamas’ terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7.

Tarawneh, a 2020 graduate of King’s Academy in Madaba, Jordan — has been open in her views, with video of her addressing a pro-Palestinian crowd going viral.

“I remember feelings so empowered and happy, so confident that victory was near and so tangible,” she told a crowd about the monstrous Oct. 7 attack, as reported by the Daily Pennsylvanian, Penn’s independent student-run media organization.

“I want all of you to hold that feeling in your hearts. Never let go of it.”

10 Tarawneh praised the “joyful and powerful images which came from the glorious October 7” Hamas attack during her controversial speech at a rally in Philadelphia.

On Friday, bioengineering student Liam Pharr, 21, said he believes terrorism has taken root at the Ivy League college after witnessing students chanting, “We are Hamas” — designated a terrorist organization by the US, EU, UK and many others — on UPenn grounds.

“I’m not Jewish but there is absolutely antisemitism on campus,” Pharr told The Post. “A couple of weeks ago, there was a group on campus who joined hands and chanted, ‘We are Hamas.’ I was in the library and I heard it.

“It’s crazy the kind of s–t people can say on campus and get away with it. A terrorist organization has infiltrated a place where the next generation is getting the best education they possibly can,” he continued.

“I’ve seen social media posts circulating of Jewish students holding an Israel flag in peaceful protest, with the caption ‘remember their faces, they’ll be on the wrong side of history’.”

Meanwhile, the campus has seen shocking incidents including graffiti calling for “intifada” meaning “uprising,” “Avenge Gaza” and, sickeningly, “The Jews R Nazis” scrawled on a building next to a Jewish fraternity.

Students on campus are also getting creeped out by mysterious “outsiders” joining pro-Palestine demonstrations.

Nursing student Sam Graybill, 18, said she has also noticed a rising tide of aggression towards Jews among the student body both on campus and online and spotted older non-students at rallies on campus.

“There is a decent amount of antisemitism,” Graybill told The Post. “Some people here are super aggressive towards Jewish people. There’s a protest every few days. There is a lot of anger and aggression.

“Some people who aren’t students here will come and start protests. They’re older, not grandpa old, but they just genuinely look a lot older than most students,” she added.

“A bunch of my friends are Jewish and they worry about their safety on campus. I’d estimate 40% of antisemitism is on campus and 60% is online.”

Her thoughts were echoed by Alkaid Zeng, 23, who also said he’d noticed older people joining in the crowds at protests.

“There’s a lot of outrage from both sides,” Zeng said Friday on campus. “There are protests every other day. The people taking part in the protests are faculty, students and outside people coming in.”

Zeng said he believes the university leadership is virtue signaling without truly caring for its students.

“We receive emails on a daily basis from the president, the chancellors and deans of the various schools saying they’re listening to students’ voices but they’re being very careful not to take sides,” he said.

“The administration is not showing they care. The students are not seeing there is much care or empathy from the administration,” Zeng added.

“Even if they cannot do much, they could at least show they care.”

A letter from 74 members of Congress has called for Magill and the presidents of MIT and Harvard to resign following their appearance at the congressional committee this week.

10 College campuses — including at other Ivy League schools such as Columbia, Cornell, Yale and Harvard — have been hotbeds for disturbing anti-Israel protests. Robert Miller

In addition, the board of UPenn’s prestigious Wharton Business School have said they have lost confidence in the university’s leadership, while numerous donors have pulled millions in funding for the college.

“It’s absolutely preposterous that the head of the university says it’s completely OK to make statements calling for a large portion of the student base to be killed,” Pharr told The Post.

“Based on her statements, I think she should go. You can say what’s happening to the Palestinians is wrong, but you can’t say people should be killed,” he added. “The school is not supporting Jewish students.

“There was no statement even condemning Hamas until the Huntsman family said they’d pull their funding. Only when there’s money involved do they do anything.”

Still, Magill remained president as of Friday night and a spokesperson for the school told CNN there is no immediate plan to replace her.

10 The Ivy League campus was also heavily criticized even before the Oct. 7 terror attack for holding a Palestine Writes literature festival. Robert Miller

UPenn is facing increasing pressure to change its leadership, from major donors to those on its own staff — and even from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.

The governor, who is Jewish, called Magill’s testimony “shameful” and urged the board of trustees to meet to decide whether her statements were in line with the school’s values."

The Tulare County District Attorney’s Office said this week that, according to research, Peter Park is the youngest person to pass the exam.

The State Bar said Friday in an email to The Associated Press that it could not confirm that Park is the youngest, but it hailed his achievement.

“Passing the California Bar exam is a major accomplishment at any age, and for someone as young as Mr. Park, it is quite an extraordinary feat and one worth celebrating,” Executive Director Leah Wilson said.

Park took the exam in July and received the test results on Nov. 9, according to a news release issued by the District Attorney’s office this week.

“It was not easy, but it was worth it,” Park said in a statement.

Park began high school at Oxford Academy in Cypress, California, in 2019 at age 13 and simultaneously began a four-year juris doctor program at the Northwestern California University School of Law after completing college-level proficiency exams, the office said.

Park took the exam in July and received the test results on Nov. 9, according to a news release issued by the District Attorney’s office this week. AP

Park graduated high school in 2021 by taking the state’s high school proficiency exam and focused on law school, graduating this year.

He became a law clerk for the District Attorney’s office in August, turned 18 in late November and was sworn in as an attorney on Tuesday."

Frank Rubio, NASA Astronaut and US Army Lieutenant Colonel, became a pioneer when he grew and harvested one of the first tomatoes ever grown in space in March of this year.

But when it inexplicably went missing one day, people assumed he had eaten it.

“I was pretty confident that I velcroed it where I was supposed to velcro it,” he said during a NASA briefing after his time in space. “And then I came back, and it was gone.”

Rubio had just achieved the longest single spaceflight by an American, having been in low orbit around the Earth for 371 days.

“Rubio’s journey in space embodies the essence of exploration,” a NASA statement read, graciously forgiving Rubio for losing the fruit.

Rubio grew the tomato on the International Space Station, a modular space station that collaborates with space agencies across the US, Japan, Europe, Russia and Canada.

The microgravity on the ship means that unrestrained items will often float away without control.

Rubio suspected that this happened with the tomato.

“I spent so many hours looking for that thing,” he said.

“I wanted to find it mostly so I could prove like I did not eat the tomato.”

“I’m sure the desiccated tomato will show up at some point and vindicate me, years in the future.”

Fortunately, he only had to wait a little over two months.

Members of the ISS revealed they had found it during a Wednesday stream celebrating the 25th anniversary of the station.

“Our good friend Frank Rubio … has been blamed for quite a while for eating the tomato. But we can exonerate him,” said astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli, who had arrived at the station in August.

The state of the tomato was not confirmed."

Fighting escalated and the Palestinian death toll rose on Friday, with Israel pounding the enclave from north to south in an expanded phase of the two-month-old war against the Islamist group Hamas.

Decrying a “spiraling humanitarian nightmare”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres declared that nowhere in Gaza was safe for civilians, hours before the US vetoed a Security Council resolution backed by the vast majority of its members calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.

The vote left Washington diplomatically isolated on the 15-member council.

Thirteen members voted in favor of the draft resolution put forward by the United Arab Emirates, while Britain abstained.

Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told the council: “We do not support this resolution’s call for an unsustainable ceasefire that will only plant the seeds for the next war.”

The United States and Israel oppose a ceasefire, saying it would only benefit Hamas, which Israel has vowed to annihilate in response to the militants’ deadly Oct. 7 cross-border rampage.

Washington instead supports “pauses” like the seven-day halt in fighting that saw Hamas release some hostages and the humanitarian aid flow increase.

The deal broke down on Dec. 1.

Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour told the council the vote means that “millions of Palestinian lives hang in the balance.”

Ezzat El-Reshiq, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, condemned the US veto as “inhumane.”

Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan said in a statement: “A ceasefire will be possible only with the return of all the hostages and the destruction of Hamas.”

In Washington, the White House on Friday said more could be done by Israel to reduce civilian casualties and the US shared international concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

“We certainly all recognize more can be done to try to reduce civilian casualties,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.

On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken sharpened Washington’s language, saying it was imperative that Israel took steps to safeguard Gaza’s civilian population.

“And there does remain a gap between…the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground,” he told a press conference.

Describing the situation as “at a breaking point,” Guterres said the collapse of Gaza’s humanitarian system could result in a complete breakdown of public order.

Most Gazans are now displaced, hospitals overrun and food running out.

Residents and the Israeli military both reported intensified fighting in both northern areas, where Israel had previously said its troops had largely completed their tasks last month, and in the south where they mounted a new assault this week.

DEATH TOLL

Gaza’s health ministry reported 350 people killed on Thursday, and on Friday it said the death toll from Israel’s campaign in Gaza had risen to 17,487.

More strikes were reported on Friday in Khan Younis in the south, the Nusseirat camp in the centre and Gaza City in the north.

On Friday evening, residents reported intensified Israeli tank fire in north Gaza, while health officials said at least 10 people were killed in an air strike on a house in Khan Younis.

Israel’s military said 94 Israeli soldiers had been killed fighting in Gaza since its ground invasion of the densely populated enclave began in mid-October in retaliation for Hamas’ rampage in southern Israel in which terrorists killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages.

Since the Israeli military campaign began, most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, and residents say it has become almost impossible to find refuge.

Israel says it is providing details about which areas are safe and that Hamas is to blame for harm to civilians because it operates among them, an accusation the Islamist group denies.

Hamas reported the most intense clashes with Israeli forces were taking place in the north in Shejaia, as well as in the south in Khan Younis, where Israeli forces reached the heart of the enclave’s second-biggest city on Wednesday.

Israel’s chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel had detained more than 200 suspects from Gaza in the last 48 hours and dozens were taken to Israel for questioning.

Reuters journalists in southern Gaza have seen dead and wounded swamping the main Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, where there was no room on the floor on Friday for arriving patients sprawled across blood-smeared tiles.

With the fighting now going on in all directions, there was no place left to flee, said Yamen, sheltering at a school in central Gaza with his family.

“Inside the school is like outside it: the same feeling of fear of near death, the same suffering of starvation,” he said."
74,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Ex-model who appeared in hit Aerosmith music video arrested for attempted rape: police,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/aerosmith-music-video-model-dean-kelly-arrested-over-attempted-rape-police/,"A former male model, who appeared in the music video for Aerosmith’s hit song “Crazy” in 1994, was arrested and charged with attempted rape earlier this week, meeting the women through dating apps, according to a report.

Dean Kelly, 52, was nabbed by police and booked on attempted third-degree rape and sexual battery charges stemming from an incident from October, the New Orleans Police Department announced on Thursday.

Kelly rose to fame for his cameo in the band’s music video where he played a young, shirtless farmer tilling farmland in a tractor, starring alongside actress Alicia Silverstone and frontman Steven Tyler’s daughter, Liv.

A woman alleged in court documents obtained by WDSU that she met Kelly through a dating app and claimed he used a fake name and didn’t look like his photos before he allegedly assaulted her.

The former model turned predator is being held at the Orleans Parish Justice Center on $1.1 million bond and also received charges for failing to register as a sex offender and failing to notify of sex offender, jail records show.

The arrest is the latest in a string of legal problems for Kelly as he has faced several other similar arrests over the past decade.

Kelly was issued a 10-year suspended sentence and five years of probation for sexual battery and felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile in 2014, according to NOLA.com.

He was later sentenced to prison when a New Orleans judge ruled Kelly violated his terms of probation including not using aliases on social media and having to register all phones he used, the outlet reported at the time.

Kelly has also been accused of raping a 14-year-old and 17-year-old girl in two separate incidents in 2005, according to NOLA.com.

4 The music video, which was remastered and published on YouTube in 2009, has been viewed over 661 million times, but was one of the most requested videos on MTV’s when it was first released. FOX 8

He was charged with forcible rape and felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile, second-degree kidnapping and possession of child pornography, but took an Alford plea where he did not plead guilty but acknowledged there was evidence against him.

Two years after his imprisonment in 2014, Kelly was charged with trying to hire a fellow inmate to kill former New Orleans District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro along with the judge who worked the case and his defense attorney, the now Orleans Parish District Attorney, Jason Williams.

Kelly pleaded guilty to threatening a public official, and handed a 6-month suspended jail sentence and two years of probation.

Samuel Haskell IV, 35, was bare-chested, wearing an anti-suicide smock around his waist, and holding a bag with a small milk carton as he stood in front of a judge and was told he would continue to be held without bail, according to ABC 7.

A court deputy explained the accused murderer’s Velcro straps came undone before his court appearance, allowing it to slip down exposing his tattooed upper body, according to the Daily Mail.

Haskell IV’s arraignment was postponed to Jan. 12, 2024.

The delay in his arraignment comes as the California man made a last-minute switch to his defense team.

Haskell IV had been represented by Beverly Hills defense attorney Bob Schwartz until two days ago, according to the Los Angeles Times.

His new attorney, Joseph Weimoritz, did not enter a plea on his behalf and requested a continuance of the hearing as he stood separated from his client by a glass partition.

It remains unclear why he made the change.

In a previous court appearance in mid-November, Haskell IV’s arraignment was postponed, and he was ordered to be held without bail.

The alleged killer lived in the Tarzana neighborhood with his wife, Mei Li Haskell, 37, and their three young children, as well as with her parents, dad Gaoshan Li, 72, and mom Yanxiang Wang, 64.

Mei Li and her parents were last seen around Nov. 6, the California District Attorney’s office said.

On Nov. 7, Haskell IV allegedly hired four-day laborers to haul off several heavy black plastic trash bags from the six-bedroom Tarzana home, speculated to be containing body parts.

He allegedly told the workers the 50-pound bags contained rocks, but the suspicious men stopped their truck a block away from his home and made the disturbing discovery.

The day laborers returned the bags and money, with the son of the prominent Hollywood executive allegedly telling them they were Halloween props, according to an interview with KNBC.

Those bags disappeared before police could get their hands on them, officials said.

Police visited Haskell’s IV’s home after the day laborers reported they had been asked to remove suspicious bags.

Responding officers found no evidence at the scene and were forced to leave.

However, a dismembered torso, believed to have belonged to his wife, Mei Li, turned up in a dumpster miles away from their home the next day by a homeless man.

Haskell IV was caught on video allegedly dumping an apparent body in the dumpster, authorities said.

When police went to his home a second time, they brought a search warrant and allegedly found evidence of a horrible crime.

“Once officers made entry, what was discovered was evidence of a crime, including some blood evidence and other items that I’m not going to provide at this point,” LAPD Detective Efren Gutierrez said at the time.

Haskell IV was arrested at a shopping mall nearby and was charged with his wife’s and in-laws’ murders on Nov. 8.

The remains of Wang and Li, Chinese nationals who lived with the couple and their three grandchildren, have not been found.

The couple’s children are currently in the custody of relatives.

The elder Haskell had represented an illustrious list of stars, including George Clooney, Dolly Parton, Whoopi Goldberg — and even King Charles’ brother Prince Edward.

If convicted on all three counts of murder, Haskell IV faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole."

The order by the all-Republican court came more than 30 hours after Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, received a temporary restraining order from a lower court judge that prevents Texas from enforcing the state’s ban in her case.

In a one-page order, the court said it was temporarily staying Thursday’s ruling “without regard to the merits.”

The case is still pending.

“While we still hope that the Court ultimately rejects the state’s request and does so quickly, in this case we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox.

Cox’s attorneys have said they will not share her abortion plans, citing concerns for her safety.

In a filing with the Texas Supreme Court on Friday, her attorneys indicated she was still pregnant.

Cox was 20 weeks pregnant this week when she filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind since the landmark US Supreme Court ruling last year that overturned Roe v. Wade.

The order issued Thursday only applied to Cox and no other pregnant Texas women.

Cox learned she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later that her baby was at high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low survival rates, according to her lawsuit.

Furthermore, doctors have told Cox that if the baby’s heartbeat were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her two prior cesarean sections and that another C-section at full term would endanger her ability to carry another child.

Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox does not meet the criteria for a medical exception to the state’s abortion ban, and he urged the state’s highest court to act swiftly.

“Future criminal and civil proceedings cannot restore the life that is lost if Plaintiffs or their agents proceed to perform and procure an abortion in violation of Texas law,” Paxton’s office told the court.

He also warned three hospitals in Houston that they could face legal consequences if they allowed Cox’s physician to provide the abortion, despite the ruling from state District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, who Paxton called an “activist” judge.

On Friday, a pregnant Kentucky woman also filed a lawsuit demanding the right to an abortion. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is about eight weeks pregnant and she wants to have an abortion in Kentucky but cannot legally do so because of the state’s ban, the suit said.

Unlike Cox’s lawsuit, the Kentucky challenge seeks class-action status to include other Kentuckians who are or will become pregnant and want to have an abortion."
77,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"New Yorkers don’t need to disclose social media accounts to carry a firearm, federal court rules",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/new-yorkers-dont-need-to-disclose-social-media-accounts-to-carry-a-firearm-federal-court-rules/,"New Yorkers don’t have to give state officials a list of their social media accounts in order to apply for concealed carry permits, a federal appeals court ruled Friday, striking down portions of the Empire State’s 2022 gun law.

The 261-page ruling, handed down by a three-judge panel on the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, also blocked New York from enforcing restrictions on carrying concealed firearms on private property that is accessible to the public, as well as restriction on carrying in houses of worship.

“Disclosing one’s social media accounts — including ones that are maintained pseudonymously — forfeits anonymity in that realm. Conditioning a concealed carry license on such a disclosure imposes a burden on the right to bear arms that is without sufficient analogue in our nation’s history or tradition of firearms regulation,” the judges wrote in their ruling, referencing a standard set by the Supreme Court in last year’s New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen case, which overturned the state’s century-old law restricting the carrying of concealed firearms.

3 The panel judges ruled that lower courts erred in previously striking down New York’s “good moral character” clause, arguing that the requirement is consistent with the nation’s historical traditions of gun regulation. tawanlubfah

New York’s “Concealed Carry Improvement Act” had required gun license applicants to submit a list of former and current social media accounts, from the past three years, to state officials for review.

However, other aspects of the law were allowed to remain in place, including a requirement that applicants demonstrate “good moral character” and list household and family members on a license application.

New York will also be allowed to enforce concealed carry bans in “sensitive places,” such as theaters, bars, and public parks.

3 New York Attorney General Letitia James called the provisions of the gun law that the court left intact “critical” for keeping New Yorkers safe. designer491

“Governor Hochul and her cabal in Albany never seem to get the message, and in turn, [Gun Owners of America] is proud to have played a major role in rebuking her unconstitutional law. Nevertheless, this was not a total victory, and we will continue the fight until this entire law is sent to the bowels of history where it belongs,” Erich Pratt, the senior vice president of Gun Owners of America, a prominent gun rights group, said in a statement.

Sam Paredes, a member of the board of directors for the Gun Owners Foundation, expressed frustration that the court allowed the “good moral character” provision to remain in place and indicated that his group may seek relief from the Supreme Court.

“It’s encouraging that the Court blocked the intrusive social media provisions, but just as intrusive are the processes needed to confirm someone is ‘of good moral character,’ which the Court has inexplicably chosen to uphold,” Paredes said in a statement. “Frustratingly, much of this Court’s opinion reads like an insubordinate rebuke of the Supreme Court, which is a disgrace and cannot be allowed to stand. We are weighing action at the nation’s High Court.”

The panel judges ruled that lower courts erred in previously striking down New York’s “good moral character” clause, arguing that the requirement is consistent with the nation’s historical traditions of gun regulation.

“The CCIA’s definition of ‘character’ is a proxy for dangerousness: whether the applicant, if licensed to carry a firearm, is likely to pose a danger to himself, others, or public safety,” the ruling states.

“And there is widespread consensus (notwithstanding some disputes at the margins) that restrictions which prevent dangerous individuals from wielding lethal weapons are part of the nation’s tradition of firearm regulation,” it continued.

New York Attorney General Letitia James called the provisions of the gun law that the court left intact “critical” for keeping New Yorkers safe.

“Today’s decision to permit the state to enforce critical provisions of the Concealed Carry Improvement Act as the court process moves forward will help keep New Yorkers safe,” James said in a statement. “This commonsense law was enacted to keep guns out of dangerous hands and away from schools, hospitals, parks, public transportation, and other sensitive locations. My office will continue to defend New York’s gun laws and use every tool to protect New Yorkers from senseless gun violence.”"

Five cases of the deadly disease — caused by bites from infected ticks — have been reported since July in Southern California.

In each case, the patient had been in the Mexican border city of Tecate within two weeks of becoming ill, the agency said.

All five patients, three US residents and two Mexican residents, were hospitalized and three died. Four of the patients were minors.

“RMSF is a severe, rapidly progressive, and often deadly disease transmitted by the bite of infected ticks, although many patients do not recall being bitten by a tick,” the CDC notice said.

The disease is native to several states in northern Mexico along the southern border and parts of the Southwestern US.

The pathogen, Rickettsia rickettsii, is commonly spread by ticks associated with urban dogs, according to the CDC.

Symptoms can at first appear mild over the first 1-4 days of infection, including a “low-moderate fever, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain, myalgia, rash, and edema around the eyes and on the back of hands,” the notice says.

After about five days, however, the CDC says disease can cause “altered mental status, coma, cerebral edema, respiratory compromise, necrosis, and multiorgan system damage.”

Half of those who die from RMSF do so within 8 days of contracting the illness. In Mexico, the fatality rate is a staggering 40%, according to the agency.

RSMF can be treated with the antibiotic Doxycycline, which is recommended to be administered as soon as possible."

“I think she is just what we need right now. I think her approach is smart. I think she’s clarified herself on some issues, which is very important. And more importantly, I think the American people need this kind of leadership, statesman-like, elegant,” Langone told Fox News host Neil Cavuto.

The 88-year-old financier noted that he recently met with Haley, 51, and that the former South Carolina governor was “very grateful” and “very appreciative” upon learning he would endorse her.

“She’s excited, not only just about my involvement, but the fact that she’s beginning to get significant traction,” Langone said, noting that Haley recently secured the backing of Americans for Prosperity Action, an influential political group founded by the deep-pocketed Koch brothers.

“Trust me, these guys know how to raise money – big money. Having them in our corner is no small feat,” the Home Depot co-founder said of the Koch-affiliated group’s endorsement.

Langone, a GOP mega-donor and once a prominent supporter of Trump, indicated that he has no intention of backing the former president, even if he were to secure the Republican nomination.

“Look, I think his time has come and gone,” he said.

“What Trump put this country through for the last three months of his presidency was disgraceful. I’m sorry. And I think frankly, that to me ruined his chances to succeed himself at some point,” Langone added, slamming Trump for not telling the rioters at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to “please go home.”

“He sat in a room and watched it for three hours – did nothing about it. America deserves better than that,” he argued.

When asked about choosing to endorse Haley over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Langone cited the Sunshine State governor’s stagnant poll numbers.

“I did like Ron DeSantis. His numbers are unmoving … the handwriting is on the wall,” he said.

“Now, on the other hand, Nikki Haley has had a very substantial upswing,” Langone noted, predicting that if Haley can at least secure second-place in the Iowa caucuses it will be “pretty much the end of the rest of the candidates.”

Langone dismissed the candidacies of entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, arguing that while he supported Christie early on, “he’s not the guy” and that Ramaswamy “should have his mouth washed out with soap.”

“We need a winner. Bad. America needs a winner. What’s gone on in this country, Neil, for the last almost eight years is disgraceful. It’s pathetic,” Langone said."

Jarrett Booker, 37, had served as the Pastor of Worship and Youth Ministry at Nashua Baptist Church for nearly a decade when his alleged victims came forward last month.

“Regrettably, on the evening of November 27, Jarrett Booker took his own life, refusing to face the consequences of his actions,” the church’s elders and deacons said in a statement.

“This event has added immeasurably to the complexity and pain of the situation.”

Officials at Nashua Baptist Church said they became aware of a criminal investigation into the alleged sexual assault just five days before Booker’s suicide.

Booker, a married father of one, worked “specifically with teenagers,” the church’s archived website shows.

A swift internal probe “revealed further evidence of misconduct,” religious leadership said, slamming the accused pervert’s actions as “inexcusable.”

The church is cooperating with the criminal investigation and “had encouraged Jarrett to do the same.”

The details surrounding the alleged assaults and how many victims Booker may have targeted remain unclear.

Nashua police had been investigating Booker for child sex offenses at the time of his suicide.

“We learned of the alleged crimes through an investigation by another police department,” a Nashua Police Department spokesperson told Patch. “The investigation is still ongoing even though the suspect is deceased.”

The nearby Hollis Police Department was also involved in the investigation, according to church officials.

Booker had not been charged with a crime relating to the accusations at the time of his suicide, records show.

The disgraced pastor described himself as “an unfaithful and unholy sinner changed by a faithful and Holy God,” according to his Facebook profile.

Before spending nearly a decade working with teenagers at Nashua Baptist, Booker worked as the youth pastor at Childrey Baptist Church in Nathalie, Virginia.

His mother, who still lives in Virginia, declined a request for comment from The Post.

Booker’s wife described the horrifying saga as “a blender of emotions, one that is still spinning violently at every turn.”

“JB had his demons, I won’t pretend that he didn’t. His choices caused harm. The hard truth I am learning is that there are questions for him that will go without answers in my lifetime,” she wrote on Facebook."
81,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Jewish artists launch guerilla art project during Art Basel Miami Beach to bring attention to rape victims in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack,https://nypost.com/2023/12/08/news/jewish-artists-launch-guerilla-art-project-during-art-basel-miami-beach-to-bring-attention-to-rape-victims-in-hamas-oct-7-attack/,"The Israel-Hamas war is a hot-button issue in South Beach during Art Basel Miami Beach.

An anonymous group of Jewish artists, and artworld pros, have launched a guerilla art project that’s been popping up around Miami, aimed at amplifying the voices of Israeli rape victims from the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

The roving works features bold white type on a red background with messages including, “Rape is not resistance,” “May your daughters never be raped while the world justifies it,” and, “The UN says rape is a war crime. Except in Israel.”

The project, “A Message to Miami,” has been projected on a truck traveling the city, on the Red Cross building and on a building at the intersection of highly trafficked Lincoln Road and Collins Avenue.

Images were also projected during a Wednesday night party at the Bass Museum, but the pop-up project was shut down by a member of the museum staff within an hour.

5 The work has been displayed on the side of trucks, and on buildings.

We are told the interaction was not hostile, and the projectionist left immediately.

One member of the collective explains of the projected images, “If we had put up posters we have no reason to believe people would respect those posters.”

The anonymous artist, who said they’re a survivor of assault, tells us, “Miami Art Basel is a time where there are fellow artists, curators, fashion people, DJs and a lot of different industries… we wanted to harness that opportunity to say something.”

5 The projections were also seen on a Red Cross building.

“We never expected to have to convince the art community that rape should be condemned, that rape is not a weapon of [resistance], or that it happened,” the person continued.

“Because the art world had positioned itself as inclusive and a space of activism and consent and language. I feel so let down by this community.”

The group is critical of organizations it says were slow or absent when responding to the reports of rapes that took place on Oct. 7.

5 The artist said, “In no uncertain terms is rape the fault of the victim, but I saw intellectuals pontificating.”

The artist noted, “It’s the same beast as Holocaust denial, and it’s happening now. It’s a distrust of Jews and dehumanizing of Jews — and that’s antisemitism.”

She continued that on the other hand, “The level of gaslighting and re-traumatizing is incredibly intense. You have people sharing they know and believe, but that these Israelis deserved it, which is akin to saying ‘she was wearing lipstick’ and ‘she was wearing a short skirt.’ In no uncertain terms is rape the fault of the victim, but I saw intellectuals pontificating on how they had it coming from them.”

There has been mounting evidence of widespread rape with testimonies from medics, witnesses, and Hamas footage.

5 Another group, Kidnapped from Israel, has placed milk cartons showing images of the Israeli hostages around Miami.

Israel’s justice ministry has said “victims were tortured, physically abused, raped, burned alive, and dismembered,” reports Reuters, which also states that, “Police say they have over 60,000 ‘visual documents” including videos from Go-Pro cameras worn by attackers, CCTV footage and images from drones.”

There have been reports of broken pelvises from rape and of a gunman shooting a woman while raping her.

During an event last week at the UN led by Sheryl Sandberg, there was horrific testimony by a volunteer who helped collect the remains of victims that women were shot in the vagina and there were “nails and different objects,” in the female organs of one victim.

5 The milk carton work is another take on hostage pictures, which have been among in places like NYC.

Meni Binyamin, the head of the International Crime Investigations Unit of the Israeli police, said in an interview that it had documented “violent rape incidents, the most extreme sexual abuses we have seen,” reports the New York Times.

Hamas has denied the allegations.

Nearly two months after the attack, UN Women issued the statement, “We are alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks.”

Another organization, Kidnapped From Israel, has been displaying large milk cartons around the beach town with images of the Israeli hostages.

On Friday, pro-Palestinian protesters were spotted outside the Convention Center of Art Basel.

According to Artnet, peoples’ stance on the war has become a lightning rod in the art world.

“For the first time you are starting to hear: What’s your position on the Israel-Palestine situation?” Ralph DeLuca, a collector and advisor, told the publication.

“People want to know where the artists stand on this issue.”"

Naoko Takemaru, 69, succumbed to “multiple gunshot wounds” after gunman Anthony Polito stormed the college shortly before noon Wednesday, the Clark County Medical Examiner announced.

Takemaru was a decorated scholar who taught all levels of the Japanese language at UNLV and authored a book about gender bias in the culture’s society.

“Dr. Takemaru has received the William Morris Award for Excellence in Teaching from the College of Liberal Arts at UNLV,” according to the university.

Officials had initially withheld Takemaru’s identification pending family notification.

Officials previously identified the other two victims as business professors Patricia Navarro-Velez, 39, and Cha Jan “Jerry” Chang, 64.

All three faculty members had been inside Beam Hall, which houses UNLV’s business school, when Polito began firing with a list in hand of intended targets, none of whom were struck by his bullets.

A fourth victim, a 38-year-old visiting professor, survived the attack and was rushed to a hospital, where his condition has since been downgraded to stable condition.

Polito was killed when he rushed out of the building and exchanged gunfire with cops.

Investigators are still working to uncover Polito’s motive, though the violence could be tied to his repeated rejection by universities.

Polito — who served as an associate business professor from August 2001 to January 2017 — was repeatedly rejected from numerous job applications at several Nevada higher education institutions.

Moments before the deadly rampage, the scorned professor sent 22 letters containing laced white powder to collegiate scholars across the country.

In the wake of the tragedy, UNLV canceled classes for the remainder of the semester, including finals.

The Winter Commencement ceremony, however, will continue as planned.

“One common thread that emerged was a desire to come together,” UNLV President Keith E. Whitfield said in a letter to the community.

Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) demanded Friday that the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania be immediately fired over their handling of antisemitism on campus.

The two lawmakers sent a bipartisan letter — signed by 72 of their colleagues — to board members of the three vaunted institutions arguing that the university leaders “enabled” the “dehumanization” of Jewish people and calling for an “action plan” to be put in place on each campus to ensure the protection of Jewish and Israeli students and faculty.

“Jewish students should have found comfort on their campuses. Instead, many Jewish and Israeli students have faced an increasingly hostile educational environment, in the form of targeted harassment, protesters calling for the elimination of the Jewish state, and even acts of violence,” the letter states.

“This is a clear result of the failure of university leadership,” the lawmakers argue.

Claudine Gay, Liz McGill and Sally Kornbluth — the presidents of Harvard, UPenn and MIT, respectively — took heat on Capitol Hill earlier this week, after being grilled by House lawmakers over their response to on-campus protests calling for violent armed resistance against the state of Israel and Israeli civilians, as well as the genocide of Jews.

Gay and McGill evaded questions from Stefanik on whether violent anti-Jewish demonstrations that have swept their institutions following the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel violated codes of conduct at the Ivy League schools.

Gay stressed that while she finds antisemitic speech “personally abhorrent,” Harvard is committed to “free expression and give[s] a wide berth to free expression, even of views that are objectionable.”

McGill said her institution would only consider calls for the genocide of the Jewish people bullying or harassment “If it is directed and severe, pervasive.”

“It is a context-dependent decision,” the UPenn president added.

Kornbluth responded that such language violated conduct codes only if “targeting individuals, not making public statements.”

“We have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people,” the MIT leader said.

Stefanik and Moskowitz were not satisfied with what they heard from the university presidents during their testimony.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” they wrote in Friday’s letter. “When pushed on whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates university policies on bullying or harassment, Presidents Gay (Harvard), Kornbluth (MIT), and Magill (Penn) were evasive and dismissive, failing to simply condemn such action. This should have been an easy and resounding ‘yes.’”

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses.”

“Anything less than these steps will be seen as your endorsement of what Presidents Gay, Magill, and Kornbluth said to Congress and an act of complicity in their antisemitic posture. The world is watching – you can stand with your Jewish students and faculty, or you can choose the side of dangerous antisemitism,” the letter concludes.

Stefanik announced Thursday that a formal congressional investigation into the three universities will be launched."

Biden, 81, gave his latest rendition of the tale — changing some details, including the specific mileage cited — while touting investments in rail infrastructure at an event in Las Vegas.

“I was vice president… I was going home to see my mom. I was catching a 5 o’clock train I used to take every single day — a 7 o’clock train out of Washington,” Biden began.

“One of the senior guys at Amtrak… He comes up to me — his name is Angelo — and he comes over and he says ‘Joey, baby!’ and grabs my cheek. I thought they were gonna shoot him.

“And I said, ‘Ang, what’s the matter?’ He said, ‘We just — I just read the newspaper’ — because they keep meticulous mileage [of] how many miles you use on aircraft for the United States Air Force as vice president,” Biden continued

“‘I read in the paper, Joey, that you traveled… one million, two hundred thousand miles on Air Force,” Biden went on, using a different figure from the million of miles he more commonly cites.

“He said, ‘Big —’ I’m gonna quote him exactly. He said, ‘Big deal, Joey.’ He said, ‘We just had a retirement dinner in Newark, New Jersey… You know how many miles you’ve ridden?’ I said, ‘No, Ang.’ And he said, ‘1,000,327 miles. I don’t hear any more about the Air Force.’ Well, guys, I — I’m a rail guy, not a joke.”

The story was rated “False” in 2021 by CNN, which noted that Biden didn’t reach one million miles aboard Air Force Two until September 2015, well after Negri’s retirement from Amtrak in 1993 and death in May 2014.

Biden’s daily private schedule as vice president included a note about how many Air Force miles he had traveled, allowing for verification.

Biden is seeking a second four-year term in next year’s election despite broad public concern about his mental acuity.

A New York Times poll last month found 71% of swing-state voters believe Biden is “too old to be an effective president,” versus 39% who said so of former President Donald Trump, 77, who is seeking a rematch against Biden.

Biden also has a decades-long propensity for embellishing personal stories and was forced to drop out of his first presidential bid in 1987 due to plagiarism of speeches, a law school paper and exaggerations about his academic record."
86,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Astonishing infrared footage shows ‘mass incursion’ of migrants leaping over border wall,https://nypost.com/2023/12/08/news/infrared-footage-shows-dozens-of-migrants-leaping-over-border-wall/,"Astonishing infrared video from the overrun Southern border shows dozens of migrants pouring over the wall and running into San Diego — as the United States set a grim new record in illegal crossing this week.

In the video, posted on X by the Chief Patrol Agent of the US Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector, a group of 75 migrants can be seen amassing on the Mexico side of the wall, near San Ysidro, Calif.

One by one, the migrants slip over the wall into San Diego before racing through through some brush and onto a road.

“Mass incursions continue to occur throughout the San Diego Sector Area of Operations. Yesterday, 75 people were guided by callous smugglers over the border wall near San Ysidro, CA,” Patricia D. McGurk-Daniel wrote on X.

The footage comes after the US set a new single-day record Tuesday, with over 12,000 migrants crossing over the southern border into the country.

Of those, more than 10,200 were taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection, according to Fox News.

By Wednesday morning, the CBP had more than 22,000 migrants in custody at various border crossings, pushing its already strained resources to the breaking point.

The shocking infrared footage also comes as there has been a sharp uptick in violence along the Mexican border involving drug cartels and human traffickers — which is driving more migrants into the US seeking refuge from the horrors back home.

The notorious Mexican border city of Juarez has recently been the site of horrific acts of violence, including severed heads dumped inside coolers in local parks and dismembered bodies found in apartment building parking lots or stuffed in storm drains, according to Border Report.

McGurk-Daniel says the organized criminal groups will exploit those desperate to escape to help them distract Border Patrol agents.

“Criminal organizations continue to use people as pawns by placing them into dangerous situations as a means of pulling Border Patrol resources away from our law enforcement mission,” McGurk-Daniels wrote on X.

“San Diego Sector will continue to address these humanitarian challenges to the best of our ability, while still prioritizing public safety.”

The same tactics have been seen in Arizona, where smugglers are brazenly cutting down wall bollards with power tools to allow thousands of migrants to flood into the US.

In an interview posted on X, journalist Ali Bradley spoke to a 20-year-old migrant from Morocco, who said he paid $7,000 to reach America — and doesn’t care if American taxpayers had to foot the bill now he has arrived.

The young man, Osama, said he was unaware of the CBP One App, which enables migrants to sign up for legal entry into the country.

He added he would rather kill himself than go back to Morocco because there was “no future” there and thanked President Biden.

“Thank you Joe Biden, for everything. We love you Joe Biden,” he said.

Osama also claimed he could “easily” find a way to earn a living in the US and that he was hoping to make money as an Uber driver in New York, where he said he has friends."

Nancy Mace splits with fiancé, ‘frequently’ discussed her sex life in office: report",https://nypost.com/2023/12/08/news/rep-nancy-mace-splits-with-fiance-discussed-her-sex-life-in-office-report/,"Rep. Nancy Mace frequently talked about her sex life in front of junior staffers in her Capitol office while dating her now ex-fiancé, according to a report.

“She frequently made sexual references in the office and discussed things that were not appropriate in a work environment,” a former senior staffer for the South Carolina Republican told the Daily Mail.

If Mace was subjecting her staff to tales of her bedroom antics, the 46-year-old congresswoman could face a House Ethics Committee investigation if one of her aides were to file a complaint with the panel.

She is already embroiled in a messy legal dispute with her ex — Charleston entrepreneur Patrick Bryant — over a pair of multi-million dollar homes the former couple purchased together, according to the outlet.

Mace reportedly broke up with Bryant, who popped the question in May 2022, because she found him on a dating app.

Bryant told the Daily Mail that he was not active on the app since before the two became an item and that he recently deleted an old profile that was still popping up.

3 Mace “frequently made sexual references” inside her Capitol complex office, according to a former staffer. ZUMAPRESS.com

Mace, who has served in the House of Representatives since 2021, has made awkward public remarks about her frisky ex-fiancé in the past.

In one uncomfortable moment in July, she suggested that she was nearly late to former GOP presidential candidate Tim Scott‘s prayer breakfast because Bryant wanted to get intimate.

“When I woke up this morning at seven, I was getting picked up at 7:45. Patrick, my fiancé, tried to pull me by my waist over this morning in bed and I was like, ‘No, baby, we don’t got time for that this morning. I got to get to the prayer breakfast and I got to be on time.’ A little TMI,” Mace told a roomful of Christians at the event.

“I know he can wait … I’ll see him later tonight,” she added as some in the crowd nervously laughed.

Mace, one of the eight GOP lawmakers who voted in favor of ousting former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in October, was called out by the retiring pol over her claims that he wasn’t keeping his word.

“So, I call [Mace’s] chief of staff … I said, ‘Can you please tell me, I don’t understand? Where have I not kept my word?’” McCarthy told reporters the day he was removed from the speakership. “Chief of staff said, ‘You have kept your word 100%.’

“Her chief of staff told all of us we have kept every single one of our words. And he said he’s told her that, too,” the former speaker added.

That chief of staff, Dan Hanlon, has since been fired by Mace, according to the Washington Examiner, and his ouster has been followed by at least five other aides leaving her office.

3 Mace reportedly broke up with Bryant after she found him on a dating app. bpatrickbryant/Instagram

On the same day she voted to boot McCarthy, Mace appeared to flout House rules by soliciting donations at the Capitol complex, asking Fox Business viewers to visit her website and contribute to her campaign during an interview with the network.

Ron DeSantis on Friday qualified to be on Vermont’s ballot for the 2024 GOP primary, marking a key milestone.

With the Green Mountain State down, he has now secured ballot access in 30 states and territories as the leadoff contest draws near, his campaign confirmed.

“Ron DeSantis’ strong ballot access operation is just another example of why he’s the only candidate with the resources and grassroots organization necessary to beat Donald Trump,” campaign communications director Andrew Romeo said.

“DeSantis continues to out-work and out-organize the competition all across the country as his message to fight for the American people, win on the issues that improve their everyday lives, and lead our nation into a brighter future, continues to resonate.”

This week alone, the Sunshine State governor also notched Oklahoma, Tennessee, North Carolina, North Dakota, Michigan, and Minnesota.

Other states and territories he’s qualified for include: South Carolina, the US Virgin Islands, New Hampshire, Washington, Massachusetts, Nevada, American Samoa, Missouri, Virginia, Iowa, Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Michigan, Georgia, Idaho, Washington DC, Hawaii, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Texas, and Maine.

Qualification for ballot access typically involves a labyrinth of signatures and other requirements that vary from state to state.

To gain access, the DeSantis campaign has touted its “sophisticated grassroots” work.

DeSantis’ team has also invested considerably in its ground game for early states.

In Iowa, which is set to hold its caucuses on Jan. 15, 2024, the governor has over 30,000 Iowans committed to caucus for him, per his campaign.

The governor has the coveted backing of Hawkeye State Gov. Kim Reynolds as well as 42 endorsements from state legislators and 130 county-level chairs supporting him.

Last Saturday, he completed the “full Grassley” and finished visiting all 99 counties in the state.

DeSantis has also completed 20 campaign stops in South Carolina, which is slated to hold its primary on Feb. 24, 2024.

There, he also notched 19 endorsements from sitting legislators and enjoys five offices between his campaign and Super PAC.

In New Hampshire, which is slated for a Jan. 23, 2024 primary, DeSantis has made 53 visits, scored 65 current legislative endorsements, and has four offices between his campaign and Super PAC.

89,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Desperate mom of daughter, 19, who was taken away, bloodied by Hamas speaks out: ‘An eternity in hell’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/08/news/israeli-hostage-naama-levys-mom-speaks-out-each-minute-an-eternity-in-hell/,"A desperate mother who last saw her 19-year-old Israeli daughter being hauled away by Hamas terrorists in a viral video two months ago said each moment her child is held hostage “is an eternity in hell.”

“You have seen the video of my daughter Naama Levy. Everyone has,” Ayelet Levy Sachar wrote in a heartbreaking account published Friday in The Free Press.

“She is seriously injured. She is frightened. And I, her mother, am helpless in these moments of horror,” Sachar said.

Levy, one of 17 young women still held hostage by Hamas, was staying at Kibbutz Nahal Oz on Oct. 7, when the group launched its unprecedented surprise attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 250 captives.

Around 7 a.m. that morning Sachar said she received a haunting final message from her daughter: “We’re in the safe room. I’ve never heard anything like this.”

The teen was filmed by Hamas being dragged out of the back of a jeep at gunpoint, barefoot with her hands bound in bloodied clothes, and shoved back into the vehicle.

The disturbing video of her daughter emerged the following day — but the woman in the clip appeared nearly beyond recognition in her bloodied and battered condition, Sachar wrote. Levy’s father later called and confirmed that it was her daughter.

The teenager has dreams of a future career in diplomacy, and worked as a member of the “Hands of Peace” delegation, which promotes peace between Israeli, Palestinian and US youth, her mother said.

“But now, one video, totally unrepresentative of the life she had led until October 7, is how the world knows her,” she said.

Since her daughter’s been taken hostage, Sachar said “each minute is an eternity in hell,” as she watches news coverage of living conditions of Hamas’ captives, including allegations of rape and violence against women.

“The same monsters who committed those crimes are holding my daughter hostage,” Sachar wrote.

Dozens of hostages and Israeli prisoners were swapped during a short-lived cease-fire at the end of last month, but Levy was not one of them.

The distraught mother pointed out that on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Hamas is refusing to release its female prisoners because “they don’t want those women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in custody.”

“Everyone knows exactly what he means,” Sachar wrote."

Sarah Unsicker (D-83) has been removed from her committee assignments after she posted a picture on social media with an influencer the Anti-Defamation League calls a Holocaust denier and “alt-right troll.”

However, the four-term rep, who is running for Missouri Attorney General in 2024, claimed on her Substack that she was unaware of any formal inquiry or complaints lodged against her until House Speaker Dean Plocher (R-89) notified her Friday afternoon that his office had received a letter announcing her expulsion from her committee posts.

Missouri House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, a fellow Democrat, issued a news release Friday announcing Unsicker’s removal.

“During her time in the legislature, Rep. Sarah Unsicker has proven a strong advocate for society’s vulnerable, especially children,” Quade wrote.

“Recently, however, she has chosen to use social media to promote individuals who espouse baseless conspiracies and racist and antisemitic ideologies that are antithetical to the values of inclusiveness, tolerance and respect House Democrats are dedicated to upholding,” she continued.

“As a result, I am removing Rep. Unsicker from all committees as the process of evaluating her future as a member of the House Democratic Caucus begins.”

While the X post containing the offending image was no longer visible, in a separate post, Unsicker identifies the man she had met with as Charles C. Johnson, whom the ADL dedicates an entire page to on its website.

In their writeup, the organization claims Johnson “asserted the number of Jews killed [in the Holocaust] was false” in a 2017 “Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit.

The ADL also asserts Johnson founded a crowdfunding website which “reportedly raised more than $150,000 in 2017 for the neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin’s legal defense.”

The blurb also notes that Johnson had been invited to Capitol Hill in October 2017 and February 2018 by former Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), respectively.

In a statement Thursday, Unsicker expressed confusion about her removal and how it unfolded.

“I am confused by the statement that I have ‘promoted individuals’ who espouse ‘baseless conspiracy theories.’ I have not been offered any explanation of how my behavior was different from my typical behavior, including my refusal to respond to slanderous representations about others,” she wrote.

On Substack, Unsicker wrote that “despite the fact that I have not been formally removed from committees,” references to her as a member of the House Subcommittee on Appropriations, Health, Mental Health, and Senior Services had been purged from her official House website.

She also says she’s been removed from the Children and Families Committee.

An email sent to Unsicker seeking comment was not immediately responded to."

“[W]e understand that former intelligence officials often return to the intelligence community under private contract for their previous agencies,” Jordan wrote in a Dec. 4 letter to CIA Director William Burns obtained by The Post.

“It is vital to the Committees’ oversight to understand whether any of the signatories of the public statement were actively employed by CIA as contractors or consultants at the time they signed the public statement.”

Jordan gave Burns until Dec. 15 to reveal any of the 51 signers who have been on an active contract or consulting for the CIA at any time since Jan. 1, 2020, and in what capacity — especially if their work related to the Biden family.

Jordan also said the CIA has not complied with records requests that his panel submitted in May, citing “fundamental concerns about the role of the CIA in helping to falsely discredit allegations about the Biden family in the weeks before the 2020 presidential election.”

6 House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is probing whether the CIA paid any of the 51 former intelligence officials who claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was likely Russian disinformation. AP

The Judiciary chairman said that earlier production of documents indicated initially unclassified records had been marked as classified before coming into the committee’s hands — and that the records related “directly” to “the CIA’s awareness of the public statement before its publication.”

“After a careful review of the classified production of documents that were originally unclassified and retained their previous unclassified markings, it is apparent that the classification of these documents was not for the purpose of protecting American national security, but rather to shield the CIA from potential embarrassment,” Jordan wrote.

“Thus, it appears that the CIA’s decision to baselessly classify these documents frustrates and impedes the Committees’ ability to fulfill our constitutional oversight obligations.”

Jordan had threatened to subpoena the CIA in May if it declined to hand over the information.

The Oct. 18 open letter sought to discredit The Post’s bombshell reporting that the first son had involved his father, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, in his lucrative overseas business ventures, according to emails found on his abandoned laptop.

6 The 51 officials said the leaked emails possessed “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,” which big tech platforms used to suppress its reach.

The 51 officials said the leaked emails possessed “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,” a claim which Big Tech platforms like Facebook and Twitter used to suppress the story’s reach, saying The Post report violated their policies concerning hacked material.

The social media companies censored The Post even after having been informed by the FBI that the contents of the laptop were authentic.

The Post revealed many of the signatories on its March 19, 2022, front page, one of whom was later discovered to be a former CIA agent who was employed at Twitter on Election Day 2020.

Then-candidate Joe Biden referenced the letter during the second and final presidential debate against former President Donald Trump on Oct. 22, 2020, falsely claiming the laptop to be a “Russian plant.”

David Cariens, a former CIA analyst, revealed that Morell had asked for the analyst’s signature on the infamous letter when Cariens was speaking with the agency’s Prepublication Classification Review Board about his forthcoming memoir.

That exchange and others about the CIA’s knowledge of the letter were disclosed by the House Judiciary Committee in a May staff report.

Under questioning from reporters, several former intelligence officials who signed the letter have chosen to defend the statement, with Obama-era CIA Director Leon Panetta telling Fox News in October, “No, I don’t have any regrets.”"

“Your spending is documented and irresponsible,” Kathleen Buhle emailed him on Feb. 20, 2017.

The couple were in bitter divorce negotiations.

“I am sick of trying to figure out how you are hiding the money,” Buhle continued in the email, cited in “Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden, Big Tech and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide” by The Post’s Miranda Devine.

Buhle wrote that he had spent $122,000 in two months — and at the same time cut monthly payments to Buhle and their three daughters from $17,000 to $1,700.

“Simply looking at your spending is enough for any judge to be disgusted.”

Three days later she filed a court motion. Biden “rarely” spent anything on his family, she charged, but was blowing hundreds of thousands on alcohol, strip clubs, gifts to other women, and travel — sometimes charging multiple hotel rooms for the same night.

15 Hunter Biden, seen in the middle of a drugs spree, blasted through money in four years while dodging his taxes, prosecutors say. His ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, warned during in 2017 that he needed to be stopped.

Now federal prosecutors have revealed just how right Buhle was.

They alleged Pres. Biden’s son blasted through $4,907,813 in four years, including $683,212 “to various women,” and $188,960 on “adult entertaining.”

David Weiss, the special counsel investigating Biden filed a nine-charge indictment in Los Angeles, Calif., Thursday, accusing him of dodging more than $1 million in taxes while living an “extravagant” life between 2016 and 2019 — and detailing the eye-popping spree.

Biden, 53, was charged with three felonies and six misdemeanor counts of failure to file taxes and to pay them in the 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 tax years, amounting to at least $1.4 million. He faces 17 years in prison if convicted on all counts.

A year after Buhle’s furious email and her court bid to get his cash, Biden was undeterred, emails and records in his laptop show.

15 In February 2018, Hunter was spending $7,000 as month in rent for a home in Annapolis, MD, which he was sharing with his love Hallie Biden — his brother Beau’s widow.

In February, 2018, he was splurging $7,000 per month on a $5 million waterfront home in Annapolis, MD, complete with a pool and private jetty for his 27ft boat — and sharing it with his brother Beau’s widow Hallie, with whom he was having an affair.

By May 2018, he was in Los Angeles, where he spent $8,000 on an extended callout for a 24-year-old Russian prostitute named “Yanna,” an “elite courtesan” with green eyes and brown hair from Emerald Fantasy Girls.

He also charged 42 nights at the Chateau Marmont hotel for an $ 820-a-night poolside bungalow, for a total of $34,400, using the four-burner stove in the tiny kitchen to cook up crack.

On many of the same nights, Biden also booked a $469-a-night room at The Jeremy and another at La Peer, both luxury hotels in West Hollywood.

In August, the First Son shelled out $140,000 a night for 14 nights to stay at the Las Vegas Palms Casino Resort where he went on a bender, fueled by crack cocaine and accompanied by prostitutes, according to images and texts found on his laptop.

The suite cost him $10,000 a night, although the Russian who organized it told him that was “half-off.”

At the time, he tooled around Los Angeles in a $650-a-day Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder from Legends Car Rentals while his own Porsche 911 was being serviced.

While in Los Angeles, he shelled out $1,000 for a sex-cam porn site called STREAMRAY where women with monikers like “PerfectTits” writhed and took off their clothes.

The spending was bi-coastal. In New York, he stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Columbus Circle in a $ 2,495-a-night suite with views of Central Park.

In two different visits to the elite menswear store Riflessi on W57th Street, he spent $30,000 on suits from luxe Italian brand Brunello Cucinelli, including a tuxedo, and $14,000 on other clothes.

There was $7,694 at Caruso Menswear, an Italian boutique, and just under $540 at Brooks Brothers in Manhattan.

While in the city, he also spent more than $69,000 to fix his teeth, wrecked from his crack-smoking, at Smile Design Cosmetic Dentistry in Midtown — and dropped $12,000 at Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club in Hell’s Kitchen.

In May 2019, he complained in several texts to strippers at Archibald’s Gentlemen’s Club on K Street in Washington, DC, where he was a regular, that a woman had walked away with his $8,500 Gucci bomber jacket, and he wanted it back.

“We had credit card debt and medical bills,” said Buhle in her 2022 book “If We Break: A Memoir of Marriage, Addiction and Healing.”

“The sheer amount of our debt overwhelmed me. We were underwater.”

Biden barely addressed his extraordinary spending in his memoir, “Beautiful Things,” focusing instead on buying 10 dime bags of crack for $100 and staying in $59-a-night Super 8 motels off I-95.

But the special counsel was interested in one aspect of the book: He alleges that Biden had $140,000 in proceeds from it sent to Buhle’s bank account — and did not send a cent of it to the IRS.

What does cash option mean?

The major lotteries in the United States offer two jackpot payout options: annuity and cash.

The annuity option is paid out over time. There is an immediate payment and then 29 annual payments after that, increasing by 5% each year. The cash option is significantly lower than the advertised jackpot, but it is paid in a lump sum. You don't have to wait decades for all the money.

Can a jackpot winner remain anonymous?

In some states, like New Jersey, you can win a lottery anonymously. That wasn't always the case, but now winners are able to stay anonymous under a law that was signed by Gov. Phil Murphy. In other states, a winner's name and hometown are a matter of public record. Check with your state lottery for more information.

103,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,‘We’re on the side of righteousness’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/florida-black-history-task-force/,"Nearly three decades ago, Florida passed a landmark measure requiring that Black history be taught in its public schools. “Knowledge is the antidote to the poison of prejudice,” Gov. Lawton Chiles (D) said as he signed the legislation.

The law — one of the first in the nation — created a special volunteer task force to continuously guide implementation, and the educators and historians involved did so with little controversy until 2020. That’s when Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) began to fundamentally remake how the state would teach Black history.

DeSantis signed legislation prohibiting lessons that might make students feel guilty about their race. He rejected an Advanced Placement course on African American studies. He appointed a new working group and this summer drew scathing criticism when he defended curriculum revisions that said enslaved people developed skills that “could be applied for their personal benefit.” Veteran members of the African American History Task Force were not consulted.

As a year of intense rancor draws to a close, The Washington Post talked to four people deeply involved with the task force about how they have lived Black history in Florida and what it has meant for their voices to be sidelined. Their remarks have been edited lightly for clarity and conciseness.

(Mark Wallheiser for The Washington Post) Donna Austin Austin, 65, is the chief executive of a Tallahassee-based education consulting firm, which she founded after nearly a quarter-century as a school guidance counselor. She has long been an advocate for teaching Black history in schools and joined the Florida African American History Task Force in 2019. She holds a doctorate in educational leadership.

I was born in the small town of Chipley in North Florida, but I grew up in Tallahassee. We integrated our schools when I was in seventh grade. There was a lot of racial tension, and it was tough at first, but by the time I was in 12th grade, everything was calm. Black people started dating White people without repercussions of any kind.

But it only went so far. When my sister’s White friends wanted her to come over to their houses, they made her duck down in the car so nobody would see her because Black people weren’t allowed to be in that neighborhood. My White friends would come and visit me at my home, but I was never invited to theirs.

In the 1960s and 1970s, we were not learning about the contributions that African American people made to this country. We didn’t see that in our textbooks or in the books we were reading in the library. Nobody was teaching us that African Americans built the White House, for example. We got bits and pieces of history funneled through the African American churches.

I became an educator and wanted to help students learn our real history. I joined the task force because I thought that would be a good way to help teachers throughout the state to integrate African American history into their lessons.

When they came out with the new history standards, the DeSantis people completely bypassed [the long-standing task force members]. I had no idea in my lifetime that I would be subjected to the level of disrespect that we are being subjected to now. They want to teach that slavery had a benefit? That makes me so upset. We’re moving backwards instead of moving forward.

I don’t know if DeSantis understands, or if he even cares, that when he’s attacking our history, he’s attacking everyone. The vast majority of our society is so intertwined, he’s doing an injustice to the citizens of Florida, period.

I’m still on the task force, but I haven’t heard anything about it or for months; it’s been crickets. And I’m extremely frustrated. You have to get up every day and put out fires, because there’s one fire here, and then another fire and another fire. I’m not speaking for every Black person I know in my community, but a lot of us are tired of fighting.

The best we can do is continue to hold it together and know that we’re on the side of righteousness.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) Frederica S. Wilson Wilson, 81, is a Democratic congresswoman from Miami whose first elective office was on the local school board. An educator by training, she was an elementary school principal who insisted that Florida’s Black history be taught in the state’s schools. At her urging, the legislature in 1994 passed a law requiring the same in schools statewide. She is a founding member of the Florida African American History Task Force.

I’m a child of the civil rights movement. My father was a civil rights icon in Miami. When I was growing up, it was a very sensitive time. He would train people at our home on how to register to vote. And the Ku Klux Klan would ride down our street, because they knew what he was doing and they wanted to intimidate us and make him stop.

But he would just turn out the lights, and tell everybody to be quiet, and wait until they passed.

As a little girl I was always inquisitive as to what he was doing and what the people were doing at our house. … My mother would tell me to go under the table. We had a crochet tablecloth that went all the way down to the floor. Before the meeting started, I’d get a pencil, get under the table, listen, and then I’d write down my questions. And she said, “When the people leave, you can ask your daddy your questions.”

As a teacher and a school principal, I made sure my kids, the students in my school, knew Black history. Every child in my school knew “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” And on the flip side, all of the children knew how to say the Pledge of Allegiance in Spanish. That’s the kind of school I had.

Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement

When I got to the legislature, I went full force on teaching Black history. Schools could offer African American history as an elective, but there was no mandate. That’s when I started my mission to make it a mandate.

[Wilson began with textbook publishers, using the state’s purchasing power to compel change.] For a book to be purchased with state funds, it had to include the history of African Americans, Hispanics and women. Trust me, I had a game plan. It was controversial, and I knew we’d have to work for it every year.

I think we can give Mr. DeSantis credit for waking up African Americans of this nation by shining a light on the fact that Black history is not taught the way it should be. People say to stay woke; well, he woke us up. I don’t think that’s what he was trying to do, but what he was trying to do backfired. Nobody was even thinking about African American history until he started all this. But now Black people are saying, “We’ve got to teach it, we’ve got learn it, we’ve got to preserve it.”

(Joshua Lott/The Washington Post) Samuel Wright Wright, 70, was the first Black elected official on the Boynton Beach City Council. He holds a doctorate in education and worked for nearly three decades at the University of South Florida, serving as an associate dean and director of multicultural admissions. Until he resigned this summer in protest over the state’s new curriculum standards, he was a longtime member of the Florida African American History Task Force.

I grew up in Boynton Beach. My father worked for a car dealership — he did property maintenance — and my mom worked at A.G. Holley Tuberculosis Hospital. She worked there for 30 years, and she was the first Black supervisor of the dietary department.

We would spend a lot of time with my grandmother. We would sing a cappella, do three- or four-part harmony, right on her porch. Hymns and church songs.

Our pastor was a very active person politically. He always had a social agenda; I learned a lot about desegregation in church. And my family was very politically astute; my father read the newspaper from front to back every day. We knew what was going on in the country.

I was one of the students who integrated Boynton Beach Junior High School when I was in the seventh grade. I had one or two times when folks referred to me as n-----, but overall, it wasn’t a bad experience. I had a great relationship with a lot of the White students. Years later when I ran for office, I had a lot of support from the Black community but also from the White community because they knew me from school.

Samuel Wright served on the Boynton Beach City Council in Florida in the early 1980s. (Boynton Beach City Library Local History Archives)

At the University of South Florida, I saw just how much people don’t know about Black history. I wanted to make sure that boys and girls are exposed to the fact that Black folks weren’t just slaves. We were educated, we made a tremendous difference. So many monuments and other things built in the United States were made by Black hands.

When I was invited to join the task force, I thought it was a good thing because we need to expose students to that history. This year, when I saw what the governor did to the task force, the people put in there and the changes they were making, I could no longer be a part of that.

Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement

We never wanted to make White kids feel inferior or bad about slavery. We just wanted to illuminate the contributions of African Americans in this country and also, before the slave trade, what they did in Africa. DeSantis put his supporters on the task force, and they followed him, and I feel like they disrespected all of us who have been trying for years to have the full Black history taught.

To teach that slavery might have had benefits for the enslaved? That’s unconscionable.

(Joshua Lott/The Washington Post) Geraldine Thompson Thompson, 75, is a Democratic state senator from the Orlando area, a member of the Florida African American History Task Force and the founder of the Well’sBuilt Museum of African American History and Culture. She began her career as a teacher, then served for 24 years as the director of Valencia College’s equal opportunity office.

The Well’sBuilt Hotel was built in Orlando in the 1920s — the one place that would provide lodging to African Americans when they traveled to Central Florida. It was very much like the Lorraine Motel where Doctor King would stay, not because it was the most opulent, but because it was the only choice. People like Thurgood Marshall and Jackie Robinson, all kinds of entertainers and athletes, stayed there. And it was slated for demolition.

I felt sadness, almost grief, as you would grieve the passing of a loved one. When I approached the city about restoring it, I was told the building was in a community that was a slum and that there was prostitution and drugs and homelessness and all kinds of problems. [Yet] we saved it, and it’s now a museum.

A 1950s photo shows the Well’sBuilt Hotel in Orlando. For much of the 20th century, the hotel was one of the few places where African Americans traveling in Central Florida could stay. (Edgar B. Mitchell)

School tours all want to come in February for African American history month. It’s like when I would talk to people throughout the state about teaching Black history, I would hear, “We celebrate Doctor King’s birthday.” They felt that satisfied the law regarding teaching African American history. But a celebration is hardly instruction. The history and facts are just as relevant in September as they are in February.

We on the task force worked to come up with the curriculum, with lesson plans and learning activities, so there could be no excuse about what to teach. There’s been a lot of hypocrisy in the state to have this law on the books for almost 30 years but there are no consequences if the instruction isn’t provided.

Recently, that changed. The state of Florida rejected the AP African American studies course, with officials saying that African American history has no educational value. It lit a fire under people. [One consequence was a 2023 law, championed by Thompson and others, that compels school districts to provide evidence that they are teaching Black history and to post lesson plans on their websites.]

So if there is any silver lining to this, it has awakened people that there is a concerted effort to obscure and to sanitize and to whitewash African American history. It validates the belief I have had for decades: We must all work to make sure that history is part and parcel of American history. People now realize it has to be included intentionally — or it will be excluded intentionally.

I have a lot more support, a lot more energy, a lot more engagement than I’ve ever had before."
104,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,How a toilet-themed YouTube series became the biggest thing online,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/skibidi-toilets-you-tube-children-internet/,"Listen 10 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

The biggest online phenomenon of the year is an animated video series that primarily appeals to children, filled with obscure internet and gaming references that most adults wouldn’t understand, and with a name that all but screams scatological humor. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight Its existence has sparked concern among adults, but is in fact a natural outgrowth of a video world created in part by parents who’ve made a habit of handing their iPads to their children to watch harmless entertainment such as “Cocomelon.” The success of the series also shows the first point of tension between Gen Z and Gen Alpha.

Called “Skibidi Toilet,” the YouTube series was created by an animator named Alexey Gerasimov for his YouTube channel DaFuq!?Boom! The series tells the story of Skibidi Toilets (toilets with human heads) engaged in a war with people who have CCTV cameras, speakers and televisions for heads amid a dark and dystopian landscape. They battle each other across an expanding industrial world that includes New York City landmarks, with the Skibidi Toilets acting on behest of their leader, G-Man, to destroy humanity and transform more people into Skibidi Toilets.

“Skibidi” videos have been viewed more than 65 billion times this year on YouTube alone, making it one of the biggest trends on the platform. On TikTok, videos with the hashtag “Skibidi Toilet” have been viewed more than 15.3 million times, and they’ve appeared in countless memes and videos on Instagram. DaFuq!?Boom! also has surpassed 36 million subscribers on YouTube, becoming one of the fastest-growing channels on the platform, at times outpacing MrBeast, YouTube’s biggest star.

Maddy Buxton, culture and trends manager at YouTube, said “Skibidi Toilet” is a phenomenon unlike any other the platform has seen before.

“It’s become one of the year’s biggest cultural moments,” she said. “I’ve never quite seen anything blow up like this. It started as a meme but it’s evolved into this very complex storyline with a lot of hidden meaning that people are very eager to break down and try to understand.”

“Skibidi Toilet” may seem easy to write off as an internet fad, but its ascendance reveals what the future of entertainment might look like across major social platforms. It is the first narrative series to be told entirely through short-form video (60 seconds or less), and it’s the first major mainstream meme that has arisen from Generation Alpha (kids roughly age 10 and younger).

“This is one of the first memes that we’ve seen take off with Gen Alpha and it’s one of the first Gen Alpha trends we’ve seen on YouTube,” Buxton said by phone.

With so much focus on TikTok as a culture driver over the past few years, “Skibidi Toilet” is also a testament to the enduring power of YouTube. In one episode, one of the toilet people destroys YouTube’s headquarters in what the YouTuber Matthew Patrick called “a not-so-subtle metaphor for how the show has broken the website and … created a level of virality that has never been seen before.”

While Gen Zers initially appreciated the nostalgic gaming element of the series, many of them now feel uncomfortable and have made reaction videos and memes lamenting its growth.

Sophie Browning, 21, a content creator and meme account administrator, says that’s a natural reaction to Gen Z being supplanted as the driver of online culture. “This is the first time Gen Z feels old or out of touch with meme culture,” she said. “We’ve been told that we run memes and control what’s popular and funny, but now I think Gen Z is reckoning with the new Alphas. It’s unnerving for them to encounter this big meme phenomenon that they don’t feel a part of and didn’t contribute to.”

Gerasimov, a 25-year-old self-taught animator and a member of Gen Z, began creating the series earlier this year. He created the DaFuq!?Boom! video channel in 2016 and for years attracted a modest following by posting humorous animated videos.

He creates his animation using a computer graphics tool called Source Filmmaker that allows users to create animations in the style of an early video game called Garry’s Mod. Garry’s Mod was an online world building sandbox (or space to play around in) similar to “Minecraft.” “Early YouTube was filled with GMod videos, the exact same way “Minecraft” videos dominate the platform today,” Ryan Broderick, a journalist and content creator, noted in his Garbage Day newsletter, adding that Gerasimov’s channel veering deeply into “weird internet aesthetics” played into young people’s nostalgia for the internet of the early 2010s.

Said Buxton: “ ‘Skibidi Toilet’ really plays with the language of the internet in ways Gen Z and Gen Alpha are more used to and have grown up with.”

The word “skibidi” comes from the series’ recurrent theme song, a mashup of the 2007 song “Give It to Me” by Timbaland and a 2022 Turkish song called “Dom Dom” that went viral on TikTok last year. The first few “Skibidi” videos were relatively straightforward toilet humor, but soon evolved into complex narratives.

YouTube says that this rich storytelling has spurred a highly dedicated community online that has created an endless stream of “Skibidi Toilet” fan fiction, art, writing and games inspired by the series.

“ ‘Skibidi Toilet’s’ success is a reminder that YouTube is not just about polished productions and celebrity endorsements. It’s a space for creativity, experimentation and the unexpected,” Buxton said.

Ben De Almeida, a 24-year-old YouTuber with nearly 7 million subscribers, said he watched nearly every episode of “Skibidi Toilet” on a live stream a couple of months ago and has begun to understand its appeal. “I’ve never seen episodic type [entertainment] on YouTube Shorts,” he said. “Especially for Gen Alpha kids, I don’t think there was any narrative series they could keep coming back to on Shorts.”

But he says he now sees why it’s appealing, especially to young people.

“It’s not something you have to watch every episode to understand,” he said. “There are common characters and themes, and it just gets bigger and bigger. All you really have to know is it’s the toilet people fighting the camerahead people and then new characters come in.”

The entertainment news website Cartoon Brew reported that “Skibidi Toilet” “may look rough around the edges compared to major studio fare, but there is no question that Gerasimov is a filmmaker who understands pacing, camerawork, sound design, and how to tell a story.”

De Almeida said he has watched as Skibidi memes have spread among elementary school-age children. Said Broderick: “‘Skibidi Toilet’ is one of those things where you might not know what it is, but you know some 5-year-old is watching it and they think it’s the funniest, best thing they’ve ever seen in their life.”

The series is so deeply of the internet that it appeals almost exclusively to those who are young enough to have been fully immersed in online content since their earliest memories. These Gen Alpha kids who make up the majority of the “Skibidi Toilet” audience are often loosely referred to online as “iPad babies” because social media content has been their primary form of entertainment since birth.

“I can’t help but wonder if ‘Skibidi Toilet’ is a consequence of iPad babies growing up watching hours and hours of YouTube Kids, which is known for its nonsensical videos featuring characters from various movies, games and TV shows,” Browning said. “I think being exposed to YouTube Kids has had an effect on kids’ humor.”

Older people without a deep intrinsic knowledge of internet culture are unlikely to understand the appeal of the series, Broderick said. “It’s such a late-stage internet thing because it’s based on previous internet culture artifacts,” he said.

Online culture experts said that you can see the direct influence of TikTok on the series. It’s short form and often uses viral TikTok sounds. “Gen Alpha are spending their development years on TikTok,” Browning said. And the sort of collaborative, iterative, short-form storytelling seen on the app is very tied with “Skibidi Toilet.”

Many of the references in the “Skibidi Toilet” series also come from gaming. The leader of the Skibidi Toilets, G-Man, is actually a character from the “Half-Life” series of first-person shooter video games, and the camera-headed people often engage in “Fortnite” dances.

Despite its young audience, “Skibidi Toilet” appears on YouTube, not YouTube’s app for children’s content, and the company said that theoretically only kids ages 13 and older are supposed to be able to view the content. But parents frequently pass iPads off to young children, who freely view content on YouTube’s primary app. “Skibidi” costumes for elementary school-age children were a hot commodity this past Halloween.

“If YouTube thinks anyone over the age of 13 is watching hours and hours of ‘Skibidi Toilet,’ they’re out of their minds,” Broderick said. “It’s not something anyone with a fully formed brain is enjoying.”

Videos of children begging to watch “Skibidi Toilet” have gone viral on TikTok and Instagram and kids have begun playfully hopping out of objects singing the “Skibidi Toilet” song while pretending to be Skibidi Toilets, baffling parents.

This summer, the slang phrase “Skibidi Toilet syndrome” emerged to speak to the effects that relentless “Skibidi Toilet” viewing has on young children. The TikTok account of one elementary school-age child humorously documents his descent into “Skibidi” madness, with videos of him throwing tantrums when he’s unable to watch the YouTube videos.

The viral craze has led to panic among adults who can’t understand the frenzy their children have developed around the series. Several parenting sites have published articles on “how to protect your kids” from “Skibidi Toilet” syndrome, claiming that the videos are “dangerous.”

But YouTube’s Buxton says the series is all in good fun. “It’s an epic good-versus-bad story told across short-form video,” she explained. There’s no dialogue in the series, which has allowed it to gain international appeal.

Browning also dismissed any worries about its popularity among young children. “I think older generations are threatened by it because it feels so foreign to them,” she said. “It is an admittedly strange visual. I can see how people can be disturbed by it. It’s very surreal and crazy, but I feel like Gen Alpha is used to seeing surreal and crazy things on the internet.”"

After years spent addicted to heroin on the streets of North Carolina, Samantha Ross had turned her life around. She marked four years in recovery, got married and traveled last year to Miami Beach to celebrate her 34th birthday. By then, the cravings had returned. Ross told her husband she’d gone out and used methamphetamine and crack cocaine, according to a Miami-Dade County medical examiner’s report. That morning, Ross’s husband found her dead of an overdose, slumped in a bed at their Airbnb, two pipes and a baggie with powder residue at her side. Toxicology tests revealed she’d consumed cocaine and fentanyl — plus two other drugs belonging to a class of opioids known as nitazenes. One of those drugs is estimated to be 43 times more potent than fentanyl.

Ross’s mother, Cathy Sheely, had never heard of nitazenes. She doubts her daughter knew she was ingesting them. “We’ve all heard of fentanyl but didn’t know there were these other drugs out there killing people,” Sheely said.

The novel opioids can be many times more powerful than fentanyl and can complicate overdose revivals and addiction treatment. Even as illicit fentanyl manufactured in Mexico remains by far the chief catalyst for overdose deaths in the United States, the increasing presence of nitazenes adds another layer of health concerns as users often have no inkling they are consuming those opioids.

A recently unsealed federal indictment in South Florida opens a rare window into the source of nitazenes: manufacturers in China that officials say sell the drugs online and ship them to dealers in the United States. Prosecutors allege that a Deerfield Beach, Fla., man used WhatsApp and bitcoin to purchase nitazenes to mix with fentanyl or heroin, to stretch out his supplies of opioids and make an “ultra powerful substance.”

“The nitazenes can make [a drug mix] stronger than fentanyl,” said Anthony Salisbury, the special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations field office in South Florida. “As if we needed something stronger than fentanyl.”

The South Florida case from October included indictments against a Chinese chemical sales company and an employee of that company. According to one of the indictments, the Chinese company selling nitazenes used websites, social media accounts and messaging apps to sell chemicals such as protonitazene and metonitazene to customers in the United States, Europe, Asia and South America. As part of the investigation, a U.S. Postal Inspection Service agent posing as a buyer ordered nitazenes from the company, according to the indictment.

It was among the first criminal prosecutions to target an overseas source of nitazenes, Salisbury said.

U.S. federal indictments also targeted Chinese companies allegedly selling precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl. Additionally, charges were brought against a company alleged to have used websites to sell xylazine, an animal tranquilizer, known as “tranq,” that some drug dealers add to fentanyl. The Biden administration has labeled the mix of xylazine and fentanyl — which causes ghastly flesh wounds — as an emerging threat.

Chinese chemical and pharmaceutical companies have played a significant role in the proliferation of illicit synthetic drugs in the past decade. And although Beijing announced in November that it would curb the sale of precursor chemicals used by Mexican organized crime groups to manufacture fentanyl, experts worry that an unintended consequence could be the proliferation of other synthetic drugs such as nitazenes.

A senior Drug Enforcement Administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue candidly, said the agency is monitoring how the illicit drug marketplace may evolve, including the possibility that if “one supply of an opioid were to change that there would potentially be something else that would fill that space.”

Nitazenes were developed by researchers at a Swiss pharmaceutical company in the 1950s as potential painkillers but were never approved for wider use. Although they are considered opioids, the chemical structure of nitazenes differs from fentanyl and related compounds. They began appearing in the United States about 2019, after China — under pressure from the Trump administration — restricted fentanyl-related substances, which are listed as controlled substances in the United States.

Experts say shipments of nitazenes from China have ebbed and flowed as the DEA has placed at least 10 versions of nitazenes on a list of temporarily controlled substances, in a category reserved for those with a high potential for abuse and with no accepted medical use. The DEA plans to restrict two more. The senior DEA official noted that federal law allows authorities to go after traffickers dealing in nitazenes that are not controlled substances, as long as they are chemically similar.

Different versions of nitazenes have appeared in Chicago, Tennessee and West Virginia, said Alex J. Krotulski, the associate director of toxicology and chemistry services at the Center for Forensic Science Research & Education, a nonprofit entity that runs an early warning program researching novel drugs.

The center announced in December that a nitazene called N-Desethyl etonitazene had been detected for the first time in two samples, one from the coroner’s office in Boulder, Colo. It is 10 times stronger than fentanyl. Another of the latest nitazenes to emerge in the past year — known as N-Pyrrolidino protonitazene — is estimated to be 25 times more potent than fentanyl.

Krotulski said that between 10 and 15 types of nitazenes exist on the illicit market.

“This is all new, labs in China creating these drugs. They know how to create them because the blueprints are out there [online], but they’re creating new modifications, new drugs that sort of skirt around these national and international laws but still retain those opioid-like effects that people are interested in,” Krotulski said.

Health officials in multiple countries have issued warnings about nitazenes in recent years. British toxicologists said they have detected nitazenes in the blood of more than a dozen people, typically heroin or cocaine users, who died in the London and Suffolk area since July. The opioids have also been linked to recent overdose deaths in Northern Ireland. In Edmonton, Canada, law enforcement officers last year said they seized 10.5 kilograms of isotonitazene during a raid of a drug “super lab,” the largest seizure of that drug in the country’s history.

In D.C., nitazenes were first identified on used syringes in November 2021, prompting the District’s forensic lab to issue an alert to public health partners.

Naloxone, the commonly used overdose reversal drug, can revive nitazene users. But nitazenes may complicate rescue efforts if users or medical personnel do not know the drugs have been consumed. In a study published in August, researchers found that a small group of emergency room patients who had taken nitazenes needed more naloxone than people overdosing on fentanyl. Two patients who ingested a compound known as metonitazene suffered heart attacks. One died, according to the study in JAMA Network Open.

“The concerns about nitazenes being more potent than fentanyl were confirmed by the study,” said Alex F. Manini, a study co-author and a professor of emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

With the increasing unpredictability of the makeup of the nation’s illicit narcotics supply, users may unwittingly become hooked on nitazenes that were mixed into drugs without their knowledge.

That volatility means users cannot always get the same drug configurations and risk going into withdrawal if they do not, said Jon E. Zibbell, a senior scientist at the nonprofit research institute RTI International. “And then, when [users] enter treatment, providers have no idea what to prescribe patients experiencing withdrawal symptoms,” he said.

It isn’t easy to gauge the prevalence of nitazenes in the drug supply because many police and medical examiner labs do not routinely test for them.

NMS Labs, which partners with the Center for Forensic Science Research & Education and conducts toxicology tests for medical examiners and coroners, has identified at least 749 nitazene-involved deaths since 2019, almost certainly an undercount, Krotulski said. Tennessee health officials published data showing a total of 52 nitazene-related deaths in 2020 and 2021. None were recorded in 2019.

In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, medical examiner toxicologists last year began testing for some nitazene compounds and are adding more to their routine screenings.

In one case, according to a medical examiner’s report, a 52-year-old former soldier with a history of drug use and mental illness was found dead in his family’s Miami Beach home last fall. Tests revealed he died of the effects of a staggering array of drugs, including fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, the anti-anxiety drug clonazepam — and butonitazene, a nitazene that is slightly less potent than fentanyl but still more powerful than heroin. The following month, the man’s older brother — depressed by his sibling’s passing — died of an overdose that included fentanyl and butonitazene, according to medical examiner records. Their mother could not be reached for comment.

Luke Knox, a 22-year-old Florida International University football player, was discovered unconscious in his Miami dorm room last year. Doctors could not save his life. Toxicology tests performed by the county medical examiner showed Knox died of an accidental overdose of drugs including bromazolam (an illegal benzodiazepine); mitragynine, the compound found in the herbal substance kratom; and protonitazene, which experts estimate is four times as potent as fentanyl. The toxicology test results were in public records.

Knox is the brother of Buffalo Bills football player Dawson Knox. Luke’s death received widespread publicity, although the cause had not been previously disclosed. His family, contacted through Dawson Knox’s agent, declined to comment.

As for Ross, the 34-year-old from Mint Hill, N.C., her life had been marked by tumult. As a child, her older brother died in a car accident. She began drinking heavily as a teen. Later, she turned to heroin and went to prison for two years on drug-related charges, said Sheely, her mother. After prison, she found recovery by going to a clinic for methadone, the prescription drug that treats opioid use disorder. She got married in Las Vegas several months before her death — her wedding dress still hangs in her husband’s closet, Sheely said.

Shortly before her trip to Miami Beach, Ross’s opioid cravings had returned because her methadone doses were so low, Sheely said. Along with cocaine and meth, toxicology tests showed, Ross had ingested metonitazene and N-Pyrrolidino etonitazene, the latter of which is 43 times more potent than fentanyl, experts say.

“She had overcome so much. For this to come out of nowhere — my youngest son figures he’s next because I’ve lost two other children,” Sheely said. “It just broke all of our hearts.”"

Saoussan Aitchaoui and her husband, Ayoub Bouriqui, studied the colorful map of schools. They tried to match the tiny blocks on the page to their corresponding booths. Aitchaoui looked up from the maze of school names. She pointed left and then right. She stared back down at the map. Around them, families squeezed past, pushing strollers and tugging along reluctant children. They all were looking for the perfect school.

On this weekend morning, Aitchaoui and Bouriqui were among hundreds who showed up to the cavernous, World War II-era armory in Southeast Washington for EdFest, the city’s annual public school fair.

A list of questions zipped through Aitchaoui and Bouriqui’s minds as they considered the right school for their 6-year-old son, Mohamed Ali: Does the school offer Spanish? What about coding? What forms do they need for enrollment, and what if one is missing? Will their son be prepared for a good life and career?

Aitchaoui and Bouriqui, like parents the world over, want better lives for their kids than they had. A good education — and all that it promises — is key. That, along with the prospect of high-paying jobs, is what brought the family last year from Casablanca to D.C., where they didn’t know anyone.

What greeted them was a complex system in which families can attend their neighborhood public school or enter a citywide lottery. Many are in search of special programs. Others just want a school that’s on the way to their jobs. EdFest, which marks the beginning of D.C.'s months-long school lottery season, is a chance for parents to question teachers and administrators, mulling over the answers before surrendering to the luck of the draw. Last year, more than 20,000 families participated.

“I didn’t expect that there will be a lot of schools there,” Aitchaoui said. In Morocco, people just enroll their children in whichever school they want them to attend.

Amidon-Bowen, the family’s neighborhood elementary school, was just a few yards away. On paper, it checked most of their boxes: close to their soon-to-be apartment, a STEM lab, a soccer team.

After-school activities in Morocco typically cost money, Aitchaoui said: “If we are just talking about the educational system, it’s much better than Morocco.”

When Aitchaoui and Bouriqui found the Amidon-Bowen booth, they lingered on the edge of a small group clustered in front of a table with stickers and an illustration of the school’s mascot, a tiger. Kenisha Pecot, who teaches prekindergarten, smiled as she welcomed them.

“The majority of us have been at that school for 10-plus years,” she said.

“That’s good,” Bouriqui said. “That means stable staff.”

Aitchaoui wanted to make sure Mohamad Ali could sign up for clubs in case he needed to stay after school. She is not working but hopes to start sometime next year.

“They have a lot of activities. The environment is diverse,” Aitchaoui said. She could tell by looking at Amidon-Bowen’s teachers — including Hajar Bencherki, who wrapped Aitchaoui in her arms when she found out they are both Moroccan. A slide show that played underneath their conversation featured children of different races singing.

There may also be a chance for Liliane, Mohamad Ali’s 1-year-old sister, to attend preschool there.

Amidon-Bowen does not, however, offer Spanish. Or at least, not yet: Aitchaoui learned other families want the option, too. Mohamad Ali — who speaks Arabic, French and English — is learning Spanish at his current school, and Aitchaoui doesn’t want any interruptions.

The family fixed their eyes on the signs above each booth that shared the schools’ locations. They were looking for places in Ward 6.

Capitol Hill Montessori was next, and teacher Monique Myles made her pitch.

“In Montessori, we do a lot of figuring things out for ourselves,” she said. Her students learn to wash, dry and fold their clothes. Mohamed Ali took off his gray coat, folded it neatly and placed it underneath his sister’s stroller. With a smile, he started doing addition out loud: “Twenty plus 20 is 40. Sixty plus 60 is 120.”

Mohamed Ali loves to learn. He said he wants to be a “scientist and make Pokémon” when he grows up. But although Aitchaoui likes the Montessori approach, the school wasn’t as close as she’d hoped. It was two miles away.

A few days later, Aitchaoui and Bouriqui made their choice. Instead of entering the lottery, Mohamed Ali would attend Amidon-Bowen, his neighborhood school."
107,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Sewers are overflowing everywhere. One solution is right in your backyard.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/12/10/rain-garden-cities/,"Listen 4 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

When a heavy rainstorm hits D.C., it’s bad news for the city’s rivers. The city’s sewer system, which combines storm runoff and raw sewage in some areas, has a history of overflowing. Instead of flowing into a treatment plant, that toxic mix, along with the sediment, trash and other pollutants storm water washes off streets, ends up in rivers.

The city just finished a major component of a multibillion dollar tunnel system to intercept that storm water, but it’s also turning to a far simpler and cheaper solution: rain gardens.

These features, which are built below street level and host a variety of plantings, have been popping up across the country as cities seek to manage more extreme storms.

In San Francisco, officials built a twelve-block span of 30 rain gardens capable of managing over 5 million gallons of storm water every year, or the equivalent of five Olympic pools. Milwaukee has been installing rain gardens in parking lots, streets, and schoolyards, and so has Philadelphia, which has launched a years-long project to reduce combined sewer overflows.

Projects like these can’t handle storm water on the scale of D.C.’s huge new tunnel, but experts say that cities will need all the tools they can get to weather heavier rainstorms, which are expected to become more common and intense with climate change.

“If storms are getting bigger, we need more of everything,” said Trey Sherard, with the nonprofit Anacostia Riverkeeper group.

Managing storm water

D.C. has been struggling with its storm water for decades, well before the more intense rainfall we’re seeing today. Combined sewer systems are common in cities with aging infrastructure.

After being sued for polluting the river, the District agreed to implement a long-term project to reduce combined sewer overflows. The tunnels are part of this effort, preventing overflows by catching excess wastewater and bringing it to a treatment plant.

The agreement was amended in 2016 to include the use of “green infrastructure,” which manages storm water using natural processes. When water is captured by a rain garden, it infiltrates into the ground, evaporates, or is absorbed by plants and eventually returns to the atmosphere. The city is also installing permeable pavement.

The goal is to slowly absorb storm water to keep it out of the combined sewer, said Seth Charde, D.C. Water’s green infrastructure manager.

Share this article Share

It’s like “draining a bathtub through a straw,” he said. “If we keep enough volume out of the system, then you can reduce those downstream overflows.”

One rain garden project to control storm water that flows into Rock Creek cost about $25 million. It’s built to manage the equivalent of 20 acres of hard surfaces like pavement and roofs, capturing the first 1.2 inches of storm water. A second project in the area is planned to be finished in January and cost $16 million.

Gardens everywhere

D.C. is promoting rain gardens in other ways. For $100, the city will design and install a rain garden through an incentive program for homeowners. The city is also helping private projects get federal money.

Less than half a mile from the White House, the streets of the Golden Triangle district are lined with restaurants, businesses, and lots of greenery. The wide sidewalks host tree boxes, pollinator plants, and enough rain gardens to capture 48,000 gallons of water.

Cutouts in the curb allow water rushing down the road to flow into these gardens, which are set below the sidewalk level. The largest are the size of several parking spots, and they’re filled with trees, bushes, flowers and layers of soil. An underdrain sits below them to capture any excess water.

The project cost $2 million, according to Miranda Woolston, a spokesperson for the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District, which installed the gardens. The Department of Energy and Environment and the Environmental Protection Agency put up most of the money.

Intercepting pollutants

In addition to keeping storm water from overwhelming combined sewers, rain gardens can intercept pollutants before they reach rivers. Sediment picked up by storm water can carry toxic compounds and cloud river water, harming aquatic plants and fish, Sherard said. Dog waste and trash can also get washed into local waterways. Rain gardens also create green spaces in cities.

“As our climate continues to change rapidly, I think that it’s just one more bonus of green infrastructure,” said Jennifer Cotting, director of the University of Maryland’s Environmental Finance Center. “It’s gonna be able to deliver some benefits that are addressing the impacts of climate change.”

Charde, with D.C. Water, wants rain gardens to become a normal sight on city streets.

“We’re looking for a future state where green infrastructure is just part of the fabric of the streetscape, you know, just like a stop sign,” he said"
108,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Less appetite — and opportunity — to serve as fake Trump electors in 2024,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/10/trump-fake-electors-charges/,"Listen 12 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Republican Party activist Ken Carroll thought he was doing the right thing when he agreed to cast an electoral college vote for Donald Trump at the Georgia Capitol on Dec. 14, 2020. But he wouldn’t do it again. Keeping up with politics is easy with The 5-Minute Fix Newsletter, in your inbox weekdays. ArrowRight “Knowing what I know now? No,” Carroll said. “But hindsight provides a wealth of knowledge we don’t have at the time of an event.”

Carroll was one of 84 Republican presidential electors who convened to cast votes for Trump in 2020 across seven states where Joe Biden had been declared the certified winner. And he is among the electors in six of those states who have become embroiled in criminal investigations of their actions — saddled with legal bills and in some cases facing criminal charges. Carroll says he never again wants to be involved with a criminal investigation.

In the past few months, 25 of those 84 electors have been charged with felonies, such as forgery, false statements and filing false documents. Ten more have agreed as part of a lawsuit settlement to not serve as electors in any election in which Trump is on the ballot. And 13 others in Georgia have been labeled “unindicted co-conspirators.”

The publicity surrounding those investigations, and the specter of tarnished reputations and heavy legal costs, are likely to discourage future Trump electors — should the former president secure the GOP nomination next year — from casting votes for him in a state where Biden is again declared the winner, many Republicans said.

While the fake elector scheme was novel in 2020, with many pro-Trump electors claiming they didn’t fully understand how their votes would be used, those who engage in similar activities in the future could find it harder to claim they didn’t know they could be held criminally liable. Another discouraging force: a new federal law that tightened the rules surrounding the counting of electoral college votes every four years.

“I think the message being sent on a state-by-state basis, without necessarily any coordination and without the overarching reach of a federal prosecution is: don’t mess around with the integrity of state election proceedings,” said Carol Lam, a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California who was appointed by George W. Bush. Lam has experience with the interplay between parallel state and federal probes.

But it won’t be hard to find electors to serve, these people said — positions typically filled at state convention elections in the spring and summer of presidential years. With the Iowa caucuses looming and the nomination not yet secured, it’s not an issue the Trump campaign is focused on yet, according to one individual close to the organization who requested anonymity to speak candidly.

“The party will find no shortage of volunteers for the job, but with the precedent now set by the district attorney, electors of both parties might get a little nervous if it’s once again a razor-thin margin, which is quite possible,” said Brian Robinson, an Atlanta-based GOP consultant, referring to pending election-interference charges against Trump and 14 others, including three of Trump’s 2020 electors, in Fulton County, Ga.

Robinson disapproves of the criminalization of the electors’ behavior in Atlanta, where “they were told it was a legal maneuver, and when that didn’t work in court — as things work in our country — they all dropped it.” And he thinks it would be “absurd” if the investigations have a chilling effect on activists’ willingness to participate in the process.

Six states as well as the Justice Department have launched investigations into Trump’s efforts to overturn Biden’s 2020 win: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and Wisconsin.

Although several investigations launched almost immediately after the 2020 election, the first charges against electors didn’t land until this summer. Some state prosecutors for a time deferred to the U.S. Department of Justice but grew frustrated that charges had not been filed after more than two years and acted on their own. Others said the investigations simply took a long time.

In July, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) announced charges of forgery and other felonies against the state’s 16 Republican electors from 2020. Nessel agreed to drop the charges against one of the electors in exchange for his cooperation. The other 15 have pleaded not guilty, with preliminary hearings for nine of them scheduled for this week.

In August, Atlanta-area District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D) announced a sweeping indictment of Trump and 18 others, including three of the 16 GOP electors who gathered at the state Capitol — just down the hall from the Democratic electors whose votes were ultimately counted by the Jan. 6, 2021, joint session of Congress after the violence of that day finally subsided. Four of the defendants have accepted plea deals, including Kenneth Chesebro, an architect of the plot to use fake electors. A trial date has not been set.

The charged electors face multiple felony counts in the case, including racketeering, forgery, impersonating a public officer and making false statements. Carroll was granted immunity by Willis’s office, has been cooperating with the probe and is considered an unindicted co-conspirator in the case.

“I didn’t know anything other than we were still trying to get to the bottom of who actually won the state of Georgia, and that seemed to be the way forward with that,” he said.

More charges could soon come in Arizona, where Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) took office in January and launched an investigation that her Republican predecessor refused to do.

The investigation has picked up speed over the summer and through the fall, when members of a well-staffed prosecutorial team met with witnesses to learn about their knowledge about the strategy.

As part of the team’s interviews about the alternate elector strategy, Arizona investigators have also spent hours interviewing people about efforts by Trump and his allies to delay canvassing of the election results. One interview lasted hours and about five people from the attorney general’s team attended, a level of attention that conveys the seriousness of the probe, according to someone familiar with the session who requested anonymity to describe it.

Chesebro recently met with investigators in Nevada and is scheduled to meet on Monday with Arizona prosecutors. His Arizona attorney, Rhonda Neff, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the office declined to comment.

Two people familiar with the Arizona investigation said they expect the evidence-gathering phase to stretch into the new year before deciding whether to pursue charges.

The final state to launch an investigation is Wisconsin, according to two sources familiar with the probe, who said the state attorney general’s office has interviewed Chesebro as a possible witness. One individual with knowledge of the case who requested anonymity to discuss a pending investigation said Wisconsin authorities are casting a “wide net.” But he added “the focus would be more on the locals.”

CNN first reported the Wisconsin investigation.

Chesebro’s value to prosecutors stems in part from his plea deal in the Georgia case, in which he agreed to lesser charges in exchange for truthful testimony. In a nearly three-hour proffer interview for Georgia prosecutors in October, Chesebro described a previously unreported White House meeting during which he briefed Trump on election challenges in Arizona and summarized a memo in which he offered advice on assembling alternate slates of electors in key battlegrounds to cast ballots for Trump despite Biden’s victories in those states.

Chesebro’s recollection could provide evidence that Trump was aware of the elector plan.

He also disclosed for the first time that he played a role transporting documents signed by Wisconsin Trump electors to Capitol Hill as part of a Trump campaign plan to present Vice President Mike Pence with competing slates of electors.

Officials in the seventh Biden-won state where Trump electors met, Pennsylvania, have said that charges are unlikely there because of the contingency language electors included in the certificates they sent to Washington: that they should be considered only if “we are recognized as the duly elected and qualified electors” from Pennsylvania.

Electors in New Mexico included similar contingency language in their paperwork. Nonetheless, an investigation by Attorney General Raúl Torrez (D) is ongoing, a spokesperson for his office said.

Statutes of limitation in the states where the elector strategy unfolded is partly dictating the timing of some indictments. In Nevada, the ability to charge the electors with certain crimes would have expired on Dec. 14, three years after the electors gathered.

Separately, in Wisconsin, the Trump electors agreed in a legal settlement on Wednesday to revoke the false paperwork they filed with the National Archives and other institutions, acknowledge Joe Biden had won the state and promise not to engage in similar behavior in the future. The settlement was reached in a lawsuit filed by two of Wisconsin’s Biden electors who argued the Republicans had defrauded voters.

The Biden electors are continuing their lawsuit against Chesebro and attorney Jim Troupis, who led Trump’s unsuccessful recount efforts in Wisconsin.

Under the agreement, the 10 Republicans who met as electors in 2020 cannot serve as electors in 2024 or any time Trump is on the ballot. Andrew Hitt, one of the GOP electors and the former chairman of the state Republican Party, said with a bellowing laugh Friday that he would not serve as an elector in 2024 even if he could.

“How do you convey laughter in a newspaper article?” he said when asked about serving as an elector again. “No, I will not be serving as an elector again.”

Hitt, who has been cooperating with federal special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation since May 2022, said Trump won’t have any problem finding people who will serve as electors next year if he wins the party’s nomination.

“There will be activists who will do it, no doubt about it. They’re not going to have a hard time because they still have people who will do anything for the guy,” said Hitt, who opposes Trump’s 2024 run.

Rohn Bishop, a former chairman of the Fond du Lac County Republican Party, said plenty of Wisconsin Republicans would be happy to serve as electors next year — but he expects they will convene only if the Republican nominee wins the popular vote in the battleground state.

“If he loses the state narrowly next time, they’re not going to make the same mistake and do an alternate slate of electors,” said Bishop, who is now the mayor of Waupun, Wis.

Even in 2020, some among the original slates of electors balked at the scheme to send their votes for Trump to Washington. Among the seven states’ 84 electors, 15 refused to join the Dec. 14, 2020, meetings, and they were replaced by alternates in a mad scramble executed by state party officials, overseen by the Trump campaign — and documented extensively in emails and texts surfaced by the U.S. House committee that last year examined the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Another force will make it harder for electors to do what Trump’s slates did in 2020: The Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation intended to prevent the chaos surrounding the events of the last presidential election.

Among other provisions, the new law empowers a state executive, typically the governor, to determine which slate of electors — Republican or Democratic — will be counted during the joint session of Congress. No other entity or individual is given the power to do so, and Congress is required to accept that determination, absent a court ruling.

The law also raises the threshold to lodge an objection during the joint session to at least one-fifth of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and makes it harder for state legislatures to disregard the results of the popular vote when determining which candidates’ electors are valid.

“It would be exceedingly difficult for there to be competing, valid slates [of electors],” said David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer and the executive director of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research. “A slate must be signed by the executive (defined as the governor in almost every case) and have the state seal affixed. If a new one comes in after the original one, but before the electors meet, the new one expressly supersedes the previous one.”

He added: “Hard to imagine a scenario where there are different slates, both signed by the governor and having the official seal, where one doesn’t supersede the other.”"

Humans are often to blame for illnesses and injuries that land animals in wildlife rehabilitation centers, a recent analysis in the journal Biological Conservation suggests. The broad-reaching study looked at animals housed in wildlife centers in the United States and Canada — and highlighted threats that humans present to over 1,000 species.

The study reviewed a data set of 674,320 digitized records from 94 wildlife centers throughout North America running from 1975 to 2019. The records contain information about all kinds of animals, but Eastern cottontail rabbits, Eastern gray squirrels, Virginia opossums, American robins and raccoons were most frequently admitted to wildlife rehab centers, although species varied by region.

Researchers pinpointed several leading reasons for animal injuries, including human disturbances such as collisions with vehicles, injuries and illness; predators; and poisonous substances.

Nearly 40 percent of all cases were caused by humans, and vehicle collisions were the main cause of injury, affecting 12 percent of animals admitted, the study says. Other dangers included fishing, collisions with buildings or windows, and run-ins with domesticated dogs and cats, researchers found. Reptiles suffered the highest proportion of human-caused rehab admissions.

Overall, human activities have “a large, negative impact on wildlife,” the researchers concluded.

Just 32.5 percent of animals ended up being released back into the wild, and about 9 percent were transferred to another facility or otherwise being treated; the rest died or were euthanized. More mammals were eventually released than any other type of animal.

Humans’ presence could be felt throughout the study, even in cases in which they did not directly injure the animals.

Lead poisoning and the effects of human-caused climate change also put animals in danger, with heat stress, die-offs and other issues linked to the extreme weather thought to be fueled by human activity. These factors affected different animals in different ways: For example, bald eagles were dramatically more likely to be admitted for lead poisoning than other animals, and red-tailed hawks bore the brunt of pesticide exposure."
110,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,"Educators hate holding kids back, but new research suggests it works",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/12/10/grade-retention-holding-kids-back/,"Listen 6 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Terry Grier once met a student at a Darlington County, S.C., middle school who looked much older than the eighth-graders in his class. When Grier, an experienced school district superintendent, asked the boy whether he was in the right place, the student smiled and said, “Yes, sir. This is the third year in a row that I have been in Ms. Jones’s class.”

Grier told me he recoiled at that, but he wasn’t surprised. Making low-performing students repeat grades is old-fashioned and controversial — but enshrined in many state laws. When President Bill Clinton in 1997 pushed for an end to what he called “social promotion” of students who failed to pass state standards, particularly in reading, only about six states required such exams. Now at least half of states do.

Most of the educators I know don’t like grade retention — the term of art for holding a student back. They prefer to help students improve without squashing their dreams and keeping them in place while their friends move forward. But they face new battles, because recent studies show making kids repeat grades can improve their future performance.

A 2017 study of third-graders retained in Florida for low scores found if they were given better instruction, they did better in eighth-grade math and 10th-grade reading than students who were not held back. They also hit better grade point averages in high school and took fewer remedial courses.

In October, RAND Corporation researchers Umut Ozek and Louis T. Mariano revealed that studies in Florida, Indiana, Mississippi, Chicago and New York City “provide evidence that grade retention in elementary school (generally grades 3-5), when implemented as part of a broader remediation effort, can increase test scores through middle school and reduce the need for future remediation.”

Such research has yet to persuade the many opponents of grade retention that there aren’t better ways to help children overcome academic weaknesses. Daniel Domenech, an experienced superintendent who led the School Superintendents Association, said holding students back was done in all the districts he served “primarily because of the lack of an alternative.” He said “if students were taught at the level that they are at and allowed to progress as they achieve mastery, there would be no need to retain them.”

The failure to arrange such progress for each child reflects “inadequacies in early childhood opportunities and in teacher education,” said former Montgomery County schools superintendent Jerry Weast.

Researchers who see good results from retention say it can work if done in grades three, four or five. Harvard scholar Martin West, one of the researchers on the 2017 study of Florida’s retention policy, said that state did “a reasonable job of this.”

“They asked retained students to attend summer reading camps, prescribed individualized plans to support their development as readers, and generally made big investments in improving reading instruction in the early grades,” he said.

West said opponents of grade retention are correct when they say being retained is a painful experience for many students. “My question would be whether they’re confident that the students wouldn’t have had an equally painful experience if they were advanced to the next grade and consistently faced content for which they were unprepared,” he said. “If retention is disabling for most students, then studies like ours would find large negative effects in both the short and long term. That’s not what we see.”

Ozek said “we view retention as a last resort for such cases, and we emphasize intervening at the first signs the student is at risk to maximize avoiding the need to go the retention route.”

Share this article Share

Ozek mentioned a 2020 study of Florida schools he did with University of Rochester scholar David Figlio found that “students who scored right below the retention cutoff, and hence were flagged for retention, were 10 percent less likely to take a remedial course in English language arts (ELA), 25 percent more likely to take an advanced course in ELA, 25 percent more likely to take an advanced course in math, and 20 percent more likely to take an advanced course in science in middle school” compared with similar students who scored right above the retention cutoff and didn’t have to repeat a grade.

The data from Florida, which appears to provide the most detailed information on retention, indicates that about 10 percent of 213,192 third-graders were retained in the 2021-22 school year. Another 15 percent were promoted to fourth grade despite poor scores on the state achievement tests because they showed other signs of reading proficiency, were immigrants still learning English or had disabilities that exempted them from retention.

The number of states using tests to determine retention has increased, but it is not clear whether more students are being retained now than when Clinton complained about the practice.

West said one federal report suggests that the percentage of students retained each year declined between 1996 and 2020. “One possibility is that the percentage of students who were retained specifically for academic reasons did increase over this time period,” he said, “at least in states with test-based promotion policies, while the percentage retained for other reasons, such as behavioral or social-emotional reasons, went down.”

Ozek said “another possibility is that the increasing popularity of early grade retentions reduced the need for retentions in later grades.”

The day after Grier encountered the South Carolina student who had repeated eighth grade twice, he moved the boy to a high school. The student was enrolled in choral music and English I, which he passed with help from a tutor.

He enrolled in summer school to continue catching up, but Grier left the district that summer and lost track of the student. One of the problems with retention is the failure to keep track of what happens to students in many states after they repeat a grade."

Linebacker Von Miller remains eligible to play for the Buffalo Bills, as the NFL has not put him on paid administrative leave via placement on the commissioner’s exempt list. That could change, according to a person familiar with the situation, if prosecutors formally pursue a criminal charge against him. Miller turned himself in to police in the Dallas area Nov. 30 after authorities issued an arrest warrant for him in connection to a case of alleged domestic violence.

In the meantime, Miller could play when the Bills face the Kansas City Chiefs in a late-afternoon game Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium.

“We’re not investigators,” Bills General Manager Brandon Beane said during a news conference last week. “We weren’t present or anything like that. So you have to let all that stuff play out and we’ll follow the lead of the NFL.”

The league generally allows a legal case to proceed to completion before imposing any disciplinary measures under the personal conduct policy, including a potential suspension without pay.

But the NFL also has the authority to put a player on paid leave while the legal process plays out. The policy allows the league to take that step when a player is formally charged with a felony or a crime of violence; when an investigation leads the commissioner to believe a player may have violated the policy in that way; or when a violation relating to a crime of violence is alleged but further investigation is needed. A player placed on the exempt list is ineligible to participate in practices or attend games.

Miller turned himself in to the Glenn Heights, Tex., police, authorities said. He was taken to the regional jail in DeSoto, Tex., where he posted a $5,000 bond and was released, according to the police. Miller is accused of assaulting a pregnant woman, according to the Dallas Police Department.

“You never want anyone in your organization … to have an allegation like that,” Beane said. “That’s a very serious nature and something that we’re going to take every precaution with. Culture and character and all those things are super important. But we also have to remember we have to let the legal process play out. And the guy that we’ve known here for a year and a half, that seems out of character.”

Beane said the Bills were “comfortable as we sit here today with him being here and him being part of the team.” He declined to reveal specifics about the conversations that team officials had with Miller about the alleged incident.

“We’re just trying to do the right thing,” Beane said. “And you’re never going to make 100 percent [of] people happy. If we went the other way and said he can’t play, there’d be people upset about that, too.”

The Bills endured another significant controversy last week. Coach Sean McDermott said Thursday that he regretted referencing the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks during a team meeting that reportedly occurred in training camp in 2019.

Those issues come during a trying season in which the Bills have struggled to a record of 6-6 while attempting to reach the AFC playoffs for a fifth straight year.

No vote expected on Brady’s Raiders deal: NFL team owners, barring a last-minute shift, are not expected to vote during their one-day meeting this week in the Dallas area on Tom Brady’s proposed deal to purchase a minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, according to a person familiar with the situation.

But the deal between Brady, the seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback who announced his retirement as an NFL player in February, and Raiders owner Mark Davis is “definitely not dead,” according to another person with knowledge of the deliberations.

The NFL finance committee previously raised concerns about some aspects of the proposed deal, including the discounted price that Davis was offering Brady, according to three people familiar with the discussions. But the finance committee was leaving open the possibility of revisions being made to the deal for it to gain the committee’s approval.

The transaction ultimately would have to be ratified by 24 of the 32 owners. They generally follow the recommendation of the finance committee.

The owners are scheduled to meet Wednesday in Irving, Tex.

Bengals in compliance: The NFL found the Cincinnati Bengals have been compliant with reporting requirements regarding quarterback Joe Burrow’s wrist injury.

The league reviewed medical records, studied two weeks of practice video and interviewed Burrow and medical personnel, according to a person familiar with the deliberations, to reach its finding Saturday that the Bengals complied with injury-reporting rules.

Share this article Share

The NFL’s review began after Burrow left the Bengals’ loss Nov. 16 at Baltimore during the first half. He later underwent season-ending surgery for a torn ligament in his right wrist. Burrow did not appear on the Bengals’ injury report before the game. But he was shown on video wearing a brace or covering on his right wrist just after the team arrived in Baltimore.

Burrow and the Bengals said the injury occurred during the game, and Burrow said he had been wearing a compression sleeve on the team’s flight to Baltimore.

Wilson and the Jets: The New York Jets’ season probably is unsalvageable. They have lost five straight games to drop to 4-8. They’re 14th in the AFC. Their playoff chances are less than 1 percent, by some calculations, probably making any talk of a late-season return by quarterback Aaron Rodgers from his torn Achilles’ tendon moot.

But the Jets remain intriguing to watch, as quarterback Zach Wilson returns from his two-game benching to start Sunday’s game against the Houston Texans in East Rutherford, N.J.

Coach Robert Saleh said Wednesday that he expects Wilson, the No. 2 overall selection in the 2021 NFL draft, to be the Jets’ starter for the remainder of the season. Saleh said that he regarded Wilson as the quarterback who gave the Jets the best chance of winning without Rodgers, even when he benched Wilson in favor of Tim Boyle, who was released Monday. Wilson’s return to the starting role comes after the Athletic reported last week that he was hesitant to be the starter because of injury risks.

Wilson denied that report Wednesday. Now, he gets a late-season chance to try to prove that he deserves an opportunity with the Jets or perhaps another NFL team next season.

“It’s been challenging,” Wilson said. “I think everyone’s felt that. But extremely excited to get back on the field with these guys.”

More ‘Brotherly Shove’ deliberations: The league and the NFL competition committee consistently have said they will resume their deliberations this offseason about the possibility of prohibiting the push-the-quarterback sneak popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles with Jalen Hurts.

Jeff Miller, the NFL’s executive vice president of communications, public affairs and policy, said in a video news conference Thursday that speculation that Commissioner Roger Goodell seeks to have the play banned is inaccurate.

“That is not true,” Miller said. “He and the competition committee have asked a number of us to take a look at the play, to research it, to do analytics against it, looking at injury rates and some other factors, including getting feedback from coaches. That work is ongoing and it will be a topic of conversation, I am sure, with the competition committee. But there have been no decisions or bias for or against the play at this point.”

The league and competition committee considered proposing a ban on the play last offseason but took no action. They will revisit the issue this offseason while also considering a ban on hip-drop tackles and contemplating major changes to the kickoff.

Lawrence and the Jaguars: It didn’t look particularly promising when quarterback Trevor Lawrence suffered an ankle injury late in regulation during the Jacksonville Jaguars’ overtime loss Monday night to the Cincinnati Bengals. Lawrence had his right ankle twisted awkwardly on a sack and had to be helped to the locker room after declining to be taken from the field on a cart.

But Lawrence, after being diagnosed with a high ankle sprain, was back on the practice field Thursday and Friday with the Jaguars, albeit as a limited participant. The Jaguars listed him as questionable for Sunday’s game at Cleveland. Coach Doug Pederson said during a news conference Friday that Lawrence’s status for Sunday probably would be a game-time decision.

Backup C.J. Beathard finished the game Monday night for the Jaguars. He was plagued last week by a left shoulder injury, but he practiced fully Friday and is in line to start if Lawrence is sidelined.

Browns Coach Kevin Stefanski, meanwhile, declined to name his starter. Veteran Joe Flacco could make his second straight start. But rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson is available after being cleared under the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Vikings coordinator arrested: Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator Wes Phillips was expected to accompany the team on its trip Saturday to Las Vegas for Sunday’s game against the Raiders after he reportedly was arrested Friday night in the Minneapolis area and charged with misdemeanor operation of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

The Vikings confirmed Phillips’s arrest in a statement Saturday.

“Wes immediately notified the team following his arrest last night,” the team said. “This morning we contacted the NFL, and after internal discussion, made the decision Wes will travel with the team to Las Vegas this afternoon. We will continue to gather information regarding the incident and have further comment at the appropriate time.”

Jefferson’s return: Wide receiver Justin Jefferson is expected to be back in the Vikings’ lineup for Sunday’s game against the Raiders.

Jefferson missed the Vikings’ last seven games because of a hamstring injury. He returns to a Vikings team that is without quarterback Kirk Cousins, who suffered a season-ending torn Achilles’ tendon in his right leg in the third game of Jefferson’s absence.

The Vikings won their first five games without Jefferson. But they’ve lost their past two and are coming off their bye week, so they don’t have a victory since Nov. 12. At 6-6, they hold the No. 6 seed in the NFC. Coach Kevin O’Connell has stuck with Joshua Dobbs as the starter at quarterback, even with Dobbs coming off a four-interception outing in the Vikings’ defeat to the Chicago Bears."

After a long day of fishing in Key Largo, Fla., Dillon Angulo and Naibel Benavides Leon pulled to the side of the road and hopped out of their Chevy Tahoe to look at the stars. Suddenly, Angulo said, the “whole world just fell down.” A Tesla driving on Autopilot crashed through a T intersection at about 70 mph and flung the young couple into the air, killing Benavides Leon and gravely injuring Angulo. In police body-camera footage obtained by The Washington Post, the shaken driver says he was “driving on cruise” and took his eyes off the road when he dropped his phone.

But the 2019 crash reveals a problem deeper than driver inattention. It occurred on a rural road where Tesla’s Autopilot technology was not designed to be used. Dash-cam footage captured by the Tesla and obtained exclusively by The Post shows the car blowing through a stop sign, a blinking light and five yellow signs warning that the road ends and drivers must turn left or right.

Video obtained exclusively by The Washington Post shows the moment a Tesla operating on Autopilot crashed into a truck parked on a rural Florida road in 2019. (Video: TWP)

The crash is one of at least eight fatal or serious wrecks involving Tesla Autopilot on roads where the driver assistance software could not reliably operate, according to a Post analysis of two federal databases, legal records and other public documents. The first crash occurred in 2016, when a Tesla plowed under a semi-truck on a U.S. route in Florida. The most recent was in March when a Tesla in Autopilot failed to slow down, police said, and hit a teenager stepping off a North Carolina school bus at 45 mph.

In user manuals, legal documents and communications with federal regulators, Tesla has acknowledged that Autosteer, Autopilot’s key feature, is “intended for use on controlled-access highways” with “a center divider, clear lane markings, and no cross traffic.” Tesla advises drivers that the technology can also falter on roads if there are hills or sharp curves, according to its user manual. Even though the company has the technical ability to limit Autopilot’s availability by geography, it has taken few definitive steps to restrict use of the software.

Nor have federal regulators taken action. After the 2016 crash, which killed Tesla driver Joshua Brown, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called for limits on where driver-assistance technology could be activated. But as a purely investigative agency, NTSB has no regulatory power over Tesla. Its peer agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the Department of Transportation, has the authority to establish enforceable auto safety standards — but its failure to act has given rise to an unusual and increasingly tense rift between the two agencies.

In an October interview, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the 2016 crash should have spurred NHTSA to create enforceable rules around where Tesla’s technology could be activated. The inaction, she said, reflects “a real failure of the system.”

“If the manufacturer isn’t going to take safety seriously, it is up to the federal government to make sure that they are standing up for others to ensure safety,” Homendy said. But “safety does not seem to be the priority when it comes to Tesla.”

Of NHTSA, Homendy added, “How many more people have to die before you take action as an agency?”

In a statement to The Post, NHTSA said the agency “always welcomes the NTSB’s input and carefully reviews it — especially when considering potential regulatory actions. As a public health, regulatory and safety agency, safety is our top priority.”

NHTSA said it would be too complex and resource-intensive to verify that systems such as Tesla Autopilot are used within the conditions for which they are designed, and it potentially would not fix the problem.

Homendy was skeptical of that explanation, saying agencies and industries frequently respond to NTSB recommendations by citing the impossibility of their requests — until additional carnage forces their hand.

NHTSA said it is focused instead on ensuring drivers are fully engaged while using advanced driver-assistance systems.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. In court cases and public statements, the company has repeatedly argued that it is not liable for crashes involving Autopilot, because the driver is ultimately responsible for the trajectory of the car. After a fatal crash in 2018, Tesla told NTSB that design limits for Autopilot would not be appropriate because “the driver determines the acceptable operating environment.”

The string of Autopilot crashes reveals the consequences of allowing a rapidly evolving technology to operate on the nation’s roadways without significant government oversight, experts say. While NHTSA has several ongoing investigations into the company and specific crashes, critics argue the agency’s approach is too reactive and has allowed a flawed technology to put Tesla drivers — and those around them — at risk. The approach contrasts with federal regulation of planes and railroads, where crashes involving new technology or equipment — such as recurring issues with Boeing’s 737 Max — have resulted in sweeping action by agencies or Congress to ground planes or mandate new safety systems. Unlike planes, which are certified for airworthiness through a process called “type certification,” passenger car models are not prescreened, but are subject to a set of regulations called Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which manufacturers face the burden to meet.

NHTSA’s approach also contrasts with how some states, localities and even companies have responded to incidents involving autonomous vehicles. After a fatal crash in 2018, Uber halted its driverless program amid official scrutiny by NTSB before offloading the program entirely. And in October, the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended permits for driverless car company Cruise after one of its cars dragged a jaywalking pedestrian about 20 feet after she had been hit by a regular car. Cruise also grounded its entire U.S. fleet and issued a voluntary recall.

Steven Cliff, a former NHTSA chief who left the agency last year, acknowledged the approach taken by regulators can appear too cautious at times, but said the agency was aggressive under his watch — mandating companies such as Tesla report their data on crashes involving advanced-driver assistance-systems.

But advancing from the data collection stage to a final rule, where new regulations are adopted if necessary, can take years, he said.

“Tesla’s philosophy is, let the operator determine for themselves what is safe but provide that operator a lot of flexibility to make that determination,” he said.

He said Tesla could easily limit where the technology can be deployed. “The Tesla knows where it is. It has navigation. It knows if it’s on an interstate or an area where the technology wasn’t designed to be used,” he said. “If it wasn’t designed to be used there, then why can you use it there?”

‘Operational Design Domain’

In all, The Post has identified about 40 fatal or serious crashes since 2016 involving Tesla’s driver assistance software; the bulk of them were identified through NHTSA’s data, and the rest surfaced through lawsuits. Many occurred on controlled-access highways. But at least eight occurred on roads where Autopilot was not designed to be used.

In another six crashes, it was unclear whether the Tesla driver had engaged Autopilot or the more sophisticated Full Self-Driving mode. Full Self-Driving is designed to recognize stop signs, traffic lights, cross traffic and other hazards on surface streets.

After the 2019 Key Largo crash, Angulo filed a lawsuit arguing that Tesla’s marketing creates a false sense of complacency for drivers, setting the stage for the crash that killed his girlfriend. The suit also accuses Tesla of negligence, including for the ability to activate the feature outside of its so-called “Operational Design Domain,” which is an industry term for the specific locations and sets of circumstances for which Autopilot is designed. It is one of about 10 such cases expected to go to trial over the next year.

As a result of the crash, Angulo suffered a traumatic brain injury, a broken jaw and a broken pelvic bone, among other injuries. Even today, he said, the sight of a Tesla makes him wince.

“How could they allow something like this on the road?” Angulo said in an interview. “It’s like a deadly weapon just driving around everywhere. And people, pedestrians like me, how are we supposed to know stuff like this? It shouldn’t be allowed.”

In a sworn deposition last year first detailed by Reuters and obtained by The Post, Tesla’s head of Autopilot, Ashok Elluswamy, said he was unaware of any document describing limitations on where and under what conditions the feature could operate. He said he was aware of some activation conditions for Autopilot, including the presence of lane lines, and that it is safe for “anyone who is using the system appropriately.”

But he said he did not know what the term “Operational Design Domain” means. “I’ve heard those words before, but I do not recall much more than that,” he said.

Tesla’s commitment to driver independence and responsibility is different from some competitors, whose driver-assistance technologies are loaded with high-definition maps with rigorous levels of detail that can tip vehicles off to potential roadway hazards and obstructions. Some manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors, also only allow the technology to work on compatible roadways that have been meticulously mapped.

Tesla relies on more rudimentary maps, The Post has previously reported. And its software has been found to contain exceptions to Autopilot rules in some locations, according to a former Tesla employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. For example, the software could be activated on the Embarcadero in San Francisco, a busy and fast-moving street along the water where pedestrians and bicyclists flock, the person said.

In 2022, a company supervisor was made aware that Autopilot could be activated in locations that were not controlled-access highways, according to the former employee. The software was interpreting Kato Road in Fremont, Calif. — a public thoroughfare adjacent to Tesla’s factory — as a private road so employees could test Tesla’s “Summon” feature, which allows owners to hail their vehicles from a parking spot with no one in the driver’s seat.

Summon is supposed to be limited to private property, and the employee said he raised the matter with a supervisor. Tesla fixed the loophole soon after, the person said.

‘Sensible safeguards’

Over the years, NTSB has repeatedly called on NHTSA to rein in Autopilot. It also has urged the company to act, but Homendy said Tesla has been uniquely difficult to deal with when it comes to safety recommendations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk once hung up on former NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt, said the former chief, who retired from the agency in 2021 when Homendy took over.

Sumwalt led NTSB when the agency released its investigation of the first fatal crash involving Autopilot, which resulted in a 2017 report calling on automakers including Tesla to equip their driver-assistance systems with “safeguards” that limit use of the technology to “conditions for which they were designed.” It also called on NHTSA to create binding rules that limit the technology’s use.

In 2020, NTSB issued a report on another fatal Tesla crash the prior year that cited both the semi-truck driver, who ran a stop sign, and the Tesla driver’s “over reliance” on Autopilot as probable causes of the crash. NTSB also cited NHTSA for the first time, saying its failure to “develop a method” that would “limit the use of automated vehicle control systems to the conditions for which they were designed” contributed to the crash.

In 2021, NTSB sent another letter to NHTSA about Autopilot, calling on the agency to “include sensible safeguards, protocols, and minimum performance standards to ensure the safety of motorists and other vulnerable road users.”

Last year, several senators joined the chorus, saying they were “deeply troubled” by the number of Autopilot crashes. They called on NHTSA to “use all its investigative and regulatory authorities to shed needed light on this out-of-control industry and impose guardrails to prevent more deadly crashes.”

NHTSA has implemented some of NTSB’s recommendations, including increased data reporting for crashes involving autonomous and driver-assistance software. Meanwhile, NHTSA has an “active investigation” into Tesla’s Autopilot, and it issued a recall on certain Tesla models equipped with Full Self Driving after determining that it “led to an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety based on insufficient adherence to traffic safety laws.”

But NHTSA has not adopted any rules that would limit the technology to where it is meant to be used, despite exploring how it could ensure such software adheres to its design limits.

In one of her latest attempts to spur action, Homendy sent a letter directly to Musk in August 2021. She urged him to implement safeguards to “limit” the technology to conditions it was designed for, among other recommendations.

“If you are serious about putting safety front and center in Tesla vehicle design,” she wrote, “I invite you to complete action on the safety recommendations we issued to you four years ago.”

Musk, she said, never responded."
114,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Banning fossil fuels is now a make-or-break issue at climate talks,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/10/un-climate-conference-fossil-fuels-dubai/,"Listen 10 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

DUBAI — For 30 years, with temperatures and sea levels rising, global negotiators have managed to discuss the health of the planet without addressing the root cause of the problem. In meeting after meeting, document after document, even in the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, one phrase has been conspicuously absent: any mention of fossil fuels.

But that could be on the verge of changing.

At this year’s U.N. Climate Change Conference in Dubai, known as COP28, nations have at last turned their attention to this highly contested driver of planetary warming and are considering historic language pledging to close out the era of coal, oil and gas.

There are many camps in this debate. Some oil-rich nations want no language at all. Some, such as the United States, support a “phasedown” of fossil fuels. Others see that as far too weak, and are demanding a clear timeline for a “phaseout” of fossil fuels.

Such a move would mark a belated recognition that the past strategy — of pledging to reduce emissions without overtly saying how — has not been sufficient. And while a strong fossil-fuel phaseout statement may not be enough to keep warming below the target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, it would improve the odds that humanity could avoid the worst expected impacts of climate change.

After more than a week of talks in Dubai, countries have just a few days — and sleepless nights — left to figure out the language of a potential agreement. In so doing, they are confronting many of the sticking points that stymied talk about fossil fuels in past years, even with the clear-cut science. There are influential lobbying groups, vast financial interests, and plenty of contradictions: Some countries advocating for a reduction in fossil fuels, such as the United States, continue to ramp up their oil and gas production.

But even if COP28 were to collectively advocate a rapid end to burning of fossil fuels, the real-world results are less than clear. Would nations made wealthy by oil and gas suddenly leave it in the ground?

“This is really difficult stuff. We are talking about the future of humanity, the future of economic structures and geopolitics,” said Hana AlHashimi, the lead negotiator for the United Arab Emirates, the oil-rich nation that is hosting this year’s talks.

Year by year, the annual U.N. climate talks evolve to take on their own personality, with one particular issue rising as a priority. Last year’s climate conference, in Egypt, used its political capital to approve a fund that would help poorer countries with climate-related crises. This year’s event, with the backdrop of Dubai’s oil wealth, and during the world’s hottest year on record, has become the fossil fuel COP.

Activists on Saturday held a “die-in” protesting fossil fuels in Dubai, and negotiators from many countries have prioritized that issue above all others.

Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s minister of environment and climate change, said that island nations have insisted that the climate summit end with strong language on fossil fuels.

“If we don’t — we could have the best COP ever and agree on everything else — it’s going to be viewed as a failure by the environmental movement and some countries,"" he said.

Even if such a pledge does come to fruition, there will be much work ahead to make the language transformative. Globally, countries are spending a record $7 trillion on fossil fuel subsidies. There is still not enough financing for renewables, which would have to come online with significantly more speed to give the world the energy it needs. And some past COP agreements, even those celebrated at the time, have not led to the desired results.

Two years ago in Glasgow, Scotland, nations called for a “phasedown of unabated coal power” — the closest they have come to date to pulling back from fossil fuels, though in this instance without mentioning oil and gas. Still, China is steadily approving new coal projects.

“We need stringent language that doesn’t have any loopholes,” said Rachel Cleetus, the policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The issue is far from resolved. While some climate issues put the poorest or politically weakest nations at the center, the fossil fuel debate at COP28 hinges on the interests of the world’s biggest powers — namely the United States, China, the European Union and the Gulf nations. At the venue in Dubai — a vast complex of showy architecture, shaded walkways and food trucks — the main parlor game has been trying to theorize how those heavyweights might trade favors, compromise and bargain into the final days.

The biggest sticking point, by all accounts, is Saudi Arabia, the second-largest oil producer behind the United States. Their negotiators hold the power to scuttle any deal under U.N. rules requiring unanimity.

The kingdom’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, told Bloomberg TV several days ago that his country would “absolutely not” endorse language calling for a phasedown — a position consistent with Saudi Arabia’s stance at earlier COPs. Several news agencies reported that the OPEC oil cartel this week had warned its member countries, along with a handful of other oil-friendly nations, to reject any text that addresses fossil fuels.

Separate from the “die-in” on Saturday, a group of climate activists sat down in front of the exhibition booth for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries at COP28 and raised their hands, painted with the message that “Your time … is over.”

“We will not let you water down the final text of the negotiations,” one activist said, as the OPEC representatives looked on silently.

As it stands now, the text leaves almost all possibilities open. The working draft is made public at intervals throughout the two-week talks, and the latest iteration includes five options, ranging from a fossil fuel phaseout “in line with best available science” to having no mention of fossil fuels whatsoever.

Another option, which the United States has publicly backed, calls for a phaseout of unabated fossil fuels. This qualifier might seem like a technicality, but it speaks to a significantly different path than an outright phaseout, as it would allow for oil and gas to still be used in tandem with technology that captures and stores their greenhouse gas emissions.

The technology has had an uneven track record so far — Al Gore recently called it a “research project” in an interview with Reuters — but many fossil fuel companies are investing heavily in it and using it as the basis to project cleaner operations for decades to come.

U.S. climate envoy John F. Kerry has said that Washington supports language “requiring the phaseout of unabated fossil fuels, and we will continue to support that language.”

Many climate experts say a long-range target for a fossil fuel phasedown — say, mid-century — won’t be as meaningful as a pledge to wean off dirty fuel more quickly. Climate science shows that the next several years are crucial. One recent projection showed that the world has seven years remaining at current emissions before it might heat beyond the 1.5-degree threshold written into the Paris agreement. Carbon capture technology will not be constructed quickly enough to lead to meaningful emissions reductions during that time frame.

In an interview with The Post, Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said the “story of carbon capture and storage is one of disappointment.”

It should play a supporting — not central — role in the future, he said.

His agency recently released a report on the oil and gas industry showing the risk of putting too much stock in the technology: If oil and gas production continued as planned into the mid-century, with the idea that all emissions would be captured, the electricity needed just to power that process would be as great as the electricity used by the world in 2022.

European officials said this is one of the most challenging sticking points for negotiators in Dubai. Many heavy industries rely on technology that needs fossil fuels — especially to provide enough heat to make things such as cement and steel. Continued use of fossil fuels — paired with carbon capture and storage, or CCS — is probably necessary for those industries to operate, but that is not a panacea, said officials including Wopke Hoekstra, the European commissioner for climate action.

“The reality we need to face and actually embrace is that we have to phase out fossil fuels, period. And that we do our utmost, that we come up with very ambitious language at this COP,” Hoekstra said at a news conference on Friday.

The notion of pledging for a fossil fuel phaseout or phasedown might seem fanciful given the setting: a nation that grew fabulously wealthy because of oil. The United Arab Emirates appointed as COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of its state-run oil company. Al Jaber said before COP28 that there is “no science” showing that a phaseout is necessary for the world to meet its 1.5-degree goal. But he drew fierce backlash from scientists and subsequently called a phaseout and phasedown “inevitable” and “essential.” He has also called for a “historic package of outcomes” — something that can only be possible if his country brokers some kind of fossil fuel agreement.

“It looked like they were not playing an honest broker role at first,” said one energy expert at COP28, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about the process. “But I think they have realized and responded to that.”

Experts who follow negotiations and who support a phasedown hope that the major economies can find common ground and then work on Saudi Arabia, which might feel precariously isolated. But even getting to that point would require China’s support, something it hasn’t offered at previous COPs. China and the United States struck a note of optimism several weeks before the climate summit, when they agreed to ramp up renewable energy “so as to accelerate the substitution for coal, oil and gas generation.”

Still, two months ago, the Group of 20 — which includes China, India and Saudi Arabia — failed to commit to language on reducing fossil fuels.

Asked on Saturday whether China would accept the call for a phaseout, Xie Zhenhua, the special envoy on climate change, said the options could still evolve beyond the ones in the working document. China, he said, hopes to find wording that is “maximally inclusive and acceptable to all parties, even if it’s not totally satisfactory to any one party.”"

Sixty-six million years ago, an almost nine-mile-wide meteor crashed into Earth and triggered a mass extinction of dinosaurs. But what if that’s not the whole story? A series of enormous volcanic eruptions — occurring before, during and after the meteor collision — were also complicating life for the reptiles. Gases emitted from the eruptions shielded sunlight and likely significantly cooled the atmosphere beyond the dinosaurs’ comfort for centuries, recent research shows.

“This cooling changed the climate so much that it made it difficult for the dinosaurs, and the meteorite was the coup de grâce,” said Don Baker, study co-author and geochemist at McGill University. “That was the final extinction event, but they were not in good shape before the time of that meteorite impact.”

Earth’s temperature was dropping long before the meteorite hit, according to some research. But scientists hadn’t pinpointed a cause, so Baker and his team looked to a volcanic explanation.

A meteorite is a popular theory for the demise of the dinosaurs (birds aside), but volcanic eruptions are another contested explanation. The evidence lies in one of the largest volcanic provinces in the world, known as the Deccan Traps. Located in present-day west-central India, the area had massive outpourings of lava around the time the dinosaurs went extinct.

If you visit the site today, the lava from past eruptions can be seen stacked on each other in layers. In some parts, the layers are more than a mile thick and cover nearly 200,000 square miles (around the size of Oregon and Washington state combined).

Any eruption of that size would have drastically changed the environment, expelling gasses — like sulfur dioxide — that would have reflected sunlight back into space and caused cooling at Earth’s surface on large scales.

“The eruptions were continuous, one on top of another, for hundreds of thousands of years according to our dating,” said Paul Renne, co-author and geochronologist at University of California at Berkeley, in an email. “This level of volcanic activity, covering hundreds of thousands of square miles, is rare in geologic history.”

To investigate the gases emitted during these ancient lava flows, the team hammered out rocks in the Deccan Traps. Elements are largely lost to the atmosphere during an eruption, but a small portion are trapped in minerals as the lava cools at the end of an eruption.

The team developed a new technique to measure the amount of sulfur and fluorine in the minerals. They also recreated conditions in a lab to determine how much sulfur or fluorine would be needed in the environment to get that amount in the crystal.

Right before the supposed dinosaur-killing meteorite hit Earth, the team found the lava flows had decent concentrations of fluorine that could have had local effects, such as acid rain, plant failure or animal poisoning. But sulfur concentrations in the lava flows were extremely high — enough to trigger a major drop in temperature around the world.

The volcanic eruptions would have been unlike anything we would have experienced in human history. A relatable, but very inadequate, comparison would be the powerful eruption from Mount Pinatubo in 1991. It ejected on the order of ten cubic kilometers of magma and caused global temperatures to drop by around half a degree over a year.

By comparison, some of these ancient eruptions ejected up to a hundred cubic kilometers, Baker said. The temperature drop would be much more dramatic and persistent, with a seemingly perpetual winter (cue Game of Thrones music). He points to some research that suggests the drop could have even been 10 degrees Celsius cooler over a decade.

“If you have these big eruptions, every ten years, the temperature drops and it stays cold,” said Baker. “Once you change the temperature, it’s global change, which is far more than temperature … that includes changing the wind patterns, rain patterns, everything else.”

The dinosaurs probably didn’t have time to adapt, if that was the case. The first temperature drop probably occurred in the span of less than a decade, with each year getting a little colder than it was before, Baker said.

It’s hard to decisively know what was happening with the dinosaurs during that time, but scientists are constantly trying to solve that puzzle. In the end, there likely isn’t a simple, or maybe even a single, explanation for why the dinosaurs went extinct, Baker said. But let the dinosaurs serve as an example of what happens when Earth changes too fast — a cautionary story for climate change today.

“Rapid climate change, no matter how it happens, can be very dangerous for species on Earth,” Baker said. “Any sort of rapid change faster than evolution can adapt or migration can adapt to is going to be problematic.”"

Last year, it seemed inevitable that a proposal to build a massive data center complex in a mostly rural part of Prince William County would be approved, especially after county supervisors changed planning guidelines for that area to accommodate data centers. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight Now, some doubt hangs over the multibillion-dollar “Digital Gateway” project as it heads to a final vote Tuesday. The county’s planning staff released a report last week recommending that the proposal by two companies to rezone the area near a Civil War battlefield site and a large retirement community be denied.

Democratic county supervisors, who hold a 5-3 majority, have generally indicated support for the proposal by two companies — Compass Datacenters and QTS Data Centers — to approve zoning changes for the area that would allow as many as 34 data centers on the site in the county’s Gainesville area. But the report lends fuel to opponents of data centers in the region, who have been at the forefront of a backlash against the industry’s expanding presence in Northern Virginia. In Prince William, that movement led to board chair Ann B. Wheeler’s Democratic primary election defeat by Digital Gateway critic Deshundra Jefferson, who won the general election in November.

The idea for the Digital Gateway was initially presented by local property owners who were frustrated by traffic from nearby Interstate 66 and the towering transmission lines cutting through the area that serve the world’s largest concentration of data centers in neighboring Loudoun County.

With those property owners arguing that their once bucolic community is also now more suitable for data centers, the plan was embraced by Wheeler and some other Prince William officials who want to catch up to Loudoun in becoming a major hub for internet traffic.

Late last month, the board approved another controversial data center project called Devlin Technology Park — where nine data center buildings will be constructed about five miles from the Digital Gateway site. Outside that meeting, about 80 residents angrily shouted “put it in your own backyard!” at a smaller number of union workers chanting about construction jobs that are created by data centers.

Tuesday’s meeting will probably be just as heated.

Ally Stoeger, a Gainesville-area resident, said the anger stems from the pace at which a cluster of data center projects — some near homes and schools — has emerged during the past five years in western Prince William, fueled by the world’s increasing hunger for smartphones and other technology that require massive amounts of data to be processed.

“We don’t even have the opportunity to see the impact of what gets built before we approve even more,” Stoeger said. “The speed of this makes us feel like we’re being rolled over.”

Both sides agree that the Digital Gateway project presented by Compass Datacenters and QTS Data Centers will fundamentally shape the county’s future.

But they differ on how.

Supporters point to the $400 million in annual tax revenue the completed project is expected to generate, which they say could go toward schools and other services in the steadily growing county of 487,000 residents.

Those against the plan say the hulking structures and the electric infrastructure needed to support them will ruin the view at Manassas National Battlefield Park and in some portions of the Heritage Hunt retirement community, no matter how well they’re camouflaged.

They also argue that the buildings will damage the environment by adding impermeable surfaces, cause noise problems and put extra strain on the regional power grid, which has already been struggling to keep up with the demand brought by new data center construction in Northern Virginia.

Compass said its portion of the project will require as much as 1.7 gigawatts of electric capacity when completed, enough to power nearly 1.3 million homes. QTS said it would have about 60 percent of that capacity.

The three rezoning applications that make up the Digital Gateway project have experienced some setbacks, including the most recent staff report.

Earlier this year, the county planning commission also recommended against approving an earlier iteration of the plan. Among other things, that version lacked details on where the buildings would go and where electric substations used to route power into the buildings would be installed, the county said.

The latest versions show that the nearest distance between a data center and a home in the Heritage Hunt community will be about 1,000 feet — with slightly lower heights than originally proposed, the buildings painted to blend in with the landscape and trees in between. Substations will be in the rear of the buildings and covered so they’re not easily seen.

Compass and QTS said they could offer details on where buildings would go only for their first stages of development, with the first building expected to begin operating by about 2026 if the application is approved. In a fast-evolving industry, it’s hard to predict what the construction needs will be during what will be as many as 20 years of development, the companies said.

To deal with environmental concerns, Compass said it plans to install a system that will treat runoff from rain, then release it through a strawlike mechanism to reduce the flow into surrounding streams — with the goal of the discharge being as clean as discharge from undeveloped areas.

QTS has offered to replace every tree affected by the development with another one elsewhere on the site.

The two companies have also committed to developing a system of hiking trails, bike paths and other recreational park activities on about 270 acres of open space that will be publicly accessible, with portions of those trails winding past the data centers. QTS plans to purchase and set aside an additional 51 acres as parkland.

The companies said they will conduct noise studies before and after each building begins operation to ensure that they abide by the county’s noise ordinance, which limits daytime noise to 60 decibels — what a normal conversation sounds like from about three feet away — and 55 decibels at night.

The as many as 60 backup generators per building that will be included as a safeguard against power failures will be tested on a rolling basis once per month, the companies said.

In its report recommending denial, the county planning staff said the latest version still does not conform with the comprehensive plan for the area and other policies that encourage the depiction of site layouts for rezoning and special use permit applications. The report suggested that, if the board approves the plan, it tweak those requirements for the project so that it must be in “general” conformance instead of “substantial” conformance.

Both supporters and opponents of the project have aggressively lobbied the county board, including through making political donations.

“It’s a digital revolution,” Mary Ann Ghadbhan, an area property owner who helped initiate the plan, said. “We’re creating all kinds of new areas that people can hike and bike, being respectful of history, which they would never get if it stays private.”

Greg Akerman, president of the DC Metro Building Trades Union, estimated that the Digital Gateway will create 30,000 construction jobs, paying more than $100,000 per year, for multiple years.

“These are life-changing jobs that don’t require a college education,” he said.

Wheeler, the outgoing chair, called the plan “a visionary project that will transform Prince William County.”

With data center projects, in general, “I think people’s opposition is really based, oftentimes, on misinformation,” Wheeler said. “The way they’ve been portrayed is: They’re the end of civilization. I don’t perceive data centers being the end of civilization. I see them, in a lot of ways, being the future of civilization.”

Jefferson, the incoming board chair, said she has tried unsuccessfully to convince the board’s other Democrats that the plan should be rejected. She blamed board members from both parties for not pushing harder to build homes in western Prince William instead of data centers — whose expanding presence has now made it harder to justify placing more homes in some portions.

“Neither party has clean hands,” Jefferson said.

One example is the area that includes the Devlin Technology Park site. In 2014, that property was slated for a town center with 1,650 homes before Supervisor Jeanine Lawson (R-Brentsville), who represents that area, indefinitely tabled it amid local concerns about traffic and crowded schools.

The property is now home to several data centers — some near homes and a school — with the Devlin site being the last parcel to be rezoned to allow for more.

Lawson, who ran unsuccessfully for board chair in November, has expressed regret for being an early supporter of the industry, saying she has realized how damaging they can be to communities.

“We’re all human; we’ve all made mistakes,” she said before she and the board’s other two Republicans voted against the Devlin project last month. “If I could reverse the clock, I would absolutely make changes on some of my land use votes, in particular data centers.”

Supervisor Kenny Boddye (D-Occoquan), who said he is still undecided on the Digital Gateway plan, predicted that, given the controversy it has generated, the county will be reluctant in the near future to take on another project of that size in that part of the county — particularly because Jefferson has said she wants to limit the industry’s growth in Prince William after she takes office in January.

“There definitely needs to be some time to reflect and look at our standards,” Boddye said. He cited a county work group that includes residents who live near data centers that is reviewing issues related to noise, and the fact that the county has yet to update its overall land-use policies under a revised comprehensive plan approved last year.

“For my one-eighth of the board, I don’t necessarily want to vote on very many more data center projects, if it all, especially in that part of the county, until we get a better hold on some of these other initiatives,” he said.

County Supervisor Bob Weir (R-Gainesville), who represents the area and is opposed to the plan, said the project is probably headed toward some kind of litigation, regardless of Tuesday’s outcome.

“There’s a myriad of issues with this thing,” he said, including the earlier recommendations to reject the plan. “I’m pretty certain that whatever happens [on Tuesday], it’s going to court.”"

Former Trump attorney and ex-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani could be on the hook for up to $43.5 million in damages when a defamation lawsuit filed against him by two Georgia election workers goes to trial Monday in Washington, D.C. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight The showdown between the financially strapped Giuliani and the two temporary poll workers he baselessly accused of ballot tampering in 2020 will highlight a major court battle over false claims that became central to former president Donald Trump’s efforts to stay in power and is now at the heart of two criminal cases against him.

U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell has already found Giuliani liable for more than a dozen defamatory statements against Ruby Freeman and Wandrea ArShaye “Shaye” Moss, who are mother and daughter, leaving a jury of eight only to decide how much he should pay in damages for violent threats and harassment the pair received. Howell previously ordered Giuliani to pay the women $230,000 in legal fees and sanctions for failing to turn over relevant information. She said those failures, combined with Giuliani’s own admissions, compelled her to rule without a trial that he defamed both women, intentionally inflicted emotional distress on them as part of a civil conspiracy, and owes punitive damages.

At a recent pretrial hearing where Giuliani failed to show, Howell lashed defense attorney Joseph D. Sibley IV for the lapse. She warned she would not allow the defense to veer into “weirdness-land” by mounting claims she already rejected after Giuliani stonewalled the plaintiffs and agreed not to contest that he made false and defamatory claims about them.

Howell has suggested that Giuliani was trying to avoid disclosing information that could hurt him in other civil and criminal cases, and legal experts said the bill may be coming due for the former Manhattan U.S. attorney and host of his “America’s Mayor Live” YouTube show.

“I don’t want to overcomplicate this. Words have consequences, including for Mr. Giuliani,” said legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg, a former top FBI and Justice Department official. “We are all responsible for what we say and do. Mr. Giuliani doesn’t get a pass.”

The prospect of a humbling or debilitating financial judgment is only the latest legal risk for Giuliani. He faces state prosecution in Georgia, in part for his dissemination of the false claims about Freeman and Moss. He’s also considered an unindicted co-conspirator in Trump’s indictment on federal charges for obstruction of the 2020 election. He and one of his lawyers are being sued by Hunter Biden for allegedly mishandling the presidential son’s laptop, and that lawyer is accusing Giuliani of not paying legal bills. Giuliani also faces suit from a former employee accusing him of wage theft and sexual harassment.

Giuliani has pleaded not guilty in the Georgia criminal cases, and denied all claims of wrongdoing in all cases.

In a statement, Giuliani adviser Ted Goodman said, “The Rudy Giuliani you see today is the same man who took down the Mafia, cleaned up New York City and comforted the nation following September 11th.”

Goodman added, “In the fullness of time, this will be looked at as a dark chapter in our nation’s history, as those in power attempt to destroy their partisan political opposition in ways that cause great, irreparable harm to the U.S. justice system … While it may be President Trump, Mayor Giuliani, and others you disagree with politically today, it could be you and the people who share your beliefs, tomorrow.”

Giuliani on Monday will sit at the defense table and share a courtroom feet away from Freeman and Moss, who say they received death threats and were forced into hiding after Giuliani repeatedly claimed in the weeks after the 2020 election that misleading security video footage showed them bringing in “suitcases” full of fake votes for Joe Biden. Those claims were quickly debunked by election officials in Georgia, who explained that the so-called suitcases were regular ballot boxes and that nothing untoward had occurred at State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

Giuliani highlighted the Georgia video to other Trump advisers, according to court filings, and Trump went on to reference it in meetings with top Justice Department officials and in a phone call with Georgia’s secretary of state. During the call. the president asked for the state official to “find 11,780 votes.”

Freeman and Moss are expected to testify in the case, and the defense has signaled Giuliani could take the witness stand in his defense, although Howell warned Sibley about his client’s risk of self incrimination.

In court filings, attorneys for the Georgia workers hint they might put on new evidence about the scope of the alleged conspiracy between Giuliani, Trump, and participants with his legal and campaign teams. According to state prosecutors in Georgia, three Trump supporters tried to pressure Freeman into going along with the false claims, including by showing up at her home.

Attorney Michael J. Gottlieb said plaintiffs plan to show jurors relevant video excerpts of depositions taken under oath from Trump attorneys such as Jenna Ellis and Ray S. Smith III, even though the pair invoked the Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions hundreds of times. Plaintiffs said that other potential video evidence could include depositions taken from Giuliani adviser Bernard Kerik and lawyer Christina Bobb, who after the 2020 election volunteered for Trump’s legal team and reported for conservative cable news channel One America News.

“I lost my name, I’ve lost my reputation,” Freeman testified to the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attacks. “I’ve lost my sense of security — all because a group of people, starting with Number 45 and his ally Rudy Giuliani, decided to scapegoat me and my daughter, Shaye, to push their own lies about how the presidential election was stolen.”

In Giuliani’s defense, Sibley has argued that the election workers haven’t shown that his client’s statements caused all that harm, and that it would be unfair if “damaging statements made by other people” were attributed to him.

“Our argument is that the causal relationship to damages has to be linked” to the lawsuit’s specific allegations, Sibley said, adding in court papers that Giuliani reserved the right to ask Howell to revisit her orders and to appeal the case.

One America News was a co-defendant in the case, but entered a settlement with Moss and Shaye and was dismissed earlier from the lawsuit. OAN then reported that state officials concluded “there was no widespread voter fraud by elections workers who counted ballots at the State Farm Arena,” indicating that Freeman and Moss “did not engage in ballot fraud or criminal misconduct.”"

ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia — All she wanted was for her only child to go to school in her native tongue. In 2020, the ethnically Mongolian teacher living in the northern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia joined protests against a ban on most Mongolian-language education. Police cracked down hard. She was fired, hauled in for questioning and pushed into exile.

Three years later, her daughter is attending kindergarten here in Ulaanbaatar, where she can learn Mongolian and have pride in her heritage. But the former teacher fears that the Chinese security state could drag them back any day now.

China under Xi Jinping, its most powerful leader in decades, has progressively clamped down on ethnic minorities living on the country’s periphery: Tibetans, Uyghurs, Kazakhs and Mongols have all been targeted as part of Xi’s broader effort to crush dissent and force assimilation into the Han Chinese majority.

This effort has increasingly spread beyond China’s borders. To combat international criticism and silence diaspora communities, Beijing has used economic leverage and political pressure to enlist other countries to support Xi’s quest for absolute control.

Governments on China’s doorstep face a stark choice about how far to go along with Beijing’s global agenda. Shared culture and language make neighboring countries a natural destination for people fleeing China’s borderlands, but theses places are also the focus of efforts to defend against perceived foreign threats.

Beijing views exiles like the small but growing number of China-born Mongolians living in Ulaanbaatar as dangerous pockets of overseas resistance who could incite protest at home. Six people who spoke to The Washington Post all reported varying degrees of Chinese police harassment and intimidation through phone calls, messages and pressure on their families in China.

An emerging network of Mongolian activists and politicians want to protect these people, despite concern from Mongolian officials about angering China, the country’s largest trading partner. As a young democracy concerned for human rights, they argue, the country should be a haven for persecuted Mongols everywhere.

That tussle over influence and values is already underway in Mongolia, a former Soviet satellite state once known as “Outer Mongolia” where, after the fall of Communism in 1990, leaders built a multiparty democracy and reoriented the national identity around Mongol heritage and historical figures like Genghis Khan. The traditional Mongolian script abandoned in the Soviet era will be reinstated as an official language in 2025.

At the same time, the leaders of Mongolia, landlocked and dependent on China and Russia for trade and energy, have sought closer ties with the United States and its allies to shake off those overbearing neighbors.

Beijing has been watching this cultural evolution warily.

The Chinese Communist Party has governed the southern part of the Mongolian homeland — “Inner Mongolia” — since 1947 and is deeply suspicious of resurgent Mongol nationalism. It fears stronger ties of blood and language across the border will undermine assimilation and control.

Some Mongolian activists fear that the Chinese security state could use cross-border policing ties to target critics of China on Mongolian soil. They say that ethnically Mongolian Chinese citizens seeking refuge over the border — activists estimate there could be hundreds — have little to no protection from Chinese police harassment.

The 2020 protests in Inner Mongolia were a “wake-up call” that China wants to “eliminate the great desire and tradition of Mongols to learn their own culture and language,” former Mongolian president Tsakhia Elbegdorj told The Washington Post. “It’s a very dangerous policy.”

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment about Chinese security interests in Mongolia.

Free to speak Mongolian — but fearful of police

In a cafe on the ground-floor of a trendy apartment complex in southern Ulaanbaatar, where the snarl of traffic and dust fades into tree-covered mountains, the teacher grew pensive when talking about her struggle to stay in the country.

“Life has been very difficult,” she said through tears, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals from Chinese authorities. “Under Chinese rule, we lost our ancestral land and now they are taking away everything. Mongols in China will be Chinese within generations,” she said, suggesting they will be stripped of their identity.

China’s border may be nearly 900 miles away, but she is worried Chinese police could soon launch a formal investigation against her, which, under bilateral agreements, could easily result in her being detained and extradited.

Already in 2020, Chinese police seized on her social media posts as evidence of collusion with “hostile foreign forces” and interrogated her about a Mongolian activist, Munkhbayar Chuluundorj, she had barely heard of. Last year, the activist was jailed by Mongolian authorities for a decade on espionage charges. His family alleges the arrest was made to curry favor with Beijing.

More recently, the teacher said her fears intensified after she heard about an ethnic Mongol Chinese citizen, a dissident writer in his 80s, who was sent back to China. His case is at least the fifth instance of a Chinese passport holder being returned involuntarily from Mongolia since 2009, according to Safeguard Defenders, a human rights organization. In most cases, Mongolian authorities detain people and hand them over to China.

These events have made the teacher question whether she is really safe here. But she is determined to stay for her daughter. “If she can’t speak Mongolian, how can she say she is Mongol?” she asked.

A Mongolian jailed for working ‘against China’

The revolutionary statues and imposing colonnaded architecture of Sukhbaatar Square speak to Mongolia and China’s shared Communist history. But unlike Beijing’s heavily policed Tiananmen Square, where calls for democratic reform were brutally crushed in 1989, this expanse in central Ulaanbaatar remains the go-to place for a protest, just as it was in 1990 as the Soviet Union unraveled.

Share this article Share

For decades, Munkhbayar, the activist the teacher was questioned about, was a familiar face among the crowds protesting issues such as corruption, pollution and inflation. More often than not, the activist would energetically criticize his country’s close relationship with China.

Then last July, the activist was detained and then sentenced to a decade in jail for “collaborating with a foreign intelligence agency.”

The case, which activists consider the first incident of a Mongolian critic of China being targeted, has become a rallying point for Mongolians who fear China’s growing influence. A famous Mongolian poet, Tsoodolyn Khulan, was jailed for eight years on similar charges in July.

She had criticized the selection of an 8-year-old boy as the reincarnated head of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia. China has watched that process closely as it attempts to weaken influence of the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader. Beijing considers him a “separatist.”

In Munkhbayar’s trial, prosecutors argued that Munkhbayar was guilty of espionage because he attended a meeting of activists organized by an Indian diplomat to discuss the crackdown in Inner Mongolia. The convener was an intelligence agent, they claimed, and by speaking to him, Munkhbayar had “worked against China.”

“They used that phrase ‘worked against China’ more than 10 times,” his brother, Munkh-Erdene Chuluundorj, said. How could unwittingly speaking to a foreign agent — about a foreign country — count as espionage? The only possible explanation, he said, is that the charges are politically motivated.

Mongolian authorities and the Indian embassy in Ulaanbaatar declined to comment on Munkhbayar’s case, the details of which are classified.

Munkhbayar’s firebrand advocacy made him an outlier, but he is far from alone in advocating that Ulaanbaatar should do more to defend Mongols in China.

After writing a public letter to Xi criticizing China’s Mongolian-language restrictions in 2020, Elbegdorj, Mongolia’s president from 2009 to 2017, launched the World Mongol Federation, a nonprofit group that speaks up for Mongols facing oppression across the world.

“Our main goal is to keep Mongolian culture and Mongolian identity safe. That should be our right, and we are defending that,” the 60-year-old statesman said.

But Beijing’s hair-trigger sensitivity to issues regarding ethnic minorities makes aiding Inner Mongolians — whether in China or in Mongolia — complicated. Behind closed doors, Beijing has warned the Mongolian government against providing official support, said two people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. The Mongolian administration declined to comment on Chinese pressure on Inner Mongolians in the country.

China’s coming showdown with Mongol solidarity

Underlying concern about Chinese influence are deeper fears that hard-line security policies under Xi amount to a wider assault on Mongolian culture and heritage.

Watching Mongols in China fight to protect their heritage sparked sympathy in Mongolia, because “people saw how hard they are trying to preserve their language,” said Zolzaya Nyamdori, executive director of the World Mongol Federation.

Others see a chance that China’s crackdown on Mongolian-language education, combined with its increasingly aggressive actions inside Mongolia, could backfire by spurring on criticism of China and support for Chinese Mongols in Ulaanbaatar.

Muumiangan Tengerleg walks through Ulaanbaatar looking like he just stepped out of the ancient past, when Mongols ruled from the Carpathian mountains of central Europe to the Sea of Japan. An ethnic Mongol from China who came here with a Chinese mining company 15 years ago, he now wears a navy blue deel tunic and traditional yuden hat.

Over a dinner of deep-fried mutton pockets, the 41-year-old said that if the Chinese government pushes too hard it could “bring together their enemies’ enemies,” meaning Mongols in China and Mongolia or elsewhere. “Then we would have a showdown,” he warned.

Among Mongol literati, there are few more potent symbols of their endangered heritage than the dying use of that vertical writing system. Many consider Mongolia’s adoption of Cyrillic in the 1940s a grievous error of Communism. At the time, Mao Zedong let Inner Mongolians keep the script, in part to distinguish them from kinfolk across the border. Now Mongolia is trying to undo that mistake.

Five minutes east of Sukhbaatar Square, a famous paean to the beauty of Mongolian language is painted in brilliant blue graffiti on a two-story whitewashed wall. The artist, who goes by the pseudonym Ochirone, said watching videos of protests in Inner Mongolia during the pandemic inspired him to teach himself the script and incorporate it into his work “as a reminder that language is the biggest part of our national identity.”

For some in Mongolia, China’s crackdown on the Mongolian language brings up unpleasant memories of the Soviet Union’s suppression of Mongolian intellectuals.

“The situation is desperate,” said Mongolian novelist Puvsan Purevdorj, who wants his government to offer visas to Inner Mongolians so they can come teach Mongolians how to write vertically.

“In the past, we achieved independence by standing, carefully balanced, between Russian and Chinese influence. But now that balance is being lost,” he said. “If Russia becomes China’s little sister, what happens to Mongolia then?”"

BUENOS AIRES — Javier Milei, the libertarian economist embraced by far-right leaders around the world, is to be sworn in Sunday as president of Argentina, an office he won on promises to slash government spending and dramatically transform a country facing its worst economic crisis in two decades. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Milei, a political outsider who rose to prominence here as a television pundit, takes office exactly 40 years after Argentina’s return to democracy following the fall of its brutal military dictatorship. He clinched a stunning victory last month over the outgoing economy minister on a pledge to rip up the entire system.

During the campaign, Milei vowed to dollarize the economy, cut the number of government ministries by more than half, and shutter the central bank. But in the weeks since, the wild-haired radical has pedaled backward. Dollarizing and closing the central bank no longer appear to be on his immediate agenda; since the election he has focused instead on what he describes as the most urgent issue: cutting the fiscal deficit.

“There’s no money,” Milei has repeated, mantra-like, in each of his interviews as president-elect. “Fiscal balance is not up for discussion. Any minister who spends more, I will fire him.”

Argentina, which has struggled for decades with inflation and debt, has found itself excluded from international borrowing and failing to meet the terms of a bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The third-largest economy in Latin America has a plummeting peso, a poverty rate at 40 percent and a central bank with virtually no reserves.

Milei’s office has said closing the central bank remains a “nonnegotiable,” but his recent moves suggest it will at least be postponed. His appointment of Luis Caputo to head the Economy Ministry — the pragmatic former center-right finance minister and central bank chief has been dubbed the “Messi of finance” — has been received as an unexpectedly orthodox and market-friendly choice.

Some of Milei’s recent decisions, political analyst Juan Germano said, indicate “he’s trying to create something different from what was expected.”

Milei has also stepped back from some of his more aggressive foreign policy positions as he tries to mend relationships with leaders and countries with which he’ll now have to deal. During the campaign, he called China an “assassin” state, Pope Francis a “representative of the evil left” and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva a “communist.”

Share this article Share

Since winning the election, he has hailed Francis as the “most important Argentine in history,” invited Lula to his inauguration (the Brazilian has declined), and thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for his congratulations and offered wishes for the well-being of the Chinese people.

Prominent world leaders — including, reportedly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — are expected to attend Sunday’s inauguration. Also expected are several figures from the global far right, including former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and the leader of Spain’s Vox party, Santiago Abascal.

Former president Donald Trump told advisers he would like to attend the inauguration, but logistical hurdles make the visit unlikely, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations.

“The support from the right and from Trump and Bolsonaro gives a certain legitimacy to his figure, and to his political project,” Argentine political analyst Ana Iparraguirre said. Those alliances help give credibility to a president-elect whom Iparraguirre describes as more of an outsider than even Trump or Bolsonaro, having never had Trump’s experience in corporate America nor Bolsonaro’s in Brazil’s military establishment.

As Milei kicks off his presidency, political analyst Andrés Malamud said, he faces a daunting challenge: how to find the political and social support needed to implement reforms “that the majority believe are necessary but no one wants to pay for.” With control of fewer than 15 percent of the seats in Argentina’s lower house and fewer than 10 percent in the upper chamber, Milei will have to build alliances in Congress if he wants to pass his agenda.

That agenda will face an immediate test on Monday, when Milei is expected to unveil a comprehensive bill to overhaul the Argentine system with significant state deregulation, labor revisions, tax simplification and the elimination of primary elections. It could also involve the privatization of deficit-running state-owned enterprises.

The economy is expected to worsen before it gets better. Prices have been rising since Milei’s win. Economists expect a 20 percent increase in December alone, and increases to continue through the first months of a Milei government as the current government’s artificial price caps are lifted.

Sunday’s inauguration could provide a glimpse of what to expect of Milei in his first days — and whether he will push forward with his radical campaign promises or opt for a measured approach.

“I don’t know which Milei is going to show up on Sunday,” said Gregory Makoff, senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and an author who has written about Argentina’s debt crisis.

“Is he going to bring a chain saw, or will he bring his reading glasses?” Makoff asked. “He can be a peacemaker and a historical figure in Argentine history. This can be a major turning point, or it can be a major disaster. Whatever his plan, he has to deliver.”

Dear Amy: I’m a girl in 11th grade. In my freshman year, I made friends with “Ruby.” Over time I came to understand that I needed to end the friendship because of Ruby’s troubling behavior toward others and with me. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Now, two years later, I have a new friend, “Sammie,” who is also friends with Ruby. I hang out with Sammie only when Ruby is not present. On several occasions when I was talking with Sammie, Ruby joined the conversation. I was cordial, but I tried to limit my contact.

Now, when I see Ruby in the hall at school, Ruby waves enthusiastically and calls my name excitedly. I don’t want any contact with Ruby. I don’t want any association with this person’s bad actions, including occasionally being violent.

I don’t want to confront Ruby to say I’m not interested in friendship, but Ruby keeps making attempts, suggesting renewing the friendship. How can I gently distance myself from Ruby without causing conflict or hurting this person’s feelings?

— Desperate for Distance

Desperate: I think that you should continue along the careful course you’ve already set. Be polite, noncommittal, and avoidant.

Ruby might have changed somewhat during the many months you’ve successfully been distant, and while you should stay open to that possibility, you should not hang out with someone — anyone — who makes you uncomfortable. If Ruby confronts you about your distance, you might say something like, “I’m just hanging back, like usual.” Don’t let yourself be drawn in. You don’t need to answer loaded questions. Just be quiet and polite.

You don’t seem to have discussed Ruby with “Sammie” in any depth, and I also think this is wise, although I caution you that if Ruby hasn’t really changed, Sammie might be drawn into a friendship drama-triangle with Ruby at one point, Sammie at another, and you at the third. You might wonder whether Sammie is making the right choice regarding a friendship with this challenging person, but that friendship decision should be up to Sammie.

All of this is a reminder of what a social minefield high school can be, but you seem well-equipped to handle these challenges. If you were in my class, I’d give you extra credit for being both sensitive and smart.

Dear Amy: I am in my mid-30s. Over the past 10 years, my life has changed significantly. I’m married now, and my husband and I have two children. I’ve been struggling a bit lately with looking way down the road.

I used to be this very adventurous person. I was more or less up for anything. I’d describe myself as almost daring and unconventional. Yesterday my husband and I had a lengthy (and I mean lengthy) conversation about granite countertops. Our kids are 3 and 5 years old. Our world revolves around them, other families with children their ages, our jobs, and our house.

Share this article Share

I find myself wondering what happened to us and wondering how we can fix it.

— Safe but not Sound

Safe: First of all, even though you are deep into the wooliest part of your family life, you possess enough perspective to remember your earlier self with fondness — and you want to reclaim access to that person and those feelings. Some people dive into the granite conversation, and they stay there, forever, locked into choices and actions that are ultimately superficial.

My first suggestion is that you might consider the perspective that raising children at this stage is actually loaded with tiny adventures and some big challenges. You and your husband are scaling small mountains every day. Second, I think that you two should leave your children, and your home environment, for a weekend. Two whole days. While away, you should rest, relax, and make a determination to look at your larger life goals. Reach for the sky and write down your list.

You want more adventure: What are some ways you can get that as individuals, as a couple, and as a family? How can you raise your children to be free, brave, and bold souls? When you’re young, adventure has a way of finding you. When you’re older, you have to deliberately seek it. I hope you will.

Dear Amy: I thought your advice to “Wondering” was completely hysterical. Wondering was concerned about her boyfriend’s super-close relationship to his sister. You interpreted this as a “threat.” Give me a break!

Dismayed: “Wondering” already felt threatened by the relationship, and then the sister seemed to deliver an actual threat. I thought it was wisest to walk away."

Hi, Carolyn: My wife and I are two busy (but not crazy busy) professionals with three children in grade school. My wife just left for a week-long work trip. Without consulting me, she arranged for her parents to stay at our house “to help you with the kids.” It’s a bit of a rougher week, but I can manage the kids alone quite fine. I told her before she did this that, considering the inconvenience to her parents and the minimal benefit to me at best, they should stay home and I’d manage alone.

My father-in-law was too busy, so my mother-in-law came alone. Confirming my concerns, having to explain things to her during the morning rush was actually more work for me. I also feel the need to entertain her, whereas I would otherwise finish my workday and just wind down on my own. I feel guilty because my mother-in-law is busting her rear end to do something I neither need nor want, which she can barely accomplish, and which only my wife thinks is necessary.

To be clear, my mom-in-law is cool, we get along very well, she is full of good intentions, but I was looking forward to this week alone to work from home. My wife works from home and basically does not let me do that as well, even though I could, so I commute to work.

My wife says I am ungrateful and everyone is making sacrifices to help me, and my kids are happy to see their grandmother. (Note, they see their grandparents a lot.) To be honest, I also feel this is in small measure a way for her to control my comings and goings. I’m a perfectly normal if not boring guy, but she hates not knowing where I am at all times. Am I ungrateful?

— Normal Guy

Normal Guy: So it’s not enough that no one listens to you and you can’t get your share of the last word in your own home, but you also need to say thank you? And you’re a jerk if you don’t?

It took you a while to get there, but you got us there: Your marriage is a power struggle, and you’ve been on the losing end of it so long, I’m not sure you know it could be otherwise.

Who works where is a decision both halves of a couple make together — but you’re commuting by fiat. Who stays in your home is a decision both halves of a couple make together — but she booked her mom by fiat. What one parent needs when the other’s away is a decision the home-based parent makes for himself! — but she sent help by fiat.

How you feel about all of the above is 100 percent your business — but she’s presuming to correct how you feel.

Share this article Share

This suggests a serious problem, for a bunch of reasons.

First, it is dehumanizing. Such control is a violation of another person’s autonomy, bodily and otherwise. Either you are a worthy spouse and parent, or you are not — and if you are not, then it’s on her to seek legal recourse. She doesn’t get to have it both ways, to keep you as a partner while denying you partnership.

Second, control rarely stays in its current container. If she is so certain you can’t be a solo parent for a week that she voids your input entirely, then what other decisions does she feel certain you can’t make for yourself? Money, job, friends — any chance there’s a growing list of things you’ve had to give up? Or a sense your world grows ever smaller?

Third, your frustration is so palpable, it’s ticking. But blowing up, which is a fairly typical consequence of living under someone’s control, would further undermine your standing in your home. The cost of not finding your “no” while you can still maintain your composure can be surprisingly high.

Finally, but most consequentially, a power imbalance hurts your kids. Do you want them to be deferent to their partners to the point of self-erasure, or, alternately, to steamroll their wishes? And well before that — is your wife as certain and inflexible with your kids as she has been with you? This could constrain their development and, especially when they hit their oppositional peak in their teens, needlessly harm their relationships with each of you."

University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill has resigned after intense criticism from donors, alumni and others of her testimony at a congressional hearing about antisemitism on college campuses. Scott L. Bok, chair of Penn’s board of trustees, said in a note to the campus community that Magill will stay in the role until an interim president is appointed. After that, she will remain a tenured faculty member at the university’s law school.

The note was sent shortly before Bok announced that he would step down as board chair. In a separate note, he wrote: “Former President Liz Magill last week made a very unfortunate misstep — consistent with that of two peer university leaders sitting alongside her — after five hours of aggressive questioning before a congressional committee. Following that, it became clear that her position was no longer tenable, and she and I concurrently decided that it was time for her to exit.”

“The world should know that Liz Magill is a very good person and a talented leader who was beloved by her team,” he said. “She is not the slightest bit antisemitic. Working with her was one of the great pleasures of my life.”

The moves came a day before Penn’s board of trustees was set to meet amid the growing leadership crisis at the Ivy League school in Philadelphia.

“It has been my privilege to serve as President of this remarkable institution,” Magill said in the note to campus. “It has been an honor to work with our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and community members to advance Penn’s vital missions.”

Magill came under withering criticism after her testimony before a House committee on Tuesday in which she declined to state plainly that a call for genocide against Jews would violate the university’s code of conduct. Magill told Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) it would violate the school’s code of conduct “if the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes.” When pressed by Stefanik, Magill said: “It is a context-dependent decision, congresswoman.”

Magill appeared at the hearing alongside Harvard President Claudine Gay and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth. The presidents sought to defend values of free expression, while assuring that they would punish harassment or bullying. To many, though, the academics’ attempts at nuance came off as weak-kneed and legalistic equivocations.

Stefanik, who was among those who had called for Magill’s ouster, welcomed the news of her resignation. “One down. Two to go,” Stefanik wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday evening. “This is only the very beginning of addressing the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has destroyed the most ‘prestigious’ higher education institutions in America.”

“Harvard and @MIT, do the right thing,” Stefanik wrote. “The world is watching.”

Spokespeople for Harvard and MIT did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday. Gay, in an interview with the Harvard Crimson, apologized for remarks she made at the congressional hearing. Gay and Kornbluth gave similar answers to Magill’s when questioned by Stefanik.

Magill became Penn’s president in July 2022 after previously serving as provost at the University of Virginia and dean of Stanford Law School. Magill’s testimony alienated key constituents, including the state’s governor, the board of the Wharton School of Business, and an alumnus who is threatening to withhold a $100 million donation. A video Magill released late Wednesday, walking back her remarks from the hearing, did little to placate critics.

The presidents’ testimonies have reinvigorated a broader debate about where colleges draw the line between offensive speech and threatening conduct — an always thorny topic that has been rendered more so by the passions inflamed from the ongoing crisis in Israel and Gaza.

Claire Finkelstein, a professor of law and philosophy at Penn, said Friday she thinks the university’s guidelines on open expression would prohibit a call for genocide against Jews. And she’s troubled that anyone would suggest otherwise. Some lines need to be drawn, she said.

“The place to start is by ruling out calls for violence against members of ethnic, religious or racial minorities,” Finkelstein said. “That’s my own view, and I’m quite shocked to see it’s not the dominant view, apparently, of college presidents.”

Magill saw notable erosions of support in powerful places. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) described Magill’s comments as “absolutely shameful,” telling reporters last week, “It should not be hard to condemn genocide.” The Wharton board, whose members include some members of Penn’s board of trustees, said in a letter to Magill that Penn needed a change in leadership. And lawyers representing Ross Stevens, founder and chief executive of Stone Ridge Asset Management, said in a letter Thursday that he had grounds to rescind $100 million in shares donated to Penn. Stevens would discuss the matter “if, and when, there is a new university president in place,” the letter said.

In contrast, the MIT Corporation, which is the board of trustees for the institute, expressed its “full and unreserved support” for Kornbluth.

Still, on Friday, a letter signed by more than 70 members of Congress called on the governing boards for Harvard, Penn and MIT to remove the presidents.

On Saturday, the Wharton Board of Advisors issued a statement saying it looks forward to working with the board to take immediate action “to improve the safety and security of the entire Penn community.”

“We are all united in our desire to see that Penn remains a world-class educational institution.”

The executive committee of Penn’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, however, was critical Saturday of what it called “distortions and attacks” on some faculty and students in recent months. “Trustees, donors, lobbying organizations, and members of Congress have repeatedly misrepresented the words and deeds of Penn faculty and students who have expressed concern for Palestinian civilians and criticized the war in Gaza, going so far as to suggest that faculty who have publicly condemned Hamas were Hamas supporters and that groups protesting genocide were calling for genocide,” the group said in a statement.

“These attacks strike at the heart of the mission of an educational institution: to foster open, critical, and rigorous research and teaching that can produce knowledge for the public good in a democratic society,” the committee said.

At Penn, Jewish students on Friday said they were disappointed in Magill and some echoed calls for her to resign or be forced out. But they spoke more broadly of the fear that they and many other Jewish students nationally have reported experiencing since the Israel-Hamas war began in October. Several said they worried that forcing out the president was an overly simple answer to the much more complicated problem of antisemitism.

“I think this is the start of the healing process of Penn to restore its reputation,” Eyal Yakoby, 21, a senior at Penn majoring in political science and Middle Eastern studies, said Saturday. Campus leaders had been indifferent to campus hostilities and violations of campus policies, he said. “What now needs to happen is those policies are upheld: Students and faculty are held accountable for breaking not only policies, but the law. And restore Penn into being an academic institution.”

Yakoby is one of two students who is suing the university for failing to respond to antisemitic incidents on campus. The suit, filed early this month, alleges Penn has become “an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred.” The two plaintiffs say Penn has run afoul of the federal Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race and national origin, among other protected categories.

Yakoby, who is American Israeli and Jewish, said Friday the lawsuit came after months of inaction from administrators. He described a string of antisemitic acts over the past three months: a swastika on campus, then the hosting of what he called antisemitic speakers, then a break-in at Penn Hillel, then the vandalism of Chabad House, then a bomb threat against Hillel.

In addition to the lawsuit, Yakoby also testified before Congress about antisemitism on Penn’s campus — on the same day Magill did.

Noah Rubin, a junior who studies electrical engineering and economics, found out Magill had resigned when someone knocked on his door Saturday night — just as Shabbat was winding down — to share the news.

Rubin, 21, who is Jewish, spent part of last weekend locked in his dorm room, fearing for his own safety as hundreds of protesters marching parallel to campus chanted, “From water to water, Palestine will be Arab!” Rubin said he has found Penn’s administration and some professors unwelcoming to Jews, and in some cases openly antisemitic — mentioning cases in which professors have celebrated the Oct. 7 attack on social media or attended pro-Hamas rallies.

Rubin hopes, he said, that some professors will face discipline — both at Penn and campuses across America, on which, he said, antisemitism has become all too common. “This is just the first of many actions that need to be taken,” he said of Magill’s resignation. “The first of many things that will happen in the reformation of our college campuses to eradicate antisemitism.”

On Penn’s campus on Saturday, there was a mix of reactions to the resignation.

“It’s not really that surprising,” said Vinay Khosla, 20, a junior who is studying English and political science. “People were pushing for her resignation for a long time. … That being said, I think that it sets a really bad precedent that donors are the ones who are in power at the school and not academics, not administrators even. And also, I think that whoever they replace her with is going to be a lot harsher towards student activism and free speech.”

Aarav Jilka, 18, a freshman studying finance and business analytics, said he hopes attention can now shift to other things.

“It caused a lot of people pain on campus after what she said … or lacked, what she didn’t say honestly,” Jilka said. “So in that sense, I’m glad that she resigned, because that way there’s more attention back on how we can help students on campus who are Jewish, who are Palestinian, and who identify [with] different groups and give them support instead of focusing on all these trials.”

In her video message Wednesday, Magill said she was focused in the hearing on long-standing Penn policies, which say “speech alone is not punishable.” In her view, however, a call for genocide against Jews “would be harassment or intimidation,” Magill said.

Nuances of free speech

For all of the outrage the presidents’ remarks at the congressional hearing have engendered, free speech advocates say they worry about colleges cracking down on protected speech because of political pressure. Unsatisfying though the answer may seem, deciding whether speech violates a university’s code of conduct “does depend on context,” said Aaron Terr, director of public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.

“A call for genocide is a form of advocacy — advocacy of violence,” Terr said. Advocacy is generally protected by the First Amendment and free speech principles, he said. There are only narrow exceptions to those protections, Terr said, including a true threat of violence, incitement to imminent unlawful action, or speech that meets the legal standard for discriminatory harassment.

“A lot of the speech that we’re seeing on campus now wouldn’t fall into these exceptions and should be protected,” Terr said. “So the university presidents are right.”

Much of the criticism the presidents are getting now is “misguided,” Terr said, and coming from people who have been frustrated by other past incidences of censorship on college campuses. “The pressure should be on them to protect free speech consistently, not expand the censorship,” he said.

Private universities, like Penn, MIT and Harvard, are not bound by the First Amendment. But leaders of private institutions say they are guided by principles of free expression that are critical to academic freedom.

Discussions about where free speech ends and harassment begins are nuanced — and a congressional hearing isn’t a great place for nuance, said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California at Berkeley.

“Even advocacy of genocide is protected by the First Amendment,” Chemerinsky said. “And some believe that defending what Israel is doing in Gaza is defending genocide. Some believe that supporting abortion rights is defending genocide.”

Campus officials should condemn hateful speech, Chemerinsky said, “and there’s a point at which the advocacy is so pervasive it constitutes harassment.”

“But this is what I mean by there’s a need for nuance — and [the hearing] just wasn’t a forum to express nuance.”

Rick Fox, a rabbi who leads a Jewish empowerment and education group on Penn’s campus, said Friday he was sickened by Magill’s testimony before Congress. At the same time, he said he worried that, if Magill were forced out, she’d be replaced by someone just as fond of legal platitudes.

“I don’t want Liz Magill to be sacrificed so they can say, ‘Okay, we did something’ and they actually did nothing,” Fox said. “I’d much prefer she be courageous and stay and stand up for the Jewish people — but if she’s not able to, then that’s when she needs to step down.”

Liz Cheney is considering many different political roles over the next several years. But there’s one certainty she’s trying for in the next 11 months: Defeating her former House GOP colleagues and electing a new Democratic majority. Keeping up with politics is easy with The 5-Minute Fix Newsletter, in your inbox weekdays. ArrowRight Cheney believes that the 2024 presidential contest could end without any candidate securing a majority of the electoral votes — an outcome that would toss the decision into the House. Or, ex-president Donald Trump could again contest the outcome if he loses the electoral college. That’s why she believes a Democratic majority is the only safeguard for democracy.

“I think that’s why it’s so important that the Republicans not be in the majority in 2025. And that’s, again, for me to be sitting here saying that, is a pretty stunning thing,” said the former three-term lawmaker, who served in House GOP leadership, whose father served 12 years as a House Republican and eight years as a GOP vice president and whose mother served two Republican presidents.

Cheney, 57, has grown so disillusioned with her former caucus that she plans to build on a model she tested out last fall after she lost her August 2022 primary for the sin of challenging Trump politically. Then, she stumped for Democrats in key races at both the state and federal levels that could play a role in future presidential elections.

She has spent the past week crisscrossing the media airwaves promoting her new book, “Oath and Honor,” which recounts her story of growing up in Republican politics and rising up the House GOP ranks, only to end up helping Democrats lead the investigation into the Trump-fueled Capitol attack in January 2021.

She recently raised eyebrows with a tease of a potential independent run for president against the incumbent, Joe Biden, and Trump. Every interview leads to more questions about the indomitable GOP leader and his firm grip over the party’s base voters. She’s already suggested that, should he win a second term, Trump will not leave the White House at the end of his constitutionally mandated exit.

But Cheney has held almost as much contempt for her former House colleagues, who vaulted her to the No. 3 leadership post after just one term in Congress. Quickly and decisively, House Republicans fell in line behind Trump, retired or, like Cheney, lost their GOP primary to a Trump-backed firebrand, replaced by political sycophants.

“I don’t think that the people who are in charge on the Republican side in the House of Representatives today can be counted on to stand up against Donald Trump,” she said during a 45-minute interview on Friday in a private club in Georgetown.

That goes for Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who’s resigning this month after the MAGA wing took him down as speaker. And it also goes for Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the Trump ally who refused subpoenas from the select Jan. 6 committee on which Cheney served as vice-chair last year.

“It felt good for the country, that he lost,” Cheney said of Jordan’s bruising defeat in his bid to succeed McCarthy as speaker. “But I think Mike Johnson is just as much of a threat as Jim Jordan would have been.”

Johnson (R-La.), who ultimately won the speakership, is essentially Jordan with a lower profile, eyeglasses and a clipboard under his arm, as Cheney sees it.

When she was first sworn in on Jan. 3, 2017, the House Republican Conference still leaned heavily toward traditional Reagan-Bush ethos. Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) led the House and its top committee chairs came from the old establishment, like Reps. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), at Energy and Commerce, Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), at Ways and Means, and Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.), at Armed Services.

“I do feel, in some ways, like I kind of saw the very end of a situation in which there was responsible functioning of government,” she recalled.

Ryan and those three committee chairs would all soon retire rather than continue to serve in their party’s Trump-dominated era. Every GOP retirement seems to create a coin-toss chance the successor will not be a serious legislator and instead embrace politics as performance.

“I think one of the best examples of what’s happened is the switch of Mac Thornberry for Ronny Jackson,” Cheney said.

Thornberry, a mentor to Republicans and Democrats alike on national security issues, retired at the start of 2021.

Jackson has so far gained attention mostly for getting into a cursing match with state troopers at a rodeo that ended with him in handcuffs. No charges were filed and the former White House physician said he was trying to help a teenager having a seizure.

Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), a former Ryan aide, was appointed chair of the House Administration Committee and has overseen investigations of the 2021 attack on the Capitol that have shifted blame away from Trump and his allies.

In recent weeks a flood of retirement announcements prompted more concerns about what Cheney calls the “caliber” of people serving, particularly on the GOP side.

Does Cheney even consider herself still a Republican?

“I certainly am not a Trump Republican. And I still believe all the same things that I believed before. But the Republican Party no longer stands for those things in the way that it once did,” she said.

Fixing the GOP — whether it’s working from within to reclaim its Reagan-Bush roots, or breaking off to form a new party — is a “post-’24 cycle” matter, according to Cheney.

For now, she’s focused on key House races for next year. Her leadership PAC, the Great Task, had $3.2 million on hand as of its last federal filing, but Cheney can now also raise unlimited sums for her efforts, freed from House ethics rules.

As Cheney and others ponder independent presidential bids, the chances grow that some third-party contender could win a state or two and deny any candidate the bare minimum of 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.

Or, in 2020, had Trump won Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin — each of which he lost by less than 1 percentage point — he and Biden would have tied at exactly 269 votes and the House would have settled the race.

In these scenarios, the House would vote state by state, with each state counting as one vote.

So Cheney’s Wyoming, with less than 600,000 residents and one lone representative — Rep. Harriet M. Hageman (R), who defeated Cheney last year — would probably cast its one vote for Trump. California, with roughly 39 million residents, would probably cast its one vote for Biden based on its 40-12 split for Democrats in its delegation.

“It’s really going to matter who is in the majority,” Cheney said. “And it’s going to matter a lot who has the majority in each state.”

After the 2022 elections, Republicans held a majority in 26 delegations, Democrats in 22 and two — Minnesota and North Carolina — were tied.

Cheney campaigned in person last year for Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and endorsed Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), each of whom won close races and have backgrounds in national security like Cheney.

Slotkin is running for Senate next year, while Spanberger runs for Virginia governor in 2025, so expect to see Cheney stumping for the nominees to succeed them in the House to help keep the Democrats’ one-seat edge in the delegations from Michigan and Virginia.

Flipping one currently GOP-majority state, to either a tie or the Democratic column, might leave Trump’s path to power short-circuited, because Republicans would hold just 25 majorities and a candidate must win 26 states to claim the Oval Office.

All of this might seem like preparing for a worst-case scenario that is very unlikely to come. The House last decided a presidential contest 200 years ago. But ever since Jan. 6, 2021, Cheney leaves nothing to chance.

She still despises most Democratic policies — “what’s happening at the border is really irresponsible” — but her foremost focus is blocking Trump.

And Trump’s recent words and actions as the GOP front-runner, embracing authoritarian rhetoric and dire warnings about how he’d govern in a second term, added to her cause.

“It’s not a choice that anyone would ever wish to have. But we can survive bad policy. We can’t survive a leader who’s going to torch the Constitution,” Cheney said.

In early 2020, she had a chance to run for an open Senate seat, from which she would have had a six-year term and still be in the arena. Instead, Cheney preferred the House’s traditional hand-to-hand combat over the Senate’s debate society ways, seeing a path to become the first GOP female elected speaker.

Her true calling was to sacrifice her career in her pursuit of defeating Trump.

“And I think that was exactly the right place for me to be,” she said."

LAS VEGAS — LeBron James hugged his Los Angeles Lakers teammates, donned a commemorative hat and lifted the NBA Cup over his head with both hands in a joyous, but not overly emotional, conclusion to the inaugural in-season tournament. The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don’t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news. ArrowRight The Lakers scored a 123-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers in the championship game at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, claiming the title thanks to their punishing style and just enough late-game resolve. James finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds and four assists to earn tournament MVP honors, adding to his four regular season MVPs, four Finals MVPs and three All-Star Game MVPs.

Anthony Davis added 41 points, 20 rebounds and five assists, pounding away against an overmatched Pacers front line from start to finish. Each Lakers player earned a $500,000 bonus as tournament champions, while each Pacers player took home $200,000 as the runners-up.

“Records will be broken, but one thing that will never be broken is being the first to do something,” James said. “We’re the first champions of the in-season tournament and nobody can ever top that.”

In the quiet moments after the trophy presentation, James munched on grapes at his locker, packed his body with ice and gifted his Cup-winning sneakers to longtime Nike executive Lynn Merritt. James handed off his MVP trophy to Maverick Carter, his longtime business partner, and chatted with Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul at the end of a long weekend. The Lakers’ cork-popping was confined to an auxiliary room and seemingly over before it started.

The Lakers looked and acted like a team that was proud that it handled its business going 4-0 in the group stage before beating the Phoenix Suns, New Orleans Pelicans and Pacers in the knockout round, but their understated celebration was a far cry from the tearful and champagne-soaked scene following their 2020 championship in the Bubble. Lakers owner Jeanie Buss wasn’t on hand for the trophy presentation, and it remains unclear whether the franchise will hang a banner to recognize the tournament title at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.

Though the NBA Cup and its accompanying riches were something to compete for early in the season, the event paled in comparison to what’s coming in the playoffs, especially for a franchise that has won 17 championships.

“We want to put it in perspective that it’s still December,” James said. “We like where we are right now but we want to continue to work our habits, continue to get healthy as well. Right now, where we are in December, I would take it. But I’m definitely not looking to May and June. That’s too far.”

The in-season tournament’s 67th game proved to be a fervent finale for an event that largely exceeded expectations by delivering intense elimination games and improved television ratings. Neither team built a double-digit lead until Los Angeles went up 70-60 early in the third quarter, and a nonstop stream of officiating complaints from both sides confirmed this was a more serious occasion than a typical regular season game.

“I will say, in terms of the interest we are seeing around the in-season tournament, I don’t think it was just the money,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Saturday. “I think it was the competition, in part. I think it was coming to Vegas. I think it was all those things that made the difference. I should say also that players like LeBron, [Stephen Curry] and other leading veterans in this league embracing this from day one makes a big difference with the players.”

Both the Lakers and Pacers entered Saturday’s final with identical 6-0 tournament records and differing motivations: James wanted to put his stamp on the new event while making his case to one day own an NBA franchise in Las Vegas, while Tyrese Haliburton and his small-market teammates wanted to introduce themselves to a national television audience while getting valuable experience for the playoffs.

Sin City was anything but a neutral site: Lakers fans outnumbered Pacers fans at least 20-1 in a sold-out crowd of more than 19,000, and boos rained down when James uncharacteristically found himself in early foul trouble. The 38-year-old forward picked up two fouls in the first quarter before wrestling with Aaron Nesmith to earn his third with more than three minutes left before halftime. Lakers Coach Darvin Ham challenged the call, and James protested at length, but their efforts proved unsuccessful.

Davis and Austin Reaves picked up the slack in James’s absence, helping the Lakers claim a 65-60 halftime lead by attacking the heart of the Pacers’ defense. Davis piled up 13 points and eight rebounds in the first quarter, and Reaves scored 22 of his 28 points before halftime.

“That was a Shaq-like dominant performance,” James said of Davis.

The Lakers’ cast of long and aggressive perimeter defenders was difficult for Haliburton to crack: The Pacers’ star guard had a three-pointer blocked and tossed up an air ball under duress in the early going, and he finished with 20 points and 11 assists, never looking as comfortable as he had while knocking out the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks.

While Indiana enjoyed a memorable tournament run thanks to its free-flowing, league-leading attack, its offense stalled Saturday, buoyed by a parade to the free throw line in the first half and several sloppy Los Angeles turnovers late in the third quarter. The Lakers squandered possessions with an illegal screen, an over-and-back violation and a bad pass in quick succession, and Bennedict Mathurin hit a running three-pointer to beat the third-quarter buzzer to help the trailing Pacers maintain contact.

Down the stretch, the Pacers’ frontcourt ultimately proved unable to withstand the Lakers’ bludgeoning. Indiana center Myles Turner played just 25 minutes because of persistent foul trouble, and he fouled out with more than four minutes remaining. Turner’s undersized replacements struggled to keep Davis and James from scoring inside; Los Angeles racked up 86 points in the paint.

“We’ve been doing it together for a long time, five years now,” Davis said of his partnership with James. “We just figure it out. We know each other’s tendencies, what we like to do. Obviously in crunchtime, we get to our infamous pick-and-roll and it’s tough to stop. We feed off one another.”

A well-rested James, who played just 23 minutes in the Lakers’ blowout of the Pelicans in the semifinals Thursday before watching from the sideline for chunks of the first half Saturday, slammed the door with a double-clutch dunk with a little more than two minutes to play. Soon after, Pacers Coach Rick Carlisle waved the white flag by emptying his bench and Silver handed out the hardware."

The Washington Capitals keep finding ways to surprise. After losing their previous three games heading into Saturday night’s matchup with the New York Rangers, who are atop the Metropolitan Division and entered the day third in the NHL, the Capitals were a significant underdog. Their most recent loss — in a shootout against visiting Dallas on Thursday — was a step forward after flat performances at Las Vegas and Arizona ended a five-game Western Conference road trip with a pair of thuds, but the Rangers presented another significant challenge.

After Sonny Milano opened the scoring just 43 seconds after the puck dropped at Capital One Arena, though, Washington rolled to a 4-0 win. Charlie Lindgren made 31 saves — including three on his younger brother Ryan, a Rangers defenseman — to notch his second shutout of the season.

Milano was a healthy scratch Thursday, and he wasted little time in responding after returning to the lineup. His line, with Evgeny Kuznetsov at center and T.J. Oshie on the right wing, started the game and worked the puck deep into the Rangers’ end. As the Capitals cycled around the zone, stretching out the defense, Milano slid unmarked toward the far post. Defenseman Martin Fehervary slipped a pass across the crease, and Milano had a wide-open net behind goalie Igor Shesterkin (25 saves).

“I thought that shift from Kuzy’s line ... set the tone for our entire group,” Capitals Coach Spencer Carbery said. “Just right away, from the puck pressure, good decisions, the execution with the puck that we’ve talked extensively about and had discussed earlier in the day, it just got us right into the right mind-set for the entire group.”

Anthony Mantha doubled Washington’s lead 1:43 into the second period, two seconds after a power play expired. Another forward left unmarked by the Rangers, Mantha drove toward the net and tipped a pass from Kuznetsov over Shesterkin’s shoulder.

The goals kept coming. The Capitals’ sluggish scoring has been well documented, but they regularly found openings on Shesterkin — who won the Vezina Trophy in 2022 as the best goalie in the league. Tom Wilson made it 3-0 less than four minutes after Mantha’s tally with a transition goal; he poked the puck away in the defensive zone, raced up the ice on a two-on-one with Alex Ovechkin and fired a wrist shot past Shesterkin.

Nicolas Aube-Kubel added the last goal at 11:52 of the second with a bar-down wrister from the slot — not the kind of goal typically produced by the fourth line, which only emphasizes the confidence the Capitals gathered on offense during this one.

“They’re kind of a benchmark team right now in the league,” Wilson said of the Rangers (18-6-1). “We knew we were going to have to be ready. They play fast. They have a lot of skill. Good balanced lineup. I think we set the tone from a first shift. Kuzy’s line did a good job, and [we] kind of rolled from there.”

The Rangers pushed back at points — midway through the first period, late in the second and for brief stretches of the third — but the offensive outburst gave Washington (13-8-3) the luxury of a cushion. Many of the Capitals’ wins have been characterized by white-knuckle defending and clinging to a narrow lead in the final minutes, but Saturday they were in control from start to finish.

Advertisement

Lindgren improved to 6-2-1 with a .931 save percentage. He didn’t have to be perfect for the Capitals to win Saturday, but he was anyway.

Carbery and Aube-Kubel agreed it was Washington’s most complete effort of the season. The Capitals received a standing ovation from the capacity crowd of 18,573 over the game’s final 90 seconds.

“I thought our puck play tonight was as good as it’s been all year long,” Carbery said. “Coming through the neutral zone, we looked way quicker. Our execution, whether it was a bank pass or whether we were beating a guy with speed or whether it was an area play, everything just seemed like it was way cleaner and connected.”

Said Aube-Kubel: “Especially against that team, against our ex-coach [Peter Laviolette], just means a lot.”

The next challenge for the Capitals is to translate the effort they often show against the league’s top teams into every game on the schedule. They’re developing a habit of showing up when the lights are brightest — Lindgren’s other shutout was against the Vegas Golden Knights, the defending Stanley Cup champions — but slipping away when the spotlight fades.

“Starting to learn that,” Carbery said. “And that maybe is something that’s been talked about in the past, of playing to a level and that. Now we need to lose that reputation because you just don’t have that luxury of being able to turn it on and off.”"

Six people were killed and nearly two dozen injured after tornadoes touched down around Nashville on Saturday, according to local authorities, who feared the death toll could rise as rescue efforts continued late Saturday night. Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday.

Ahead of the front, abnormally warm and humid air — as much as 20 degrees higher than average for this time of year — surged northward, helping to fuel the storms.

More than 75,000 customers were without power in Tennessee as of Saturday night. The hardest hit areas appeared to be Clarksville, Tenn., and the northern side of Nashville. A child and two adults were killed in Clarksville, the city’s mayor said, and the Nashville Emergency Operation Center reported three people were killed by severe storms there.

“This is devastating news and our hearts are broken for the families of those who lost loved ones,” said Clarksville Mayor Joe Pitts, who declared a state of emergency and enacted a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday night. “The city stands ready to help them in their time of grief.”

Rescue efforts were still underway in both areas Saturday night. Photos from the Clarksville Fire Rescue showed at least two homes with their front facades and roofs torn off, a tractor-trailer truck that had been flipped onto its side and rescue workers scouring neighborhoods for people trapped or injured. Northeast of Nashville, utility poles, trees and power lines were downed in the nearby city of Gallatin, while buildings were at least partially collapsed in parts of neighboring Hendersonville.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) directed the public Saturday night to follow guidance from local and state officials. “We mourn the lives lost,” he said in a social media post.

Through 8:30 p.m. Eastern, the National Weather Service had received about 75 reports of severe weather from northern Louisiana to southern Kentucky. But most of the severe weather was concentrated in western and central Tennessee, including 15 reports of tornadoes. The NWS said that as of 10 p.m., the severe weather threat had ended for all of Middle Tennessee.

The same front is forecast to barge toward the East Coast on Sunday. Some severe storms could erupt in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic but they are not predicted to be as widespread or violent as Saturday’s storms in the Tennessee Valley.

In the Northeast, the front is expected to trigger torrential rains Sunday night into Monday morning. Flood watches are in effect from northern Virginia to eastern Maine, including Washington, Philadelphia, New York and Boston, where 1 to 3 inches of rain are predicted."

This may be a time when many begin waiting for winter, but Saturday in Washington seemed more suited to savoring the sunshine, feeling its warmth and enjoying the concluding days of autumn. Beneath white clouds, and under a beaming sun, temperatures in the region reached the realms of above average warmth sometimes after struggling up from below freezing.

In Washington, the high touched an invigorating 56 degrees, six above the Dec. 9 average.

At Washington Dulles International Airport, the 57-degree high was nine above average there.

It also suggested true thermal achievement, symbolized by a 28-degree rise. In daylight at Dulles, the mercury trekked up from a perhaps discouraging 29 degrees.

That reading came as late as 7:36 a.m. It probably required some confidence in solar power to justify wearing relatively light garments for an afternoon outdoor jaunt.

In its warmth, Saturday seemed much like Friday. At Dulles, Friday’s high had managed to reach 60 degrees, normal for early November.

In that way, Saturday gave a sense not merely of bracing conditions of autumn, but of the departing season’s resolve not to yield too soon to dark and chill winter.

Of course, Saturday showed signs of the passage of the days.

Some leaves remained on trees. Bright bronze bedecked many a branch. But the leaves that still held on seemed to lean toward brown as their primary color. And brown leaves carpeted the ground as well.

At sunset, bare branches stood silhouetted against the orange of the western sky.

If it is wind that persuades leaves to loosen their grip and add to accumulations on streets and lawns, Saturday seemed not the day for it.

Instead, our wind seemed mainly from the south, light enough to take a live-and-let-live attitude toward leaves.

As of 5 p.m., the day’s average wind speed in Washington was 3.7 mph. Dulles seemed to be given even further toward atmospheric serenity.

There, the National Weather Service calculated the average wind speed to be a derisory 1.8 mph.

That seemed scarcely enough to flutter a leaf, rustle a feather in a circling raptor’s wing or cause even the most sensitive to clutch outer garments more tightly, in anticipation of winter."

NEW YORK — Jayden Daniels, a Californian who hopscotched to Arizona and then to Louisiana, where he built gobsmacking statistics as LSU’s quarterback, won the 89th Heisman Trophy on Saturday night and became the latest winner to epitomize this college football era of kinetic player mobility. When he edged runner-up Michael Penix Jr., the quarterback at Washington, in the closest vote since 2018, he became the fifth winner in the past seven to have transferred during their college years.

“You took a kid from the West Coast and brought me down to the bayou,” the smooth 22-year-old said to the LSU coaches in attendance during a speech rich in humility and full of thanks to everyone, including nutritionists and janitors. His varied path left Daniels moved to thank coaches and players at Arizona State, where he spent three seasons, and LSU, where he spent the past two. Later, at the winner’s news conference, he noted the value of transferring as “something where you’ve got to adapt” and about “really just challenging myself to the life that I want and for my future.”

Once that future reached the Heisman Trophy, he felt “a sigh of relief,” he said, “kind of like, ‘Dang, it’s here now,’ ” after weeks of becoming the betting-line favorite with “just the suspense, ‘Are you going to win it, [or] are you not?’ ” He spoke of “a different kind of feeling that I had, [about] everything I worked for in my life, everything I overcame.”

His kind of multi-region relocation, routine nowadays in a sport with a bustling transfer portal, rang through the biographies among the four finalists. Penix is a Floridian who played four injury-haunted seasons at Indiana before reaching Seattle, and third-place finisher Bo Nix, the Oregon quarterback, is an Alabamian who played three seasons at Auburn before his two in Eugene. Only Marvin Harrison Jr., the Ohio State wide receiver who finished fourth in the balloting of 928 electors, had not switched schools.

The vagabonds to reach the Heisman podium in recent years, all quarterbacks, include Caleb Williams (2022), the Washingtonian who went west to Oklahoma and then farther west to Southern California; Joe Burrow (2019), the Ohioan who went to Ohio State and then LSU; Kyler Murray (2018), the Texan who went to Texas A&M and then Oklahoma; and Baker Mayfield (2017), the Texan who went to Texas Tech and then Oklahoma. In a quarterback era, Daniels became the 20th quarterback to win the Heisman Trophy among the 24 named since 2000. In becoming LSU’s second Heisman winner in the past five Decembers, Daniels became its third overall, placing the school in a seven-way tie for fourth after it spent the first 84 Heisman years with only Billy Cannon (1959) among the winners.

Daniels’s deluge of dual-threat statistics this season — a record 208.0 passer rating, 3,812 passing yards, 1,134 rushing yards, 40 touchdown passes, 10 rushing touchdowns, only four interceptions — lured another statistic: 503 first-place votes (to 292 for Penix). Penix gathered more second-place votes, 341 to 217, and more third-place votes, 143 to 86, until the closing points stood at a fairly close 2,029 to 1,701. That’s all despite the fact that Penix wound up with the bigger seasonal prize: He will take his Huskies (13-0) to the College Football Playoff’s Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against Texas (12-1) on Jan. 1, while Daniels’s No. 13 Tigers (9-3) go to Tampa for the ReliaQuest Bowl against Wisconsin (7-5).

LSU’s three losses count as the most for a Heisman winner’s team since 2016, when the award went to Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson, who was an inspiration for a fellow young Black quarterback watching on TV at the time: Daniels, then 15. Now that same Daniels, only bigger, received congratulations onstage from Andre Ware, the 1989 winner who noted the value of having yet another Black quarterback in the fold. The son of Javon Daniels and Regina Jackson, Jayden Daniels joked about how his father initially steered him toward cornerback, a thought long since buried especially in the presence of LSU Coach Brian Kelly, a quarterback maestro.

“He was intentional,” Kelly said during the ESPN ceremony of Daniels’s improvements, especially with deep passes. “He was thoughtful. And he was committed to doing this.”

“The word ‘perseverance’ is that kid, Jayden,” his mother said on the broadcast, soon adding, “It’s hard, really, to describe.”

Daniels had not dominated the Heisman chatter of the early part of the season. That kind of talk centered more on various others, including those two towers in the Pacific Northwest, Penix and Nix. The former passed for a nation-leading 324.5 yards per game, led his team to comebacks with his moxie and never did lose; the latter saw his career fatten to a record 60 starts, completed a stunning 77.2 percent of his passes and combined 40 touchdown passes with a puny three interceptions while losing just twice, both by three points to Penix’s Washington. All along, Harrison turned up in Heisman and NFL draft conversation while looking a tier above even great players and catching 67 passes for 1,211 yards and 14 touchdowns while leading the country in catches against nearby defenders.

As the autumn wore on, though, Daniels soared on. He passed for 219 yards and rushed for 163 at Alabama before a hit from linebacker Dallas Turner with 12:54 left Daniels concussed and sidelined. The very next Saturday night, at home against Florida, he amassed yardage numbers that had never happened in the top tier of the sport: 350-plus passing and 200-plus rushing in the same game, his 372 and 274 adding up to 606 total yards — by one player. “Toward the end of the season,” Daniels said Saturday night, “it started amping up more, so [this] was a real possibility.”

By that point, the Tigers had three losses, so the Daniels-to-Heisman campaign helped energize a season that might have felt residual. “Certainly when we did not have that [College Football Playoff] opportunity after the Alabama game,” Kelly said, “you start to recalibrate, and certainly one [endeavor] was to rally behind the player we felt was the best player in college football.”

In that vein, Kelly said, players felt “motivated to play their very best.”

They had rallied behind somebody they liked, evidenced by their extension to Daniels of the most votes in captaincy balloting. “A transfer quarterback that comes into your program has to win the locker room,” Kelly said, and so four years after then-LSU coach Ed Orgeron praised how Burrow came to town and “kept his mouth shut,” Kelly lauded Daniels’s humility.

At 13, as his friends were finishing eighth grade, Peter Park was starting law school. A year later, he was finishing his freshman year finals by day, and passing his first major law school exam by night. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight This past July, Park took California’s bar exam, and in November, he became the youngest person in state history to pass at 17, beating the previous record holder who passed at 18, according to the Tulare County district attorney’s office, where Park now works. His two younger sisters and parents moved with him three hours north for the job.

On Tuesday, he was sworn in as a deputy district attorney.

“At first it was very intimidating — I had zero knowledge about the law,” Park told The Washington Post. “But now, I pretty much have a 10-year head start. That’s like living 10 years extra. I value that over the traditional high school experience.”

It started when he was 13, and his father — himself involved with law as a patent agent — came into his room with an idea. The elder Park had read about a 21-year-old who had passed the bar and thought maybe his son could, too.

“Do you want to become an attorney right now?” his father, ByungJoo Park, asked him.

The teen hadn’t really considered it, but the more his dad spoke — about the possibilities law opened up, about how he could help keep people safe as a prosecutor — the better it sounded. Park told his dad he’d think about it.

The next day, he decided he was in. He wasn’t worried about missing out on the perceived fun of high school and eventually college. Pursuing law school felt like he was doing something more important and meaningful with his life.

His dad told him he had to start studying for the College Level Proficiency Exams (CLEPs), which, if passed, would allow Park to apply to law school without an undergraduate degree. Park spent the next month teaching himself marketing, the subject of his first test.

After he passed that exam, he took on microeconomics and macroeconomics, then a composition exam, studying for each for just a week, spending hours on YouTube learning the subjects on his own.

By early 2019, he had passed all the CLEPS and could start applying to law school while he finished eighth grade. By the time he was starting high school, he had enrolled in a four-year juris doctor program at Northwestern California University School of Law online, using a state rule that allows students who have completed the CLEPs to apply directly to law school without completing a bachelor’s degree.

Some of his high school classmates would tease Park, asking him if he thought he was above them for skipping ahead, he told The Post. He said he didn’t feel that way, but he did feel drawn to law more than math or other high school subjects. He wanted to help people, he said, and getting a law degree meant he could go into a range of industries, including criminal law, medical law and property law, among others.

“The law is like the fabric of society, it reaches into everyone’s lives,” he said.

Still, navigating both high school and online law school left little time for sleep.

When asked how he got up to speed with classmates who were a decade older than him, the now 18-year-old Park pointed to another famous autodidact who provided inspiration — Abraham Lincoln.

Lincoln, the son of a Kentucky frontiersman, lacked a formal education but engrossed himself in his studies, and particularly, reading law. So that’s what Park did too.

He read as much as he could, choosing to prioritize his law school work over his high school work. He spent almost every waking hour reading case law or becoming accustomed to legalese, and sometimes didn’t have enough time to finish his math homework.

“I felt confident in doing that because I knew I would gain much more value in putting in time into law than math,” he said.

Park didn’t tell all his teachers he was going to law school while he attended high school. He didn’t want the attention, especially if it didn’t work out.

According to his father’s plan, halfway through sophomore year of high school, Park could take the California High School Proficiency Exam to graduate at the end of 10th grade. In 2021, Park did just that.

“I get the comment very often: ‘Why not just wait? When do you have fun? Why didn’t you want to get to have the whole high school or college experience?’” Park said. “Everyone else is missing out on the law school experience at such a young age.”

He said he feels others his age are just “chasing fun.”

Park’s father, who also encouraged Park’s younger sisters to buck the traditional high school experience and go to law school in their teens, said he agreed that his son didn’t miss out “on anything.”

“I think there isn’t much difference between hanging out with college friends, enjoying time with friends at church, and studying with colleagues at the prosecutor’s office,” ByungJoo Park said in an email.

The father had completed a PhD in Korea in material sciences before moving the family to Japan and then California when Park was four. He eventually passed the patent bar exam, and now helps Park run a company, in addition to his work as a prosecutor, selling affordable stenography keyboards.

If they stay on their current tracks, Park’s younger sisters will both pass the bar at an age younger than he did, Park said.

On Tuesday, the day of his swearing in, Park walked into a conference room of the district attorney’s office around 3:30 p.m. His father had just come back from Korea, where he was visiting when he’d hurt his back. He wasn’t sure if he was going to be able to make the flight and spent a full day recovering once he arrived back in California. But he was there, watching his son.

As Park took the oath, and looked at his father in the audience, the new prosecutor was proud of the work he’d done over the past four years.

“I have my whole life in front of me,” Park said. “This DA’s office gave me as a 17-year-old a chance. Now I get to prove myself in court.”"

JERUSALEM — Israeli forces have detained Palestinian civilians in Gaza during two months of war, according to family members and rights groups, who say they have been given no information about the whereabouts, conditions or charges against the missing. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Many of those detained have been rounded up by Israeli forces while fleeing south or during raids in the north, friends and family said in more than a dozen interviews. Some were held for hours, outside or in metal trailers, and released. Others have disappeared.

Family members told The Washington Post they saw relatives with no ties to Hamas or armed groups led away by Israeli soldiers at gunpoint and have heard nothing from them since.

Mahmoud Almadhoun, his 13-year-old son, 72-year-old father and several other relatives were detained Thursday. That morning, Israeli tanks rolled by their family home in Beit Lahia in Gaza’s smoldering north. Soldiers ordered them and dozens of other men out.

In a widely shared video, Almadhoun, 33, is seen in his underwear on the ground in a line of men. They sat for hours, he told The Post on Saturday, before soldiers tied their hands and loaded them into trucks. They drove by burning cars to a beach somewhere between Beit Lahia and inside Israel. Almadhoun feared he would not return. “None of the people they detained were Hamas or any kind of fighters,” he said.

Israeli forces say they’re looking for members of Hamas and participants in the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, when fighters streamed out of Gaza to kill 1,200 people and take another 240 hostage. Israel responded with a military campaign the commanders say is aimed eradicating the militant group as a political and military force in Gaza. It has killed more than 17,000 people in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

But Israeli authorities have not said how many people they’ve detained, the legal grounds or where they’re being held, including whether in Gaza or in Israel. The Israel Defense Forces referred questions to the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service. The Shin Bet did not respond to requests for comment.

Yasser Alyan told The Post that he last saw 20-year-old Ahmed Al-Lahman, whom he described as a surrogate son, on Nov. 20 as they walked south. The family was fleeing Beit Lahia along Salah al-Din Road, the route Israel had told people to take.

What happened next followed what has emerged as a pattern. When the family reached the Netzarim checkpoint, the site of an old Israeli settlement, soldiers called Lahman over. Alyan hasn’t seen him since.

The family waited for hours, Alyan said, until Israeli soldiers shot in their direction and warned them to leave. A relative who was detained with Lahman, but released that day, told Alyan that they were made to strip to their underwear and pass before what appeared to be a facial recognition scanner, he said.

Lahman, an amateur singer, “had no connection to any organizations or political orientations at all, so we are shocked and surprised by his arrest,” Alyan said. He and his wife contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross repeatedly. The organization said it had no information.

The ICRC received more than 3,000 reports of missing Gazans between Oct. 7 and Nov. 29, spokeswoman Sarah Davies said. She could not specify how many involved detentions.

The video of Almadhoun, among images first shared by Israeli media, suggest the scale and conditions of some arrests.

Israeli media outlets reported without citing sources that the videos showed members of Hamas. Friends and family of several of those pictured told The Post that their loved ones were taken from their homes and had no connection to Hamas or any armed group.

Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said Friday that the people in the images are “military age men” found in “Hamas strongholds” and “areas where civilians were supposed to have evacuated.”

“Those individuals will be questioned and we will work out who indeed was a Hamas terrorist and who was not,” he said.

Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said Friday that the military had detained more than 200 suspects over the previous 48 hours in Gaza and referred dozens to questioning.

Hani Almadhoun, the Washington-based director of philanthropy at UNRWA USA, told The Post he was shocked when he saw his brother Mahmoud, 32, in the video.

Another brother was killed in an airstrike Nov. 24, just before the start of a week-long humanitarian truce.

Mahmoud Almadhoun said at the beach soldiers cursed at them, scanned them with what appeared to be facial recognition equipment and left them in their underwear, exposed to the elements. When they asked for food or water, soldiers would kick or curse at them, he said.

Sometime after midnight, soldiers transported him and other men closer to Beit Lahia and left them to walk back barefoot.

Two “not involved in anything” college-aged distinct cousins did not return, Hani Almadhoun said.

The Gaza Health Ministry says Israel has detained 36 medical workers — doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers — whose whereabouts remain unknown. The most prominent detainee is al-Shifa Hospital Director Mohamed Abu Salmiya, who the IDF says allowed Hamas to use bunkers underneath the hospital as a command center. The ministry and medical staff deny the accusation.

Hana Herbst, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Prisons Authority, said she could not comment on specific cases.

International law allows military forces to detain combatants. But they may arrest or detain civilians only “if it’s absolutely necessary,” said Omar Shakir, the Human Rights Watch director for Israel and Palestine. Civilians must be charged within 48 hours and allowed to challenge their detention, among other protections, he said, or released.

“You have to have a very high bar if you are going to detain civilians,” Shakir said. “It can’t just be, ‘Well anyone could attack us any time.’”

“Israel’s abusive and discriminatory detention practices over decades of occupation raise significant doubt if detention is meeting those standards,” he said.

Israel’s Unlawful Combatants Law asserts the authority to put Palestinians from Gaza in what is effectively administrative detention, a form of incarceration without charge or trial that authorities can renew indefinitely, Shakir said.

Israel’s Prisons Authority said this month that 260 Gazans were being held under the law as of Dec. 1. It was unclear which cases it was counting.

The Shin Bet is holding an unknown number of militants arrested in Israel during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Israeli forces in Gaza have since arrested more combatants in its war. Hundreds of Gazan workers stranded in Israel were also imprisoned.

Jessica Montell, the executive director of the Israeli rights group Hamoked, said the organization has received more than 115 calls from family members of people who were detained at the Netzarim checkpoint. In only two cases has the person has been released.

“The question is, where is everyone else?” she said. “Where physically are they and what legal status are they?”

At least 16 female detainees from Gaza have been incarcerated in Israel. Since Oct. 7, authorities have denied Palestinian prisoners access to lawyers or the ICRC, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society.

Teacher Khawla Salem, 40, says her 19-year-old daughter, Aseel, is one of those prisoners.

Salem, her husband and three children on Nov. 22 left their home in the Jabalya refugee camp, where her 16-year-old son had been killed in a strike, and headed south to Khan Younis. As they approached the Netzarim checkpoint, Salem said, soldiers stopped the group and told them to appear before what appeared to be a facial recognition scanner. Snipers and tanks surrounded them.

Aseel and 9-year-old Mays were summoned to metal trailers. The soldiers, Mays told The Post, wanted her identification card, asked about her school and insulted her sister. Aseel pleaded with the soldiers to release Mays.

Mays was released after four hours. But she had no word of Aseel, who walks with a limp. As Salem waited, other women told her detainees were interrogated, strip-searched and beaten.

Lama Khatour, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was detained at Damon prison in northern Israel when Gazan women in distinct brown uniforms with no headscarves arrived. Through the walls, she learned their names. One was Aseel.

Khatour, who was released last month in the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, said the women had little food and slept on the floor. Several said they had been beaten. One was breastfeeding.

“There were no clear charges against them,” Khatour said. “They told us that the goal was to collect as much information as possible about their families and their surroundings.”"

Benjamin Zephaniah, a poet and writer whose work often reflected racism and injustices faced by Black communities in Britain, and who became a significant cultural force with lectures, albums and acting roles including playing a street preacher in the series “Peaky Blinders,” died Dec. 7 at 65. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight A family statement said Mr. Zephaniah died of a brain tumor, eight weeks after he learned of the diagnosis. No other details were given.

Mr. Zephaniah reached across genres and artforms, but his greatest contribution was often cited as helping expand the boundaries of poetry in Britain. Mr. Zephaniah first gained notice with work peppered with a street patois and, at times, an anarchist anger. He later found his voice in other issues including the environment and animal rights.

“I think poetry should be alive,” he said. “You should be able to dance to it.”

He first developed his style in the 1980s echoing his Afro-Caribbean roots and the traditions of dub poetry, a performance motif that emerged in Jamaica combining reggae beats with verse emphasizing social messages and activism. His early verse gave hints, too, of his own struggles, including years of street crime that led to an 18-month prison stint for burglary.

His poem “Dis Policeman Keeps on Kicking Me to Death” — first read in the early 1980s in London clubs and then part of his 1982 album “Rasta” — was inspired by clashes with authorities in Mr. Zephaniah’s native Birmingham and became a protest anthem over alleged police abuses in Britain and elsewhere.

dis regime is racist we know

dis regime is bent

dis regime is like a worthless penny dat's unspent.

Mr. Zephaniah was sometimes described as Britain’s “people’s laureate.” For decades, he found ways to keep the image alive — such as publicly rejecting the ceremonial position of officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2003. “I get angry when I hear that word ‘empire,’” he wrote in an essay in the Guardian. “It reminds me of slavery, it reminds of thousands of years of brutality.”

But he also became a familiar figure in the British cultural mainstream. He was on the BBC Radio 4 show “Desert Island Discs” in 1997 discussing his admiration for the works of the 19th century British romanticist Percy Bysshe Shelley. Mr. Zephaniah gave inspirational talks on how he overcame dyslexia, and he taught creative writing at Brunel University in London.

He even did programs for the British Council, which promotes British culture worldwide, even as he wrote poetry and song lyrics that denounced the system. “I pay tax, they force me to pay for my oppression,” he wrote in the 2001 poem “Naked.”

He became known to wider audiences as the character Jeremiah Jesus, a streetwise minister with ankle-long dreadlocks, in 14 episodes of the popular streaming series “Peaky Blinders” (2013-2022) about an underworld family’s rise and fall in early 20th century Birmingham.

Mr. Zephaniah’s writing also moved into new territory over more than 30 books and anthologies. He took on stories aimed at young adults, explored environmental issues and animal rights as a vegan since he was 13.

His 1994 poem “Talking Turkeys” was one of his best known — a playful appeal on behalf of turkeys during the holiday season.

Cos’ turkeys just wanna hav fun

Turkeys are cool, turkeys are wicked

An every turkey has a Mum.

In other ways, Mr. Zephaniah used the public forum as a confessional. In interviews, he addressed episodes of past violence that included physical abuse against former girlfriends. He told BBC Radio 5 in 2018 that his behavior “burned my conscience so badly” and asserted that his attitudes toward women changed as he became more politically active.

“I remember I was on a march and I was saying ‘Freedom! International freedom!’, and I thought, ‘I just left my girlfriend at home and told her not to leave the house — I’m a hypocrite. I’m an oppressor and a hypocrite,’” he said, “and at that moment, I just stopped.”

In an October 2020 commentary in the Guardian, Mr. Zephaniah took stock of how darkness and brilliance coexist everywhere. “Black history is not perfect,” he wrote. “We have had our dictators, our massacres, our warmongers and our evildoers, and we should not shy away from that. But we have also had our pioneers, our universities, our inventors, great writers, great poets, scientists, cartographers, teachers and philosophers.”

“The police who beat me up,” he continued, “didn’t know that.”

Jail cell decision

Benjamin Obadiah Iqbal Springer was born April 15, 1958, in Birmingham (along with twin sister Velda) to parents with ties to the Caribbean. His father, originally from Barbados, was a postal worker, and his Jamaica-born mother was a nurse.

The young Benjamin began doing readings of his poetry in a church and was called by the church elders Zephaniah, an Old Testament prophet, for his oratory. He later adopted the name Benjamin Zephaniah.

He struggled in school with undiagnosed dyslexia but flourished as a storyteller with the ability to put words to music, skills he attributed to his mother and how she passed “recipes on to my sister in rhyme.”

As a teen, he was increasingly involved in law breaking — “nicking things from cars and people’s houses, fighting with the police” — and spent time in a juvenile detention center. He later was sentenced to jail for burglary.

“I remember being in prison, thinking, 'I want to change the world, and now I'm sitting in a cell. What am I doing?'” he said.

His inspiration to become a writer, and overcome dyslexia, was sparked by a typewriter he received as a gift during childhood. When he was 22, he moved to London seeking to establish himself on the literary scene, joining up with street poets. Mr. Zephaniah’s first book of poetry, “Pen Rhythm,” was published in 1980, followed by “The Dread Affair: Collected Poems” in 1985.

Mr. Zephaniah’s first novel, “Face” (1999), the story of a man who must readjust to society after horrific facial injuries, was marketed for young-adult readers.

Mr. Zephaniah’s acting roles included the 1990 literary drama “Farendj” and in the BBC production of the “Dread Poets Society” (1992). His television show on the Sky Arts channel, “Life and Rhymes,” showcased storytelling and oral poetry and won a BAFTA award for an entertainment program in 2021.

In 2018, the BBC broadcast Mr. Zephaniah read excerpts from his autobiography, “The Life and Rhymes of Benjamin Zephaniah.”

“I’m still as angry as I was in my twenties,” he read.

Mr. Zephaniah’s marriage to Amina Zephaniah ended in divorce. Mr. Zephaniah publicly discussed his issues with infertility and obstacles to adopt a child because of his criminal record. Full information on survivors was not immediately available.

Mr. Zephaniah once described himself as a British version of a “griot,” a name for traveling poets and performers in West Africa.

“Maybe they’ll tell a story in one village, sing in the next and perform a poem in another,” he said. “Sometimes they aim just to entertain, but sometimes their aim is to get people … ready to storm the government.”"

The Education Department expanded its civil rights investigation of alleged antisemitism and Islamophobia this week to include one Georgia school district and five colleges. The probe is a part of the Biden administration’s effort to crack down on the “alarming nationwide rise in reports of antisemitism, anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and other forms of discrimination and harassment” on school campuses across the country, the department said in a statement. It did not specify what types of reports came from which schools.

The department’s Office for Civil Rights opened similar investigations into the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard, Columbia and Cornell universities last month, and Penn’s president resigned Saturday after criticism of her congressional hearing this week.

Important context

College campuses have been the site of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrations since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that left at least 1,200 Israelis dead.

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign against Hamas has caused serious destruction in the densely populated Palestinian enclave of the Gaza Strip, which Hamas rules and where at least 17,700 people have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The Israel-Gaza war has inflamed tensions over the rights of Palestinians and the security of the Jewish state. It has also led to a rise in reports of antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents on school campuses.

Which schools are under investigation?

More than a dozen schools are under investigation, according to a list the Education Department updates weekly.

1. Montana State University

2. Tulane University (Louisiana)

3. Union College (New York)

4. University of Cincinnati (Ohio)

5. Santa Monica College (California)

What are they accused of?

The schools are being investigated for allegedly violating Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin, including harassment based on a person’s shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. Programs accused of violating Title VI could lose federal funding.

How have students responded to the incidents?

Eyal Yakoby, 21, a senior at Penn, is one of two students suing the university for what they say was a failure to respond to antisemitic incidents on campus, The Washington Post reported.

The suit, filed Tuesday, says Penn has become “an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred.” The plaintiffs say Penn has run afoul of the Civil Rights Act.

Yakoby, who is American Israeli and Jewish, said the lawsuit came after months of inaction from administrators, The Post reported. He described a string of antisemitic acts over the past three months: a swastika on campus, then the hosting of what he called antisemitic speakers, then a break-in at Penn Hillel, then the vandalism of Chabad House, then a bomb threat against Hillel.

Penn officials did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.

How have elected officials responded to the scrutiny?

Congress and the White House have criticized the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for not being more forceful in their condemnations of antisemitism during this week’s Republican-led House Education and Workforce Committee hearing.

Magill announced her resignation Saturday.

Magill, who will stay until an interim president is appointed, will remain a tenured faculty member at Penn Carey Law, Scott L. Bok, chairman of the Penn Board of Trustees, said in a note to the university community.

“It has been my privilege to serve as President of this remarkable institution,” Magill said in a statement included at the end of Bok’s note. “It has been an honor to work with our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and community members to advance Penn’s vital missions.”

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who confronted Magill and others at the hearing, said the resignation was “the very beginning.”

“This forced resignation of the President of @Penn is the bare minimum of what is required,” Stefanik posted on X. She promised a “robust and comprehensive Congressional investigation.”

How have school leaders responded?

Harvard President Claudine Gay told the Republican-led panel that the university is increasing security in student residences and other campus spaces and launching a “robust program” of training for students, faculty members and staffers on antisemitism and Islamophobia.

“We will not cease our work until all members of our community feel safe and respected so they can learn and thrive,” Gay said during Tuesday’s congressional hearing.

An exchange near the end of Gay’s testimony riled Stefanik, who asked whether antisemitic speech would violate Harvard’s code of conduct.

Gay, who depicted her university as one that was tolerant of even offensive speech, said hateful comments can be a violation “depending on the context.” Campus and alumni groups have criticized her comments, with Stefanik and others calling for her resignation.

Gay apologized for her remarks during a Thursday interview with the Harvard Crimson, saying she “failed.”

“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” Gay told the Crimson. “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”

Meanwhile, the MIT Corp., which is the board of trustees for the institute, expressed its “full and unreserved support” for President Sally Kornbluth.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin walked out to the middle of the turf at Gillette Stadium, stood atop the Army-Navy logo for “America’s Game” and stoically flipped the coin ahead of the final matchup of the year for the military academy rivals. Army won the toss — and then everything else over the next 60 minutes of game action Saturday afternoon.

Black Knights quarterback Bryson Daily made all the necessary plays and the defense remained stout to give Army a 17-11 victory and the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy. Linebacker Kalib Fortner stripped the ball from Navy quarterback Tai Lavatai with 4:49 left and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown to put Army ahead by a seemingly unreachable 14 points.

A late touchdown and a subsequent defensive stop gave Navy (5-7) one last chance, but a Lavatai sneak on fourth and goal from the 2-yard line was ruled short with three seconds remaining. After a lengthy review, the ruling on the field stood. Army (6-6) took a safety to end the game, and the cadets stormed the field.

“Certainly if you have time, you would like to call something different,” Navy first-year coach Brian Newberry said of the fourth-down keeper. “Maybe a little far out to run quarterback sneak there. ... But you’re scrambling, the clock’s running. ... With the personnel grouping that we had on the field, what we had available and getting everybody lined up quickly, probably the best call we could have made in that situation. Knew the game was going to be a dogfight. It always is.”

“Man, one of our coaches said on the headset, ‘Welcome to the Army-Navy game,’ ” Army Coach Jeff Monken said. “He’s right. It’s always like that. We had a 14-point lead and, one second to go, they’re standing there knocking on the door with a chance to tie the game up. Unreal. But proud of our team. What a great win. Both teams just fought like crazy.”

Army scored its second straight win in the series. Last year’s matchup went to overtime for the first time and ended in heartbreak for the Mids on a fumble at the goal line in double overtime during a 20-17 defeat in Philadelphia.

Saturday’s Army-Navy game was the first at Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots, in the 124th meeting between the academies. All of the usual pageantry was present as students in uniform wrapped around the south end zone stands. A line of Navy parachutists in football uniforms floated onto the turf, followed by an Army group. Eight midshipmen met eight cadets at midfield, with the Navy octet spelling out “NUKE ARMY” on their backs as their counterparts offered “EAT SQUID.”

The festivities began hours before the game as ESPN hosted “College GameDay” on location and trotted out Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Coach Bill Belichick, who spoke to the Midshipmen on Friday night. (Belichick grew up in Annapolis, and his father, Steve, was an assistant coach at Navy.) Ex-Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski celebrated with fans in the stands, and a letter from President Biden was on the first page of the game program.

Army wore brown-and-black uniforms that honored soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division during the opening phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Navy’s dark blue scheme honored its submarine force, known as the Silent Service.

Army got on the board first with an easy four-yard touchdown pass from Dailey to Tyson Riley in a defensive bust by Navy. Riley was split wide right without a defender in the area. Shortly before the ball was snapped, two Navy defenders began to frantically point in his direction, but it was too late. By the time one began to move, the ball was snapped and Riley turned and threw it before the defense could recover.

“We talked about exactly how we wanted to line up to it but didn’t get it communicated out there, and [they] threw it pretty fast,” Newberry said. “... Just a poor job of communicating the formation.”

The Black Knights had the only other first-half points on Quinn Maretzki’s 47-yard field goal to close the second quarter.

That 10-point deficit had to feel much larger for a Navy team that had had little success on either side of the ball. The Mids went three-and-out on three of their first four possessions, and the other resulted in an interception on an overthrow by Xavier Arline after he led his team to the Army 24-yard line. Arline was replaced by Lavatai for Navy’s final possession of the half; the Mids reached Army territory but failed to convert on fourth and two at the 37. Newberry said the plan going in was to play both quarterbacks, and he thought Lavatai gave the Mids a better chance when they needed to throw the ball.

“I don’t think the confidence ever left our offense,” Lavatai said. “I think we knew that we could move the ball if we just stopped shooting ourselves in the foot. The message going into it was [to] trust in each other, believe that we can come back from this. And we kind of started trying to spread the ball out more. ... That seemed to work a little better.”

The Midshipmen finally got on the board with 12:45 left on a Nathan Kirkwood 37-yard field goal. Navy finally reached the end zone when Lavatai threw a 14-yard pass to Jayden Umbarger with 2:47 remaining, but a two-point conversion pass failed, leaving the deficit at 17-9. A few ill-timed penalties and a lack of explosive offensive plays doomed Navy despite a valiant effort by the defense.

“I think we’re just focused on doing our job,” said Navy linebacker Colin Ramos, who had a career-high 16 tackles. “We knew we would have the opportunity to keep in the game.”

Daily finished with 84 rushing yards and 54 passing for Army despite being bottled up in the second half. Kanye Udoh had 88 rushing yards.

“We’ve had a picture of Air Force holding that trophy in our trophy case where it’s supposed to be,” Daily said. “That hurts, seeing that every day, seeing Air Force holding it. I’m going to love seeing it Monday morning when we have it in the facility.”

Lavatai ran for 74 yards and surged late to throw for 179 for Navy. The senior’s passing yards, attempts (26) and completions (16) were career highs in his final game.

“That’s what they’ve been the whole time I’ve been here,” Newberry said of his team’s resiliency. “It’s easy to fight when things are going great. But when your back’s against the wall, that’s when you find out who you are. I know exactly who these kids are. I never doubted that they would fight to the end.”

Saturday’s loss was the last game for a senior class that went through plenty of adversity. It began with the coronavirus pandemic, which kept players sequestered in their rooms for long stretches. The Mids went 11-23 in the previous three years, leading to the firing of coach Ken Niumatalolo."

COLUMBUS, Ohio — For much of the rainy MLS Cup at the Columbus Crew’s gold-splashed palace, there was a greater sense of coronation than tension. The hungry hosts scored twice in the first half Saturday, and with Los Angeles FC flashing few of the elements that had positioned it for a possible repeat championship, the Crew seemed certain to raise the trophy for a third time.

But finals are almost never this easy, and when the final whistle broke a tension-cooked stretch run unfurling in heavy rain, the Crew and its record crowd at Lower.com Field celebrated a 2-1 thriller.

“I cried like a baby,” said Cucho Hernández, the game MVP.

Columbus, an MLS founding member, won the title for the second time in four seasons while denying LAFC’s attempt to become the first repeat champion since the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2011-12.

Hernández and Yaw Yeboah scored four minutes apart, and Columbus survived a whirlwind finish, including Dénis Bouanga’s 74th-minute goal and seven minutes of stoppage time, before a raucous audience of 20,802.

“I want to see my team face and embrace adversity, and they did it,” said Wilfried Nancy, Columbus’s first-year coach.

Implementing its possession game, the Crew put its stamp on the match right away. Captain Darlington Nagbe was the guiding light, orchestrating from central midfield and calming his team in anxious moments. He became a four-time champion — his second with the Crew after one apiece in Portland and Atlanta.

Nagbe, 33, set the tone in the pregame locker room by giving an emotional speech about the team’s journey.

“Everybody was crying because he is genuine,” Nancy said.

“It was mostly about telling each other how proud I am of them and how I need them,” Nagbe said. “We all need each other.”

Aidan Morris, Nagbe’s partner in central midfield, said of Nagbe, “Everything that comes out of this guy’s mouth, it’s just special to me.”

Nancy did his part as well. He had collected photos of all the players when they were young and held them up before the match.

“We had a good laugh,” Nancy said.

“Just to see where you’re coming from and where you want to get to, it was motivating,” Yeboah said. “It put a smile on your face; we were laughing at each other. Seeing my picture, it was emotional.”

Nagbe added: “That kind of broke the ice. That’s what Wilfried does, not only on the technical side but making sure he’s managing the guys right and then putting guys in the right mind frame.”

Nancy became the first Black coach to win an MLS title in the league’s 28 seasons.

“I’m so proud, but I’m not happy at the same time because this is not normal,” he said. “Simple as that. It’s something that has to change. I know MLS is trying to do that. This is not only in MLS. This is everywhere.”

Emotions surfaced hours before the match as Columbus supporters began gathering at the breweries and restaurants within walking distance of the stadium. A river of black and gold flowed down the boulevard and emptied at the gates.

Several hundred LAFC fans, led by actor Will Ferrell, a team investor, made the trip — and made their presence known in several upper-level sections. The energy radiated by dueling supporters’ groups at either end created a fun house for the senses and forged a world-class atmosphere.

Buoyed by the crowd, the Crew was on its front foot from the start. Its possession game kept LAFC locked in its own end. LAFC is most dangerous on the counterattack, but with limited possession, serious threats were scant.

Columbus’s breakthrough came from the penalty spot in the 33rd minute after Diego Palacios’s handball. Hernández converted into the low left corner for his fifth goal of the playoffs.

Moments later, amid a sudden deluge of rain, Malte Amundsen delivered a wonderful pass from the center circle to Yeboah making a run behind Ryan Hollingshead. As goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau came off his line, Yeboah slid it past him for his first goal in more than five months.

Crew goalkeeper Patrick Schulte described the pass as “picture perfect.”

LAFC Coach Steve Cherundolo lamented his team’s mistakes.

“We didn’t perform well enough to recover from those errors, which we don’t normally make,” he said.

Columbus dodged an own-goal scare in the final seconds of the half. When the second half began, the Crew was on the prowl for the knockout punch. With LAFC committing more players forward, Columbus salivated at the counterattacking opportunities.

Palacios headed Yeboah’s threat off the goal line. LAFC was teetering.

The Crew’s defensive work on Bouanga was close to immaculate. The runner-up for MLS regular season MVP — FC Cincinnati’s Luciano Acosta won it — was largely a non-factor on the left flank.

Midway through the second half, though, Columbus began to show cracks. LAFC’s Jesús Murillo disrupted a Columbus possession and crossed to Bouanga. Schulte made a sensational save — with his hands and jaw — but Bouanga banged in the rebound.

The pressure did not let up. Columbus did have chances to restore the two-goal lead, but LAFC survived. The Crew’s collective stress grew."
135,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Biden’s arming of Israel faces backlash as Gaza’s civilian toll grows,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/09/us-weapons-israel-gaza/,"Listen 9 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

The Biden administration faces mounting pressure over its provision of powerful weapons to Israel, with the spiraling death toll in Gaza deepening questions about whether the United States, as the country’s chief military backer, must do more to ensure civilians’ safety. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight Rights groups, along with a growing bloc from within President Biden’s Democratic Party, are intensifying scrutiny of the arms flow to Israel that has included tens of thousands of bombs since Hamas militants’ bloody attacks of Oct. 7. Local authorities say that at least 17,700 people, many of them civilians, have been killed in Israel’s operation to dismantle the Palestinian group.

At the heart of the debate, as Biden seeks billions of dollars in additional military aid for Israel’s Gaza operation, are the administration’s own rules for arming foreign nations, which indicate weapons transfers must not take place when the U.S. government assesses that violations of international law are “more likely than not” to occur.

Administration officials, offering the first detailed account of their approach to navigating those guidelines, say they have held extensive discussions with Israeli counterparts to ensure they understand the country’s obligations under international humanitarian law. But they acknowledge the United States is not conducting real-time assessments of Israel’s adherence to the laws of war.

A senior U.S. official, who like other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal discussions, said the administration was unable to make a contemporaneous evaluation of Israel’s compliance in part because officials lack access both to the intelligence Israeli forces use to plan their operations and to commanders’ intentions.

“What we can do from here in real time, feasibly but still rigorously, is to talk about the framework, the legal principles, talk about even some pretty nuanced, particular points of it,” the official said, referring to international norms governing conflict.

In certain instances, administration officials have posed specific questions to the Israelis, as they did following an October strike that killed more than 100 people in a refugee camp. In such cases, Israeli officials have shared information about their targeting and legal analysis, affirming U.S. officials’ conclusion that Israel shares their understanding of its obligations.

“We’re having some very rigorous and at times very tough conversations,” the official said.

Some legal experts say those discussions must be followed by more active monitoring of what occurs with American weapons before additional arms are supplied.

“That’s just the first step,” said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who now serves as senior adviser with the International Crisis Group. “Even if the U.S. and Israel agree on the same black letter rule, in this case the rules relevant to the conduct of hostilities and targeting, that still leaves open the question of how those rules are being interpreted.”

The heightened focus on American arms supplies comes as Israel intensifies its operations in southern Gaza, with the goal of ensuring that Hamas can never again mount the kind of assault that killed at least 1,200. Biden has vowed unqualified support to Washington’s closest Middle East ally, which for decades has ranked as the top recipient of U.S. security aid. This week, his administration took the unusual step of invoking an emergency declaration to expedite a sale of tank rounds to Israel despite mounting congressional concerns.

American-made arms have played a central role in the war. In the first month and a half, Israel dropped more than 22,000 guided and unguided bombs on Gaza that were supplied by Washington, according to previously undisclosed intelligence figures provided to Congress. And during that time, the United States has transferred at least 15,000 bombs, including 2,000-pound bunker busters, and more than 50,000 155mm artillery shells.

Gaza, meanwhile, is gripped by humanitarian crisis as millions seek shelter from Israeli airstrikes and a ground offensive that have turned to rubble vast swaths of the Palestinian enclave. The United Nations has warned of catastrophe if shipments of vital supplies are not increased significantly.

The situation presents a worsening dilemma for Biden, who has vowed absolute support for Israel’s security but has also promised to put human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy.

His administration has established a new system at the Pentagon for curbing civilian deaths in U.S. military operations and launched a separate initiative at the State Department to track harm caused by allies employing U.S. arms. Last year, the United States endorsed a global declaration designed to curb the use of explosive weapons in urban areas.

The suffering in Gaza has prompted unusual public admonitions from senior officials including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has pressed Israeli officials to proceed with greater caution.

Since fighting resumed after a seven-day cease-fire on Dec. 1, administration officials have lamented Israel’s use of powerful bombs near densely populated areas — a practice U.S. officials had urgently discouraged in private conversations and meetings in Israel, two U.S. officials said.

“There does remain a gap between exactly what I said when I was there, the intent to protect civilians, and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground,” Blinken said Thursday.

Israel’s military has sought to outline its procedures for avoiding civilian deaths but has also stressed what it says is the urgent threat facing its citizens. Like the United States, the Israeli military has lawyers who provide commanders with input, attempt to distinguish between combatants and civilians, and provide advance notice of airstrikes in certain situations. Israeli officials say, however, that Hamas embeds militants within civilian sites or in tunnels under them, including hospitals and apartment buildings, and that the group violated the laws of war, including by executing and kidnapping civilians, in its October assault.

U.S. officials who have met with Israeli counterparts in recent weeks cite the process Israeli forces use for calculating the value of individual militant targets and how many civilians are considered acceptable collateral damage. But they also said that Israel’s bar is far higher than the United States’ would be.

Publicly, U.S. officials say that it is too soon to judge whether Israel’s conduct complies with the laws of war and that the administration is gathering information to ensure U.S. aid is not being used in ways that violate U.S. laws, a process that could outlast the current conflict.

“This is an extremely challenging space where there is fog of war, where there are challenges to our ability to get proper information,” Mira Resnick, deputy assistant secretary of state in charge of arms transfers, said in a recent interview.

“We don’t have information that would indicate that we have crossed that more-likely-than-not threshold,” she said.

The Biden administration has not declined any request from Israel, officials said, and no cutoff of military assistance is being considered or communicated. And officials stressed that the administration believes it can better influence Israel’s treatment of civilians if it maintains strong backing for the Jewish state.

Still, the senior U.S. official cautioned that the Biden administration’s viewpoint may evolve as the conflict wears on.

“There is never a final answer to this and never a ‘put your pencil down’ moment in looking at what other actors are doing in the world, especially ones we’re providing support to,” the senior official said. “We are always evaluating, and reevaluating and reevaluating, our understanding of what they’re doing with it and our comfort with it.”

The situation recalls earlier moments when Washington has faced difficult decisions about arming allies, as it did in 2016, when the Obama administrations suspended certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia over its repeated bombing of civilian sites in Yemen. The decision followed warnings from State Department lawyers who worried that the United States risked becoming complicit in potential Saudi war crimes in Yemen because it supplies arms to Riyadh.

During the Reagan administration, the United States did suspend arms shipments to Israel over concerns about the use of cluster munitions in neighboring Lebanon.

Annie Shiel, U.S. advocacy director for the Center for Civilians in Conflict, questioned how Biden’s position achieves his stated goal of protecting innocent Gazans.

“On one hand, U.S. officials are saying Israel must do more to protect civilians, while on the other essentially providing a blank check, with no conditions, for how Israel is actually using U.S. assistance,” she said. “Where is the leverage in that?”

It is unclear whether the administration can allay growing concerns in Congress. Democrats have flagged the potential use of American weapons in lethal attacks involving civilians, including an incident in which, according to Amnesty International, U.S. bombs were used in what the group called an unlawful strike that killed 43 civilians in Gaza. Civil society groups have also voiced concerns that U.S. artillery shells could be used in a way that endangers Gazans.

This week, five senators appealed to Biden, condemning the Hamas attack but also decrying the human suffering resulting from Israel’s campaign.

“The risk of violating international law and our own standards increases as Israel uses explosive weapons in densely populated areas,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) wrote.

Lawmakers also complain about the administration’s lack of transparency about the weapons provided to Israel, a stark contrast to how it has accounted for aid to Ukraine. A measure introduced this week by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) would require the administration to verify that arms are being used in accordance with international law.

In an interview, Warren said the U.S. government had an obligation to condition assistance on compliance with U.S. and global laws."

AMMAN, Jordan — Palestinians in Gaza are facing mass starvation amid a punishing Israeli offensive that has “stripped families’ options for survival,” aid groups warned Saturday, a day after the United States vetoed a U.N. cease-fire resolution that the groups said would have facilitated the delivery of food and other emergency supplies.

The warnings over spreading hunger — from the United Nations, international aid agencies and Palestinian relief workers in Gaza — compounded fears for civilians already grappling with fierce fighting, heavy Israeli bombardment, the collapse of the health system and repeated displacement.

The draft resolution, backed by a majority of the U.N. Security Council, demanded an immediate halt to hostilities, the unconditional release of all hostages and humanitarian access in Gaza. The U.S. move to veto the resolution, which it called “rushed” and lacking in consultation, drew swift condemnation across the region, including from human rights groups, American partners in the Middle East and relief groups working in Gaza.

After the Security Council failed to “provide respite for civilians in Gaza,” London-based humanitarian organization Save the Children said in a statement Saturday that it has “continued to hear harrowing accounts of families going multiple days without food, shelter, water and access to healthcare.”

“Deliberately depriving the civilian population of food, water and fuel and willfully impeding relief supplies is using starvation as a method of warfare, which inevitably has a deadly impact on children,” the group said.

The U.N. World Food Program’s deputy executive director, Carl Skau, told Reuters after visiting Gaza that “half of the population are starving” and described the humanitarian needs as “massive.”

Israel has escalated its offensive in southern Gaza in recent days, pushing Palestinians toward Rafah, on the border with Egypt. Hospitals and shelters in the south are overrun, and hundreds of people have been killed almost daily, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

On Saturday, the ministry said 17,700 people had been killed by Israel in Gaza since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants staged a brutal attack on Israeli communities near the border, killing at least 1,200 people.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday that fighter jets and ground troops “continued combat in different locations” across the Gaza Strip. Several sirens sounded in Israeli communities near the border with Gaza, it added.

The IDF on Saturday directed residents in several neighborhoods in north Gaza to evacuate and warned that fighting raged around a stretch of the main north-south highway, Salah al-Din. The military also directed residents of various neighborhoods in Khan Younis in southern Gaza to evacuate, saying a road near the north and east of Khan Younis city had become “a battlefield” and should be avoided.

Israel says its evacuation directives are aimed at reducing civilian deaths, including through a numbered map, airdropped leaflets and social media posts. Gazans reached by The Washington Post say the Israeli orders have been vague or contradictory, often sending them to other battlefields. Other residents with little internet or phone access say they have not received warnings at all.

As they search for safety, Palestinians in Gaza said they were also struggling to buy — or even find — food. “The prices are astronomical,” said Mohamad, 29, in Gaza City.

Large bags of flour that cost about $9 before the war now cost more than 10 times that — and were “not available in most cases,” he said. The humanitarian aid that did reach the area — in northern Gaza — was “often stolen,” he said, then resold at high prices.

Most people “enter uninhabited homes and take what they find inside.” He said he had been one of them. “It is a struggle for survival.”

Another Gaza resident, an employee at a relief organization, said his group was previously distributing goods it bought at the market to homes and schools in Rafah. But it was recently forced to stop because “nothing is available in the market,” said the resident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.

Two days ago, people looted a storehouse belonging to UNRWA, the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees, “in front of my eyes,” the resident said. “There are people who have become bandits, blocking the routes of trucks with weapons and begging for aid.”

“Famine in Gaza,” he added, “is a matter of time.”

There was also growing alarm Saturday over the safety of patients and staff members at Al-Awda Hospital, one of the last remaining medical facilities in northern Gaza. The hospital was being “besieged” by Israeli troops, according to Renzo Fricke, the head of mission for Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, which supports the hospital.

One of MSF’s staff members in the hospital reported Friday that a sniper outside had killed two people at the hospital, including a volunteer nurse, Fricke said. The organization’s staff had stayed at the hospital to care for patients, even as others fled northern Gaza.

Israel has argued that a cease-fire would leave Hamas in power, posing a threat to its security. The United States, Israel’s unflinching ally during the war, called the cease-fire resolution “not only unrealistic but dangerous.”

Robert A. Wood, the alternate U.S. representative to the United Nations, said after the vote that it would leave Hamas “in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on Oct. 7.”

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Saturday that the U.S. veto made it responsible for the bloodshed of Palestinians and complicit in “genocide, ethnic cleansing and war crimes committed by the Israeli occupation forces.”

Advertisement

The U.S. policy “has become a danger to the world, posing a threat to international peace and security,” Abbas said in a statement, according to WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency. “This decision will haunt the United States for years.”

The foreign minister of Oman, a country that has close relations with the United States and has helped mediate between Washington and its adversaries in the region, condemned the veto as a “shameful insult to humanitarian norms” in a post Saturday on X, formerly called Twitter.

“I deeply regret that the United States should sacrifice the lives of innocent civilians for the cause of Zionism,” the minister, Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, wrote.

As the United States faced growing international pressure to support a cease-fire, the Biden administration said Saturday that it has approved a $106.5 million sale of Army tank ammunition and equipment to Israel by invoking an emergency declaration that will bypass Congress’s typical review period for weapons sales.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken used the emergency declaration because “it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,” the State Department said in a news release.

A State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military matter, defended the emergency measure, saying the administration has used it to send weapons to Ukraine.

“Given Israel’s urgent defense needs, the secretary has determined this exercise of his delegated authority appropriate in this case as well,” the official said.

Josh Paul, a former State Department official who recently resigned after working for more than a decade on arms sales issues, criticized the decision to sell the weapons without congressional approval."

Late in the first half Saturday afternoon against Syracuse, Georgetown guard Rowan Brumbaugh poked the ball away from the Orange’s Chris Bell, dribbled toward the basket and drew a foul from behind. Bell, who committed the infraction, compounded matters by exchanging words with Georgetown’s Wayne Bristol Jr., who smiled and clapped as the officials called a double technical.

Even with a fresh cast of coaches and players, a rivalry that helped define the original incarnation of the Big East continues to resonate. The latest installment in front of 14,193 at Capital One Arena ended with the rebuilding Hoyas falling, 80-68, amid repeated misses from three-point range, turnovers at inopportune junctures and defensive lapses that have plagued them during their first season under Coach Ed Cooley.

Georgetown (5-4) has lost five of seven in a series that dates from 1930. The 12-point defeat was the largest by the Hoyas at home in the matchup since January 1998, when Syracuse (7-3), which joined the ACC in 2013, triumphed, 84-66.

“I think our personality comes out when we can score,” Cooley said after the Hoyas mustered their third-fewest points of the season. “For us to continue to improve, we’ve got to hang our hat on defense because the ball’s not always going to go in the basket. Credit [Syracuse]; they played well. I appreciated everyone who came out. I hated seeing all the Syracuse orange that was in our building. That goes to tell you how intense this game is.”

Among the evidence Saturday that the Hoyas are in dire need of a tuneup on defense: The Orange shot 53.7 percent from the field and had two players, JJ Starling and Quadir Copeland, reach career highs in points. Transition defense was especially problematic, with Syracuse owning a 20-2 advantage in fast-break points.

Jayden Epps led Georgetown with 17 points and six assists but shot just 6 for 17, including 1 for 9 on three-pointers. The sophomore transfer from Illinois shot 46.2 percent from behind the arc over the season’s first eight games.

Supreme Cook added 16 points and 10 rebounds for the senior transfer’s third double-double of the season. No other Hoyas player scored more than nine points as they shot a season-worst 5 for 26 (19.2 percent) on three-pointers and committed 14 turnovers that led to 20 points for the Orange.

“It definitely felt like a Big East game,” said Cooley, who’s plenty familiar with the Georgetown-Syracuse rivalry as the former coach at Providence. Syracuse “did a great job. Their guards played really, really well, and I thought their guards controlled the whole game. It’s unfortunate we lost back-to-back home games, but in doing so we’ll continue to learn, develop and grow.”

Judah Mintz confounded Georgetown with a game-high 25 points. The dynamic sophomore guard, a Fort Washington native who played at Gonzaga High, shot 6 for 12 with five steals and went 13 for 15 at the free throw line.

The decisive stretch unfolded early in the second half, when careless ball security and wayward shooting by Georgetown allowed the Orange to secure a double-digit lead courtesy of a 17-6 run capped by Starling’s pull-up jumper. Starling finished with 21 points and made 8 of 14 shots from the field, including all three three-pointers, to go with five rebounds. Copeland added 14 points on 6-for-7 shooting in the first game between the schools since 1976 without retired Jim Boeheim as the Orange’s coach.

To underscore the bitterness of the rivalry, Mintz celebrated, in word and deed, in front of the Georgetown bench in the final minute."
138,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,"Haley surges, DeSantis stumbles. That’s the narrative. Is it that simple?",https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/12/09/haley-desantis-trump-iowa-caucus/,"Listen 6 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

The word “narrative” often dominates descriptions of politics, and right now the narrative about the competition to become Donald Trump’s principal rival for the Republican presidential nomination appears set: Nikki Haley is on a booster rocket and Ron DeSantis is on the brink of collapse.

Reality seems more nuanced.

There’s no question that DeSantis has been a major disappointment to his boosters and the coverage of his campaign from the start has been tough and critical, aided by the Florida governor’s sometimes rocky performance as a candidate. He’s slid in the polls since entering the race as the clear No. 2, and has been the favorite target of the former president, who has mocked him mercilessly.

DeSantis underperformed early expectations, which were probably inflated given Trump’s dominance over the Republican Party. He stumbled at times, particularly in the early months when he lacked a clear focus for his candidacy. He has been demeaned for not having a winning personality. His campaign and well-funded super PAC have been in disarray, providing fodder for endless critical stories.

Haley, in contrast, has benefited from being dismissed early as an unlikely long-distance runner. The former South Carolina governor and former United Nations ambassador has skills as a candidate that DeSantis doesn’t have. She is a charismatic and savvy communicator. She has made the most of being underappreciated, something she learned in the viper’s nest of South Carolina Republican politics. She has taken advantage of her gender, joking about her stiletto heels and the “fellas,” to stand apart from DeSantis and the other men she is running against.

On the debate stage, both are scripted, but Haley is agile and sharp-tongued while DeSantis is a bulldozer with a bullhorn. Many pundits call her the best performer in their post-debate commentary, but polls by The Washington Post, 538 and Ipsos more often than not have given that nod to DeSantis. That was the case after Wednesday’s debate in Alabama and a reversal from the results of the debate in Miami, where those Republicans who watched thought Haley did the best.

Haley has certainly profited from her debate performances. Her poll numbers have risen while DeSantis’s have stalled or declined. That has added to the narrative of trajectories going in opposite directions.

In New Hampshire, that’s true. In July, the RealClearPolitics poll average there showed DeSantis at about 18 percent, Haley at about 4 percent, with Trump leading at 44 percent. Today, Haley is at 19 percent, DeSantis at 8 percent and trailing former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who is polling at 11 percent. Trump leads at nearly 46 percent.

Iowa presents a somewhat different picture. There are few reliable recent polls of likely Iowa caucusgoers. What has been the most reputable over time is the Iowa Poll, this year the work of the Des Moines Register and NBC News. In October, this poll showed Haley and DeSantis tied at 16 percent, far behind Trump’s 43 percent. Haley had risen 10 percentage points over the previous two months, DeSantis had fallen 3 percentage points. Polls taken since then by other organizations have shown Haley surpassing DeSantis in the state.

The national narrative of a rising Haley has given her campaign energy and she is attracting good-sized crowds in Iowa now, as she has elsewhere. DeSantis is playing the state the way he does debates, grinding away methodically and trying to screen out the noise. He recently concluded a tour of all 99 counties in the state, a tactic pioneered by Iowa Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley and now a rite of passage for some GOP presidential candidates. He hopes this kind of diligence will be rewarded on caucus night, Jan. 15.

Despite drawing outsize media attention, Iowa caucuses results have proved to be poor indicators of the future in recent Republican presidential contests. The winners in 2008 (Mike Huckabee), 2012 (Rick Santorum) and 2016 (Ted Cruz) all failed to win the nomination. Trump could break that streak with a caucus victory next month as the first step toward cementing the nomination relatively quickly. Whether Iowa will be an accurate or inaccurate predictor of who is the preferred candidate to become Trump’s chief challenger is the question now.

A strong second-place finish by Haley in Iowa would cripple DeSantis, as he has gone all-in in Iowa and she is far-better positioned in New Hampshire, which holds its primary election right after Iowa. He has more assets than her in Iowa, such as the endorsement of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Trump antagonist, and the support of evangelical leaders like Bob Vander Plaats.

That kind of institutional backing has been hugely valuable to candidates in the past. But Trump also enjoys support within the evangelical community that likely will cut down on the DeSantis vote.

DeSantis also should have a superior ground operation, which has been put together under the auspices of Never Back Down, the big super PAC that formed at the start of his campaign. Never Back Down has gone through a period of infighting and disruption recently, however, and that could affect DeSantis’s ability to turn out voters for the caucuses. It also is uncertain whether the paid organizers working on his behalf will be able to mobilize enough caucusgoers to side with him.

Haley has lacked similar organizational muscle in the state, though now has the backing of Americans for Prosperity, a wing of the vast political machinery of billionaire conservative Charles Koch. AFP has done work in Iowa before and perhaps can help Haley make up ground in the get-out-the-vote competition over the next few weeks.

Many Iowans don’t fully tune into presidential politics until the final weeks of a campaign, and sentiment historically has shifted — and shifted dramatically — in the final days. That could work to Haley’s advantage unless she has a hiccup along the way. A debate has been scheduled for Jan. 10, five days before the caucuses. With Trump likely to skip the debate and with questions about whether Christie and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will meet the qualifications, this might become the first head-to-head encounter between Haley and DeSantis. In Iowa, at least, it could be closely watched.

Iowa’s caucus constituency is decidedly conservative and heavily evangelical in its makeup. Though quite conservative herself, Haley is seen in this field as a more moderate candidate. What happens there in a little more than a month could add to Haley’s luster or tarnish it, as the dogged DeSantis seeks to prove the current narrative wrong. The worry for him is that, even if he eclipses her in Iowa, his path after that narrows quickly. More than anything, however, Iowa should offer clues about whether Trump will have any serious competition on what has been a steady march toward the nomination."
139,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Shohei Ohtani to join Dodgers as wild free agency ends with $700 million deal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/09/shohei-ohtani-signs-dodgers/,"Listen 7 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

The most scrutinized and analyzed free agency in MLB history ended Saturday afternoon, when Shohei Ohtani’s winding offseason journey ended a few miles from where it started in a record-setting contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ohtani announced the deal on Instagram as his representatives passed around its unthinkable terms: $700 million over 10 seasons. Until Saturday, Ohtani’s former Los Angeles Angels teammate Mike Trout had the richest contract in baseball history. It pays him $426.5 million over 12 seasons.

Ohtani’s deal was long expected to break records. After all, every other massive baseball contract signed in the modern era paid its recipient to pitch or hit at an elite level. Ohtani can do both.

But the $700 million the Dodgers committed to him — an even $70 million per year in average annual value — is far and above what even the most optimistic prognosticators expected. It assumes, at least in the most basic of calculations, that Ohtani will be worth about $35 million annually as a hitter and as a pitcher. For reference, only four players are earning that much as hitters: Aaron Judge, Trout, Carlos Correa and Anthony Rendon. Only six players have earned that much annually as pitchers: Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander, Jacob deGrom, Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg, who is effectively retired.

In practice, the Dodgers are not paying Ohtani to pitch next season. The 29-year-old underwent his second elbow surgery in five years this fall, and the soonest he is expected to pitch again is 2025. Because of that injury and those that preceded it, the Dodgers cannot be sure how much pitching they will get from Ohtani during the deal. But Ohtani is the biggest star in the world and is now playing for one of the sport’s most prominent franchises. The Dodgers are paying him to hit and to pitch as much as he can. But more than anything, they are paying him to be an icon.

And they will not be paying him as much annually as it seems. Ohtani’s deal contains what a person familiar with it referred to as “unprecedented deferrals” — the majority, that person said, of his annual salary. California taxes are high, and deferrals help with those. But in waiting to pay large chunks of Ohtani’s salary until after his playing years, the Dodgers also free up money to spend on his teammates now.

Advertisement

Those teammates include former MVPs Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman as well as all-star catcher Will Smith and a familiar cast that has not missed the playoffs in a decade. While Ohtani spent years dodging questions about what he would prioritize in his long-term baseball home, he always made clear that he wanted to win. Few franchises have won as reliably in recent years — or seem positioned to continue winning in future ones — as the Dodgers.

The other thing Ohtani always made clear was that he wanted to play for a team that would let him continue to pitch and hit when he is able. That he agreed to a deal with the Dodgers suggests Los Angeles — an organization not exactly prone to letting one player dictate its direction — is willing to let him try for as long as he feels he can. The Dodgers are certainly paying him like a player they expect to pitch again at some point: More complete hitters have signed for far less annually than Ohtani did.

What Ohtani will be able to give the Dodgers as a pitcher remains to be seen. He had Tommy John surgery in 2018 and needed another surgical procedure on his elbow earlier this year. When he has been healthy, Ohtani has been dominant. Until he injured that elbow again in 2023, the right-hander had compiled three elite seasons in which he pitched to a 2.84 ERA while averaging more than 11 strikeouts per nine innings and just more than 5⅔ innings per start.

Advertisement

But even if he is limited on the mound moving forward, Ohtani is unprecedented. He has grown into one of MLB’s most powerful left-handed hitters with a .922 OPS and a .274 batting average, both of which are well below the numbers he put up when he finally got healthy and comfortable in the past three years. Since the start of the 2021 season, Ohtani has won two American League MVP awards and could have won another, maintained a .964 OPS and averaged more than 40 homers and drove in nearly 100 runs per season in an Angels lineup that was not as deep as the one he is joining.

When Ohtani shared his Instagram post Saturday — topped with the Dodgers logo, his message clear — it ended a wild few weeks of speculation conducted by an industry that had only a blurry picture of what its greatest star really wanted. His free agency, like his career, had developed into something baseball had never seen. When the two-way star from Japan was posted for MLB teams to sign six years ago, before he proved himself as one of the game’s best starters and power hitters all in one, there was widespread intrigue. But as the end of his deal with the Angels approached this year, even as a torn elbow ligament jeopardized his pitching career, there was a frenzy.

In that frenzy, the Dodgers were long considered the favorites, though “favorites” was always a loose term because, whatever anyone said, no one really knew what Ohtani wanted. For years, he dodged questions about where he would want to be, and handicapping the race was made difficult by its secrecy this offseason. Ohtani, the reigning AL MVP, did not address the media for months, and his representatives doggedly avoided providing hints of his intentions. Because of his familiarity with Southern California and their seemingly endless financial resources, the Dodgers always seemed most certain to make a credible push. They were the first team to admit meeting with Ohtani this offseason, though at times that seemed as if it could be a knock against them.

Advertisement

The Toronto Blue Jays reportedly flew Ohtani to their spring training facility in Dunedin, Fla., for a recent meeting. The San Francisco Giants, who also have money to spend and a need to inject their franchise with superstar energy, reportedly met with him, too. The Angels wanted to bring him back, if possible.

Share this article Share

At times, rumors spread that Ohtani wanted to stay on the West Coast, to play with a fellow Japanese player, not to play with a fellow Japanese player and so on. The Chicago Cubs seemed to make a real push. The New York teams never seemed to bite, and the Seattle Mariners, who once seemed to make sense, started cutting payroll in ways that indicated they would not be able to afford a record deal.

But in the end, the Dodgers were always there. They would allow Ohtani to stay in an area he knows well and guaranteed him the chance to win as much as any franchise can. He will join a lineup that already includes Betts and Freeman, one that already cleared the designated hitter spot for him when it signed J.D. Martinez to a one-year deal before last season instead of finding a long-term fit. And after he recovers from elbow surgery, he is slated to join a Dodgers rotation that relied largely on prospects last year and could use a few new anchors moving forward.

140,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,College football players still aren’t paid. That’s the real scandal.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/09/college-football-players-paid/,"Listen 6 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

On Thursday, for the third time this week, the real travesty about the College Football Playoff was underscored. It had nothing to do with unbeaten Florida State being left out of the four-team championship tournament or once-beaten Alabama leapfrogging it by way of a knockout win over two-time defending champion Georgia.

Instead, it was found in one lawsuit filed in California by three star college athletes against the NCAA for barring them from being paid for their play and in another suit filed by several states over the NCAA’s transfer rules.

That came on the heels of NCAA President Charlie Baker suggesting Tuesday that he would like to create a new group of the biggest, wealthiest and most influential college sports programs that could pay their players. (That morning, I had even mentioned college athletics’ disingenuousness to NPR host Michel Martin as we wrapped up a conversation on “Morning Edition” about the uproar around whether undefeated Florida State was wronged. “What people should be mad about,” I said, “is the fact that the players are still not going to share in all the revenues that have generated through this tournament. That’s … the real problem.”)

Advertisement

And that, my long-held lament, followed a remark most of us overlooked by Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh to ESPN’s Rece Davis, who was interviewing Harbaugh about his team ascending to the top seed in the playoff quartet.

“It’s not about one person. It’s not about any coach. It’s about the players,” Harbaugh said. “I love that you’re talking about the players. That’s who everyone comes to see. Those are the people who put in the work. You hear a lot of the controversy about who should’ve been in [the playoff] and who shouldn’t have been in it. . . . As you make those comments, I just hope you also remember it’s the players, and don’t forget to give them a share of the revenue.”

Then analyst Kirk Herbstreit joined the discussion and asked Harbaugh about how good his team was a year ago, and Harbaugh’s plea for equitable remuneration for college football’s undercompensated laborers evaporated into nattering sports blather.

Still, this argument has never been louder and clearer than now. It is no longer far-fetched or preposterous or impossible. College athletes are about to get paid. It is inevitable. Very soon. I would bet (especially since you can do so on college sports so easily and above board now) by this time next year. That is also when college football’s playoff expands again — something to which the keepers of the game once said they would never agree until they found themselves unable to turn down bigger and bigger bags of money. It will go to 12 teams from four, after having gone to four from two and to two from none. It will generate upward of three times the loot that Michigan, Washington, Texas and Alabama will bring in this season to crown a champion after two semifinal games and a championship.

The bags of money are so gorged with cash now that some court of law — if not that of public opinion, which has manifested itself in Capitol Hill proposals such as the College Athletes Bill of Rights — will force or shame college sports’ overlords into doing the ethical and moral thing by divvying up their overstuffed pie into slices for players.

NIL, the much-ballyhooed acronym that allows college athletes to turn their name, image and likeness into cash and gifts, was never a remedy for college sports’ inequity. Its promotion, however, confused many into believing as much. But it’s just some court decision-inspired patchwork relief for athletes from the NCAA’s long-onerous control of their fame, which the association turned into gobs of dough through commercialization that helped make multimillionaires out of coaches, athletic directors, conference commissioners and NCAA honchos. The movement afoot now will force colleges and universities to hand over a share of the loot they make off the blood and sweat of those athletes, disproportionately Black males in football and basketball — just like professional sports leagues bargain with their athletes. After all, it has been a couple of generations since there was a discernible difference between how the pros thrive and how major college sports work.

Indeed, the Knight Commission, the highbrow watchdog of all things college sports, pointed out this year that, in a few years, a 12-team playoff could generate $2 billion annually, or $1.4 billion more than now, for whatever major conferences are around then. This year there were five such conferences — the Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, Pac-12 and SEC — filled with 69 schools. Next season there will be four conferences after the Pac-12 dissolves and all but two of its members — Oregon State and Washington State — are absorbed by the other conferences.

More money, all of us should understand by now, is what conference realignment has been about since it ramped up in the past few years. The Big Ten and the SEC have been positioning themselves for the day the law decrees that they, at the least, treat revenue-generating sport athletes like the cogs in the college athletics industrial complex that they have become. The SEC, with Texas and Oklahoma coming in next year to join recent addition Texas A&M , will have seven of the 10 richest athletic departments in the country. The Big Ten, in major markets from New York to the Pacific Ocean, banked a record — for the moment — $7 billion TV contract. Former Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren said the plan he sold to CBS was modeled after the broadcaster’s $2 billion-per-year NFL Sunday package.

Not to share these windfalls with the players at this point is theft.

The lawsuit filed by players Thursday, which includes two women as plaintiffs — Stanford soccer player Nya Harrison and TCU basketball player Sedona Prince — is not alone in the legal pipeline. A couple of high school basketball stars sued the NCAA last month over its denial of their college eligibility because they cashed in on their NIL while playing for a private high school. There is, most notably, Johnson v. NCAA, which demands athletes be deemed employees and therefore subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act. There are several complaints before the National Labor Relations Board to demand the same employment status for Pac-12 athletes and those at the Ivy League’s Dartmouth."

Carol Miller still remembers when her brother Kenneth was forced to leave their D.C. home and live in another state. She remembers seeing his belongings packed into a trunk. She remembers watching a family member take a trip every month to visit him. She remembers the excitement that the end of each school year brought, because it meant her brother was coming home.

When her brother first left home, he was 8 years old, recalled Miller, who is three years younger than he. Their parents didn’t want to send him away. They also had no choice. He was Black and deaf, and at the time, those two parts of his identity placed him among children who faced a unique injustice in the nation’s capital. They were forced to travel far from their homes to get an education.

A letter the Miller family saved shows what happened when the children’s mother, Louise B. Miller, tried to enroll Kenneth in the only school in D.C. for deaf children.

Advertisement

“You do not mention in your letter that your child is a Negro child,” the letter reads. “Of course that makes a difference. There is segregation in the school system in the District of Columbia.”

The letter informed her that the school had a contract with the District to serve White deaf children. Black deaf children who lived in the city, it said, were expected to enroll in a school hours away in Maryland. Carol Miller said her mother visited that school, and when she saw the conditions, she refused to leave her son there. The family instead paid to send him to a school in Pennsylvania.

Louise B. Miller could have quietly accepted that those children had to leave their city and families to get a basic education. What she did instead marks a significant moment in American history that has gone mostly unseen and unacknowledged.

When we talk about civil rights activists, Louise B. Miller’s name does not usually come up. But it should. The D.C. mother stood up for her son and other Black deaf children, and in doing so, she forced the campus of Gallaudet University to enroll Black students before other schools across the country were ordered to desegregate.

A historical account from the university shows that Black students were permitted to attend the Kendall School, which served students from kindergarten through 12th grade on campus, between 1898 and 1905. Then parents of White students complained, and Black students were no longer allowed to enroll. That changed in 1952, after Louise B. Miller led a group of Black parents whose children had been denied admission to the school in filing a class-action lawsuit against the District of Columbia Board of Education.

The families won their case in July 1952. That victory has been credited with setting an important precedent. It occurred two years before the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that laws mandating and enforcing racial segregation in public schools were unconstitutional.

While that legal win by Miller and other parents allowed them to keep their children in the city, it’s important to note that those students did not receive the same treatment as their White peers. For the first two years, they were enrolled in a separate school, the Kendall School Division II for Negroes, and placed in a separate building with separate teachers. Later, when it came time for them to graduate from high school, unlike White students, they were not given diplomas.

The University took steps to right that wrong this past July when it held a poignant, long-belated graduation ceremony. I shared with you in an earlier column what that day looked like. University officials handed out diplomas for 24 students who should have received them more than six decades earlier. Family members accepted the honor for students who did not live long enough to see that day, and five surviving students attended the ceremony. Kenneth Miller was one of them.

“At last!” he said through sign language as he crossed the stage, using a walker for support.

It was a powerful scene to witness, and it felt a full-circle moment. His mother fought for him to get an education on the campus, and there he was, onstage, wearing a cap and gown.

For those who had never heard of Louise B. Miller, the ceremony offered a powerful introduction. But it was also just that — an intro, a beginning. The university has put in place plans that will allow future generations who step on the campus to know her name.

The university recently announced the official launch of the public phase of a fundraising campaign that aims to honor Miller’s legacy. The Necessity of Now campaign will fund an outdoor learning space on the campus called the “Louise B. Miller Pathways and Gardens: A Legacy to Black Deaf Children.” The funds will also go toward supporting the university’s Center for Black Deaf Studies, which is described as “the first of its kind in the world to preserve and advance Black Deaf history and culture.”

“Louise Miller is an unsung hero of educational and racial justice in America,” Evon Black, the interim co-director of the Center for Black Deaf Studies and co-chair of the Necessity of Now campaign, said. “Mrs. Miller’s impact is truly a story of how one mother, through her love, courage, resilience and determination, profoundly and positively impacted generations of the Black deaf community and helped reshape our nation’s educational landscape. Because of her fight, Black deaf education matters.”

She described the Necessity of Now campaign as “an important step forward, not only for our Black deaf community but for all to see the critical need for and the power of restorative justice.”

The campaign aims to raise $23 million. Of that, the university has said, $13 million will go toward the Pathways and Gardens, and $10 million will be dedicated to the Center for Black Deaf Studies.

Carol Miller said her mother majored in music at Howard University, was a skilled seamstress and had a way of making holidays unforgettable.

“She always attended to our needs and some of our wants,” she recalled.

Miller, who now has partial hearing loss, said that, like Kenneth, her two younger brothers, Gerald and Justin, were born deaf. She said her younger brothers attended special classes in D.C. public schools until their needs could not be met. Then they were transferred to Kendall.

I asked her what she wanted people to remember about her mother’s legacy. “If you see a wrong you must try to correct it,” she said."

The NFL will prohibit the Philadelphia Eagles’ top security staffer, Dom DiSandro, from being on the sideline for Sunday night’s game against the Dallas Cowboys in Arlington, Tex., according to two people familiar with the deliberations. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The league’s action Saturday was a result of DiSandro’s involvement in the sideline incident that led to San Francisco 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw’s ejection from last Sunday’s game in Philadelphia. The NFL has been reviewing the matter this week.

This does not represent a formal suspension, according to the people with knowledge of the deliberations. The NFL “is still considering all aspects of the altercation,” one of those people said. Disciplinary measures against the Eagles and DiSandro, the team’s chief security officer, apparently remain possible. In the meantime, DiSandro will not have sideline access for Sunday’s game.

DiSandro, who also holds the title of senior adviser to the general manager and has been with the organization since 1999, is still permitted to perform his other duties, according to another person with knowledge of the matter, and is expected to travel with the team, be in the locker room and attend game day security meetings as usual.

“This is an ongoing conversation with the NFL, and we are going to respect the restriction that is currently in place,"" the Eagles said in a written statement Saturday issued through a spokesman. “Although Dom will not be on the sideline this Sunday, he will continue to fulfill his role with the team in all other capacities.”

The Eagles have a league-best record of 10-2 and lead the Cowboys by one game in the NFC East entering Sunday’s key game.

The episode occurred during the second half of the 49ers’ 42-19 triumph at Lincoln Financial Field in a rematch of last season’s NFC championship game. Greenlaw was penalized for slamming wide receiver DeVonta Smith to the turf along the Eagles’ sideline following a catch. DiSandro and others on the Eagles’ sideline objected to the hit, leading to a confrontation during which Greenlaw swiped with his left hand at DiSandro’s face.

The officials, in consultation with members of the NFL’s officiating department in New York, ejected Greenlaw. They also ordered DiSandro to leave the Eagles’ sideline.

The NFL fined Greenlaw $10,927 for unnecessary roughness for his hit on Smith, the league announced Saturday.

San Francisco Coach Kyle Shanahan and several 49ers players said following the game they found it inappropriate that an Eagles staffer who is not a player or coach would be involved in such an incident with an opposing player.

While the NFL reviewed the incident, it sent a memo to all teams Wednesday reminding them of the relevant policies.

The NFL wrote in the memo that league rules “clearly prohibit non-player personnel — coaches, trainers, equipment staff, security officers, or others — from making physical contact with, taunting, or directing abusive or insulting language toward opposing players, game officials, or others involved in a game …. Under no circumstances are club personnel to engage with or make physical contact with another club’s player(s) or other personnel.”

Greenlaw and DiSandro reportedly exchanged apologies this week."

As a student involved in student government at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale during the 1969-70 school year, I had an unusual opportunity. Several students were asked to participate in filming a John Denver TV pilot. My recollection is the concept was a series hosted by Denver with the setting to be the Cellar Door in Georgetown. The dozen or so students showed up at a studio somewhere near Alexandria. A set gave the appearance of the Cellar Door. For perhaps two hours John Denver sat and stood on the stage and repeatedly played his acoustic guitar, singing a song, “Something to Sing About.” I also recall his either describing or reciting that the first episode would feature Peter, Paul and Mary. I have not found any reference to the show. Denver’s career skyrocketed not long thereafter and I have assumed this project simply withered on the vine.

This particular project may have withered on the vine, but John Denver didn’t. And the towheaded troubadour had a special connection to Washington.

The former Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. (it was probably a good idea to change his name) had grown up all over the country as an Air Force brat. When he was 13, his parents bought him a guitar. It served as a good ice breaker when he moved to a new school.

In 1965, Denver dropped out of college — Texas Tech, where he was studying architecture — to join the Chad Mitchell Trio, a folk group that upon Denver’s arrival had to change its name to the Mitchell Trio. (Denver had replaced founding member Chad Mitchell.)

The trio eventually disbanded, but Denver had established himself as a standout presence, writing “Leaving On a Jet Plane” — a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary — and coming under the wing of producer Milt Okun.

Okun had worked with the Chad Mitchell Trio. He produced Denver’s solo debut, “Rhymes & Reasons,” released in August 1969. A year earlier, Denver had recorded three numbers for a compilation of traditional folk songs organized by Okun. The name of that three-record set was “Something to Sing About.”

“Something to Sing About” was also the name of a prospective show centered around the Cellar Door, a famed and much-loved music venue at 34th and M streets NW. And it was the name of the song Denver performed at the opening of the show’s pilot.

Answer Man knows this because he’s seen a videotape of that pilot. It’s in the collection of Universal Media Inc., an amazing archive of music material. The company — run out of Alexandria, Va., by Eric Kulberg — does research rights and permission and clearances for documentaries and museum exhibitions.

The pilot begins with a graphic that reads “Recorded live at the Cellar Door, Washington, D.C.” That’s partially true. An in-house information card before that notes the show was produced by Logos Teleproductions. Logos was at 3620 S. 27th St. in Arlington, where WETA would later find a home.

Kulberg and former Washington Post pop music critic Richard Harrington viewed the pilot and had a few observations. They felt the performance of Peter, Paul and Mary probably was shot at the Cellar Door, though a blue curtain had been put up along the back wall, possibly to make the performers more visible.

The introductory scenes with Denver, however, appear as if they were edited in after being shot elsewhere, most likely at the Logos studio on a faux Cellar Door set.

“Something to Sing About” was produced by Dick Cerri and directed by David Silvian. Silvian had worked in public television, including a stint with “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.” Cerri was a D.C. disc jockey who presented a show called “Music Americana.”

“I have the tape only because Dick Cerri produced it,” Kulberg said. “His brother Bill Cerri was my housemate.”

The idea was that a different collection of folk acts would appear each week, taped when they were in town playing the Cellar Door and introduced by Denver.

“Something to Sing About” was shot about the time that Denver got a new manager: Jerry Weintraub.

Kulberg suspects Weintraub had a different plan: To book Denver on network TV shows rather than have him front his own syndicated show.

“I think he was right,” Kulberg said. “I would have loved for Dick to have done it, but Weintraub was correct in that assessment. That’s why you have a good manager.”

About a year after taping the moribund pilot, Denver was staying with Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert of the D.C. duo Fat City while playing the Cellar Door. One night they played him an unfinished song inspired by a drive on Clopper Road in Montgomery County, Md.

The trio stayed up late to complete Denver’s first hit: “Take Me Home, Country Roads.”

Becoming a parent opens up your social media feed to a whole range of content and creators about which you might not have otherwise given two figs, and it was via this intravenous internet drip I learned this week that Paris Hilton’s son was a full month old before she ever changed his diaper.

For those of you who don’t regularly have to perform diaper math: Newborns go through 10 or 12 every day of their early lives, meaning this was not a case of Paris missing out on 30 or 60 close encounters of the turd kind, but rather north of 300 changes before Paris finally took the baby from the nanny and did the job herself.

“You’ve never done it?” sister Nicky asks her in a recent episode of “Paris in Love,” the Peacock show that captured the inaugural diapering. Nope, Paris replies. She says she wasn’t even planning to do it that day either: It was her birthday. But before long, baby Phoenix is placed is on the changing table while Nicky instructs Paris to “Be gentle!” and Paris asks, “Is this the front or the back?”

While there’s a lot to unpack here, as I watched the clip circulating online, what I kept thinking about were the other mothering-related reels that regularly end up on my feed, namely, the brigade of Crunchy Tradwives. What is Crunchy Tradwife content? If you are on Instagram or TikTok, and the algorithms have marked you in a certain way, then you probably already know.

Picture an ethereal pregnant woman in a flowing dress, toddler on her hip, fresh bread on the cooling rack, smiling at the bounty she has created in her modern farmhouse kitchen. Is this scene in an ad for Fleischmann’s Yeast? Nope, here come the hashtags: #happyhousewife, #romantichomemaking, #traditionalgenderroles. And if there’s a voice-over, it usually talks about how evil feminism might try and convince you that fulfillment comes via independence and equality, but really fulfillment comes from babies and bread.

Crunchy Tradwife — “crunchy” as in a barefooted back-to-basics aesthetic, “trad” as in traditional — sits right at the center of a Venn diagram of the organic-hippie idyll and gender-anxious cultural nostalgia. It’s a counterintuitive merging of political signifiers. Unpasteurized milk, untrusted government. Crunchy Tradwives aren’t selling a product so much as an idea, that women are designed to be caretakers, happily up to their elbows in homemade maple butter and paraben-free rash cream. This being America, there is also a racial aspect to this lifestyle, and it’s not a coincidence that most of the biggest influencers are White.

These reels started showing up in my feeds during my pregnancy a few years ago, right around the time I started Googling “best natural fiber crib sheets.” Later, I spent more than a few midnight feedings scrolling my phone and trying to figure out if these women were crazy or if I was. I wholly support stay-at-home mothering as a valid choice, but the Crunchy Tradwife content suggests something more: Stay-at-home mothering is such a natural, easy, freeing choice that everyone can and should do it.

A few months ago The Cut published an analysis with the headline, “Is Tradwife Content Dangerous or Just Stupid?” The author came away thinking the answer was a little bit of both, but that above all else the content was a performance. “Playing pretend like you’re in Little House on the Prairie can be fun,” Kathryn Jezer-Morton wrote. “But ultimately, you put on your puffer coat and head out to Target for your tampons and Nespresso pods like everyone else.”

So back to Paris Hilton. When I first saw the diaper clip make the rounds online, I assumed that’s what we were dealing with: a performance. Not a Crunchy Tradwife performance, but a performance nonetheless. Here was a woman who became famous for playing the part of an insipid heiress taking low-wage jobs with Nicole Richie and, in the name of reality television, making messes of the menial tasks that other Americans perform out of necessity. Surely this diaper thing was an elaboration on her old shtick. The pampered princess who couldn’t even figure out Pampers. Good for an eyeroll and maybe some scolding comments.

But “Paris in Love” is not meant to be a sequel to “The Simple Life,” a fish-out-of-water story about an out-of-touch socialite. The show narrates her personal and family life, and it’s meant to show Paris in her element: as a wife, a business executive (she runs a skin-care line and has written a memoir), a budding political advocate and mother.

When I watched the entire episode, not just the derided clip, what became clear is that Paris does seem very sure of how to be in love with her baby. She seems, however, much less confident in how to care for him. The nanny says it’s time for Phoenix to be burped, and Paris replies that she’s been afraid to do it herself because she worried she might hurt him. When she wants to take the baby somewhere, she looks to the nanny for guidance to make sure that she’s not disrupting his sleeping or eating schedule. More than once, she sits on the floor, blissfully smelling her baby’s newborn head until an assistant tell her, no really, we’re already late for your next appointment.

There were times, while watching “Paris in Love,” when I wondered whether she had taken up a baby the way she might have once taken up a small dog. A cute accessory to be trotted out when it amused her and staffed out when it pooped. A friend suggested that I write a column about how out of touch Paris is, which is not an incorrect take.

But with visions of Crunchy Tradwives dancing in my head, her story started to feel more complicated. Ultimately, what the show dares to show is that motherhood doesn’t come naturally to Paris. Adoring her baby, yes. That part was a cakewalk. But walking out of the hospital with a 7-pound human who now relies on her to stay alive 24 hours a day? That was a whole different thing.

There was something poignant in the fact that Paris waited until her sister Nicky visited from across the country to attempt her first diaper change. Maybe she needed the moral support of an experienced mom and a nonjudgmental sister before she attempted the task that daunted her. Maybe her hesitance had come not only from disdain but from fear. Maybe she had been doing something that a lot of anxious new parents might do if they had Hilton money: building a bulwark against the terrible notion that she might not be built for this.

And that part was actually relatable. It felt like my own early parenting experiences, after the house had emptied of the supportive grandmas and aunties who had come to visit for the immediate postpartum days, and I looked down at the minuscule being I was now in charge of. My first thought wasn’t, “This feels natural and abundant.” My first thought was, “Oh crap.”

146,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Needy D.C. families expected a SNAP boost. But the city isn’t delivering.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/09/snap-dc-benefits-food-assistance-funds/,"Listen 8 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Food security advocates and D.C. Council members celebrated when the District finished the 2023 fiscal year with more revenue in its pocket than expected: That extra money was supposed to be used to boost food assistance benefits by nearly $40 million in the new year. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight But now the administration of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) says it’s not moving forward with the enhanced aid, deflating the advocates and council members who fought for the boost after witnessing the soaring need for food assistance following the expiration of pandemic-era federal relief.

Council members were outraged during a breakfast meeting Tuesday and throughout the week, accusing the Bowser administration of choosing to ignore the council’s budget directive to use the money to temporarily boost the District’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Roughly 140,000 District residents rely on the program to feed their families, for whom advocates say even a small increase in benefits can make a significant difference.

But Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for health and human services, said the choice not to increase the benefits is one borne of financial necessity, as many of the District’s social services programs are overburdened, over budget and more in need of the cash.

“The budget for the Department of Human Services, to put it mildly, is underwater at this point,” he said in a Friday interview.

The situation sets up another clash between the D.C. Council and the Bowser administration over how to fund critical social services programs, disagreements that have become a pattern over the past year or two and have increasingly angered council members. But it also underscores an inescapable reality in the District: Crushing demand for social services is repeatedly outpacing the city’s budget, forcing difficult decisions about which programs to prioritize even as council members criticize the administration for poor budget planning.

Council member Christina Henderson (I-At Large), who led the Give SNAP a Raise legislation, said she understood that reality — but in this case, she said, the money is available, the council specifically allocated the money for SNAP, and that’s how it should be used.

“They’re trying to bank money. And I recognize — I’m not naive — I recognize the challenges the city is facing,” Henderson said, also noting the $750 million shortfall the region’s public transportation system is confronting. “That means we also have to take care of our people. Food access should always be at the top of our list. Feeding people and making sure folks can stay housed should always be at the top of our list.”

Henderson’s legislation, which would give eligible families or seniors a 10 percent increase in their benefits, sprouted from the economic strain caused by the pandemic and soaring inflation that hit grocery store shelves. In 2019, about 94,000 District residents relied on SNAP, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. By 2020, that number climbed to roughly 135,000 residents, an increase of 44 percent, and has only grown since.

Advertisement

Enhanced, pandemic-era federal aid expired in March, leaving tens of thousands of District residents with far less money to spend on food even though, for many, their economic situations had not improved. Henderson hoped Give SNAP a Raise could fill some of that gap.

During a tough budget season this spring, council member Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4) included a provision that would allow Henderson’s legislation to move forward on a contingency basis. The provision would trigger nearly $40 million in additional SNAP benefits for nine months from January to September 2024 — but only if there was excess revenue at the end of fiscal 2023, which there was.

That’s why food security advocates were perplexed to learn that, despite the $178.8 million in excess revenue that the chief financial officer announced Sept. 30, the Bowser administration was not preparing to roll out enhanced SNAP benefits.

“Our SNAP participants have experienced a lot of harm through the ending of the SNAP emergency allotment and just overall food access and food insecurity, the rising food costs,” said LaMonika Jones, director of D.C. Hunger Solutions, which pushed hard for the boosted benefits. “So to hear this news that the mayor has stated that there is not an intent to fund or disburse those funds for Give SNAP a Raise is very disappointing.”

Turnage said that he believed the goal to expand SNAP was “laudable.” But he said that goal is colliding with the reality that DHS’s spending is already outpacing its budget, with a $22.5 million shortfall just two months into the fiscal year that Turnage expects will only grow.

“When you have a picture of a department frankly underwater with respect to its budget, with significant spending pressures they have to resolve, some of which could impact essential services we simply cannot stop,” Turnage said, “it would be financially reckless to take on another $39 million budget cost until we have resolved some of those issues.”

A spokesman for Lewis George objected Saturday morning, noting it is not a new cost but simply a way to use unanticipated funds, and the administration should find other ways to resolve the budgeting problems.

Turnage said the agency is stretched thin and can’t contemplate expanding a program at the moment. He said staff are deluged in processing Medicaid recertification paperwork for thousands, along with backloads of existing SNAP applications. D.C. has the worst processing rate nationwide.

But Henderson said hearing about staffing issues now frustrated her because she had worked closely with DHS in developing the legislation to try to ensure it would minimize administrative costs. She added that other spending pressures, such as a cost of living rate hike associated with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), could have been anticipated and should not be a surprise.

Turnage said he would have to review how officials budgeted for TANF — but said that more often, the spending pressure is due to ballooning demand in key programs beyond what they were intended to handle. For example, formerly homeless families are staying in the Family Re-housing Stabilization Program far longer than the program was designed for because many are not able to be stably housed without aid after the one-year program ends, driving up the cost of the program by tens of millions of dollars, Turnage said.

The council in July passed emergency legislation that allowed for extensions in the housing program under certain guardrails — but one guardrail was that DHS could offer extensions to families only if funding was available. In a letter to colleagues, Henderson noted that if DHS were following this provision of the law, the legislation should not be causing severe spending pressures.

Turnage argued that’s easier said than done, noting that not offering families extensions for their housing would risk making them homeless.

“The question is, how would people respond both inside and outside of government to seeing hundreds of people evicted because we have not been able to move them from FRSP to a more stable housing situation?” he said.

That conundrum with the Family Re-housing and Stabilization Program, also known as rapid rehousing, has been one of the most significant areas of disagreement with the council over the past year.

Most recently, Bowser wanted $20.6 million that the council allocated for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) to instead go toward rapid rehousing, after the administration had to dip into contingency funds to house hundreds of families. The council, however, rejected that request last month, arguing that addressing the soaring demand for ERAP took priority. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), one of the biggest critics of rapid rehousing, argued that it was more productive to spend the money on helping people pay rent to avoid homelessness versus paying millions housing them after they become homeless.

Advertisement

Council member Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) compared Bowser’s desire to use ERAP funds for rapid rehousing to the latest battle over the allocated SNAP funds.

“Mayor Bowser is trying to reduce funding for food assistance and for rental assistance. But it’s not because of an unexpected financial emergency. It’s because of irresponsible budgeting,” White charged on X, formerly Twitter.

DHS can’t move around millions of dollars without council approval. Turnage said the administration plans to submit a request to redirect the nearly $40 million in SNAP funds, but that officials have not settled yet on how they will ask for the money to be spent.

Henderson said she feared that by the time the disagreement is settled, months will have passed, and the opportunity may be lost due to the temporary nature of the benefits boost."
147,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,No clear vision of victory clouds in U.S. debate on Ukraine,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/10/no-clear-vision-of-victory-clouds-in-us-debate-on-/,"ANALYSIS: President Biden has framed it as an existential fight, one that requires sustained U.S. funding for Ukraine in order to keep Russian President Vladimir Putin from overrunning Eastern Europe with a 21st century blitzkrieg.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said that the U.S. wants to see a Russian military weakened to the point it’s no longer a threat to its neighbors. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last year that the administration wants to put Kyiv in the strongest possible negotiating position when the two sides inevitably come to the negotiating table.

Numerous administration officials have voiced some variation of an even more vague — and potentially quite expensive — position.

“We will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,” Mr. Austin said late last month.

So far, the administration’s clearest definition of an endgame for the Ukraine-Russia war is a world in which Kyiv has pushed Mr. Putin’s invading army forces out of its territory and reclaimed all its sovereign, internationally recognized ground.

But even that goal is murky at best: Will the U.S. insist that Russian troops vacate Crimea, which they’ve held since 2014? Is a Ukrainian military operation to retake the peninsula even feasible? Or is the idea of a liberated Crimea merely the opening Ukrainian position in eventual peace talks with the Kremlin?

Nearly two years into the war, none of those questions have truly been answered, and the lack of clarity has left the future of U.S. military aid to Ukraine very much in doubt. Republicans in the House are demanding that the president articulate a clear path to victory for Ukraine before they sign off on the administration’s stalled $61.4 billion funding request. Republicans in both the House and Senate also want more money for U.S.-Mexico border security as part of any Ukraine funding package.

From Mr. Biden on down, the administration is sounding the alarm and casting the Republican position as a literal danger to mankind. The president painted an almost apocalyptic future of a world without more American taxpayer money for Ukraine, one in which it will be American GIs, not Ukrainian soldiers, doing the fighting and dying to defend U.S. and Western interests in Europe.

“If Putin takes Ukraine, he won’t stop there. It’s important to see the long run here. He’s going to keep going. He’s made that pretty clear,” the president said during a speech at the White House. “If Putin attacks a NATO ally — if he keeps going and then he attacks a NATO ally — well, don’t have today: American troops fighting Russian troops, American troops fighting Russian troops if he moves into other parts of NATO.”

Republicans, meanwhile, argue that it’s both fiscally responsible and morally just to insist that the U.S. sketch out a path to peace before committing tens of billions more dollars to a conflict that could drag on for years — especially given Moscow’s historic willingness to throw countless bodies into battle rather than admit defeat.

They also contend that the administration should provide a detailed accounting of how the $111 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine so far has been spent.

“I reiterate that President Biden must satisfy congressional oversight inquiries about the administration’s failure thus far to present clearly defined objectives. … American taxpayers deserve a full accounting of how prior U.S. military and humanitarian aid has been spent, and an explanation of the president’s strategy to ensure an accelerated path to victory,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, Louisiana Republican, wrote in a recent letter to the White House. “In light of the current state of the U.S. economy and the massive amount of our national debt, it is our duty in Congress to demand answers to these reasonable questions, and we still await the answers.”

The president’s funding package, which also included $14 billion for Israel in addition to $61.4 billion for Ukraine, was blocked in the Senate last week and negotiations on a way forward continue. The prospects of any more American aid to Ukraine are now in question, with the administration warning it will run out of money by the end of the year.

Defining victory

If “victory” is a return to the post-Soviet Union, 1991 borders of Ukraine, some analysts warn that’s little more than a pipe dream.

Restoring those borders would involve pushing Russian forces out of Crimea and areas of Ukraine’s Donbas region, which Russia and its proxies have effectively controlled for years.

The Russian side has also spent the past 22 months fortifying deep defensive trenches in those areas. Ukraine’s widely hyped counteroffensive last fall failed to make much of a dent in those positions and fueled a new round of questions about whether either side could ever score a decisive win.

“There is literally, physically, no path to that objective,” said retired Army Lt. Col. Daniel Davis, now a senior fellow at the think tank Defense Priorities, which advocates for a more restrained U.S. military role abroad.

There’s little argument that U.S. aid thus far has helped Ukraine protect Kyiv and other vital cities from the Russian invasion. Aside from the occasional drone strikes, life has returned to something resembling normalcy in much of the western parts of the country.

Ukraine also has inflicted huge damage on the Russian military, with an estimated 50,000 Russian troops killed since the war began and another 20,000 mercenary fighters also killed. Russia has lost more than 11,000 pieces of military equipment during the fight, according to an analysis earlier this year by the military blog Oryx.

Those massive losses would seem to fulfill one policy aim put forth by the administration so far. In April 2022, with the war less than two months old, Mr. Austin said that weakening Russia is an explicit U.S. goal.

“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory. We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” he said at the time.

But such a strategy may be reaching the point of diminishing returns. Russia seems to be able to replenish its stockpiles, including with foreign-made military equipment such as Iranian drones and foreign-made artillery shells. Mr. Putin has ordered several call-ups of reservists to replace those killed or wounded in action.

And despite the huge losses and embarrassing battlefield setbacks Russia has suffered, British intelligence officials warned earlier this month that Russian forces are making “creeping advances” through the Donetsk province in eastern Ukraine — an area formerly seen as ripe ground for Ukraine’s counteroffensive.

Perhaps counterintuitively, sticking with Ukraine for “as long as it takes” could actually shift the balance of power even more firmly in Russia’s favor, Col. Davis argued.

“The longer this war goes, the stronger Russia gets, conventionally,” he said. “They’re so big they could absorb those [heavy casualties]. … And they’re getting combat experience at every level.”

Political battles

Other specialists say that it is little surprise Republicans are demanding a clearer path to victory before signing off on more U.S. aid. The administration, they argue, has done a poor job of articulating exactly what America’s goals are in Ukraine, how they can be achieved, and the time frame for doing so.

“The administration’s larger failure is that it continues to refrain from telling Congress, the American people and quite possibly Ukraine and our NATO allies what its objectives for Ukraine are,” Stephen Blank, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, wrote in a recent article for The Hill.

“Beyond public and congressional ignorance of the administration’s policy, the lack of clarity has rendered the mission vulnerable to Republican charges that there is little rationale for authorizing new funding to Ukraine. We now have an impasse that can only further undermine Ukrainian capabilities, if not morale, while the Biden administration’s hands are tied for several weeks or months,” he wrote. “This is a clear policy failure and a failure towards our partners and allies. This delays and undermines the transfer of funds and weapons essential for Ukraine to survive, let alone win.”

The massive distraction brought on by the Israel-Hamas war, and the need to focus attention and resources on Israel’s fight, has only weakened the urgency of the Ukraine campaign.

Other specialists, however, say that the amounts of money in question pale in comparison to what the U.S. has spent in past conflicts that ended up accomplishing little in the way of long-term policy objectives.

“The United States spent trillions of dollars on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with very little to show by way of positive developments in either campaign,” Michael John Williams, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a recent analysis. “In stark contrast, Kyiv has judiciously utilized U.S. and international assistance to significantly weaken what the U.S. Department of Defense calls a ‘near-peer competitor.’”

“While fiscal responsibility is commendable, the failure to provide Kyiv with an additional $61.4 billion to uphold the liberal world order and significantly degrade the Russian military is a short-sighted decision with far-reaching consequences for national security,” he wrote.

148,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Israel presses on with Gaza offensive after U.S. veto derails Security Council efforts to halt war,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/israel-presses-on-with-its-gaza-offen-writethru-13/,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel‘s military pushed ahead with its punishing air and ground offensive in Gaza on Saturday, bolstered by a U.S. veto derailing U.N. Security Council efforts to end the war and word that an emergency sale of $106 million worth of tank ammunition had been approved by Washington.

Unable to leave Gaza, a territory 25 miles long by about 7 miles wide, more than 2 million Palestinians faced more bombardment Saturday, even in areas that Israel had described as safe zones.

The sale of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition was announced a day after the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, a measure that had wide international support. The U.S. said Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined that “an emergency exists” in the national interest requiring the immediate sale, meaning it bypasses congressional review. Such a determination is rare.

A day after Israel confirmed it was rounding up Palestinian men for interrogation, some men told The Associated Press they had been treated badly, providing the first accounts of the conditions from the detentions.

Ahmad Nimr Salman showed his marked and swollen hands from zip ties. “They used to ask us, ‘Are you with Hamas?’ We say ‘no,’ then they would slap us or kick us,” he said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment when asked about the alleged abuse.

With the war in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,700, the majority women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

PHOTOS: Israel presses on with its Gaza offensive after US veto derails Security Council efforts to halt war

Two hospitals in central and southern Gaza received the bodies of 133 people from Israeli bombings over the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry said midday Saturday.

Israel holds the Hamas militants responsible for civilian casualties, accusing them of using civilians as human shields, and says it has made considerable efforts with evacuation orders to get civilians out of harm’s way. It says 97 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages.

Hamas said Saturday that it continued its rocket fire into Israel.

In Gaza, residents reported airstrikes and shelling, including in the southern city of Rafah near the Egyptian border - one area where the Israeli army had told civilians to go. In a colorful classroom there, knee-high children’s tables were strewn with rubble.

“We now live in the Gaza Strip and are governed by the American law of the jungle. America has killed human rights,” said Rafah resident Abu Yasser al-Khatib.

In northern Gaza, Israel has been trying to secure the military’s hold, despite heavy resistance from Hamas. The military said that it found weapons inside a school in Shujaiyah, a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza City, and that, in a separate incident, militants shot at troops from a U.N.-run school in the northern town of Beit Hanoun.

More than 2,500 Palestinians have been killed since the Dec. 1 collapse of a weeklong truce, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

The truce saw hostages and Palestinian prisoners released, but Israel says 137 hostages remain in Gaza.

On Saturday, a kibbutz that came under attack on Oct. 7 said 25-year-old hostage Sahar Baruch had died in captivity. His captors said Baruch was killed during a failed rescue mission by Israeli forces Friday. The Israeli military said Hamas killed him.

With no new cease-fire in sight and humanitarian aid reaching little of Gaza, residents reported severe food shortages. Nine of 10 people in northern Gaza reported spending at least one full day and night without food, according to a World Food Program assessment during the truce. Two of three people in the south said the same. The WFP called the situation “alarming.”

“I am very hungry,” said Mustafa al-Najjar, sheltering in a U.N.-run school in the devastated Jabaliya refugee camp in the north. “We are living on canned food and biscuits and this is not sufficient.”

While adults can cope, “it’s extremely difficult and painful when you see your young son or daughter crying because they are hungry,” he said.

Israelis who had been taken hostage also saw the food situation deteriorate, the recently freed Adina Moshe told a rally of thousands of people in Tel Aviv seeking the rapid return of all. “We ended up eating only rice,” said Moshe, who was held for 49 days.

The rally speakers accused Israel‘s government of not doing enough to bring loved ones home. “How can I sleep at night? How can I protect my daughter?” asked Eli Albag, the father of 18-year-old hostage Liri Albag.

On Saturday, 100 trucks carrying unspecified aid entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, said Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority. That is still well below the daily average before the war.

Despite growing international pressure, President Joe Biden’s administration remains opposed to an open-ended cease-fire, arguing it would enable Hamas to continue posing a threat to Israel.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has argued that “a cease-fire is handing a prize to Hamas.”

Blinken continued to speak with counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and elsewhere amid open criticism of the U.S. stance.

“From now on, humanity won’t think the U.S.A. supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech.

Protesters at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai called for a cease-fire, despite restrictions on demonstrations.

Amid concerns about a wider conflict, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen threatened to prevent any ship heading to Israeli ports from passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea until food and medicine can enter Gaza freely. Spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said in a speech that all ships heading to Israel, no matter their nationality, will be a target.

In southern Gaza, thousands were on the run after what residents called a night of heavy gunfire and shelling.

Israel has designated a narrow patch of barren southern coastline, Muwasi, as a safe zone. But Palestinians described desperately overcrowded conditions with scant shelter and no toilets. They faced an overnight temperature of around 52 degrees (11 degrees Celsius).

“I am sleeping on the sand. It’s freezing,” said Soad Qarmoot, who described herself as a cancer patient forced to leave her home in the northern town of Beit Lahiya.

As she spoke, her children huddled around a fire."
149,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"CAIR condemns Biden for bypassing Congress to send tank shells to Israel, ‘affront to democracy’",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/cair-condemns-biden-bypassing-congress-calls-move-/,"An American-Muslim advocacy group condemned President Biden’s move to bypass Congress to sell thousands of tank shells to Israel, saying the administration’s decision was “an affront to democracy and an act of moral insanity.”

Edward Ahmed Mitchell, national deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, decried the Biden administration’s decision, claiming that the move would embolden Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “kill more Palestinian civilians.”

“Rushing deadly weapons to the far-right and openly genocidal Israeli government without congressional review robs American voters of their voice in Congress, emboldens Netanyahu to kill more Palestinian civilians and further stains our nation’s standing in the world,” Mr. Mitchell said.

He continued, “The timing is also remarkable, as media outlets just confirmed that Israeli tanks deliberately targeted and slaughtered journalists in Lebanon. The Biden administration’s decision is an affront to democracy and an act of moral insanity.”

The organization’s condemnation of the sale comes as the White House ripped comments from the CAIR’s National Executive Director Nihad Awad that seemingly approved of the terrorist organization Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

The Biden administration used emergency authority from the Arms Export Control Act to approve the sale of over 14,000 tank shells to be delivered immediately to Israel — a sale worth about $106 million.

The State Department said that it had notified Congress of the move Friday after Secretary of State Antony Blinken deemed “an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale” of the munitions.

“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” the department said. “Israel will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense.”

The sale comes as Congress has struggled to find middle ground on a $106 billion emergency package proposed by Mr. Biden that includes $14.3 billion for Israel.

Republicans in the House and Senate have argued that the package, which includes funding for Biden administration goals at the U.S.-Mexico border, needs to have border security policy attached to pass either chamber.

House lawmakers previously passed a $14.3 billion standalone Israel aid bill, but it is all but dead as the Senate continues negotiations on the complete package.

It also follows the failure of a United Nations Security Council cease-fire resolution to put a stop to fighting in the Israel-Hamas war over humanitarian concerns. The U.S. vetoed the resolution, marking itself as the lone vote against the U.N.’s cease-fire push.

150,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Human Rights Watch hits U.S. with war-crime alert after cease-fire veto,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/human-rights-watch-warns-us-risks-complicity-war-c/,"The nonprofit organization Human Rights Watch on Friday contended the U.S. could be “complicity with war crimes” as it continues to provide weapons and support for Israel as civilian deaths rise in the Gaza Strip.

The organization’s message comes after the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The resolution failed on a 13 to 1 vote, with the United Kingdom abstaining from voting.

Louis Charbonneau, Human Rights Watch’s U.N. director, said America used its veto to prevent the world body from making some of the “calls the U.S. itself has been demanding” for both sides in the war to comply with international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and the release of all hostages.

“By continuing to provide Israel with weapons and diplomatic cover as it commits atrocities, including collectively punishing the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza, the U.S. risks complicity in war crimes,” Mr. Charbonneau wrote on X.

Over 17,000 Palestinians, including 7,000 children, have been killed in Gaza since the war started after Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid on Israel, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis during its terrorist attack.

Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood criticized the Security Council’s resolution for failing to condemn the Hamas rampage on Oct. 7. He also said the measure didn’t recognize that Israel has the right to defend itself.

“Although the United States strongly supports a durable peace, in which both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security, we do not support this resolution’s call for an unsustainable cease-fire that will only plant the seeds for the next war,” Mr. Woods said.

Fighting in the region paused in November during a cease-fire that let Israel trade Palestinian prisoners with Hamas for hostages.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for the vote, decried the veto that sank the resolution, saying the situation in the Gaza Strip is a “spiraling humanitarian nightmare.”

“The people of Gaza are being told to move like human pinballs — ricocheting between ever-smaller slivers of the south, without any of the basics for survival,” Mr. Guterres said. “But nowhere in Gaza is safe.”

151,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,The State Department approves the sale of tank ammunition to Israel in a deal that bypasses Congress,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/state-department-bypasses-congress-approves-sale-o/,"Going around Congress, the Biden administration said Saturday it has approved the emergency sale to Israel of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106 million as Israel intensifies its military operations in the southern Gaza Strip.

The move comes as President Joe Biden’s request for a nearly $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security is languishing in Congress, caught up in a debate over U.S. immigration policy and border security. Some Democratic lawmakers have spoken of making the proposed $14.3 billion in American assistance to its Mideast ally contingent on concrete steps by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza during the war with Hamas.

The State Department said it had notified Congress of the sale late Friday after Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined “an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale” of the munitions in the U.S. national security interest.

That means the purchase will bypass the congressional review requirement for foreign military sales. Such determinations are rare, but not unprecedented, when administrations see an urgent need for weapons to be delivered without waiting for lawmakers’ approval.

“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” the department said in a statement. “Israel will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense.”

The sale is worth $106.5 million and includes 13,981 120 mm High Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose with Tracer tank cartridges as well as U.S. support, engineering and logistics. The materiel will come from Army inventory.

Bypassing Congress with emergency determinations for arms sales is an unusual step that has in the past met resistance from lawmakers, who normally have a period of time to weigh on proposed weapons transfers and, in some cases, block them.

In May, 2019, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an emergency determination for an $8.1 billion sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after it became clear that the Trump administration would have trouble overcoming lawmakers’ concerns about the Saudi- UAE-led war in Yemen.

Pompeo came under heavy criticism for the move, which some believed may have violated the law because many of the weapons involved had yet to be built and could not be delivered urgently. But he was cleared of any wrongdoing after an internal investigation.

At least four administrations have used the authority since 1979. President George H.W. Bush’s administration used it during the Gulf War to get arms quickly to Saudi Arabia."
152,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Israel presses ahead with bombarding Gaza, including areas it told Palestinians to evacuate to",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/israel-presses-ahead-with-bombarding-g-writethru-8/,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli warplanes struck parts of the Gaza Strip in relentless bombardment Saturday, hitting some of the dwindling bits of land it had told Palestinians to evacuate to in the territory’s south.

The strikes came a day after the United States vetoed a United Nations resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza, despite its wide support. The vote in the 15-member Security Council was 13-1, with the United Kingdom abstaining.

“Attacks from air, land and sea are intense, continuous and widespread,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the council before the vote. Gaza residents “are being told to move like human pinballs – ricocheting between ever-smaller slivers of the south, without any of the basics for survival.”

Gaza was at a “breaking point” with the humanitarian support system at risk of collapse, and Guterres said he feared “the consequences could be devastating for the security of the entire region.”

Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt are effectively sealed, leaving 2.3 million Palestinians with no option other than to seek refuge within the territory 25 miles (40 kilometers) long by some 7 miles (11 kilometers) wide.

With the war now in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,400, the majority women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory, whose counts do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.

Two hospitals in central and southern Gaza received the bodies of a total of 133 people from Israeli bombings over the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry said midday Saturday.

Israel holds the Hamas militants responsible for civilian casualties, accusing them of using civilians as human shields, and says it has made considerable efforts with evacuation orders to get civilians out of harm’s way. It says 93 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 raid in Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostage.

Hamas said Saturday it continued its rocket fire into Israel.

In Gaza, residents reported airstrikes and shelling in the north and south, including the city of Rafah near the Egyptian border - one area where the Israeli army had ordered civilians to evacuate to. In a colorful classroom there, knee-high children’s tables were strewn with rubble.

“We now live in the Gaza Strip and are governed by the American law of the jungle. America has killed human rights,” said Rafah resident Abu Yasser al-Khatib. “The Palestinian people will not leave and do not want to leave.”

Israel has been trying to secure the military’s hold on northern Gaza despite heavy resistance from Hamas. Tens of thousands of residents are believed to remain despite evacuation orders, six weeks after troops and tanks rolled in.

The Israeli military said Saturday its forces fought and killed Hamas militants and found weapons inside a school in Shijaia in a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza City. It said soldiers discovered a tunnel shaft in the same neighborhood where they found an elevator, and in a separate incident, militants shot at troops from an U.N.-run school in the northern town of Beit Hanoun.

More than 2,200 Palestinians have been killed since the Dec. 1 collapse of a weeklong truce, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

The truce saw hostages and Palestinian prisoners released, but more than 130 hostages are believed to remain in Gaza.

On Saturday, a kibbutz that came under attack on Oct. 7 said 25-year-old hostage Sahar Baruch had died in captivity. His captors said Baruch was killed during a failed rescue mission by Israeli forces Friday. The Israeli military only confirmed that two soldiers were seriously wounded in an attempted hostage rescue and that no hostages were freed.

With no further cease-fire in sight and a trickle of humanitarian aid reaching just a few parts of Gaza, residents reported severe food shortages.

“I am very hungry,” said Mustafa al-Najjar, sheltering in a U.N.-run school in the devastated Jabaliya refugee camp in the north. “We are living on canned food and biscuits and this is not sufficient.”

While adults can cope with hunger, “it’s extremely difficult and painful when you see your young son or daughter crying because there are hungry and you are not able to do anything,” he said.

Despite growing international pressure, the Biden administration remains opposed to an open-ended cease-fire, arguing it would enable Hamas to continue posing a threat to Israel. Officials have expressed misgivings in recent days about the civilian death toll and dire humanitarian crisis but have not pushed publicly for Israel to wind down the war.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has argued that “a cease-fire is handing a prize to Hamas, dismissing the hostages held in Gaza and signalling terror groups everywhere.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued to meet with counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and elsewhere as frustration grew with the U.S. stance. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has said the U.S. veto of the Security Council resolution showed Washington’s isolation.

“From now on, humanity won’t think the U.S.A. supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech on Saturday.

Fidan and the Palestinian, Saudi, Qatari, Nigerian, Indonesian, Egyptian and Jordanian ministers met with Blinken to press for an end to the fighting, and the group was to meet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday.

Despite restrictions on demonstrations, protesters at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai called for a cease-fire.

Israel has expanded its blistering air and ground campaign into southern Gaza, sending tens of thousands fleeing.

“It was a night of heavy gunfire and shelling as every night,” Taha Abdel-Rahman, a resident of Khan Younis, said by phone Saturday.

Airstrikes were reported overnight in the Nuseirat refugee camp, where resident Omar Abu Moghazi said a family home was hit, causing casualties.

Israel has designated a narrow patch of barren coastline in the south, Muwasi, as a safe zone. But Palestinians there described desperately overcrowded conditions with scant shelter and poor hygiene facilities.

“We are living here in a tough cold. There are no bathrooms,” said Soad Qarmoot, who was forced to leave her home in the northern town of Beit Lahiya.

“I am a cancer patient,” Qarmoot said as children huddled around a wood fire. “There is no mattress for me to sleep on. I am sleeping on the sand. It’s freezing.”

Imad al-Talateeny, who fled Gaza City, said Muwasi lacks basic services to accommodate the growing number of displaced families.

“I lack everything to feel a human,” he said."
153,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Turkey’s Erdogan accuses the West of ‘barbarism’ and Islamophobia in the war in Gaza,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/turkeys-erdogan-accuses-west-of-barbarism-and-isla/,"ISTANBUL — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used a speech on human rights Saturday to accuse the West of “barbarism” for its stance on the Israel-Hamas war and what he alleged was its toleration of Islamophobia.

“Israel has carried out atrocities and massacres that will shame the whole of humanity,” Erdogan told a packed hall in Istanbul the day before the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

“All the values relating to humanity are being murdered in Gaza. In the face of such brutality, international institutions and human rights organizations are not taking any concrete steps to prevent such violations,” the Turkish leader said.

The human rights declaration, proclaimed by the U.N. General Assembly in Paris on December 10, 1948, enshrines a standard for human rights and freedoms for all people.

Referring to Friday’s U.S. veto of a United Nations resolution calling for a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza, Erdogan said a fairer world was possible “but not with America because the USA stands with Israel. … From now on, humanity won’t think the USA supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.”

Turkey’s human rights record during Erdogan’s two decades in power has come under frequent criticism over the targeting of government critics and political opponents, the undermining of judicial independence and the weakening of democratic institutions.

Turkey withdrew from the Istanbul Convention on preventing and violence against women and has failed to implement European Court of Human Rights judgments.

On Saturday, the president defined Islamophobia and xenophobia, which he said “engulf Western societies like poison ivy,” as the greatest threats to human rights.

He told the cheering audience that the only value “the West holds on to is its barbarism. We have seen this example of the West’s barbarism in all those unfortunate events that they either supported or perpetrated.”

Erdogan cited the 2019 attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which a gunman killed 51 people, as an Islamophobic attack that was “legitimized” and “even encouraged” by the West.

“According to their understanding, non-Westerners don’t have the right to enjoy those universal human rights … they overlook Islamophobic attacks and they show the twisted perception and mentality of the West,” he said.

In October, Erdogan told a massive protest crowd in Istanbul that his government was preparing to declare Israel a “war criminal” due to its actions in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government said in response that it would reassess its diplomatic relations with Turkey."
154,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,U.S. vetoes U.N. resolution demanding immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/us-vetoes-un-resolution-backed-by-many-writethru-7/,"UNITED NATIONS — The United States vetoed a United Nations resolution Friday backed by almost all other Security Council members and dozens of other nations demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza. Supporters called it a terrible day and warned of more civilian deaths and destruction as the war goes into its third month.

The vote in the 15-member council was 13-1, with the United Kingdom abstaining. The United States’ isolated stand reflected a growing fracture between Washington and some of its closest allies over Israel‘s monthslong bombardment of Gaza. France and Japan were among those supporting the call for a cease-fire.

In a vain effort to press the Biden administration to drop its opposition to calling for a halt to the fighting, the foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey were all in Washington on Friday. But their meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken took place only after the U.N. vote.

Along with the vote, the Arab diplomats’ mission served to shift responsibility more squarely onto the United States for protecting Israel from growing demands to stop the airstrikes that are killing thousands of Palestinian civilians.

“What is the message we are sending Palestinians if we cannot unite behind a call to halt the relentless bombardment of Gaza?” United Arab Emirates deputy ambassador Mohamed Abushaha asked after the vote. “Indeed, what is the message we are sending civilians across the world who may find themselves in similar situations?”

U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood called the resolution “imbalanced” and criticized the council after the vote for its failure to condemn Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel in which the militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, or to acknowledge Israel’s right to defend itself. He declared that halting military action would allow Hamas to continue to rule Gaza and “only plant the seeds for the next war.”

“Hamas has no desire to see a durable peace, to see a two-state solution,” Wood said before the vote. “For that reason, while the United States strongly supports a durable peace, in which both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security, we do not support calls for an immediate cease-fire.”

Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 17,400 people in Gaza - 70% of them women and children - and wounded more than 46,000, according to the Palestinian territory’s Health Ministry, which says many others are trapped under rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

Abushahab, the UAE diplomat, said before the vote that the resolution, which his country sponsored, had garnered nearly 100 co-sponsors in less than 24 hours, a reflection of global support for efforts to end the war and save Palestinian lives.

After the vote, he expressed deep disappointment at the U.S. veto and warned that the Security Council is growing isolated and “appears untethered” from its mandate to ensure international peace and security.

Ambassador Nicolas De Rivière of France, a veto-wielding permanent council member who supported the resolution, lamented its lack of unity and pleaded “for a new, immediate and lasting humanitarian truce that should lead to a sustainable cease-fire.”

Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky called the vote “one of the darkest days in the history of the Middle East” and accused the United States of issuing “a death sentence to thousands, if not tens of thousands more civilians in Palestine and Israel, including women and children.”

He said “history will judge Washington’s actions” in the face of what he called a “merciless Israeli bloodbath.”

The council called the emergency meeting to hear from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who for the first time invoked Article 99 of the U.N. Charter, which enables a U.N. chief to raise threats he sees to international peace and security. He warned of an “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and urged the council to demand a humanitarian cease-fire.

Guterres said he raised Article 99 - which hadn’t been used at the U.N. since 1971 - because “there is a high risk of the total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza.” The U.N. anticipates this would result in “a complete breakdown of public order and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt,” he warned.

Gaza is at “a breaking point,” he said, and desperate people are at serious risk of starvation.

Guterres said Hamas’ brutality against Israelis on Oct. 7 “can never justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”

“While indiscriminate rocket fire by Hamas into Israel, and the use of civilians as human shields, are in contravention of the laws of war, such conduct does not absolve Israel of its own violations,” he stressed.

The U.N. chief detailed the “humanitarian nightmare” Gaza is facing, citing intense, widespread and ongoing Israeli attacks from air, land and sea that reportedly have hit 339 education facilities, 26 hospitals, 56 health care facilities, 88 mosques and three churches.

Over 60% of Gaza’s housing has reportedly been destroyed or damaged, some 85% of the population has been forced from their homes, the health system is collapsing, and “nowhere in Gaza is safe,” Guterres said.

Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the council that Israel’s objective is “the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip” and “the dispossession and forcible displacement of the Palestinian people.”

“If you are against the destruction and displacement of the Palestinian people, you have to be in favor of an immediate cease-fire,” Mansour said. “When you refuse to call for a cease-fire, you are refusing to call for the only thing that can put an end to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.”

After the vote, he called the U.S. veto “disastrous” and said it was “a terrible day for the Security Council.”

“We reject this result, and we’ll continue resorting to every legitimate avenue to stop these abhorrent atrocities,” Mansour said.

But Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant thanked the United States for its “bold leadership.”

“A cease-fire is handing a prize to Hamas, dismissing the hostages held in Gaza, and signaling terror groups everywhere,” he said in a statement. “Stand with Israel in our mission. We are fighting for our future, and we are fighting for the free world.”

In Washington, Jordan’s top diplomat told reporters that the killings of Palestinian civilians in Israel’s bombardment and siege of Gaza were war crimes and threatened to destabilize the region, the U.S. and the world for years to come.

“If people are not seeing it here, we are seeing it,” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said, adding: “We’re seeing the challenges that we are are facing talking to our people. They are all saying we’re doing nothing. Because despite all our efforts, Israel is continuing these massacres.”

Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard criticized the U.S. for continuing to transfer munitions to the Israeli government “that contribute to the decimation of entire families.”

And Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, said that by providing weapons and diplomatic cover to Israel “as it commits atrocities, including collectively punishing the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza, the U.S. risks complicity in war crimes.”"
155,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Ukraine says any Russian presidential voting in its occupied regions would be ‘null and void’,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/ukraine-says-any-russian-presidential-voting-in-it/,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine on Saturday condemned Russia’s intention to organize presidential election voting in occupied Ukrainian territory next year.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said any such balloting held in the occupied regions in the country would be “null and void” and pledged that any international observers sent to monitor the Russian election would “face criminal responsibility.”

“We call on the international community to resolutely condemn Russia’s intention to hold presidential elections in the occupied Ukrainian territories, and to impose sanctions on those involved in their organization and conduct,” Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said.

Lawmakers in Russia on Thursday set the country’s 2024 presidential election for March 17. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his candidacy for reelection. He is all but certain to win another six-year term.

Russian authorities are still pondering whether to arrange the voting in Ukraine‘s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Moscow illegally annexed the four regions in September 2022 but only controls parts of them.

Putin subsequently introduced martial law in those areas, and Russian lawmakers amended regulations to allow elections in territories where martial law was in place. Russian authorities held elections in the annexed regions in September for Moscow-installed legislatures; Ukraine and its Western allies denounced the votes as a sham.

The head of Russia’s Central Election Commission, Ella Pamfilova, said Thursday that together with the Russian military, security forces and the Moscow-appointed governors in Ukraine, election authorities would decide by Dec. 12 on “the possibility of holding” the presidential vote in the Ukrainian regions.

“After weighting in all pros and cons, we will be making this decision. If we decide (to hold the vote), then the next step would be to adopt a plan for holding elections there,” Pamfilova was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. “Of course, it will be somewhat different from the balloting in Russian regions, the law allows for it.”

Russia does plan to hold the presidential election in the Crimean Peninsula, which it illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014."
156,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,U.S. aid for Ukraine by year-end seems increasingly of out reach as GOP ties it to border security,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/us-aid-for-ukraine-by-year-end-seems-increasingly-/,"A deal to provide further U.S. assistance to Ukraine by year-end appears to be increasingly out of reach for President Joe Biden. The impasse is deepening in Congress despite dire warnings from the White House about the consequences of inaction as Republicans insist on pairing the aid with changes to America’s immigration and border policies.

After the Democratic president said this past week he was willing to “make significant compromises on the border,” Republicans quickly revived demands that they had earlier set aside, hardening their positions and attempting to shift the negotiations to the right, according to a person familiar with the talks who was not authorized to publicly discuss them and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The latest proposal, from the lead GOP negotiator, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., came during a meeting with a core group of senators before they left Washington on Thursday afternoon. It could force the White House to consider ideas that many Democrats will seriously oppose, throwing new obstacles in the difficult negotiations.

Biden is facing the prospect of a cornerstone of his foreign policy - repelling Russian President Vladimir Putin from overtaking Ukraine - crumbling as U.S. support for funding the war wanes, especially among Republicans. The White House says a failure to approve more aid by year’s end could have catastrophic consequences for Ukraine and its ability to fight.

To preserve U.S. backing, the Biden administration has quietly engaged in Senate talks on border policy in recent weeks, providing assistance to the small group of senators trying to reach a deal and communicating what policy changes it would find acceptable.

The president is trying to satisfy GOP demands to reduce the historic number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border while alleviating Democrats’ fears that legal immigration will be choked off with drastic measures.

As talks sputtered to a restart this past week, Democrats warned Republicans that time for a deal was running short. Congress is scheduled to depart Washington in mid-December for a holiday break.

“Republicans need to show they are serious about reaching a compromise, not just throwing on the floor basically Donald Trump’s border policies,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday before Republicans made their counteroffer.

But the new Republican proposal dug in on policy changes that had led Democrats to step back from the negotiations, according to the person familiar with the talks. The GOP offer calls for ending the humanitarian parole program that’s now in place for existing classes of migrants - Ukrainians, Afghans, Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans and Haitians. That idea had been all but dashed before.

Additionally, those groups of migrants would not be allowed to be paroled again if the terms of their stay expire before their cases are adjudicated in immigration proceedings.

GOP senators proposed monitoring systems such as ankle bracelets for people, including children, who are detained at the border and are awaiting parole. Republicans want to ban people from applying for asylum if they have transited through a different country where they could have sought asylum instead. GOP lawmakers also want to revive executive powers that would allow a president to shut down entries for wide-ranging reasons.

Further, after migrant encounters at the border recently hit historic numbers, the GOP proposal would set new guidelines requiring the border to be essentially shut down if illegal crossings reach a certain limit.

Lankford declined to discuss specifics after the Thursday meeting, but said he was trying to “negotiate in good faith.” He said the historic number of migrants at the border could not be ignored. The sheer number of people arriving at the border has swamped the asylum system, he said, making it impossible for authorities to adequately screen the people they allow in.

“Do you want large numbers of undocumented individuals and unscreened individuals without work permits, without access to the rest of the economy?” Lankford said.

The lead Democratic negotiator, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, did not quickly respond to the GOP proposal.

Senators had made some progress in the talks before Thursday, finding general agreement on raising the initial standard for migrants to enter the asylum system - part of what’s called the credible fear system. The administration has communicated that it is amenable to that change and that it could agree to expand expedited removal to deport immigrants before they have a hearing with an immigration judge, according to two people briefed on the private negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Immigration advocates and progressives in Congress have been alarmed by the direction of the talks, especially because they have not featured changes aimed at expanding legal immigration.

Robyn Barnard, director of refugee advocacy with Human Rights First, called the current state of negotiations an “absolute crisis moment.” She warned that broadening the fast-track deportation authority could lead to a mass rounding up of immigrants around the country and compared it to the situation during the Trump administration. “Communities across the country would be living in fear,” she said.

But Republican senators, sensing that Biden, who is campaigning for a second term, wants to address the historic number of people coming to the border, have taken an aggressive stance and tried to draw the president directly into negotiations.

“The White House is going to have to engage particularly if Senate Democrats are unwilling to do what we are suggesting be done,” said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., at a news conference Thursday.

The White House has so far declined to take a leading role in negotiations. “Democrats have said that they want to compromise. Have that conversation,” said White House press secretary Karine-Jean Pierre.

After every GOP senator this past week voted not to move ahead with legislation that would provide tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance for Ukraine, many in the chamber were left in a dour mood. Even those who held out hope for a deal acknowledged it would be difficult to push a package through the Senate at this late stage.

Even if senators reach a deal, the obstacles to passage in the House are considerable. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has signaled he will fight for sweeping changes to immigration policy that go beyond what is being discussed in the Senate. Also, broad support from House Democrats is far from guaranteed, as progressives and Hispanic lawmakers have raised alarm at curtailing access to asylum.

“Trading Ukrainian lives for the lives of asylum seekers is morally bankrupt and irresponsible,” Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, as part of a coordinated campaign by Hispanic Democrats.

The unwieldy nature of the issue left even Lankford, who was one of the few senators optimistic that a deal could be reached this year, acknowledging the difficulty of finding an agreement in the coming days.

“There’s just a whole lot of politics that have been bound up in this,” he said as he departed the Capitol for the week. “Thirty years it hasn’t been resolved because it’s incredibly complicated.”"
157,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Sri Lanka experiences a temporary power outage after a main transmission line fails,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/sri-lanka-experiences-temporary-power-outage-after/,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka experienced an island-wide power outage for several hours Saturday after a system failure in one of the main transmission lines, the country’s power and energy ministry said.

The power outage began Saturday evening and continued for several hours.

“Step by step restorations are underway and it may take few hours to completely restore the power supply,” said the ministry in a statement.

Sri Lanka largely depends on hydro power for power generation, while coal and oil are used to cover the balance. During the dry season, the country is compelled to use more thermal power for generation of electricity.

Sri Lanka experienced several hours of daily power cuts last year for several months due to plunging water levels powering hydroelectric dams. The power crisis worsened as Sri Lanka faced difficulty in importing sufficient stocks of oil and coal after the country’s foreign reserves were depleted during an unprecedented economic crisis.

Sri Lanka plunged into am economic crisis in 2022, creating severe shortages and drawing strident protests that led to the ouster of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. It declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt - more than half of it to foreign creditors.

Under new President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a continuous power supply has been restored. But there has been growing public dissatisfaction with the government’s efforts to increase revenue by raising electricity rates and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses.

Sri Lanka has sought the support of the International Monetary Fund to rescue the economy.

The IMF agreed in March to a $2.9 billion bailout package, releasing the first payment shortly thereafter. However, the IMF delayed the second tranche, citing inadequate oversight and debt restructuring.

An IMF review in September said Sri Lanka’s economy was recovering but the country needed to improve its tax administration, eliminate exemptions and crack down on tax evasion.

Sri Lankan government officials have expressed confidence over the last two weeks that the IMF would provide the $334 million installment before the end of the year since the island nation received required financial assurances from its bilateral creditors, including China, Japan and India."
158,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,A Soviet-era statue of a Red Army commander taken down in Kyiv,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/soviet-era-statue-of-red-army-commander-taken-down/,"KYIV — City workers in Kyiv on Saturday dismantled an equestrian statue of a Red Army commander, the latest Soviet monument to be removed in the Ukrainian capital since Russia launched its full-scale invasion last year.

The statue of Mykola Shchors on horseback, erected in the 1950s, was taken down from a pedestal in downtown Kyiv to the applause of a small group of onlookers. City officials said it will be stored in the State Aviation Museum.

“Derussification and decommunization are continuing. We have already dismantled more than 60 monuments related to the history and culture of Russia and the Soviet Union,” Mykhailo Budilov, director of the city’s Department of Territorial Control, said in a statement.

An effort to remove symbols of the Soviet era, which many Ukrainians equate with Russian imperialism, accelerated after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

In August of this year, officials removed a hammer-and-sickle symbol from the Mother Ukraine statue in Kyiv - one of the country’s most recognizable landmarks - and replaced it with Ukraine’s trident coat of arms.

On Saturday, a few dozen people gathered around the Shchors monument as workers cut the statue from the pedestal and removed it with a crane.

“Once I heard this was happening, I put my coat on and ran here to see a historic moment,” said Heorhii Lukianchuk, a Kyiv resident.

Oleksii Prokopets, another Kyiv resident, said he supported taking down Soviet monuments but questioned whether it was worth the resources as Ukraine finds itself struggling to fight off the Russian invasion almost two years into the war.

“I guess it is not the right time to spend a lot of money for taking them down. It could be just wrapped in a black cloth and dealt with after the victory,” Prokopets said.

It’s not yet clear what the monument will be replaced with."
159,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,A hospital fire near Rome kills at least 3 and causes an emergency evacuation of all patients,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/hospital-fire-near-rome-kills-at-least-writethru-2/,"ROME — A fire broke out in a hospital on Rome‘s outskirts, killing at least three people and forcing the overnight evacuation of the smoke-filled facility and its nearly 200 patients, officials said Saturday.

The blaze began in the ground floor emergency room of the St. John the Evangelist hospital in Tivoli at around 11 p.m. Friday, which was a holiday in Italy. The flames spread to a few other wards, “but the smoke went everywhere,” said chief prosecutor Francesco Menditto.

Using fire truck ladders to reach patients on high floors, fire and police rescue crews worked through the night to evacuate the 193 patients. The ones in intensive care were transferred immediately to other hospitals in ambulances, while patients in less critical condition were moved into a nearby municipal gymnasium and then transferred to other facilities, officials said.

The governor of the Lazio region, Francesco Rocca, said from the scene that three people were killed and an investigation would determine the cause of the fire. He acknowledged “notable delays” in updating Italy‘s aging hospitals with sprinkler systems and other fire safety infrastructure.

The fire department initially said four people were killed. Menditto said during a news conference that only three deaths were directly caused by the blaze, while a fourth death was unrelated to the fire.

He said prosecutors do not believe the fire was set intentionally but the working hypothesis guiding the investigation was related to manslaughter charges, without any suspects identified.

Video released by the fire department showed fire crews trying to reach the upper floors of the hospital on ladders to get to patients as smoke billowed out. Both Menditto and Rocca, the governor, praised firefighters and police officers for a “truly exceptional” overnight operation to evacuate the patients, especially those who could not walk on their own, and to get them transferred to other hospitals.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni offered condolences to the families of the victims.

Rome‘s chief firefighter, Cmdr. Adriano De Acutis, said crews were now focused on securing and removing valuable medicines, especially drugs used to treat cancer, since the hospital will be unusable for the foreseeable future.

Tivoli, which is located about 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the center of Rome, is a popular tourist destination. It is best known for the archaeological sites of Villa d’Este and Villa Adriana, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites."
160,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"‘Shadows of children:’ For the youngest hostages, life moves forward in whispers",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/shadows-of-children-for-youngest-hosta-writethru-1/,"HERZLIYA, Israel — After seven weeks held hostage in the tunnels of Gaza, they are finally free to laugh and chat and play. But some of the children who have come back from captivity are still reluctant to raise their voices above a whisper.

In theory, they can eat what they want, sleep as much as they choose and set aside their fears. In practice, some have had to be convinced there’s no longer a need to save a cherished bit of food in case there is none later.

At last, the 86 Israelis released during a short-lived truce between their government and Hamas are home. But the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on roughly 20 towns and villages left many of the children among them without permanent homes to go back to. Some of their parents are dead and others are still held hostage, foreshadowing the difficulty of days ahead.

And so, step by step, these children, the mothers and grandmothers who were held alongside them, and their families are testing the ground for a path to recovery. No one, including the physicians and psychologists who have been treating them, is sure how to get there or how long it might take.

“It’s not easy in any way. I mean, they’re back. They’re free. But you can definitely see what they went through,” said Yuval Haran, whose family is celebrating the reunion with his two nieces, their mother and grandmother, while yearning for the return of the girls’ father, who remains a captive.

“We’re trying to give them love, to give them hugs, to give them control back of their life,” said Haran, visibly exhausted by the stress of the past two months, but every bit as busy now as he rushes to fix bicycles and set up bank accounts for those who have returned. “I think that’s the most important thing, to give them the sense that they can decide now.”

PHOTOS: ‘Shadows of children:’ For the youngest hostages, life moves forward in whispers

It was clear as soon as the youngest were helped from helicopters that captivity had been brutal.

“They looked like shadows of children,” said Dr. Efrat Bron-Harlev of Schneider Children’s Medical Center in suburban Tel Aviv, who helped treat more than two dozen former captives, most of them youngsters.

Some had not been allowed to bathe during the entirety of their captivity. Many had lost up to 15 percent of their total weight, but were reluctant to eat the food they were served.

Asked why, the answer came in whispers: “’Because we have to keep it for later.’”

One 13-year-old girl recounted how she’d spent the entirety of captivity believing that her family had abandoned her, a message reinforced by her kidnappers, Bron-Harlev said.

“They told me that nobody cares for you anymore. Nobody’s looking for you. Nobody wants you back. You can hear the bombs all around. All they want to do is kill you and us together,” the girl told her doctors.

After enduring such an experience, “I don’t think it’s something that will leave you,” said Dr. Yael Mozer-Glassberg, who treated 19 of the children released. “It’s part of your life story from now on.”

In the days since the hostages were freed, nearly all have been released from hospitals and rejoined their families, including some welcomed back by thousands of well-wishers.

Doctors and others charged with treating the former hostages spent weeks preparing for their return. But the realities of caring for so many who endured such extremes has stunned physicians, starting with the reluctance of many children to speak.

“Most of them talk about needing to be very quiet. At all times. Not to stand up. Not to talk. Of course, not to cry. Not to laugh. Just to be very, very quiet,” said Bron-Harlev, the physician.

“What these children have gone through is simply unimaginable.”

Despite that, at times now some appear to be thriving.

Noam Avigdori, 12, who was released with her mother, has spent the past week trading jokes with her father, meeting with friends, and has even ventured out to a store.

“When I say, ‘Noam, do this, go do that,’ she says, ‘Dad, you know what happened to me.’ And she knows that she can squeeze that lemon and … she’s enjoying it,” her father, Hen Avigdori, said in an interview.

But there are also nights when his daughter wakes up screaming, Avigdori said this week at a separate news conference.

Nearly all those who have been freed have said little publicly about the conditions of their captivity. Their families say officials have told them not to disclose details of their individual treatment, for fear of putting those still being held in further jeopardy.

But interviews with their families, doctors and mental health professionals, and statements released by officials and others make clear that while all the hostages suffered, their experiences in captivity varied significantly.

Some were isolated from their fellow hostages. Others, like Noam Avigdori and her mother, Sharon, were held together with relatives, making it possible for the 12-year-old to act as something like an older sibling to the young cousins who were held with her.

“Everyone who was with a family member or with friends was in much better condition” when they were released, said Dani Lotan, a clinical psychologist at Scheider who treated some of the former hostages.

That varies, though, even within families.

In the weeks they were imprisoned, Danielle Aloni and her 5-year-old daughter, Emilia, established a close friendship with one of the imprisoned Thai farm workers, Nutthawaree Munkan. Last week, after all were released, the girl sang to a delighted Munkan when they were reunited in a video call, reciting the numbers she learned in Thai during captivity.

But Emilia’s cousins, 3-year-old twins, are having a difficult time since their return.

In captivity, Sharon Aloni was held with her husband and one of the twin girls in a small room, together with eight or so others. The couple spent “10 agonizing days” believing their other daughter had been killed, when she was snatched away shortly after they were taken into Gaza, Aloni’s brother, Moran Aloni told reporters.

That lasted until the day Sharon insisted to her husband that she could hear the cries of their missing daughter, Emma. Minutes later, a woman appeared without explanation to bring them the child, a joyous reunion that allowed mother and daughters to stay together throughout the remainder of their captivity. But a couple of days before they were released, the girls’ father was taken away and his whereabouts remain unknown.

Now free, the girls wake up crying in the middle of the night, Moran Aloni said. Emma won’t allow anyone to leave her side. They have gotten used to speaking up again, but their mother still whispers.

Many former hostages have recounted being given meager amounts of food. But the rations seemed to vary from group to group with little explanation, said Mozer-Glassberg, a senior physician at Schneider.

One family told doctors they were each given a biscuit with tea at 10 every morning and, from time to time, a single dried date. At 5 p.m. they were served rice. It wasn’t enough, but day after day of worry left their appetites to wither.

One 15-year-old girl recounted not eating for days so she could give her share of the food to her 8-year-old sister.

Some of the 23 Thai hostages released recently told caregivers they were each given roughly a half liter (17 ounces) of water and then had to make it last for three days. Sometimes, they said, it was saltwater.

One group of former captives reported being allowed to bathe three times over seven weeks with buckets of cold water. But one child never bathed at all, doctors say.

“Many of them talk about feeling very hungry. Very, very hungry. Many of them talk about feeling very dirty, not being able to clean, not being able to go to the bathroom,” Bron-Harlev said.

The process of recuperation from such prolonged trauma will be slow and piecemeal, doctors say. And while the adults may be better able to process what they have experienced, their recovery poses its own challenges.

Many, particularly the older and infirm, remain weak after losing nine kilos (20 pounds) or more because of the meager rations provided by their captors. When they speak, their families hear notes of resilience, but also of fragility.

Margalit Moses, a 78-year-old cancer survivor who has long struggled with multiple health problems, is back on the medications she was deprived of as a captive. But she remains too weak to walk more than a few steps.

“I think two months was up to the very, very last limit of her body hanging in there,” her niece, Efrat Machikawa, said.

In the days since Moses returned, she has been savoring pleasures that once seemed trivial, like peeling a fresh orange and lingering over crossword puzzles, her niece said.

Yaffa Adar, 85, a Holocaust survivor who was seized from her kibbutz and hustled into Gaza on golf cart, talks at length with her family about her time in captivity. But the days since have become more difficult as she grapples with what happened to her and the community she cherished, granddaughter Adva Adar said.

“She’s incredibly mentally strong, but you can see how the hell got into her soul,” the younger Adar said. “It’s in the way she looks at the world, the way she looks at people.”

In the hospitals, doctors, social workers and psychologists were careful about how they talked with the former hostages, not wanting to magnify their trauma. But as they settle in, both children and adults are confronting the toll of the October attack that captivity kept hidden from them.

Throughout the seven weeks she was held, Shoshan Haran, her daughters and grandchildren had to wonder what had happened to her husband.

“We had to tell them my father was murdered,” Yuval Haran said.

In the days ahead, he and others acknowledge, they will face questions about how to move forward without those who were killed or remain missing. But for most, it is far too soon.

When Hen Avigdori was called to a Tel Aviv hospital at 4 a.m. to reunite with his wife and daughter he said his heart filled with joy akin to the feeling of becoming a parent for the first time, but multiplied tenfold.

Hearing his daughter’s laughter again and talking for hours with his wife over coffee and cigarettes, it feels like his family has been reborn and they are treasuring the moment, he said.

Staying with family in southern Israel, Moses acknowledges that the kibbutz she loved no longer exists. But questions about where she wants to live will have to wait.

“It’s not time yet. You take it day by day. That’s part of the listening, part of the waiting, part of being here and now while everything else is going on,” said Machikawa, her niece.

And in Yuval Haran’s household – settled in quarters loaned to the family and shared with his mother, his sister, and his nieces, all recently freed – worries about the future are overwhelmed by the concerns of now.

In captivity, his mother made it her job to look after the girls, 4 and 8, and their mother. After more than a week of freedom, she still sleeps alongside them. Now, Haran says, the rest of the family will become their caregivers.

They will do whatever they can to help the girls and the women feel safe again. To reassure them that they can put their trust in others. To let them know that, at last, they are home."
161,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Zimbabwe holds special elections after court rules to remove 9 opposition lawmakers from Parliament,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/zimbabwe-holds-special-elections-after-court-rules/,"HARARE, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe is holding special elections Saturday for nine seats in Parliament after opposition lawmakers were removed from their positions and disqualified from running again. The opposition called it an illegal push by the ruling ZANU-PF party to bolster its parliamentary majority and possibly change the constitution.

This may allow President Emmerson Mnangagwa, 81, who was reelected for a second and final term in August amid international and regional criticism, to run for another term.

All nine opposition lawmakers from the Citizens Coalition for Change party that were removed were elected in the national vote in August. But an official claiming to be the secretary-general of the party recalled them from their positions in the weeks after that election.

CCC leader Nelson Chamisa said the official, Sengezo Tshabangu, held no position with the party and his instructions should be ignored. But Zimbabwean courts recognized Tshabangu’s authority, ruled to remove the opposition MPs and declared them on Thursday ineligible to run.

“This is not an election. This is not democracy,” opposition deputy spokesperson Gift Ostallos Siziba told The Associated Press.

Another late-night court ruling Friday left the ZANU-PF candidate set to win one of the seats in the capital, Harare, uncontested.

PHOTOS: Zimbabwe holds special elections after court rules to remove 9 opposition lawmakers from Parliament

The CCC said on the eve of the special elections that it had launched an appeal with the Supreme Court, demanding that eight of its candidates appear on the ballots. It didn’t list a name for the Harare seat.

The main opposition party said the removal of its lawmakers is a brazen attempt by the ruling party to increase its control in Parliament and has accused ZANU-PF, which has been in power since the southern African country’s independence in 1980, of using the courts to help it do that. The CCC said ZANU-PF was using Tshabangu and the courts to “decimate” the opposition.

“The battle lines have been clearly drawn,” the CCC said Saturday in a statement on social media site X. “The actions of the court officials who contributed to the demise of democracy in Zimbabwe will be recorded in the country’s history.”

ZANU-PF won 177 out of 280 parliamentary seats in the national election but needs another 10 seats to gain the two-thirds majority it requires to change the constitution. That would allow it to remove term limits for presidents, among other things.

Saturday’s special elections are just the start. Tshabangu has recalled dozens more opposition lawmakers, local councilors and mayors. More elections are due in the coming months.

Rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have said ZANU-PF is using institutions like the courts and the police force to suppress opposition and criticism.

The U.S. State Department said last week in the run-up to the special elections that it was placing visa restrictions on Zimbabwean individuals “believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining democracy in Zimbabwe.” It said they had been involved in “excluding members of the political opposition from electoral processes,” but didn’t name anyone.

ZANU-PF has denied any links to Tshabangu and his recall of opposition lawmakers, calling it an internal squabble in the CCC. The ruling party’s spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa said ZANU-PF is not responsible for the “chaos and disorder” within the opposition.

Rights groups have also warned of an upsurge in violence against opposition activists since the August elections. The country has a long history of violent and disputed elections.

Last month, a CCC activist - Tapfumaneyi Masaya - campaigning in the Harare constituency was found dead after unidentified people forced him into a vehicle, according to the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights group.

Masaya’s killing followed other attacks on opposition figures since the Aug. 23 election. The country is going in “a dangerous direction,” the CCC said.

Mnangagwa’s term is due to end in 2028 and some within his party have called for him to remain past the current two-term limit. He came to power in 2017 following a coup that removed autocrat Robert Mugabe, who was Zimbabwe‘s leader for 37 years.

Under Mugabe, Zimbabwe‘s economy collapsed and it was put under U.S. and European Union sanctions over alleged human rights abuses."
162,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Germany’s Scholz confident of resolving budget crisis, says no dismantling of the welfare state",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/germanys-scholz-confident-of-resolving-budget-cris/,"BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Saturday he is confident that his troubled government will find a good solution to a budget crisis triggered by a court ruling last month, and promised his center-left party there will be no dismantling of the country’s welfare state.

Leaders of Scholz’s three-party coalition have been wrangling over money since Germany‘s highest court annulled a decision to repurpose 60 billion euros ($65 billion) originally meant to cushion the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic for measures to help combat climate change and modernize the country.

The immediate challenge is to plug a 17 billion-euro hole in next year’s budget. Scholz, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck and Finance Minister Christian Lindner have met repeatedly to seek to resolve the impasse, but have run out of time to get the budget through parliament before the new year starts.

The issue has added to tensions in the 2-year-old coalition, which has become notorious for infighting and has seen its poll ratings slump. The alliance brings together Scholz’s Social Democrats and Habeck’s environmentalist Greens, who also traditionally lean to the left, with Lindner’s pro-business Free Democrats.

Lindner and his party have portrayed themselves as guarantors of solid finances and adherence to Germany‘s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt - the rules at the center of last month’s court ruling - and have advocated spending cuts.

Some members, along with the conservative opposition, have questioned a roughly 12% increase in unemployment benefits that is due to take effect in January. Germany‘s inflation rate has now declined to 3.2% from much higher levels earlier this year.

“I want to impart confidence here that we will succeed” in finding a solution, “and that we will succeed in a way that is important for the future of this country,” Scholz told a regular convention of the Social Democrats in Berlin Saturday. “We’re not facing an insoluble task; we just all have to agree.”

“But for me it is very clear that there will be no dismantling of the welfare state in Germany in such a situation,” he told delegates, to applause.

He said it “belongs to the DNA of our country” and is “the basis of prosperity in our country that you’re not given up on without hope, but again and again get an opportunity to manage and fight for your own prospects.”

The discussion about the unemployment benefit hike is “very odd,” given that the preceding increase was small and the next one probably will be too, Scholz said. “I think we have to resist,” he added, noting that parliament had approved it with opposition support.

Recent polls have shown support for the Social Democrats languishing at just 14-16%, far behind the 25.7% with which they narrowly won Germany‘s 2021 election. They trail both the conservative opposition Union bloc and the far-right Alternative for Germany.

Scholz noted that governments in Germany‘s neighbors also have squabbled lately - “that doesn’t make it better … but one must say that it can’t be a coincidence.”"
163,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"U.S., South Korea and Japan urge a stronger international push to curb North Korea’s nuclear program",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/9/us-south-korea-and-japan-urge-stronger-writethru-5/,"SEOUL, South Korea — The national security advisers of the United States, South Korea and Japan on Saturday called for a stronger international push to suppress North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and missiles, its cybertheft activities and alleged arms transfers to Russia.

The meeting in Seoul came as tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest in years, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerating the expansion of his nuclear and missile program and flaunting an escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons.

The United States and its Asian allies have responded by increasing the visibility of their trilateral partnership in the region and strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim condemns as invasion rehearsals.

Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have also expressed concerns about a potential arms alignment between North Korea and Russia. They worry Kim is providing badly needed munitions to help Russian President Vladimir Putin wage war in Ukraine in exchange for Russian technology assistance to upgrade his nuclear-armed military.

Speaking after the meeting, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington is working with Seoul and Tokyo to strengthen defense cooperation and improve its response to North Korean missile testing and space-launch activities, including a real-time information sharing arrangement on North Korean missile launches that the countries plan to start at an unspecified date in December.

He also said the countries have agreed to new initiatives to more effectively respond to North Korean efforts to bypass U.S.-led international sanctions that aim to choke off funds for its nuclear weapons and missile program.

“This will be a new effort with respect to cryptocurrency and money laundering and how we disrupt North Korea’s capacity to gain revenue from the hacking and stealing of cryptocurrency and then laundering it through exchanges,” he said.

Sullivan declined to share detailed U.S. assessments on the types and volume of North Korean arms being shipped to Russia and didn’t comment on the specifics of his discussions with South Korean and Japanese officials over the issue, but insisted that “there’s no daylight among us in terms of the types of weapons transfers that we are seeing. And those continue and they represent a grave concern for us.”

South Korean intelligence and military officials have said North Korea may have shipped more than a million artillery shells to Russia beginning in August, weeks before Kim traveled to Russia’s Far East for a rare summit with Putin that sparked international concerns about a potential arms deal. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied U.S. and South Korean claims.

In a joint news conference after Saturday’s trilateral meeting, Cho Tae-yong, South Korea’s national security office director, said the three security advisers reaffirmed North Korea’s obligations under multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that call for its denuclearization and ban any weapons trade with other countries, and agreed to strengthen coordination to ensure that is implemented.

Takeo Akiba, Japan’s national security secretariat secretary general, said the “unprecedented frequency and patterns” of North Korean ballistic missile launches necessitate a deeper and more effective partnership between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.

South Korea, the U.S., Japan and Australia have also announced their own sanctions on North Korea over its spy satellite launch last month. North Korea argues it the right to launch spy satellites to monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat of its nuclear-capable missiles.

During his conversation with reporters, Sullivan said the allies are preparing for the possibility that North Korea will up the ante of its weapons demonstrations and threats in 2024, possibly including the country’s seventh nuclear test.

Direct military action is also a concern after the North recently announced it was abandoning a 2018 inter-Korean military agreement on reducing border tensions after the South partially suspended the agreement, which had established border buffers and no-fly zones. Some experts say that has raised the risk of border-area shootings or clashes.

“Look, when a country announces its intent to walk away from a set of measures that are designed to help reduce risk and increase stability, our concern for potential incidents, provocations has to go up,” Sullivan said, though he said the full implications of the North’s announcement is not immediately clear.

Sullivan held separate bilateral talks Friday with Cho and Akiba and also met with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.

The U.S., South Korean and Japanese national security advisers last held a trilateral meeting in June in Tokyo.

South Korean intelligence officials have said the Russians likely provided technology support for North Korea’s successful satellite launch in November, which followed two failed launches.

North Korea has said its spy satellite transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos. Many outside experts question whether the North’s satellite is sophisticated enough to send militarily useful high-resolution imagery.

Kim has vowed to launch more satellites, saying his military needs to acquire space-based reconnaissance capabilities.

South Korean officials have also said North Korea-made rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons could have been used by Hamas during its Oct. 7 assault on Israel and that the North could be considering selling weapons to militant groups in the Middle East.

Sullivan said that the United States has not seen any specific evidence of that, but remains vigilant about the possibility.

“I think given North Korea’s history of proliferation activities, including to reprehensible actors in other contexts across history, it’s a legitimate concern,” he said."
164,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Healed bald eagle released in Chesapeake,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-09/healed-american-bald-eagle-wildlife-chesapeake,"Read the original article on WHRO's website.

More than 200 people gathered at Oak Grove Lake Park in Chesapeake Thursday afternoon, eagerly awaiting a chance to see a bald eagle released into the wild.

Ed Clark, president and co-founder of the Wildlife Center of Virginia, made the rounds through the crowd, showing off the 11-pound adult female that had been too sick to fly less than two months ago.

Then, he moved to the middle, counted to three and launched the bird into the sky. She spread a roughly 7-foot wingspan and quickly soared above the trees.

“She definitely was ready to go,” Clark said.

Katherine Hafner / WHRO The rehabilitated bald eagle soars over Oak Grove Lake Park in Chesapeake.

Chesapeake Animal Services responded to a call about the eagle in late October. Officers found it hurt and unable to fly and transferred the bird to the wildlife center in Waynesboro.

The eagle was “quiet but alert and responsive” at the time, the center said on its website.

Veterinarians found several issues with the eagle, which had corneal ulcers in both eyes, a broken talon, lesions on its feet and an old healed fracture on one leg.

The bird was also severely dehydrated and had a very high level of toxic lead in its blood — an amount known to cause permanent neurological damage, according to the wildlife center.

The care team gave the eagle fluids, antibiotic eye drops, anti-inflammatories and more, and it responded well to treatment.

Over the past month and a half, rehabilitation staff helped the eagle rebuild strength and stamina with daily exercises until she could fly consistently.

Being released after just a couple months is rare, Clark said. Some birds need treatment for a year or more.

“Once she started feeling better, she let us know in no uncertain terms she did not like being in captivity,” he said with a laugh. “At least a half a dozen of my colleagues have been injured by this bird.”

Wildlife Center of Virginia The eagle was initially found injured in Chesapeake in late October.

The Chesapeake eagle was one of almost 70 admitted this year — a record for the wildlife center, which opened in 1982. At least 15 of those birds came from southeastern Virginia. The statewide average over the past five years has been 46, which officials said is still high.

They include birds that were hit by cars, had nests destroyed by storms or were injured during territorial disputes with other eagles. Others, like the one in Chesapeake, suffered from lead toxicosis.

Clark said that lead comes from hunting ammunition left in dead animals, on which eagles feed. Even a piece of lead the size of a grain of rice can be fatal to an adult bald eagle.

“Each chunk is a toxic time bomb,” he said.

The increase in admissions is likely due to a combination of factors, he said.

On the positive side, it’s a reflection of bald eagles’ recovering population in Virginia. The number of nesting eagle pairs in the Commonwealth has grown from 20 to 1,500 since 1970 — a change of more than 7,000%.

“The good news is we have more eagles in Virginia than we've had probably in 500 years and maybe more than ever,” Clark said.

But that growth means more competition between eagles, which have been pushed out of their historical coastal habitat further inland.

Climate change is also starting to affect their migration patterns and breeding seasons, Clark said.

Several more eagles are set to be released from treatment soon. Clark said he was pleased to see so many people show up for the event in Chesapeake.

“What a nice way to start the holiday season.”"

Motorkat canceled the planned drag events Saturday, refunding ticket holders.

""Motorkat prides itself on providing an accepting and supportive space for people of all backgrounds and identities. The planned drag brunch and drag story time events were designed to be inclusive gatherings promoting positivity and acceptance.

""Motorkat vehemently condemns this act of hate, expressing solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community. Motorkat is determined to overcome this incident, rising above hate, and fostering an environment of love and acceptance.""

Council on Friday would officially void racial covenants that are in the original deeds of many homes in the Chevy Chase neighborhood; a neighborhood where covenants also prohibit apartments.

The city's plans for the Chevy Chase library and the community center would allow development that will replace the current buildings with a new complex that includes apartments in opposition to a covenant. Proponents of the plans said that covenants about the apartments and race should be officially voided.

""Obviously, this language has no place in our society, and should never have existed,"" said one woman during the meeting. ""Due to the current political environment, I would rather not take chances,"" said another.

But others insist that no way would racial covenants be enforced nowadays and this rush to avoid them is a ruse to help apartment developers essentially invade Chevy Chase.



""In my view, the purpose of his package is to smooth the way for developers by hiding the intent behind the important pursuit of racial equity and fairness,"" said another woman at the meeting.

Councilmember Matt Fruman said that there is a covenant from the 1930s on his own home. 7News asked him who wouldn't be allowed in his home according to the covenant.

""Well, African Americans are not allowed in my house, really in a painful kind of language that is not uncommon. The only way that they were allowed to live in my house is if they were domestic servants,” Fruman explained.



In addition to African Americans who were prohibited, also Chinese, Japanese, Armenians, Persians and Syrians. While the city is still yet to present its plan to the neighborhood for the development is still years away, you can believe it will be controversial.
