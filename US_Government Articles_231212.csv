2,U.S. Support for the Philippines in the South China Sea,https://www.state.gov/u-s-support-for-the-philippines-in-the-south-china-sea-7/,"Outside Scarborough Reef on December 9 and again near Second Thomas Shoal on December 10, People’s Republic of China (PRC) ships employed water cannons and reckless maneuvers, including forcing a collision, causing damage to Philippine vessels undertaking official supply missions to those locations, and jeopardizing the safety of the Filipino crew. The PRC ships at Scarborough Reef also used acoustic devices, incapacitating the Filipino crew members, and drove away Philippine fishing vessels. By impeding the safe operations of Philippine vessels carrying provisions to Filipino service members stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, the PRC interfered in lawful Philippine maritime operations and in Philippine vessels’ exercise of high seas freedom of navigation. Obstructing supply lines to this longstanding outpost and interfering with lawful Philippines maritime operations undermines regional stability.

These actions reflect not only reckless disregard for the safety and livelihoods of Filipinos, but also for international law. As reflected in an international tribunal’s legally binding decision issued in July 2016, the PRC has no lawful maritime claims to the waters around Second Thomas Shoal, and Filipinos are entitled to traditional fishing rights around Scarborough Reef. As provided under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, the 2016 arbitral decision is final and legally binding on the PRC and the Philippines, and the United States calls upon the PRC to abide by the ruling and desist from its dangerous and destabilizing conduct.

The United States stands with our Philippine allies in the face of these dangerous and unlawful actions. We reaffirm that Article IV of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty extends to armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft – including those of its Coast Guard – anywhere in the South China Sea"

We express our appreciation to President of Djibouti Ismail Omar Guelleh for the invitation to participate in the summit, held in Djibouti December 9 to address the conflict in Sudan.

The United States welcomes the stated commitments during the summit of SAF General Burhan and RSF General Hemedti to an unconditional ceasefire and a one-to-one meeting between them. For the sake of the people of Sudan and regional stability, the United States demands the SAF and RSF abide by these commitments and enter talks without delay. We join IGAD in reiterating to the belligerent parties that there is no acceptable military solution to the conflict in Sudan. We strongly endorse the condemnation by IGAD of support to the warring parties, which only serves to fuel the conflict.

We share IGAD’s deep alarm at the particular toll the conflict has taken on women and children, including conflict-related sexual violence. The United States is committed to coordinating closely with IGAD, the AU, and other partners in facilitating an inclusive Sudanese-owned and led civilian dialogue to address transitional and governance issues and resume Sudan’s democratic transition.

The United States is proud of our steadfast partnership and support for the efforts of IGAD and the African Union’s efforts to resolve the Sudan crisis."
4,Secretary Antony J. Blinken With Martha Raddatz of ABC This Week,https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-martha-raddatz-of-abc-this-week-3/,"QUESTION: For the latest on the conflict, we’re joined now by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. We appreciate your time this morning, Mr. Secretary. You had five Democratic senators send a letter to you, the Defense Secretary, the President this week calling for increased accountability for Israel’s use of American weapons. And yet your State Department is now pushing through the sale of 13,000 rounds of tank ammunition for Israel, bypassing congressional review generally required for foreign arms sales. Why are you doing that?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Martha, first, we’re trying to do everything we can to ensure that civilians are protected, that humanitarian assistance gets into people who need it in Gaza. We are deeply, deeply aware of the terrible human toll that this conflict is taking on innocent men, women, and children, and we’re working to minimize that to the greatest extent possible. When it comes to the weapons that we transfer, the rules that go along with them, those rules apply to Israel as they do to any other country, including the way they’re used and the need, the imperative of respecting international humanitarian law.

In the case of these particular weapons that you mentioned, Israel is in combat right now with Hamas, a group that viciously attacked it on October 7th; that has said that it – given the opportunity, it will repeat October 7th again and again and again; that continues to launch rockets against Israeli civilians. And we want to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Hamas. A small portion of what has been requested is going through on an emergency basis, that is moving quickly so that Israel can have what it needs in hand. But virtually everything else is going through the regular order, through Congress. It’s very important that Congress’s voice be heard in this.

QUESTION: But let me go back to the law you mentioned. Have you seen anything in the Israel campaign, with thousands and thousands of civilians killed, many, many of those children, that you believe should be investigated or has been investigated?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: We are in almost constant discussions with the Israelis about – to ensure that they understand what their obligations are, to make sure that we understand how they are using whatever arms we’re providing to them, as well as more broadly. I can’t evaluate a specific instance in the moment, but I can tell you we’re looking at everything.

QUESTION: If you’re continuing to send these weapons without any accounting for how they are used except talking to the Israelis, what other leverage can you use to make sure they take greater care in this campaign?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Martha, we’re focused on two things. We’re focused on what is their intent and do they have in place – are they taking necessary measures to make sure that they’re acting in adherence with international humanitarian law and international law? But then also, what are the results? And as I’ve said before —

QUESTION: We’ve seen the results.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: — there is a gap between the intent – there is a gap between the intent and the results, and that’s the gap that we’re trying to make sure is closed. Look, this could be over tomorrow. This could be over tomorrow if Hamas got out of the way of civilians instead of hiding behind them, if it put down its weapons, if it surrendered. And what there ought to be as well is a call on part – on behalf of the entire world for Hamas to do just that. That would stop this tomorrow. But in the absence of that, Israel has to take steps not only to defend itself against the ongoing attacks from Hamas, but against Hamas’s stated intent to repeat October 7th again and again if given the opportunity.

QUESTION: And I assume —

SECRETARY BLINKEN: I think any country faced with that would have to deal with it.

QUESTION: And Mr. Secretary, I assume that that answer is the same when it comes to the U.S. being the only country to vote against a UN ceasefire resolution on Friday?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: We have been a strong proponent of humanitarian pauses. In fact, because of our advocacy, because of the work we did, we got pauses, we got pauses on a daily basis, to make sure that people could get out of the way, that humanitarian supplies could get in. We helped negotiate the longer pause that resulted in the release of more than 110 hostages and that also allowed a doubling of humanitarian assistance that was getting into Gaza. But when it comes to a ceasefire in this moment, with Hamas still alive, still intact – and again, with the stated intent of repeating October 7th again and again and again – that would simply perpetuate the problem.

And so our focus is on trying to make sure that civilians are protected to the maximum extent possible, that humanitarian assistance gets in to the maximum extent possible. And again, if Hamas were to put down its weapons tomorrow, surrender tomorrow, this would be over tomorrow.

QUESTION: Let me go to this wider war. There were a series of missile attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea this week. The USS Carney rushed to aid them, ended up shooting down several drones fired by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. The Yemeni armed forces now saying they will prohibit the passage of any ships to Israel and consider them a target. What do you do about that?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, there are a number of things. First, what we’ve seen coming from the Houthis directed at ships in that area is a threat not just to Israel, not just to us, but to dozens of countries that are engaged in shipping that depend on this corridor for goods moving about every single day. And this has actually implicated the interests, directly, of well over a dozen countries with crews from all sorts of different places, ships registered and insured in different places. So this should be and is an international concern.

We are bringing together a group that we’ve already formed and we’re trying to strengthen its work to, on a maritime basis, help protect shipping. We’ve obviously taken action, including sanctions just this week, against those who are trying to finance the Houthis and their efforts. And we’ll take whatever other actions are necessary to protect our personnel, to protect our people, as well as to protect shipping.

QUESTION: Military action? You have the former commander of CENTCOM saying we’ve given them no reason not to continue their attacks.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Again, we will and we are looking at everything.

QUESTION: I want to move to Ukraine. This week you – aid was held up to Ukraine. How concerned are you about that with winter coming on?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Very concerned. We need to see this supplemental budget request go through as quickly as possible. Ukraine has done an extraordinary job in defending against this Russian aggression. Over the past year, it’s taken back more than 50 percent of its territory. It’s engaged in a ferocious battle right now along the eastern and southern fronts. We are running out of resources already in the bank to continue to assist them, and we need them.

I would point out as well that about 90 percent of the security assistance that we provided to Ukraine actually is invested right here in the United States in terms of the production of materials and munitions and weapons that go to the Ukrainians. It’s right here in America with good jobs. We have extraordinary burden sharing that I haven’t seen before my own experience, where, for everything that we’ve been providing to the Ukrainians to help them, our European partners and other allies around the world have provided more – military, economic, humanitarian assistance.

So the choice is very clear. If we do this and help Ukraine sustain the achievements that it’s made, help ensure that Russia continues to suffer a strategic failure in Ukraine, that’s one route to go. The other route to go is to do something that the only people who are rooting for it are in Moscow and maybe in Tehran and Beijing, which is not to provide this assistance.

QUESTION: Okay, thank you very much for joining us this morning. We do appreciate your time again. Thank you so much.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks, Martha."
5,Secretary Antony J. Blinken With Jake Tapper of CNN State of the Union,https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-jake-tapper-of-cnn-state-of-the-union-3/,"QUESTION: Joining me now is Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us. So the U.S. stood alone at the UN Security Council on Friday to block the ceasefire, and the administration is sidestepping Congress to rush more weapons to Israel. You said this week there is, quote, a “gap between … the intent to protect [Palestinian] civilians, and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground” in Gaza. Can you describe that gap? What is Israel doing right now that you think does not demonstrate enough care or protection of Palestinian civilians?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Jake, we think there needs to be a premium put on protecting civilians and making sure that humanitarian assistance can get to everyone who needs it. And as I said, I think the intent is there, but the results are not always manifesting themselves. And we see that both in terms of civilian protection and humanitarian assistance. We want to make sure that as Israel continues this this campaign – because remember, they are dealing with a terrorist organization that engaged in the most vicious possible brutality on October 7th and has made clear that it would do it again and again and again if given the opportunity. So Israel needs to be able to deal with this, to protect itself, to prevent October 7th from happening again. But as it does that, it’s imperative that civilians be protected. And here, the critical thing is to make sure that the military operations are designed around civilian protection and to focus on that.

When it comes to humanitarian assistance, we, as you know, made the argument many weeks ago to get humanitarian assistance in. It started to flow. We got it doubled during the humanitarian pause for the hostage releases that we helped to negotiate. But now what’s critical is this: Even as Israel has taken additional steps – for example, to designate safe areas in the south; to focus on neighborhoods, not entire cities in terms of evacuating them – what we’re not seeing sufficiently is a couple of things.

One, making sure that the humanitarian operators who are there, starting with the United Nations, performing heroically, that there are deconfliction times, places, and routes so that the humanitarians can bring the assistance that’s getting into Gaza to the people who need it. Similarly, we need to see the same kind of deconfliction time, pauses, designated routes – plural, not just one – and clarity of communication so that people know when it is safe and where it is safe to move to get out of harm’s way before they go back home. These are the kinds of things we’re working on every single day, again, to make sure that that gap between intent and result is as narrow as possible.

QUESTION: The IDF told CNN – I believe Alex Marquardt – earlier today that they estimate they’ve killed about 7,000 Hamas fighters. When do you anticipate this phase of Israel’s military campaign is going to end? Obviously, they can’t kill every member of Hamas, and even if they did, 150,000 new ones would show up the next day. Are the Israelis telling you anything about when this phase is going to wrap up? Because obviously, the civilian death toll is mounting; it’s unimaginable. Secretary Austin suggested that Israel might ultimately be facing a strategic defeat by chasing so many Palestinians into the arms of Hamas.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Jake, we have these discussions with Israel, including about the duration as well as how it’s prosecuting this campaign against Hamas. These are decisions for Israel to make, but Hamas has decisions to make too. It could get out from hiding behind civilians tomorrow.

QUESTION: Right.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: It could put down its arms tomorrow, it could surrender tomorrow, and this would be over.

QUESTION: Right, obviously, but will the U.S. continue to back Israel the way it’s backing Israel right now if this continues for months and months, as opposed to days or weeks?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Again, Israel has to make these decisions. Of course, everyone wants to see this campaign come to a close as quickly as possible. But any country faced with what Israel is facing, a terrorist organization that attacked it in the most horrific way possible on October 7th – and as I said, has said repeatedly that it would do it again and again and again – it has to get to the point where it is confident that that can’t be repeated.

But you make another point that’s very important. When the major military operation is over, this is not over, because we have to have a durable, sustainable peace, and we have to make sure that we’re on the path to a durable, sustainable peace. From our perspective, I think from the perspective of many around the world, that has to lead to a Palestinian state. This is – we’re not going to have durable peace, we’re not going to have durable security for Israel unless and until Palestinian political aspirations are met. And of course, what happens the day after in Gaza itself once the military operation’s – major military operation’s over – that’s also hugely important and urgent to make sure that governance, security, reconstruction, all of that is in place so that there’s no vacuum.

QUESTION: The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 63 journalists and members of the news media have been killed, 56 of them Palestinian, in this war, presumably, mostly if not entirely by IDF strikes. Is that acceptable to you? You’ve made press freedom a hallmark of your term. How do you explain all these deaths of journalists? How do the Israelis explain it?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Jake, as I see journalists, including some of your colleagues but also from many other news organizations, putting their lives on the line to just bring the news, bring the facts, bring information to the world, I have extraordinary admiration for what they do, for the courage that they show, and for the vital importance of their mission. And we want to make sure that, just as every civilian is protected to the greatest extent possible, of course, journalists are too. And there – when it comes to instances where journalists have been killed, we want to make sure that that’s investigated and we understand what’s happened and there’s accountability.

QUESTION: Congress is scrambling to reach a deal to pass foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel. Republicans are insisting on more border funding and new asylum restrictions, that that be added to the bill. What would it mean for Ukraine and Israel if Congress does not pass any additional support by the end of the year? And why not agree to tougher border protections, which is an issue of national security as well?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, Jake, the border piece, as you know, is out of my purview. But I can say this. I know on day one of this administration, or at least day two, the President put before Congress, I think, a first bill on immigration reform. Unfortunately, Congress hasn’t acted on that. In this request for additional funds, there are $6 billion to enhance border security, including having more people, more agents on the border. So I know that’s very much part of the discussion and something the President’s fully prepared to engage on.

But in terms of what it would mean for Ukraine, what it would mean for Israel, what it would mean for our efforts to be competitive in the Indo-Pacific – I think the only people who’d be happy if this supplemental budget request is not voted on and approved by Congress are sitting in Moscow, sitting in Tehran, sitting in Beijing. For Ukraine, this is absolutely vital. They’ve made remarkable progress over the last year in pushing back Russian aggression, taking back more than 50 percent of the territory that was seized since February of 2022. But they’re in a ferocious battle now in the south and the east. We are running out of funding for them.

By the way, 90 percent of the assistance, the security assistance that we provided Ukraine, is actually invested right here in the United States to our companies, to our manufacturers. Similarly, we’ve had extraordinary burden sharing with our allies and partners. We’ve provided very significant assistance, about $70 billion over the last two years. Our European friends and partners beyond Europe: more than $110 billion for Ukraine. So we have the burden sharing that we need.

This is a time to really step up, because if we don’t, we know what happens. Putin will be able to move forward with impunity, and we know he won’t stop in Ukraine, and he may well end up going after a NATO country. That would bring us in given our obligations to our NATO Allies. So here, an ounce of prevention is really worth 10 pounds of cure.

QUESTION: Antony, as you know, CNN has led the coverage when it comes to the evidence mounting in Israel of rapes and sex crimes committed by Hamas against women and girls, maybe even against men on October 7th. Why do you think the United Nations and the international community has been so slow to condemn these atrocities? I can’t think of a real reason – well, let me just put it this way. I’ve heard antisemitism hypothesized as a reason why the UN and the international community might be so slow to acknowledge this. What do you think?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Jake, first, I really applaud the extraordinary work of CNN in bringing this to light and bringing this before the world. You’ve performed a remarkable service in doing that. As to your question, I don’t have an answer. I don’t know why countries, leaders, international organizations were so slow to focus on this, to bring it to people’s attention. I’m glad it’s finally happened. The atrocities that we saw on October 7th are almost beyond human description or beyond our capacity to digest. And we’ve talked about them before, but the sexual violence that we saw on October 7th is beyond anything that that I’ve seen either. So thank you for doing that, and look, I don’t have a good answer to that question. I think it’s a question that these organizations, these countries need to ask themselves.

QUESTION: Secretary of State Antony Blinken, thanks for joining us today. Appreciate it.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks, Jake. Good to be with you."
6,Human Rights Day,https://www.state.gov/human-rights-day-3/,"We live by the principle that all persons are born free and equal with inherent human rights. This principle – a product of foresight and humility by those who came before us – was enshrined 75 years ago today by the UN General Assembly when it adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The UDHR, now endorsed by nearly every country in the world, enumerates the human rights that must be universally protected, and sets a common standard of liberty and dignity for all people, of all nations.

As we look at the first 75 years of the UDHR, we recognize what we’ve accomplished in this time, but also know that much work remains. Too often, authorities fail to protect or – worse – trample on human rights and fundamental freedoms, often in the name of security or to maintain their grip on power. Whether arresting and wrongfully detaining journalists and dissidents, restricting an individual’s freedom of religion or belief, or committing atrocities and acts of genocide, violations and abuses of human rights undermine progress made in support of the UDHR. In the face of these actions, we must press for greater human rights protection and promote accountability whenever we see violations or abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

On its 75th anniversary, the UDHR must continue to be our guiding light as we strive to create the world in which we want to live. Its message is as important today as it was 75 years ago: human rights belong to everyone, everywhere."
7,Medal of Honor Monday: Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Karl G. Taylor Sr.,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1972,"When Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Karl Gorman Taylor Sr. was called upon to rescue a trapped platoon in Vietnam, he didn't hesitate to do whatever it took to get his comrades to safety. For Taylor, that meant giving his life for theirs — a sacrifice that earned him a posthumous Medal of Honor.Taylor was born July 14, 1939, to parents Arthur and Anna Taylor. He and his younger brother, Walter, grew up on a small farm outside of Laurel, Maryland.Taylor went to Arundel Senior High School but left after his junior year in 1956 to work in construction. In January 1959, both he and his brother joined the Marine Corps.After infantry combat training, the elder Taylor served with the Fleet Marine Force at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In the early days of his career, he was able to study for his high school equivalency diploma and, in 1961, earned that from the former Armed Forces Institute in Madison, Wisconsin.Taylor served as a drill instructor for a time before going on inactive duty with the Marine Corps Reserve. However, about three months later, in late March 1963, he returned to active duty to serve at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.At some point during those years, he married Shirley Ann Piatt. They went on to have two boys, Karl Jr. and Kevin, as well as a daughter, Sheryl.In August 1964, Taylor deployed to Vietnam with the 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division. A year later, he was reassigned as an instructor for the Non-Commissioned Officer Leadership School for Fleet Marine Force, Pacific.He returned to Quantico in January 1966 for duty as a platoon sergeant at Officer Candidate School before being promoted to staff sergeant on Sept. 1, 1966.In February 1968, Taylor returned to Vietnam for his second tour of duty, again with the 3rd Marine Division. He was assigned as a platoon sergeant and company gunnery sergeant of Company I of the 3rd Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment.In December 1968, Taylor's unit was part of Operation Meade River, which was a combined search and destroy mission to regain control of various areas in Quang Nam Province — specifically, to push the enemy out of an area called Dodge City. That region was known to be a staging area and command post for the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong troops moving toward U.S. bases at Da Nang, which was about 10 miles south.On the night of Dec. 8, 1968, Taylor was acting as the company gunnery sergeant when his unit got pinned down by heavy enemy fire. At some point, he learned that the commander of the lead platoon had been killed, so he and another Marine quickly staged a rescue effort to help the remaining members of the beleaguered platoon.Both men crawled through a hail of hostile fire to reach the unit, where they shouted instructions and encouragement to the men and deployed them to covered positions. Several times, Taylor and the other Marine maneuvered across an open area to rescue seriously wounded platoon members who couldn't move themselves.When Taylor learned that other seriously injured Marines were trapped in another open area near an enemy machine gun, he and four others moved across the fire-swept terrain to try to rescue them. Soon after, though, their progress was stopped by intense enemy fire, so Taylor ordered the others to go back to the company command post.From there, Taylor grabbed a grenade launcher and, in full view of the enemy, charged across an open rice paddy toward the machine gun's position, unleashing devastating fire as he went. He was wounded several times but succeeded in getting to the enemy bunker and taking out its machine gun and gunners. Moments later, he was killed. However, his efforts saved the lives of several of his fellow Marines.Taylor's brother, Walter, later told reporters that he was informed of his brother's death while he was a drill instructor in San Diego. He said Taylor was supposed to return from deployment a mere 20 days later.Taylor is buried in Independence Cemetery in Independence, Pennsylvania, where his wife and children were living at the time of his death.In honor of his sacrifice, Taylor was awarded the Medal of Honor. His wife and children were presented the medal by President Richard M. Nixon during a White House ceremony on Feb. 16, 1971. His youngest son, 4-year-old Kevin, even made the news for saluting Nixon after the presentation.Eleven other men — three Marines and eight soldiers — also received the Medal of Honor that day.To honor his father, Kevin Taylor went on to become a career Marine as well. When he was promoted to gunnery sergeant -- a rank his father was set to be advanced to before he died -- he dedicated the promotion to his father, according to a May 2005 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article. The younger Taylor retired from service that same year.This article is part of a weekly series called ""Medal of Honor Monday,"" in which we highlight one of the more than 3,500 Medal of Honor recipients who have earned the U.S. military's highest medal for valor."
8,Art eases pain for combat Veteran,https://news.va.gov/126721/art-eases-pain-for-combat-veteran/,"He was unemployed, debilitated by pain and nearly homeless. This is how Army Veteran Michael Jones described his life just a few years ago. Today he is an artist, a teacher, operations director and curator for the Marilyn Rose Center, an art gallery in Indianapolis.

As an Army combat and helicopter flight medic, Jones saw a lot of action, but he had no pain until one day in 2017. Standing in a store, he coughed, “and I blew out my disc,” he shared. The excruciating pain rendered him disabled.

His pain escalated after a spinal fusion and doctors told Jones it would never go away.

“It was pretty rough, realizing that this pain was going to be forever. I was a pretty angry guy. I lost my job. I lost my insurance. I got divorced. I had nothing,” he said.

“It’s been the most amazing journey.”

Jones packed up and moved home to Indianapolis. When his mother suggested the Indianapolis VA, he wasn’t sure he qualified. “They said, ‘Yes, we’ll help you,’ and from that day on, it’s been the most amazing journey.”

At the Indianapolis YMCA VA clinic, Jones received a pain management plan that included Whole Health services such as tai chi and meditation. He also joined a creative arts therapy group, although he had no art experience beyond doodling.

“Somebody brought in alcohol inks and we had tiles. So, we just started painting on them. I posted my paintings online and people were asking if they could buy them,” he said.

Jones was surprised at that response but even more at how he physically felt while painting. “I began to notice that as I painted, I became focused into the piece. It allowed my body to ease up the pain.” When he paints, “It’s the least pain I ever have.”

Jones is now grateful for his back injury because it led to his new vocation as an artist. This year, he judged the annual Veterans Creative Arts Show in Indianapolis, the same show he won in 2019. “I’ve come full circle. This is unreal that I get to do this,” he added.

9,Veteran reflects on life with multiple sclerosis,https://news.va.gov/126513/veteran-reflects-on-life-multiple-sclerosis/,"Navy Veteran Bill Metzger shares his journey with multiple sclerosis.

There are many wonderful things in this world, and I’ve spent much of my life trying to see them. I enlisted in the Navy my senior year of high school, starting my tour in September 1964. I wanted to experience more than my small town of Mechanicsburg, Penn., could offer and the Navy was the best way out. I served for three years with a two-year tour in Guam. Following my military service, I worked in journalism and photography.

I started getting the symptoms of MS in 1978 and was diagnosed in 1983, though that diagnosis never changed my desire and ability to see and explore.

Navy Veteran Bill Metzger

I retired in 2021 and rode freight trains all over the country for five years, escorting heavy, expensive and fragile machinery to make sure it arrived quickly and in one piece.

As my MS progressed, I needed a career change and settled on creating maps and brochures as contributing illustrator for Trains and Classic Trains magazines, where I made historic and contemporary railroad maps of subjects worldwide.

When I was diagnosed with MS, I decided to become a stronger, fitter person; I quit smoking and started exercising. I ran when I was traveling. When running became unsafe, my feet stumbling too often, I took up swimming.

“When I wasn’t biking, I was thinking about biking.”

After an ear infection, I took up biking. Every year I planned and completed a two-week bike trip with hundreds of small trips in-between. And when I wasn’t biking, I was thinking about biking. I figure I did about 30,000 miles on two wheelers, including one that lasted six weeks and 2,000 miles.

My MS hasn’t been a walk in the park. As my disease progressed, I found that handling a bike became increasingly difficult. That was in 1984, the year I also had a cardiac bypass.

Two of my neighbors who are occupational therapists introduced me to the handcycle. Once I rode it on our local trail, the Great Allegheny Passage, I was passing people. My handcycle wasn’t a step down, it was a step up to a new, incredible biking experience.

My wife and I have done several tours in the US and Canada. I keep a logbook and have put over 31,000 miles on the bike.

“Don’t we all adapt as life changes us?”

Though I’ve had MS for over 60 years, it’s never prevented me from living my best life. I’ve had to adapt at times, going from using a cane to forearm crutches and, for the last 12 years a wheelchair, but don’t we all adapt as life changes us?

Now we live in a totally accessible house, and I’ve traveled to thousands of places and met amazing people. I am a founding board member of the Montour Trail Council, which has built 40+ miles of trail around Pittsburgh. I’m also a founding board member of the Great Allegheny Passage Conservancy. We live along the trail and I’ve written a book about it, “The Great Allegheny Passage Companion.”

I’ve been married for 26 years to Pam (pictured above), an amazing woman who shares my love of biking and my adventurous spirit. I have an amazing VA neurologist, Dr. Islam Zaydan at Pittsburgh VA, who is my personal superhero. He’s helped keep me healthy and safe. And I’ve enjoyed excellent general health care through VA.

As a biking enthusiast and adventurer, I’ve learned there are good rides and there are better rides. There’s no such thing as a bad ride. You learn to deal with whatever comes along and you move forward. If it rains, you get wet… so what. Just enjoy the journey. That’s life.

As songwriter John Hartford wrote, “I’m still here. How ‘bout that.”

Downstate areas including Long Island, New York City, and the lower Mid-Hudson regions, will see several inches of rain and strong winds that could cause flooding and power outages. Further upstate, including areas in the North Country, Mohawk Valley, Central New York, Capital District, and Upper Mid-Hudson regions, rain will transition to wet heavy snow overnight, which could create difficult travel conditions during the Monday morning commute and cause power outages. New Yorkers should pay close attention to the weather forecast throughout the night and tomorrow and plan travel and other activities accordingly.

“This system will bring heavy rain and strong winds to downstate New York, while upstate will receive snow and wind tonight and tomorrow,” Governor Hochul said.“We will continue to monitor impacts from this weather system and state agencies are prepared to respond to requests for assistance. I urge all New Yorkers to watch the weather and plan your travel and activities accordingly with updated forecasts to stay safe, especially during tomorrow’s morning commute.”

Sunday and continuing into Monday, up to three inches of rain is expected across New York City and Long Island with up to five inches of rain possible across eastern Long Island. Parts of Suffolk County could see wind gusts up to 60 mph overnight tonight, which could cause power outages due to downed trees and wires, while parts of New York City and Nassau County could see 50 mph wind gusts. This evening, areas in the North Country, Mohawk Valley, Central New York, Capital District and Mid-Hudson Valley will see rain transition to heavy, wet snow with a foot or more expected in the highest elevations, including the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Tug Hill, and some lower elevation areas could see up to six inches of snow. Wind gusts up to 35 mph are possible statewide, which could lead to additional, isolated power outages.

Safety Tips

Travel

Some of the most important tips for safe driving include:

Do not drive unless necessary.

If you must travel, make sure your car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods and brightly colored cloth to use as a distress flag.

If you have a cell phone or other communications device such as a two-way radio available for your use, keep the battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling. If you should become stranded, you will be able to call for help, advising rescuers of your location.

The leading cause of death and injuries during winter storms is transportation accidents. Before getting behind the wheel, make sure that your vehicle is clear of ice and snow; good vision is key to good driving. Plan your stops and keep more distance between cars. Be extra alert and remember that snowdrifts can hide smaller children. Always match your speed to the road and weather conditions.

It is important for motorists on all roads to note that snowplows travel at speeds up to 35 mph, which in many cases is lower than the posted speed limit, to ensure that salt being dispersed stays in the driving lanes and does not scatter off the roadways. Oftentimes on interstate highways, snowplows will operate side by side, as this is the most efficient and safe way to clear several lanes at one time.

Motorists and pedestrians should also keep in mind that snowplow drivers have limited lines of sight, and the size and weight of snowplows can make it very difficult to maneuver and stop quickly. Snow blowing from behind the plow can severely reduce visibility or cause whiteout conditions. Motorists should not attempt to pass snowplows or follow too closely. The safest place for motorists to drive is well behind the snowplows where the roadway is clear and salted. Never attempt to pass a snowplow while its operating.

Power Outages

Check with your utility to determine area repair schedules.

Turn off or unplug lights and appliances to prevent a circuit overload when service is restored; leave one light on to indicate when power has been restored.

If heat goes out during a winter storm, keep warm by closing off rooms you do not need.

Central Hudson: 800-527-2714

Con Edison: 800-752-6633

National Grid: 800-867-5222

NYSEG: 800-572-1131

O&R: 877-434-4100

PSEG-LI: 800-490-0075

RG&E: 800-743-1701

Heating Safety

Use only safe sources of alternative heat such as a fireplace, small well-vented wood or coal stove or portable space heaters.

When using alternative heat sources such as a fireplace, woodstove, etc. always make sure you have proper ventilation. Always follow manufacturer's instructions.

Keep curtains, towels, and potholders away from hot surfaces.

Have a fire extinguisher and smoke detectors and make sure they work.

If you use kerosene heaters to supplement your regular heating fuel, or as an emergency source of heat, follow these safety tips:

Follow the manufacturers' instructions.

Use only the correct fuel for your unit.

Refuel outdoors only and only when the unit is cool.

Keep the heater at least three feet away from furniture and other flammable objects.

When using the heater, use fire safeguards and ventilate properly.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Praise be to God. Thank you, Lord, for allowing me to find my way early this morning from Albany to your church, your people here in Brooklyn. I've come here often, in fact, our great Senator Roxanne Persaud, says why aren't you just taking up an apartment here? You’re here so often. So, that's a possibility, if you've got a nice place I can rent. I want to thank her for her service to our state and to this community. Also, our Councilor Farah Louis has joined us as well. I thank her for her leadership and stepping forward to make sure that people in this district have a voice.

But more than anything, I want to thank Reverend Bernard. I want to thank you for saying yes. Yes, to the call to serve God, and that happened many decades ago. But thank you for your willingness to step up and be not just my spiritual advisor. We could always use a lot of advice, right? Can you use some good advice sometimes? Amen to that. But also, just recently, I named him the President of the Interfaith Council, the Executive Committee that is going to lead the messaging around the State of New York and my Office of Faith-Based Services led by CauraWashington, Pastor Caura Washington. Please stand up and take a round of applause here.

So, this is the team because the clergy, the faith leaders have a special connection with the people, right? You build a trust, a confidence, a love, a belief, and that's what I need – for people to go out, like Reverend Bernard, to go out and take that message of what we're doing to lift people up, to lift God's people up every single day across the state. So, you know we are working for you.

One thing that's so important to me is to make sure that everybody, all New Yorkers have that opportunity and promise that Reverend Bernard just spoke of. And I was touched by the fact that one of the earlier video clips talked about Asking the Lord, Apostles asking God to teach us how to pray. And he gave us the Lord's prayer. And one of the asks in that was give us our daily bread. Now anybody expecting to see a loaf of bread delivered at their house every day, you're probably going to wait a long time. That daily bread is not coming that way, right? But daily bread means the opportunity to have the money to take care of yourselves and your families.

But for too long, people are working to get that daily bread, sometimes they're working one, two jobs while they're trying to get an education, trying to take care of their kids, trying to take care of their parents, and visit grandma in the nursing home, all in one day, and guess what? They're still living below the poverty line. How do you work a full-time job and still live below the poverty line?

So, I am changing that, working with our legislature. I said, “No, no, no, no, no, not here in the State of New York. No more.” So, we are lifting the minimum wage, starting January 1. And if you're a minimum wage worker, you check your paycheck and you make sure it went up. And if it didn't, you let us know. Because that means they're stealing your wages. We're not going to let that happen either.

But not only are the wages going up, and I want you all to know this, but for the first time – over time, we're going to be indexing it to inflation. What does that mean? Because you can earn more money, right? But if the cost of everything from diapers to formula for new parents and the cost of sneakers and the backpacks and your eggs and your bread are all going up, you're not getting ahead. And that's what we're trying to solve here. Help people get ahead. So, that's one of the policies I want you to know about directly from me.

The other one is, the way you get your daily bread is the dignity of a job. Am I right about that? It's a job. It's how you get the money for the bread. Now, what if you've committed an offense, you've committed a crime, you went through the justice system, you spent your time in jail, and you come out? Okay, that's good, you paid your debt to society, it's all we ask, but then you are kept from being able to work because of the record that's on your slate.

That they say, “I'm sorry, no, no, no, you don't count anymore, so go take care of yourself but you cannot have a job.” Now people say to me, “Well, that means all these people are going to commit crimes. We can't let that happen.” I said, “Wait a minute. Do you understand what I just said? They paid their debt to society. They're out in our community now. And if you're worried about crime, I think the best crime fighting tool we can have, is a job. Give everybody a job because if you're working in a factory, working at a restaurant, working in a hotel, working at a technology office. You're not out there committing crimes.” It's just common sense. Am I right about that?

So, I had to change the law, had to change the law. November 16th, I took a pen. I don't have a pen. Nobody uses pens anymore. I actually took a pen. And with the support of our legislature and Senator Persaud, I signed a bill that said that after a period of time, if you come out, with specific crimes, you will now have a clean slate. You walk in and fill out that job application. You go get that job and you take care of your family. That's how we lift God's people up because the Lord's Prayer doesn't just talk about the daily bread, right? It's forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. That's what I believe.

So, I'm going to continue the conversation with you. This isn't political. I'm not up for election for a long time, thank God. This is a good news day for me. I'm just here to talk to you as a friend of CCC. Someone whose heart is filled with the gratitude because I came here within the first month of becoming your Governor unexpectedly.

And I asked for your prayers. And it was a dark time in our state, COVID was still swirling around, the kids weren't back at school, people weren't at their jobs, and I came here to ask for your prayers, your humble support, but also to let you know that I'll fight for you every single day. And I'm going to keep working for you and working for your families and working for your children.

And with great partners like Reverend Bernard, everyone will know that the priorities of the State of New York are to give everyone that opportunity and the promise of a better life, please keep in your prayers. I'm your humble servant. Thank you very much."
