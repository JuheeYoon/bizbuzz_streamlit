5,Battle Creek VA Outreach team conducted over 70 PACT Act information events,https://news.va.gov/126540/outreach-team-conducted-70-pact-act-events/,"Several staff members of Battle Creek VA were honored at the 67th Military Appreciation luncheon hosted by the Battle Creek Chamber of Commerce Nov. 9. Employees from Medical, Eligibility/Enrollment and Veterans Transportation Service accepted the award before an audience of Veterans, service members and local dignitaries from communities across southwest Michigan.

They were part of the PACT Outreach Team that conducted over 70 PACT Act Information events that helped enroll Veterans for the care and benefits they deserve.

Shortly after the passage of the act, Battle Creek VA’s PACT Act Outreach Team embarked on a mission to ensure that no Veteran in their 21 county catchment area faced unnecessary barriers to enrollment and screening.

They led a thorough assessment, identifying and dismantling obstacles, before pushing a communication plan that focused on radio, social media, email and post cards to reach their primarily rural Veterans.

“Phenomenal work making Veterans aware of benefits they earned.”

“The outreach team did phenomenal work reaching Veterans in the community and making them aware of the benefits they have earned,” said Brian Pegouske, Communication & Community Engagement. “We’re really proud of the gains we made this year in Veteran awareness.”

PACT Act Outreach Team

Traveling to senior centers, county offices and private venues throughout southwest Michigan, the PACT Act Outreach Team brought details about the expanded eligibility and benefits to Veterans of many different eras. Veteran Service Organizations, on-site health care enrollment and toxic agent screening were available to Veterans during the events.

Thanks to their hard work, Battle Creek VA enrolled 2,331 new Veterans last year, which was an increase of over 600 versus the previous year. Over 26,000 Toxic Exposure Screenings have been conducted as well, surpassing the goal by 111%, and with an average of 88% of follow-ups completed within 30 days.

The luncheon included members of the Army and Navy Reserve, Army and Air National Guard, VFW and other community partners. It was a celebration of the sacrifice and service our Veterans in southwest Michigan have made throughout 2023 and the Veteran Support available to these Veterans in the local community."
6,Healing hooves: Equine therapy raises spirits of Veterans,https://news.va.gov/126535/equine-therapy-raises-spirits-of-veterans/,"Ranger and Dare are in the therapy business. Like many of their peers, they spend their days working with kids, people with disabilities and Veterans… when not eating grass and alfalfa.

Ranger and Dare are American miniature horses for a North Texas non-profit that brings equine therapy to those who cannot travel to their home stable. Their audience on a recent sunny day at Dallas VA were Community Living Center (CLC) residents as part of their recreational therapy program.

Equine therapy and visits from Ranger and Dare are part of different therapeutic modalities VA recreation therapists bring to Veterans receiving nursing home level of care, assistance with daily activities and medical care.

“Animals aid in healing emotional conditions.”

“These visits bring invaluable benefits to our patients,” said Amor Aguilera, recreation therapist. “Animals can aid in healing emotional and behavioral conditions.”

Equine therapy fosters community engagement, promotes resilience and raises the spirits of CLC residents, their families and employees. Engaging with animals like Ranger and Dare can lower blood pressure and bring child-like feelings of happiness.

“I loved being with them because they love the attention I give them,” said Judith Collins, Army Veteran and CLC resident (pictured above). “After my car accident, I feel a real connection with these horses.”

Therapists for these visits believe that horses keep us grounded in the present moment. Visits like these motivate residents to interact with their surroundings while building trust.

“Just being around them helps bring calm and peace to Veterans that interact with them,” said one therapist. Visits by Ranger and Dare cement the partnership that recreation therapists and VA have with their patients, and it brings a unique perspective regarding the social, cognitive, physical and leisure needs of each Veteran."
7,Molten Monitoring: How Cal OES Tracks Local Volcanos,https://news.caloes.ca.gov/molten-monitoring-how-cal-oes-tracks-local-volcanos/,"While often overshadowed by the seismic activity associated with fault lines, California is home to several volcanos that demand careful monitoring. The California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) plays a crucial role in keeping a watchful eye on these dormant giants, ensuring the safety and preparedness of communities across the state.

While many of California’s volcanos are dormant, their potential for activity poses a risk that cannot be ignored. See a list of volcanos in California.

Volcanos in California

Volcanic eruptions in the state are not currently imminent, but in addition to fires, floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis, Cal OES’ Seismic Hazards Branch monitors any possible volcanic threats from the eight volcanic areas classified as moderate, high, and very high threat in the state.

Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are a way for Earth to release pressure and heat, much like a safety valve. A volcano is basically a vent, or opening, in the earth’s crust from which hot molten rock, gases, and volcanic ash escape to the surface.

Prepare your Home and Family

Preparing your family for a possible volcanic eruption will not only help protect your health and property, but also may be the difference between life and death. Below are steps you can take to minimize impacts to your family and home in the event of volcanic eruption:

Know where the active volcanos are in your area and how close you are to them. Consider anyone with functional and/or access needs, children, pets, and livestock. Create an emergency evacuation plan with your family. Review it often so that each person knows what to do, how to find each another if you’re apart, and how to contact neighbors and/or emergency services if you cannot get away from the property using your own transportation. Create an emergency kit for your car including maps, tools, a first aid kit, a fire extinguisher, flares, additional non-perishable food, booster cables, sleeping bags and/or emergency blankets, and a flashlight. If there are disaster warning sirens in your area be aware of what they sound like. When a volcanic eruption occurs, you’ll want and need to listen for them. Know how to turn off all utilities. Obtain proper respiratory protection such as an air purifying respirator, also referred to as an N-95 disposable respirator. Review your homeowner’s insurance policy, and if necessary, increase your level of coverage to ensure you are covered adequately.

8,Governor Hochul Signs Legislation to Strengthen Public Safety,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-strengthen-public-safety,"Governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation S.6238A/A.5791A to clearly define the term “mass shooting” to assist emergency response measures and ensure communities have access to the emergency funding and resources needed in the aftermath of a mass shooting.

“Protecting the safety and well-being of all New Yorkers remains my top priority,"" Governor Hochul said. ""We have made significant progress to address the scourge of gun violence affecting our communities, making record-level investments and leading the nation in passing prevention measures. But when tragedies do occur, this legislation will help ensure our communities receive the emergency response and funding they need in the aftermath of a mass shooting.”

Based on an agreement with the Legislature, New York will define the term “mass shooting” consistently with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, meaning that a shooting incident will constitute a mass shooting if there are at least four people murdered with a firearm, shotgun, or rifle.

State Senator Zellnor Myrie said, “Too often, victims of mass shooting incidents in communities like ours aren't given the resources and support they need to heal and recover. This new law will clarify the definition of a mass shooting, to ensure an equitable and consistent response. I'm grateful to Governor Hochul and Assembly Member Monique Chandler-Waterman for making this new law a reality.”

Assemblymember Monique Chandler-Waterman said, “New York State took a significant step forward in responding to the horrific epidemic of gun violence in our state, by passing, and signing into law, “A.5791A.” I want to thank Governor Hochul, my Senate sponsor, Senator Zellnor Myrie, my colleagues in the New York State Legislature, and my grassroots community partners of AD 58 Public Safety Taskforce for their support and partnership in passing this legislation. As the co-chair of the Anti-Gun Violence Subcommittee of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian Legislative Caucus, I am committed to reducing gun violence and providing proper and timely care to the victims and families affected by this violence. This Bill is the commencement not the conclusion of our work to address gun violence. I look forward to building upon this legislation in the future to continue to bring the needed resources in our communities to address this epidemic of gun violence.”"
9,Governor Hochul Signs Legislation to Support Victims and Survivors of Crime,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-support-victims-and-survivors-crime,"Governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation S.214A/A.2105A to expand eligibility to victim compensation funds for victims and survivors of crime. The bill removes the requirement that victims provide documentation from law enforcement in order to be eligible for compensation and expands the window of time in which a victim can file a compensation claim.

“We’re making it easier for victims and survivors of crime to access the compensation available to them,” Governor Hochul said. “As victims recover, this legislation will support New Yorkers in their time of need and ensure that they can receive the benefits they deserve.”

Legislation S.214A/A.2105A expands eligibility for victims and survivors of crime to access victim compensation funds by removing the requirement that victims must report to law enforcement and provide corresponding documentation to be eligible to receive compensation. The legislation also allows victims to provide alternative forms of evidence that would show that a qualifying crime occurred.

State Senator Zellnor Myrie said, “I'm proud to have sponsored this legislation, which cuts the red tape for victims and survivors of crime and helps ensure they will get the resources to which they are entitled. When an act of violence does occur, victims and their families need our support- not red tape. I thank my partner Assembly Member Demond Meeks and Governor Hochul for standing with crime victims and survivors.”

Assemblymember Demond Meeks said, “Thank you, Governor Kathy Hochul, for ensuring that all survivors in our state receive fair access to victim compensation by signing the Fair Access to Victim Compensation Act into law. This legislation will remove the unjust barriers victims and survivors of crime face when trying to access meaningful resources and will expand access to the victim compensation funds survivors need to rebuild their lives after trauma. As the Assembly sponsor of this legislation, it has been a privilege to work alongside Senate sponsor Zellnor Myrie, advocates, and survivors to get this crucial piece of legislation across the finish line.”"
10,Governor Hochul to College and University Presidents: Calls for Genocide of Jewish People Violates New York State and Federal Law,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-college-and-university-presidents-calls-genocide-jewish-people-violates-new,"Governor Kathy Hochul i ssued a letter to the presidents of colleges and universities across the State of New York saying calls for genocide made on college campuses are a violation of New York State Human Rights Law as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This letter follows the Congressional Hearing on Antisemitism where several university presidents failed to clearly and unequivocally denounce antisemitism and calls for genocide on college campuses.

The Governor assured New York State will enforce violations of the State Human Rights Law and will refer violations of Title VI to federal officials. Calling for genocide would be considered a direct violation of the State University of New York and the City University of New York’s Code of Conduct, and Governor Hochul made clear that all colleges and universities in the state are expected to apply the same standard, and to have a clearly defined and well publicized mechanism for individuals to report complaints.

On December 8, Governor Hochul announced the letter at Shabbat Services at Temple Israel, the site of a gun incident and subsequent arrest earlier this week. The Governor also visited Temple Beth Emeth in Albany to share a message of solidarity and made clear that New York State has no tolerance for hate and violence on college campuses.

Following a surge in hate and bias incidents in the weeks following the October 7 Hamas terror attacks, Governor Hochul deployed all available New York State resources to protect New Yorkers in at-risk communities and on college campuses. The Governor also announced that Judge Jonathan Lippman will conduct an independent third-party review of the City University of New York’s policies and procedures related to antisemitism and discrimination, and produce recommendations for how all colleges can better protect the safety of their students.

The full text of Governor Hochul's letter is below:

To: New York State College and University Presidents

This week, like many Americans, I was shocked to see the presidents of several prominent universities – current leaders that are responsible for educating young minds who will grow into the leaders of tomorrow – fail to clearly and unequivocally denounce antisemitism and calls for genocide of the Jewish people on their college campuses.

I contacted SUNY Chancellor John King to ensure that it is SUNYs policy that calling for the genocide of any group of people on one of SUNY's 62 campuses would be considered a violation of the SUNY code of conduct, and would lead to swift disciplinary action. Chancellor King affirmed that was the case, and that SUNY will not tolerate antisemitism or hatred of any kind. CUNY Chancellor Felix Matos Rodriguez has confirmed the same to be true for CUNY schools.

In addition, failure to address such activity would constitute a violation of New York State Human Rights Law as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Under Title VI, any recipient of federal funds is responsible for keeping students free from a hostile environment based upon their ethnicity or national origin - a standard that that has been applied to antisemitism.

I write to you to ensure that your institution applies the same standard in its code of conduct, and has a clearly defined and well publicized mechanism for individuals to report complaints. As Governor of New York I want to reinforce that colleges and universities not in compliance with federal and state laws protecting students against discrimination can be deemed ineligible to receive state and federal funds.

I assure you that if any school in New York State is found to be in violation, I will activate the State's Division of Human Rights to take aggressive enforcement action and will refer possible Title VI violations to the federal government.

The moral lapses that were evidenced by the disgraceful answers to questions posed during this week’s congressional hearing cannot and will not be tolerated here in the state of New York.

I remain grateful for the work you do educating and protecting our students and your partnership in keeping hate and intimidation out of our campuses.

Sincerely,

Governor Kathy Hochul"
