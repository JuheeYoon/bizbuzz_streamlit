Blinken With Gayle King and Charles Barkley of CNN’s King Charles,https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-gayle-king-and-charles-barkley-of-cnns-king-charles/,"QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. We’re very glad that you’re on the program tonight. We’ve been looking forward to this conversation, haven’t we, Charles?

QUESTION: This is pretty special.

QUESTION: Yeah, we think it’s very special.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Great to be with both of you. Gayle, Charles, thanks for having me.

QUESTION: Yes. We feel that too. Let’s talk about the hostages, if we could. The talks have broken down, the war has resumed, and of course everybody’s concern worldwide is about the fate of the hostages. I realize it’s all hands on deck; all countries are working to secure their hostages, to get them home safely, to get all of the hostages home. But I’m wondering, is the Biden administration doing anything specifically to get the release of the American hostages, realizing we want all the hostages home?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Gayle, we’re at this every single day, and it’s my number one responsibility – I know the President feels this, his number one responsibility – to look out for any American who’s in harm’s way abroad, and especially those who are being held hostage, being held captive in some way. I’ve met with the families. I’ve heard directly from them, and that’s the thing that motivates me the most. We will not rest until we get every single one.

QUESTION: Yeah, it’s not enough – all the families. I always say this, Mr. Secretary, that for all these hostages, they’re numbers for some people, but for the family members they are somebody’s everything. So can you share with us —

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Absolutely.

QUESTION: — if you can, specifically what you guys are doing?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Look, you’ll understand I can’t get into the details because this is literally going on daily and even more than daily, sometimes even hourly, trying to find a way, an angle to get this – to get this restarted. And you’re exactly right: These are not – it’s not a question of numbers; these are real people, real lives, real families whose lives have been torn upside down. I’ve got photographs of all of them. It’s real for me, it’s real for the President, and we’re on this.

Unfortunately, Hamas gets the vote, and Hamas stopped releasing hostages. It reneged on its commitments to Israel and to everyone else concerned. They chose to end this process of releasing hostages. They need to choose to start it again.

QUESTION: You asked Israel to take precaution as far as civilians in Gaza. Is that actually possible?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Charles, I think it’s important to do two things. First, we’ve got to put this in perspective. What happened on October 7th is something I’ve never seen in the 30 years that I’ve been doing this professionally, and for that matter, the 50 years or so that I’ve been going to Israel in one way or another. Children executed in front of their parents. Parents executed in front of their children. Families burned alive. You heard yesterday about the horrific sexual violence, the rapes of so many young women. What was done deliberately, intentionally, with the brutality that really I’ve encountered almost nowhere else in the many years that I’ve been doing this.

So, and then you have this terrorist group, Hamas, do that, retreat to Gaza, and intentionally embed itself with civilians, with innocent men, women, and children – in and under apartment buildings, in and under hospitals, in and under mosques, in and under schools. So it’s very, very challenging for Israel to do what it needs to do to try to make sure that this never happens again, and getting at Hamas.

But having said that, and as we’ve said from day one, they nonetheless have an obligation to do everything possible to protect civilians, to distinguish between terrorists and innocent men, women, and children. And this is something that we’ve been on.

QUESTION: And that point doesn’t seem to be going so well, Mr. Secretary, about keeping the civilians safe, because the civilians are dying, including thousands of children. And I think that’s what’s so heartbreaking for everybody around the world. What happens —

SECRETARY BLINKEN: It’s gut-wrenching.

QUESTION: Yes. Yes.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: It’s gut-wrenching for all of us. But what we’re seeing now is we’re seeing some, I think, important steps being taken as they’re operating, they’re beginning to operate in the south of Gaza after operations in the north. And in the south, what we’re seeing – and I said to them very clearly when I was there just a week ago: We cannot have a repeat of what happened in the north in the south in terms of harm being done to civilians, and also making sure that humanitarian assistance is getting to people who need it, who are in desperate need of food, of water, of shelter.

So what we’re seeing is areas clearly designated by Israel that are safe areas where there’s not going to be firing, or the military. We’ve seen efforts to make sure that people know that they need to move and not in – not the entire city, but just discrete neighborhoods. So that’s positive. On the other hand, there’s more that has to happen, that needs to be done: making sure that people have safe corridors in order to get from areas that could be in danger to places where they’ll be safe; making sure that those areas where they’re going to have the proper resources, have the food, have the water, have the medicine to care for them while they’re in those areas. So there are a number of things that that need to happen. We’re on this with them every single day.

QUESTION: My son-in-law is an amazing man and a great husband. He’s also Jewish, and you’re Jewish. He’s taken this Israel thing very personally. And how are you feeling? How does it affect you? Because he’s struggling. How do – you as a Jewish man, how are you handling the entire situation mentally?

QUESTION: And the stepson of a Holocaust survivor too, which I think adds another layer of pain in this particular story.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, of course it’s affected me personally, and I’ve talked about that a little bit. It’s affected me personally because, yes, my late stepfather survived the Holocaust. He was in the concentration camps in Majdanek and Dachau and Auschwitz. And then my father’s father, in a different generation at the turn of the last century, got chased out of actually what’s now Ukraine by pogroms that were designed to kill or chase Jews away.

So when I saw what happened on October 7th, of course it had a personal resonance. It had a resonance that goes to the history of the Jewish people, especially by the nature, the savagery of the attacks that were committed. But having said that, I’m an American. I have the awesome responsibility and privilege of being Secretary of State and representing all of the American people around the world on behalf of the President. And as I’m doing my job to the best of my ability, I’m trying to make sure that I’m reflecting America’s interests, America’s values, and doing what’s right for our country.

QUESTION: How safe – how safe – two questions. How safe are Jewish students in college? And where is the line between hate speech and freedom of speech?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Charles, we’re seeing this every day play out on our campuses. And while I’m focused on the world beyond our borders, like anyone else, I’m reading, hearing about what’s happening on some campuses, talking to my own relatives who have kids who are college age who’ve been on the receiving end of this. And it’s deeply, deeply disturbing, and more, to see some of the hate that we’re hearing on college campuses, the expressions of vitriol, the intimidation of students just for being who they are, and that’s something that is not entirely new, but it’s sort of come out from beneath the rock since October 7th.

And by the way, I’m also deeply disturbed about the same kind of hatred and vitriol being directed against Muslim Americans, Arab Americans. We see this in all different directions. And we have to get back to a place where people on all of our campuses can feel safe being who they are, what they are, and saying what they believe.

QUESTION: I think you raise a really good point about feeling safe and being able to speak, because I know so many people are struggling with even how to have a – even how to have a conversation about this, Mr. Secretary. No matter what you say – no matter what you say or how you say it, you are immediately slammed by somebody. How can we have this conversation intelligently and respectfully with all these different points of view?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, look, my humble opinion is this. Here’s where it starts. It starts with stopping something, and what we need to stop is the dehumanization of the other. We have to recognize the humanity in each other. We have to try to put ourselves in other people’s shoes. We have to have that openness of mind and openness of heart. And when you have that, you can talk about anything – even the hardest things. But once you start dehumanizing, once you start seeing someone as another and somehow not human, that takes – that takes every guardrail, every check away. And then it’s open season.

QUESTION: Yeah. I always say – I always say that – I always say that it’s very hard to hate up close, just having —

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Exactly. Exactly.

QUESTION: I always say that.

QUESTION: What part do our politicians – have they played? Because clearly, if you watch television every day, the Democrats and Republicans, they’re not civil to each other. What part do you think they played in our – us losing our civility?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, one of the great things about this job, being Secretary of State, is I don’t do politics. (Laughter.) And I don’t want to start. But you know —

QUESTION: What do you mean you don’t – wait a second.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, President Biden —

QUESTION: Wait a second, Mr. Secretary. Your whole job is politics. What do you mean you don’t do politics? You have to explain.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Around the world, but not here at home.

QUESTION: Okay.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: But here’s the thing. What I’ve heard President Biden say for years – because I’ve had the immense privilege of working for him for more than 20 years, and he will – he’s constantly said over these years it’s totally appropriate to be questioning each other’s judgments, but let’s stop questioning each other’s motives. Let’s assume good motives, good intentions, and then we can really have a conversation and we can really try to get to someplace better. I think that’s what we need to do too.

QUESTION: Yeah. I like what you said about the conversations that you’ve had with President Biden about questioning people’s – you can have conversations; you don’t really need to question people’s motives.

But I would like to end with this. What’s your personal mantra that gets you through? Because I think I’m going to adopt whatever you’re having. What’s your personal mantra, Mr. Secretary? And then we’re going to let you go.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Oh, it’s funny because one of the – I had a chance the other night to meet Rob Reiner, the great director and actor, and one of – he made one of my favorite movies of all time, “This is Spinal Tap.” So this is probably the wrong thing to say. But I told him, actually, that movie has my mantra in it. One of the characters says at one point: “There’s such a fine line between clever and stupid.” I try to stay on the right side of that line every day.

QUESTION: Okay. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Hey, it’s been an honor.

QUESTION: Yes.

QUESTION: And thank you very much.

QUESTION: Yes. We are very grateful.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Great to be with you both.

QUESTION: We are very grateful. Thank you, sir.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks."

Since the outbreak of fighting on April 15, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have unleashed horrific violence, death, and destruction across Sudan. Civilians have borne the brunt of this needless conflict. Detainees have been abused and some killed at SAF and RSF detention sites. Across Sudan, the RSF and allied militias have terrorized women and girls through sexual violence, attacking them in their homes, kidnapping them from the streets, or targeting those trying to flee to safety across the border. In haunting echoes of the genocide that began almost 20 years ago in Darfur, we have seen an explosion of targeted violence against some of the same survivors’ communities. Masalit civilians have been hunted down and left for dead in the streets, their homes set on fire, and told that there is no place in Sudan for them.

Based on the State Department’s careful analysis of the law and available facts, I have determined that members of the SAF and the RSF have committed war crimes in Sudan. I have also determined that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.

The expansion of the needless conflict between RSF and the SAF has caused grievous human suffering. The SAF and the RSF must stop this conflict now, comply with their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, and hold accountable those responsible for atrocities. They also must adhere to the commitments they made to allow unhindered humanitarian assistance and implement confidence building measures that can lead to a sustainable cessation of hostilities. Arms and funding flowing to the warring parties only prolong a conflict that has no acceptable military solution."

This powerful drug trafficking organization transports and distributes illicit drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, into the United States

Synthetic drug trafficking presents a worldwide challenge to health and security, and it exacerbates the opioid epidemic in the United States. We continue to dismantle the transnational criminal organizations destabilizing North America, including by using our sanctions authorities to sever criminal entities’ ties to the international financial system.

The steps taken today are an integral component of President Biden’s strengthened, integrated approach to disrupting the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its precursors into the United States. Today’s actions also highlight the effectiveness of nations working together to disrupt illicit drug supply chains and underscore the need for continued international cooperation, such as through the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats, to dismantle illicit drug trafficking and save lives.

Today’s designations by the Department of the Treasury were taken pursuant to Executive Order 14059, which targets international proliferation of illicit drugs or their means of production. Among those designated today was Oscar Manuel Gastelum Iribe and Pedro Inzunza Noriega, who are part of BLO’s leadership. The State Department’s Narcotics Rewards Program complements the Department of the Treasury’s efforts to bring those involved in fentanyl trafficking to justice.

10,United States Department of State,https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-december-6-2023/,"1:39 p.m. EST

MR MILLER: Good afternoon, everyone. I will start with a few brief comments before moving to questions.

Today, the Secretary determined that members of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces have committed war crimes in Sudan. The Secretary also determined that members of the RSF and its allied militias have committed crimes against humanity as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against Darfur’s civilian population. Members of the RSF and allied militias have also committed ethnic cleansing.

The SAF and the RSF must end this brutal conflict. The warring parties must comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, international human rights law, and we call on them to protect civilians, hold accountable those responsible for atrocities and other abuses, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and negotiate an end to this conflict.

For too long, the belligerents have killed, raped, and attacked civilians with impunity in Sudan. The international community must work towards meaningful justice for victims and the affected communities and bring an end to this era of impunity. As we work with our African partners, the United States calls on all countries to support efforts to protect civilians in Sudan, prevent future atrocities, and promote accountability for those responsible for these horrific acts.

As we have repeatedly said since the outbreak of this conflict, the United States stands with the Sudanese people, who did not ask for this war, in support of their rightful demands for a transition to democracy and freedom, peace, and justice. We will use all the tools at our disposal to support these aims.

With that, Matt.

QUESTION: Okay. Just to clarify, though, this determination does not come with additional sanctions?

MR MILLER: Not today. As you are aware, we have imposed sanctions already on members of the RSF and entities owned by both of the factions, but no additional sanctions imposed today.

QUESTION: So – so what’s the impact of it?

MR MILLER: So I think two things. One, it is important to send a signal to the international community what in fact has happened here. We have documented repeated atrocities. We have documented members of the factions going in and just executing civilians in villages at point blank ranges. We’ve seen accounts of them going into schools and demanding to know where are the boys, where are the men, so they could execute them. We’ve seen systematic accounts of rapes. We think it’s important to point that out and call it what it is.

And then the second thing I would say is we have taken sanctions in the past and we are ready to impose additional measures if and when we have developed appropriate facts to support them.

QUESTION: Based on this determination today?

MR MILLER: I mean in general, we have imposed sanctions unrelated to this determination to – because we’ve seen —

QUESTION: No, no, I understand that, but —

MR MILLER: But no, not just based on this determination, but based on our work to hold accountable for their actions in this conflict.

QUESTION: All right. Okay. Other people might have more on this, but I want to go to the Middle East real quick. And I have one question, but it’s about three separate things. One is that the Israelis are continuing to talk about this idea of a buffer zone that they would like to create either in or potentially near Gaza. What is – can you clarify what the U.S. position is on that? Can you clarify what the U.S. position is on the idea of there being a quote/unquote “transition period,” during which Israel would retain or would keep security control of Gaza after the conflict is over, if the conflict ever is over? And then lastly, what is the U.S. position on the idea of a international security or peacekeeping force that might be deployed, that some have called for to be deployed?

MR MILLER: Yeah, let me take them in order. So with respect to the first one, the Secretary made very clear in a speech he gave several weeks ago in Tokyo, where he laid out the principles that the United States supports when it comes to the end of this conflict in Gaza. One of those principles was that there must be no reduction in the size of Gaza, and that remains our position and it will remain our position. So if any proposed buffer zone was inside Gaza, that would be a violation of that principle, and it’s something that we oppose. With – if it’s with respect to something in Israeli territory, I won’t speak to that. That’s a decision for the Israelis to make, but we are very clear that when it comes to reduction in the size of Gaza, that is not something the United States supports.

With respect to the second – I remember the third. What’s – what was the – remind me what the second —

QUESTION: The second one was the transition.

MR MILLER: The second one was transition. With respect to a transition period, look, we understand that there will have to be some kind of transition period after the end of major combat operations. I don’t think it would be in anyone’s interests – not Israel’s interest, it wouldn’t be in the Palestinian people’s interest – for at the end of major combat operations for Israel to just leave and leave a security vacuum in place where there could be rampant lawlessness inside Gaza and innocent civilians exploited. So we understand there will need to be some transition period at the end of combat operations. I – I am not at this point able to define while the conflict’s ongoing how long that would take or when it would end. I think it’s too early to prescribe any parameters for that.

And then with respect to —

QUESTION: But, but, but, but wait – but it would have to be temporary for you to be okay with it?

MR MILLER: Yes. Yes, because one of the positions we have also made clear is that there can no – be no reoccupation of Gaza.

QUESTION: And then the last —

MR MILLER: And then with respect to the third, the international security force, these are the types of conversations we are engaging in with our allies and with our partners in the region. I think it is too early to definitively prescribe any solution, but we are focused on what the post-conflict environment needs to look at in Gaza, and that obviously includes security for the Palestinian people of Gaza.

QUESTION: Thank you.

MR MILLER: Yeah. Said.

QUESTION: On this issue, can – I mean, there is a great many rumors and so on that talks about incentivizing Egypt to take, like, hundreds of thousands and so on. So you repudiate that completely? That is not – that is not something that has been discussed? As it was allegedly discussed on Capitol Hill.

MR MILLER: So I am not going to respond to rumors, and I don’t know – I don’t know what you’re referring to with respect to Capitol Hill. But it doesn’t actually really matter, but I will reiterate the principles that the Secretary outlined, and one of them is no forced displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza.

QUESTION: Okay. A couple of other issues. There was a report that Israel’s assault forced a nurse to leave babies behind; they were found decomposing. Are you aware of this story?

MR MILLER: I am aware of that report, Said.

QUESTION: Okay. And do you take it as it happened, or if it did happen, is that a war crime?

MR MILLER: Said, I would say that is a tragedy.

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: It’s a tragedy for those babies.

QUESTION: Right.

MR MILLER: It’s a tragedy for their family members. It’s a tragedy for the Palestinian people, and it is a tragedy for the world.

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: And it is why we have made clear that far too many Palestinians have been killed in this conflict, and that of course includes far too many Palestinian children, and of course Palestinian babies. And it is why we have taken every measure we could to speak loudly and clearly to the Government of Israel that it needs to do everything it can to minimize civilian harm, and it’s why we have worked to try and move humanitarian assistance in. And it is also why, I will say, we have said that Hamas should stop hiding its fighters in hospitals. So —

QUESTION: I understand. I’m speaking about this particular incident. If it happened –

MR MILLER: No, I just – I – it gets to the very difficult nature of this war and the immense human tragedy that has been inflicted on far too many people.

QUESTION: Right. But if it happened, it’s not a war crime, or is it a war crime?

MR MILLER: Said, I am never going to be able to make an assessment here. You saw us today make a conclusion about war crimes after a very deliberate fact-finding process where we then apply the fact to the law. It’s not something I can do responding to a report from —

QUESTION: So will the U.S. do a fact-finding —

MR MILLER: Said, just – just please let me finish my answers before you interrupt. I will take all of your questions.

QUESTION: Sure.

MR MILLER: It is not something I can do responding to a report from the podium.

QUESTION: Okay, I understand. But would the U.S. consider sending a fact-finding mission, like that you did?

MR MILLER: We are in the middle of a conflict right now, an ongoing conflict. We monitor all of these reports. But it’s – I’m not going to speak to what actions we might take when we’re still in the middle of major combat operations.

QUESTION: And lastly, last – and my last question: On Monday, when I asked you about where should the Palestinians go, and you said there are designated UN centers to go to. Well, apparently the spokesperson for the United Nations, Stephane Dujarric, whom you know, repudiated that yesterday, or refuted that. He said, “Let’s be clear. There are no UN-designated safe zones in Gaza. I think all my senior colleagues have been very clear, including the secretary-general, saying there are no safe places in Gaza. There are shelters that fly the UN flag that are sheltering thousands and thousands and thousands of people – men, women, and children who are trying to stay alive and get some food, get some water. We have seen since the beginning of this conflict that those places that fly the UN flag” have been – “[have not been] safe either.” Your comment on that?

MR MILLER: So I will say first of all, I did not say that there were safe zones. That is a very different concept.

QUESTION: But you said there were safe —

MR MILLER: Said, Said, again, can we just establish a ground rule that –

QUESTION: Absolutely.

MR MILLER: — I won’t interrupt you, and you won’t interrupt me.

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: I did not say that there were safe zones. That is a different concept. We have seen earlier in this conflict the idea of safe zones, and what instead we have moved to and what we have supported are areas that are deconfliction sites, and there are sites that are UN-flagged facilities that Israel is aware where those sites are, Israel has placed them on deconfliction lists, and Israel is not supposed to target those sites. That is what I was referring to. We continue to support people moving to those sites where they can be safe from harm. But again, we recognize the very difficult situation on the ground and the very difficult choices that many Palestinian civilians are having to make every day.

QUESTION: Just to follow up on that.

MR MILLER: Yeah.

QUESTION: You’re making a distinction between a safe zone and an area – a deconfliction —

MR MILLER: So just to be very clear, so there has been ideas at one point of safe zones, entire areas – there’s this area over near the beach – an entire area that looks more like a refugee camp that people could – people could —

QUESTION: So you’re talking basically size, then.

MR MILLER: I’m talking about – it’s not just size or – instead of, like, designated – it’s neighborhoods where the – Israel is not conducting operations, right. You have seen them flag areas where they intend to conduct major combat operations, told people to leave those areas, go to other areas where they are not currently conducting operations. In addition to that, there are facilities – schools and other places, UN sites, UNRWA sites – where people are taking shelter. And those sites are on deconfliction lists and are not supposed to be struck by the Israeli army. That’s what I was referring to.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: Matt, the UN secretary-general made a really rare move today to formally warn the Security Council of the global threat from the Gaza war, invoking this Article 99. He himself has done it for the first time. I’m wondering if the United States agreed with his warning that this is a threat for the entire, like, global system.

MR MILLER: So we just saw the letter; it just – the letter came just a little while before I came out here. I won’t have any – I don’t have any specific reaction to the letter yet. We will continue to consult with the Secretary-General and other members of the UN Security Council on this matter, as we have in the past. But I will say of course there are threats to regional security and threats to global security that are presented by this conflict. We said that in the very aftermath of October 7th when we made quite clear that one of the things we are trying to do is prevent this conflict from spreading. That continues to be one of our top priorities and continues to be something the Secretary and the President and other members of the administration are focused on.

QUESTION: And we understand that our states basically seek to leverage that to renew a push for the council to call for a ceasefire. We do know U.S. position on the ceasefire, but I just want to ask you again whether there is any change on that if they go for a resolution calling for that.

MR MILLER: So I will not speak to any resolution that hasn’t yet been introduced because we’d obviously want to look at the text of that and engage in consultations before we made a decision about how we might exercise our vote in the Security Council. I will say with regard to a ceasefire, we have made clear that we do not support actions that would leave Hamas in a place where it could continue to carry out terrorist attacks against Israel.

We’ve also been clear that we support humanitarian pauses, especially if those humanitarian pauses can allow hostages to come out. The seven-day pause was incredibly successful with getting hostages out, with getting increased levels of aid in. And most importantly – or I shouldn’t say most importantly, but equally importantly, allowing civilians in Gaza to move out of harm’s way and move from one area to another. And we think those – we think pauses are important and pauses should continue, and we would support further pauses.

QUESTION: Right. A couple of more. So you said yesterday you guys have been in touch with the Israeli Government to allow more aid in, to allow more fuel. But I mean, when we look at what’s happening today, it looks like the public order is completely breaking down. There is like full chaos and UN is warning that its operation is in no shape to be able to deliver this aid to the people. So do you guys have like a solution for that, or how are you trying to overcome that? Is that something that you’re discussing with the Israeli Government?

MR MILLER: We are discussing it with the United Nations agencies on the ground. We’re discussing it with the Government of Israel. It is the focus of Ambassador Satterfield’s work. I can tell you we’ve – I talk to him all the time and hear the incredible amount of focus he’s put on trying to improve the situation on the ground, and that it’s the same thing that you see the Secretary and other members of the administration engaging in.

So it is something we’re focused on, and it – and I will say, when I say focused on, it’s not just on getting the – increasing the amount of aid that comes in, but improving the ability of aid workers inside Gaza to then deliver that aid to the people who need it most.

QUESTION: Just one more, sorry.

MR MILLER: Yeah.

QUESTION: I saw that there’s reporting about Kerem Shalom opening. Just want to give you an opportunity to clarify that. Is the United States pushing Israel to get Kerem Shalom opening for the trucks or for inspections? Like can you give us the latest on it?

MR MILLER: So we continue to think that Kerem Shalom would be a good facility to use for increased inspections of trucks. I’ve said in the past that Israel has had security concerns about that. We’ve been trying to work through those security concerns with Israel. I don’t want to get too much into the specifics of those conversations, but all of these issues you raise are things that we are talking about them with directly – or talking about with them directly.

QUESTION: Thank you.

QUESTION: Matt, Amnesty International put out an investigation saying that U.S.-made weapons were used by Israel in strikes that killed nearly four dozen civilians. Do you have a comment on this investigation?

MR MILLER: So we are reviewing that report. As the President and Secretary have said on multiple occasions, it is a tragedy any time a civilian is killed. We have made clear in our discussions with Israeli leaders that we are deeply concerns about the protection of civilians in this conflict. We expect Israel to only target legitimate targets and to adhere to the laws of armed conflict; that includes taking measures to reduce the risk of harm to civilians. I’ve talked before about the very real challenges that Israel faces because Hamas uses humans – civilians as human shields.

So I would say we will continue to engage with the Israeli Government on all those things. And of course the Israeli Government has a professional military, and so when they get these types of reports, they should do what our military should do, which is investigate them. That’s something every military should do, and we would expect them to do so as well.

QUESTION: Have they given you any commitment to investigate?

MR MILLER: I’m not aware of any conversations we’ve had. It doesn’t mean they haven’t gone on, but I’m just not aware of them.

QUESTION: And is the U.S. undertaking its own investigation or inquiry into whether U.S.-made weapons have been used in a disproportionate way?

MR MILLER: So we continue to monitor everything that happens with regard to this conflict, but again, I’m not going to speak to any internal deliberations.

QUESTION: And then can I get your assessment – I mean, we’re several days into the renewed offensive in southern Gaza, and the Secretary said last week that it cannot be prosecuted in the same way it was in the north. Do you feel that the Israelis are fulfilling this?

MR MILLER: So again, I think we are still at an early stage of this part of the conflict, this part of the conflict in southern Gaza. You heard the Secretary say that too many Palestinian civilians have been killed. That remains the case: too many Palestinian civilians have been killed, too many Palestinians have been killed – or I should say too many Palestinian civilians continue to be killed. We want to see the civilian death toll lower than it has been. We want to see the civilian death toll lower than it is today, lower than it has been the past few days.

Again, this is – a good component of this is the problem presented by Hamas embedding in civilian sites in Kha Yunis just as it did in Gaza City, but that doesn’t lesson the burden that’s on Israel to do everything it can to reduce civilian harm. So we had some very frank conversations with the Government of Israel about that when we were there last week. We continue to have very frank discussions with them about this question, and I think I’ll leave it at that.

Yeah, go ahead.

QUESTION: Yesterday, Matt, I had asked you about if State was aware of any reports or emerging evidence of Americans being sexually assaulted by Hamas on October 7th, as there are claims that multiple — many Israeli women were. You said you weren’t aware of reports. Can you say anything about – we heard from the attorney general a few minutes ago that they’re now investigating Hamas war crimes. Do you know if that will include like this – looking at potential sexual crimes as well or is State still following that?

MR MILLER: I think I should defer to the Department of Justice to speak to its investigations and what they may or may not include.

QUESTION: I know that you don’t comment on university campus-level goings on, but yesterday a group of Ivy League presidents on Capitol Hill in sworn testimony declined to condemn calls by their own students for the killing of Jews. I’m wondering if, more broadly speaking, outside of college campuses and universities if the State Department has a position on calling for the murder of Jews. Is that something that the department considers antisemitic?

MR MILLER: Yeah, absolutely. You’re right. When it comes to matters inside the United States, there are many agencies inside this government that would comment on it, but that is not the remit of the State Department. But obviously, calling for the murder of Jews is antisemitic. It’s horrific. We have a special envoy here dedicated to combatting antisemitism around the world. In addition, you’ve seen the Secretary speak about this and call it out, as I have from this podium, and we will continue to do that.

QUESTION: But you would oppose the calling of the murder of anyone, right?

MR MILLER: Absolutely.

QUESTION: Not just Jews?

MR MILLER: Yeah – yes.

QUESTION: I mean —

MR MILLER: Quite obviously. Yes.

QUESTION: One last question, if I may. Quite a few localized menorah lighting celebrations ahead of the start of Hanukkah tomorrow have been cancelled by local officials, citing threats from pro-Palestinian protestors that are scheduled for the area. Now, in California, Gavin Newsom has cancelled a – some kind of a Christmas tree lighting ceremony as well. I’m wondering if the State Department has concerns about the impact of the war in Gaza and the political fallings out on religious freedom for Americans ahead of the holidays.

MR MILLER: So let me just say that when it comes to the specific incidents you cite, I think I will defer to the Department of Homeland Security, maybe to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for comment on those as those are obviously local matters inside the United States. But I will say that generally we have seen a rise in antisemitism around the world since October 7th. We have seen a rise in Islamophobia around the world since October 7th. And we will continue to do everything in power to call those – call that out when we see it, to make clear it is objectionable, and to align our policies to fight it wherever we can.

QUESTION: Thanks.

MR MILLER: Leon, go ahead.

QUESTION: If I may come back to Sudan, I have a hard time – you’ve taken months to determine – to make the determination that there were war crimes and even crimes against humanity regarding the FSR forces. And you come out and give the statement and all that, but you don’t announce any sanctions. And you haven’t – the sanctions that have been in place have not hit the highest level. So I have a hard time understanding how at the same time you come out, make the determination, and don’t come with something more forceful in terms of sanctions. And then aside from that, just if you know, are there any – as of now, are there any ongoing talks? There were – the general talks, but that was months ago or what have you. Is there anything ongoing in terms of U.S. involvement with the two parties?

MR MILLER: So I will say we have imposed sanctions in the past, and just because we are not announcing sanctions today does not mean we will not impose additional measures in the future. I will also say I think it’s important that the United States speak with moral clarity about what we see happening and what we can document, and that’s what we’ve done here. We think there’s real value in that, and we’ll continue to do it.

And then I’ll say with respect to the talks, the talks in Jeddah broke down because both parties, the SAF and RSF, repeatedly refused to adhere to the commitments that they made at those talks. So what we will do is continue to work with our partners in the region to make clear that there is no – there can be no military solution to this conflict, to make clear that civilians continue to suffer multiple atrocities, and to try to continue to work with our partners in the region to bring an end to the conflict. But ultimately, that takes the two parties coming to the table, and not just coming to the table, but adhering to the commitments that they make. And so far, that they have been simply unwilling to do that.

QUESTION: So right now there are no talks whatsoever?

MR MILLER: There are no talks whatsoever, but we would always support talks that would lead to an actual breakthrough, and, as I said, the parties adhering to the commitments that they make.

Michel.

QUESTION: Yeah, Israeli defense minister has said that today two mayors and heads of councils located in the border with Lebanon, that they’re communities will not be returned home until Hizballah is driven north of the Litani River. He added that the best option for Israel is to reach a diplomatic solution or arrangement. If it doesn’t succeed, Israel will act with all the means at its disposal to push Hizballah by military actions. What’s your comment, and do you support such a move?

MR MILLER: So I will say that one of the things that we have made clear from the beginning is that we don’t want to see this conflict expand, and that includes expanding to the north of Israel. We do not want to see increased military activity between Israel and Hizballah in northern Israel. There continues to be a very real problem, a security problem, faced by the Israeli people in that you have Israelis from southern Israel who live near Gaza who don’t feel safe because of ongoing rocket attacks, not – never mind the events of October 7th, but the ongoing rocket attacks into their communities. And so they have relocated to elsewhere in Israel. You have people from northern Israel who don’t feel safe to return from their – to their communities because of the attacks that have happened, that have been ongoing by Hizballah across the border.

So it is a very real security problem that the Israeli public and the Israeli Government faces. We want to see a diplomatic solution, as we have said, and we would oppose any widening of the conflict and urge Israel not to widen the conflict.

QUESTION: What’s the diplomatic solution, in your view?

MR MILLER: Again, we’ll continue to pursue diplomacy. We have, I will say, been pretty consistent – and you’ve seen the Secretary focus on this in his travels around the region in trying to keep the conflict from expanding from, as I said, in northern Israel, in the West Bank, to involve other countries. I don’t want to get into all the details, but that will continue to be the focus of our efforts.

QUESTION: And do you support change – changing rules of the UN Security Council 1701?

MR MILLER: I do not have any new announcements about new Security Council resolutions or changes to announce today.

Shannon, go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you. There’s a lawsuit filed in federal court alleging that the State Department has treated Israeli Americans and Palestinian Americans inequitably when it comes to evacuations from around the conflict zone. Do you have a response to that broad statement, that brought claim?

MR MILLER: I’ve seen the lawsuit, but, as always with ongoing litigation, I’m going to refer to the Department of Justice for comment.

QUESTION: And is it still the case that the State Department’s aware of more than 1,000 individuals, and including around 350 American citizens, who are still waiting to evacuate from Gaza? And is it doing anything to speed up that kind of trickling pace?

MR MILLER: So we have seen a number of American citizens and their family members and legal permanent residents coming out in the past few days. We now have gotten over 1,100 American citizens and family members out through Rafah, and we continue to work with the Government of Israel, with the Government of Egypt to try to get more Americans out. We have a number of Americans who were on the list who are cleared to leave who have not yet left. We’ll continue to try to get them out.

And with respect to the numbers that remain, it is a little under a thousand that remain, with about 350, 370 of them being American citizens. But I will note that that number fluctuates. You’ve seen times where, despite us getting more people out, the number goes – the number of remaining goes up because there are Americans who are in Gaza who identify other family members that want to come with them.

QUESTION: But any efforts to speed that up through specific talks?

MR MILLER: Yeah, we continue to work – it continues to be something that we are focused on and trying to get. There’s obviously a difficulty of people moving around Gaza right now, so you have not just the problem of getting people onto the list so they’re cleared for departure – there’s only so many people that can go out through Rafah every day – but also people actually being able to make it to Rafah to get out. And that is why we focus on the humanitarian efforts I was talking about earlier in the briefing.

QUESTION: And just finally, has the State Department confirmed any deaths of American citizens in Gaza, or is it investigating any reports of deaths at this point?

MR MILLER: We are still investigating the one report that I’ve mentioned on previous days, but we have not yet confirmed whether that death actually happened or whether the person was an American citizen.

QUESTION: Thank you.

QUESTION: Matt?

QUESTION: Matt?

MR MILLER: Go ahead.

QUESTION: I have a question about the post-war Gaza option. Both the Secretary and yourself have mentioned a revitalized Palestinian Authority. What’s expected of the PA in that context? Could you explain what they’re supposed to —

MR MILLER: There are a number of additional measures that we think the Palestinian Authority could take in terms of cracking down on corruption, in terms of increased engagement with civil society. We had a very open discussion with this – or I should say the Secretary had a very open discussion about this with President Abbas when he was in the West Bank next week. And in addition to that, revitalizing and increasing the capability of the PA’s security forces – if you envision in the post-conflict environment, as we do, a Gaza and West Bank that are united under Palestinian Authority leadership, you would need to see an increase in the capability of the PA’s security forces. So it’s those types of reforms and increases in capabilities that we have in mind.

QUESTION: Okay. I have a question on Iran as well if there’s no other questions —

MR MILLER: Go ahead and I’ll – people can still —

QUESTION: Okay, thank you.

MR MILLER: We can come back. It’s not a – it’s not a hard turn. We don’t —

QUESTION: In response to a class action suit in Iran, with regards to the elimination of the former Quds commander, Qasem Soleimani, a court has decided that the U.S. should pay $5 billion. Any comments on that?

MR MILLER: Yeah, I – we don’t have any reason to believe these are legitimate proceedings. The Iranian judicial system is widely regarded to be lacking any independence from the Iranian regime. So I don’t have any comment on this specific verdict. We obviously don’t have any people participating in judicial proceedings inside Iran, but the United States will continue to do everything that’s necessary to protect our people and our interests.

QUESTION: Matt?

QUESTION: Staying on Iran, Matthew? Iran?

MR MILLER: Yeah, go – go ahead. I’ll come back to you, Janne. Go ahead.

QUESTION: Yeah, thank you. Do you have anything to say on the Secretary’s meeting with the members of Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Friday? What does the Secretary hope from – expect from the meeting, and what message he has, especially in response to their call for a ceasefire?

MR MILLER: So I don’t want to telegraph too much about that meeting two days before it happens, but obviously these are counterparts with which he has had a number of engagements since October 7th. You’ve seen him in – both in his trips to the region and at a meeting in New York engage with counterparts in the region, as well as a number of phone calls that we’ve read out the specifics of over the past two months.

So he will continue to engage with them about what we can do to get increased humanitarian assistance in. He’ll continue to engage with them about how we can get hostages out. He will, of course, want to talk about the end of the conflict and lay out the principles that he laid out in Tokyo, as he did in a meeting he had in Dubai, and continue to talk with them about how we can move forward, prevent this conflict from widening, and ultimately find a solution in the long term that leads to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

QUESTION: Matt?

QUESTION: Yeah, thank you. Going back to the Iran – Iranian sanctions. Russia and Iran signed a declaration to counter the Western and also the U.S. sanctions. Does that declaration concerns you? Do you believe that this would have an impact on your sanctions on both countries when we are talking about both conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine?

MR MILLER: So I will say we have long seen both Russia and Iran attempt to evade our sanctions, which is why we – you see us, with respect to both countries, at times announce both new sanctions and measures that we take to crack down on sanctions evasion.

QUESTION: And today Iranian IRGC announced that they seized two vessels with 34 foreign crew members in the Persian Gulf. Do you have any reaction and comments on that? And do you think that —

MR MILLER: That they – I’m sorry, that they what?

QUESTION: That the Iranian IRGC, Revolutionary Guard Corps, they announced today they seized two vessels with 34 —

QUESTION: Seized.

MR MILLER: Seized, got it.

QUESTION: — foreign crew members. Then do you have any comment and reaction to that? And do you think that the Iranian taking advantage of the situation in the Middle East?

MR MILLER: So we have seen them – I don’t have any specific reaction to that report, but we have seen them continue to try to take advantage of instability and try to foment additional instability, which is why we have been quite clear with the Iranian Government that they shouldn’t do anything to add to instability in the region. It’s why we’ve been quite clear with our partners in the region, anyone that can get messages to Iran, that they should deliver that message very clearly, and why you’ve seen us take steps to protect our interests in the region.

QUESTION: If I may ask the last question, going back to a very old question in this room, are you still looking to get – to go back to the JCPOA through diplomatic with Iran, or can you call the JCPOA a dead deal now?

MR MILLER: I certainly don’t see that on the table.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: Matt?

MR MILLER: Janne, go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Matt. Two questions on Russia, North Korea, and South Korea. It was reported that North Korea transshipped 10,000 containers to Russia yesterday. And why can’t United States stop North Korea’s weapons from continuing to be supplied to Russia?

MR MILLER: So we will – we have made clear that we oppose the transfer of additional weapons from North Korea to Russia and oppose the transfer of weapons from Russia to North Korea. We have imposed sanctions on both of these countries, of course. When it comes to Russia supplying North Korea – not the issue you asked about but the reverse side of this trade – we’ve made clear that it violates multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, and we will continue to take actions to hold both of those countries accountable.

QUESTION: Follow-up, one more question. And Russian President Putin wanted to restore relations with South Korea and saying it depends entirely on South Korea. Do you think this is Putin’s strategy to create a rift in U.S. and South Korea relations or other —

MR MILLER: I don’t think I have any —

QUESTION: Do you have any —

MR MILLER: I just don’t think I have any comment on that.

Alex, go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt. Can you speak to the Secretary’s level of alarm following yesterday’s interactions on the Hill? There are reports that some senators left the briefing. And I’m also asking because the Secretary just noted in his statement that today’s package will – will, he mentioned – be one of the last security assistance packages we can provide to Ukraine without congressional approval. Can you unpack it, please, for us?

MR MILLER: I think the Secretary found it to be a frank and candid exchange of views on the Hill, mostly between members of the Senate, not involving the administration. But as we made clear in the statement we issued today about the drawdown package, we have nearly exhausted the available security assistance that is available to Ukraine. It is urgent that Congress act to support Ukraine; it is urgent that Congress act to support democracy. The President spoke to this today. We continue to watch the actions on Capitol Hill. We continue to watch the negotiations over things that are unrelated to support for Ukraine. You saw the President speak to this today and talk about how – the plan that he has laid out with respect to border security. It’s not an issue that the State Department deals with.

I will just say for – from our perspective, it is an urgent priority to stand with Ukraine, especially as we enter this difficult winter when we know we will see increased Russian attacks.

QUESTION: For those of us who cover this – U.S. foreign policy for foreign audience who don’t necessarily follow U.S. domestic policy, are we in this still zone of your normal sausage-making process, or things are out of control?

MR MILLER: I just don’t think I want to play pundit from this podium. That’s for other people to do.

QUESTION: And then I have some on Azerbaijan, if you don’t mind.

MR MILLER: Go ahead. Go ahead.

QUESTION: The following two days’ meetings, do you have anything for me? What’s your level of concerns about the relationship? Assistant secretary posted that he shared ideas for deepening bilateral cooperation and supporting peace, stability, prosperity in the region. I mean, that one sentence is doing a great deal of heavy lifting.

MR MILLER: I haven’t spoken to Assistant Secretary O’Brien since the conclusion of that meeting or had a detailed readout of it, so I don’t have anything to add.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you.

QUESTION: Thank you. One question about the Abraham Accord and the normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Do you think or the State Department thinks that that diplomatic relationship is almost dead, there is no any possibility that Saudi Arabia normalizes its relationship with Israel? Or there is a possibility? My first question. Then if you allow me, I will ask —

MR MILLER: Go ahead and ask the second one. I’ve got to remember them both.

QUESTION: The second one is that there are some reports and concerns that since the war broke between Israel and Hamas is some terrorist groups that belong to al-Qaida and some other groups moved out to some safe place that they think it’s safe, like Afghanistan, to launch potentially some attacks against the U.S. interest in the region. So I just wanted to —

MR MILLER: So these are reports that people moved from where?

QUESTION: So from the Arab countries.

MR MILLER: Oh, from the Arab —

QUESTION: Yes.

MR MILLER: So I don’t have any specific comment on that. Obviously, we take any threats to our forces very seriously. We take any threats to our interests very seriously, and we’ll take whatever steps we need to protect our forces overseas and our interests. With respect to your first question, which I then forgot, remind me what it —

QUESTION: Yeah, it was the relationship between Saudi Arabia and —

MR MILLER: Oh yeah, Saudi —

QUESTION: Yes, yes.

MR MILLER: Yeah, of course, the normalization question. So look, we have made quite clear that we think further integration between Israel and its neighbors is in the long-term security interests of the region. It’s in the long-term economic interest of the region. It’s in the – it would further peace and stability. But it’s also no substitute for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

So at the end of this conflict, you are going to see the United States focus – and we’ve already started conversations about this – not just on what the post-conflict period looks like, but trying to get on a path to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and hopefully along with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state would come further integration between Israel and its neighbors. We think those are both very important things that would be good for countries in the region and good for the entire world.

Let me go to someone in the back. New —

QUESTION: On Saudi Arabia, Matt.

MR MILLER: Let me – I’ll come to you next. Go ahead, Michel.

QUESTION: Do you have any comment on President Putin’s visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE?

MR MILLER: I don’t.

Go ahead, in the back.

QUESTION: Thanks a lot. I know that the strategic dialogue between United States and Belarusian democratic movement started today, so my question will be about Belarus. Yesterday, U.S. put some new sanctions on Lukashenka’s – so-called President Lukashenka’s wallet. So how do you estimate their effectiveness? And how do you think if this sanction pressure can help to release political prisoners? Because we have something around or close to 1,500 political prisoners nowadays.

MR MILLER: So first of all, we were quite – we were pleased to host the first strategic dialogue between the United States and the Belarusian democratic movement, and welcomed the Belarusian democratic movement leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya to the State Department.

With respect to sanctions, the – yesterday, as you referenced, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on 19 individuals and entities that generate revenue to support the Lukashenka regime that operate in the Belarusian military sector and facilitate Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. This action is yet – is the most recent step in our efforts to promote accountability for the Lukashenka regime’s abuses in Belarus and around the world, and our message to Lukashenka and to those carrying out his repressions has been clear and consistent. We are willing to talk about changing our policies, easing sanctions, and improving our relations when the regime releases all of its political prisoners, stops its repression of the Belarusian people, and ends its complicity in Russia’s war against Ukraine.

Go ahead over here, and then we’re going to wrap up.

QUESTION: Thank you very much, Matt. Thank you very much, Matt. Former prime minister of Pakistan appeared in the court after many months for the first time; he interacted with the media as well. And in his court hearing, he said that during his trial, he is going to summon the U.S. official to testify as well with regard to his cipher. Will the U.S. be willing to send an official there, or no?

MR MILLER: I had a feeling this question would be about the cipher. As always, not in a position to comment on ongoing litigation. As we have consistently stated, we call for the respect of democratic principles in Pakistan and around the world. We are following the cases brought against the former prime minister, but we have no comment on the charges against him.

QUESTION: Just one more, Matt. Matt —

MR MILLER: No, let me go to Humeyra, and then we’ll wrap up.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR MILLER: Oh, sorry. I thought you had a follow-up question.

QUESTION: No, I do. I do.

MR MILLER: No, go ahead.

QUESTION: Okay. I just wanted to put a fine point to some of my previous questions and questions from my colleagues. Just looking at what the Secretary has discussed in Israel last week, and looking at the situation inside Gaza today, he had asked Israelis for specific actions, and we talked about deconfliction zones and all of that. There are a lot of people who say nowhere isn’t safe in Gaza. Does the United States believe there is anywhere safe in Gaza?

MR MILLER: There are areas in Gaza that are designated as places that are safe for Palestinian civilians. As I mentioned before, UN sites, sites where people can go —

QUESTION: Right.

MR MILLER: — that should not be struck, and we do not – we expect that the Israeli Government will respect those deconfliction zones and not strike them.

QUESTION: Okay. But that sounds a lot like difference between the intent and the results that the Secretary has mentioned, right? Like, those are the plans, but the result right now does not seem to be matching the intent. So I’m wondering if there has been any high-level intervention from this building to the Israeli Government since we left the region on these issues, and what was communicated, and whether Ambassador Satterfield or you guys have a specific plan to remedy this urgently.

MR MILLER: So we continue to engage in conversations with the Israeli Government in this building, at the White House. Those conversations did not stop when we left the region; they have continued since we left. As the Secretary made clear, too many Palestinian civilians have died in this conflict. Too many Palestinian civilians continue to die, and we will continue to have very direct conversations with the Israeli Government about steps they can and should take to further minimize civilian harm.

QUESTION: And my final one on this, because just a few minutes ago, when you were answering one of our questions, you said we’re still at an early stage of this part of the conflict. It sounds like you do know what’s the next part of the conflict.

MR MILLER: No. I was —

QUESTION: So, I mean —

MR MILLER: When it comes to stages, I was referring to the previous stage; this stage, as opposed to the stage in northern Gaza.

QUESTION: Right.

MR MILLER: Not at all predicting what the next stage of the military campaign ought to look like.

QUESTION: And you still maintain that it is early to make a final assessment or an interim assessment, like Matt asked yesterday?

MR MILLER: I do. As I said, we’re still days into this conflict. But as I said, too many Palestinian civilians continue to die.

With that, we’ll wrap for today.

QUESTION: Thank you.

QUESTION: Thank you.

Before closed-door discussions began, Austin publicly reiterated U.S. support for Ukraine.""As I said in Kyiv, the United States stands with Ukraine as you fight back against the Kremlin's aggression and cruelty,"" Austin said. ""Ukraine has taken back more than half the territory grabbed by Russia since its unprovoked invasion began in February 2022. So we will stand with Ukraine for the long haul. I'm confident that our allies and partners will be there as well.""Today's bilateral discussion built on conversations that occurred last month in Kyiv, and included Ukraine's strategic goals for the coming year and a long-term vision for a future force.""To support Ukraine's immediate needs, I am announcing our 52nd drawdown of equipment and services from U.S. stocks,"" Austin said. ""The package includes additional munitions for your defense — artillery and tank weapons, and small arms munitions.""This most recent security assistance package, worth $175 million, includes, among other things, AIM-9M and AIM-7 missiles for air defense, ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, 155 mm and 105 mm artillery rounds and High-speed Anti-radiation missiles, also known as HARMs. The United States has committed more than $44.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Austin also discussed the significance of the Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference. The two-day conference, co-hosted by the White House, Commerce and Defense Departments, brings together U.S. and Ukrainian industry and government representatives to discuss ideas that could bolster Ukraine's defense industrial base.""We discussed ways to strengthen partnerships among Ukraine and the U.S. defense industry,"" Austin said. ""This just underscores America's commitment to a free and sovereign Ukraine — one that can defend itself today and deter further Russian aggression in the future.""Umerov thanked Austin for hosting the bilateral discussions and for organizing the industrial base conference.""We consider this conference ... a significant breakthrough in the development of our military/technical cooperation,"" Umerov said.

20,Remarks by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III at the Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/3609023/remarks-by-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-at-the-ukraine-defense-indus/,"Good morning, everybody.Thanks, Jason, for that kind introduction. It's a pleasure to be here for such an important conversation.Today's event highlights the close partnership between the Department of Defense and the Commerce Department.Secretary Raimondo and I were both at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California over the weekend. And we both carried the same message: the United States stands firmly with the people of Ukraine. And we're going to be with them for the long haul.So let me welcome Minister Umerov, Minister Kamyshin, Mr. Yermak, and Chairman Stefanchuk.I know that the trip to Washington isn't easy. So thanks for being here today.And today's meeting happens to fall on Ukraine Armed Forces Day. Ukraine's troops have shown incredible courage and skill defending their country. So let's give them a round of applause.It's also great to be joined by representatives from our allies and partners, and by so many of our friends in the defense industrial base.We're grateful for your energy and partnership.And over the past 21 months, that teamwork has proven more important than ever as Putin wages his vicious war of choice against Ukraine.Now, I was back in Kyiv a couple of weeks ago. And I had the chance to meet with you, Rustem, as well as President Zelenskyy and General Zaluzhny.And that visit just underscored the human cost of Putin's tragic and unnecessary war.And it was yet another reminder of the resilience of the Ukrainian people.Since the start of Putin's war of choice, the United States and our allies and partners have worked to get key weapons systems and capabilities into the hands of Ukrainian fighters.And that's making a huge difference.Since Putin's cruel and unprovoked invasion of his peaceful neighbor in February 2022, Ukrainian troops have taken back more than half of the territory grabbed by Russia.Above all, that's a testament to the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people. But Ukraine's gains also hinge on the extraordinary coalition of some 50 allies and partners worldwide that we've forged.The United States has committed more than $44 billion in security assistance since the start of Putin's ruthless war.And our allies and partners have committed another $36 billion.And as a percentage of their GDP, more than a dozen countries have actually contributed more than the United States.Now, President Biden has laid down a clear objective: The United States seeks a free and sovereign Ukraine that can defend itself today—and deter more Russian aggression in the future.And so, together with our allies and partners, we must continue working to help Ukraine repel Russian forces today, and to build up a future force for Ukraine that can deter more Russian aggression in the years to come.That will mean strengthening Ukraine's defense industrial base, both to maintain Ukraine's current war effort and to bolster Ukraine's national strength and deterrence long into the future.And that's been an important opportunity for partnership with our own defense industrial base.One of our key strategic advantages is the power of our free-enterprise system. And that's especially important with the challenges facing Ukraine.We have already invested around $27 billion across more than 35 states for contracts to produce critical capabilities for Ukraine, including lifesaving air-defense systems, munitions, tactical vehicles, and other equipment.I hope that Congress will soon pass the President's urgent national-security supplemental request, which would include another $50 billion to flow through the U.S. industrial base.Much of the money in the supplemental will come right back to us through investments in American jobs.And all of this money will come right back to us through investments in American security.At the same time, we must expand Ukraine's capacity to sustain the many different systems and platforms being provided by allies and partners around the world.We're working to make technical data packages and advanced manufacturing capabilities more readily available.That will let the Ukrainians produce spare parts closer to the point of need and more swiftly return vital equipment to the fight.And we must also strengthen the logistical and information-technology systems that bind all of these efforts together.A robust and resilient industrial base has hot production lines with strong, secure supply chains. And by gathering here today, we're working to bring the full power of American free enterprise and American innovation to bear to reach that goal.Now, we're going to hear directly from our Ukrainian friends today about their short-term and long-term objectives for their defense industrial base.And I'd like to challenge everyone in this room to think through how we can act to meet those objectives.How can we have more frequent and robust dialogue between our respective industry partners, and open even more doors to Western investment?How can we break down bureaucratic processes and other barriers to produce greater cooperation?And how can we do all of this while promoting transparency and responsible corporate governance?Time and again over our history, we've called on the full might of American industry. And our partners in the private sector have stepped up. And the last two years have been no different.So we have all come here together, once again, to strengthen the arsenal of democracy.Together with our allies and partners, I am confident that we have all the pieces that we need to help our Ukrainian friends sustain their fight for their sovereignty over the long haul.And it's up to all of us to put those pieces together.At the end of the day, we all benefit from the dynamic industrial bases of our global allies and partners.And that's important far beyond Europe.The whole world is watching. And we must come together to meet this moment.So thanks for being here and for stepping up to answer this new challenge."

23,Investing in Future Generations: SSP Receives Hands-On STEM Outreach Training at the US Naval Academy,https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3609182/investing-in-future-generations-ssp-receives-hands-on-stem-outreach-training-at/,"The workshop—facilitated by staff at the USNA’s STEM Center for Education and Outreach and sponsored by the DoD—provided tactics, resources, and tools for Navy STEM representatives to engage children outside of the traditional classroom setting. The day included hands-on learning activities and demonstrations by USNA STEM Center staff to connect educators to curriculum as well as develop a sense of community among attendees. Attracting top engineering and technical talent is key to sustaining and driving SSP’s critical sea-based strategic deterrence mission. Throughout Fiscal Year 24, SSP anticipates an increase of more than 18 percent in its STEM professional community. In order to meet this growth and workforce sustainment goal, SSP’s Human Resources Division plans to bolster recruitment efforts within STEM fields.“Investment in STEM is an investment in our children, in our workforce, and in our future,” Caren Spahr said as she reflected on the workshop. Spahr is the co-lead for STEM outreach at SSP’s field site Strategic Weapons Facility, Atlantic (SWFLANT) in Kings Bay, Georgia. Steering STEM initiatives is a collateral duty for Spahr, the continuous process improvement coordinator for SWFLANT. Augmenting the site’s STEM program, she explains, may add to her daily work but serves as a relief to teachers in the surrounding counties who don’t have the bandwidth or resources to include STEM activities in their classrooms. Spahr has a unique opportunity to represent the Navy, SWFLANT, and its mission to future generations of STEM professionals in the local community. SWFLANT supports 35 schools across three counties. Spahr is the STEM Coordinator for the 15 schools in Camden County and a mentor for Camden Middle School's FABLAB. Spahr ensures SWFLANT mentors are assigned to robotics teams and maintains an open dialogue with county schools to ensure educators have opportunities to request and receive STEM materials. School mentors oversee and assist approximately 20 students in their STEM learning activities monthly. “When a command can send people with materials and an activity that helps to support and enhance teaching objectives, it helps the teachers teach and it helps the students learn,” Spahr continued, “[but] it also educates the teachers and students on careers in the military and government.” Not only are the students doing hands-on activities that provide a real-world application to what they are learning, those providing the training also make vital connections with the community. “STEM engagement sparks curiosity,” Spahr said. “It [STEM] also helps develop our current workforce by enhancing leadership, facilitation, and public speaking skills—and also curates a sense of community.”Nearly 200 miles south of Kings Bay is Leslie Amodeo, STEM lead at SSP’s field site Naval Ordnance Test Unit (NOTU) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, who traveled to Annapolis for the workshop.“The experience really was invaluable,” Amodeo said. “I was able to see, firsthand, best practices for STEM learning demonstrations we were already planning at NOTU, and learn how to better communicate learning objectives while keeping the kids engaged in the activity.” Amodeo, the Associate Chief Engineer at NOTU, takes pride in the work she is doing to educate future generations in STEM fields. As co-lead for NOTU’s STEM outreach, Amodeo is responsible for coordinating activities that reach four schools in Brevard County, Florida. She noted how vital it is that NOTU’s outreach program is designed to reach all communities within Brevard, especially schools in underserved communities.“NOTU’s program actively engages with Title 1 teachers and schools,” she explained. “Bringing STEM activities to kids in these communities is pivotal because it provides them education they can use in future classes and take-home material that drives interest and keeps them engaged.” STEM initiatives have a vital impact on the future of our Nation’s ability to pace with competitors—like China—who are heavily resourcing and prioritizing STEM education. Naval STEM programs are deliberate investments in the current and future DoN workforce, which enhance the Navy and Marine Corps’ ability to meet present and future war-fighting challenges. “In 2017 there were 2.4 million positions in the US workforce that went unfilled because there were not enough people with STEM degrees to fill them,” USNA STEM Center Director Joseph McGettigan told workshop attendees. “It is expected that in 2027 that number will increase by ten percent.” The USNA STEM Center is primarily geared toward addressing the urgent national need for future generations to pursue careers in STEM. USNA faculty and midshipmen provide STEM outreach to local and national communities to help engage and influence students and to bolster curriculums nationwide. A retired U.S. Navy Captain, McGettigan highlighted the criticality of changing the narrative about STEM—one that today’s youth often sees as too hard or only for the smartest of students—in order to keep the United States a global leader in technology. “One of the ways to [change the narrative] is for today's youth to have role models from the STEM community to show them that STEM is fun and not as difficult as they may have thought,” he said. Based at SSP headquarters in Washington, D.C., STEM Federal Action Officer Dr. Greg Bouton spearheads the command’s STEM education efforts, nationally, and in the Northern Virginia locale. In D.C. at SSP HQ, STEM outreach volunteers support one school and one not-for-profit STEM outreach organization for k-12 students. Combined with five of its field activities across the U.S., overall SSP supports nearly 60 schools with volunteers, resources and tools for STEM outreach. Dr. Bouton says this type of grassroots effort is how the organization develops and cultivates interest in STEM for future generations, but it’s also a matter of national security.“STEM outreach is key to future proofing the United States' ability to maintain a strategic advantage over our foreign advisories,” he explained.“Moreover, it is vital for our volunteers from headquarters and the field activities to go out into their local communities to show the importance of what we do through STEM activities,” he continued, “that will encourage interest in fields of study that help grow and sustain missions like ours at SSP.” Bouton lauded USNA STEM outreach training and staff for the ability to connect STEM mentors and professionals across the Navy. He also shared how this type of resource can affect the future for an organization like SSP.“Our volunteers learn how to engage with the public in a meaningful way—moreover—STEM outreach is absolutely essential for succession planning and sustainability on a grand scale.”Strategic Systems Programs is the Navy command that provides cradle-to-grave lifecycle support for the sea-based leg of the nation’s nuclear triad. This includes training, systems, equipment, facilities and personnel responsible for ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nation’s Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) Trident II (D5LE) Strategic Weapon System. SLBMs make up the majority – approximately 70 percent – of the U.S.’s deployed strategic nuclear deterrent Triad. The SLBM is the most survivable leg of the triad, provides persistent presence, and allows flexible concept of operations.Caren Spahr and Leslie Amodeo contributed to this article."
24,U.S. and International Partners Issue Recommendations to Secure Software Products Through Memory Safety,http://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/,"FORT MEADE, Md. - The National Security Agency (NSA) joins Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and U.S. and international partners in releasing ”The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps” Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI). Expanding on the “Software Memory Safety” CSI published by NSA in April 2023, the report provides guidance for software manufacturers and technology providers to create roadmaps tailored to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from their products.



Memory safety vulnerabilities are coding errors affecting software’s memory management code in which memory can be accessed, written, allocated, or deallocated in unintended ways. Types of memory-related coding errors mentioned in the CSI include buffer overflow, use after free, use of uninitialized memory, and double free. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow malicious actors to access or corrupt data, or run arbitrary malicious code with the same privilege as the system owner.



“Memory safety vulnerabilities affect software development across all industries,” said Neal Ziring, Technical Director of NSA Cybersecurity Directorate. “Working together to set clear goals and timelines in transition roadmaps to safer programming language is critical for mitigating these problems.”



In a shared conclusion, the co-authoring agencies recommend software manufacturers create roadmaps for the utilization of, and transition to, memory safe programming languages. This transition will enable memory safe programming languages to mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities and reduce the products' attack surface. Recommended memory safe programming languages mentioned in the CSI include C#, Go, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift. Software manufacturers should evaluate multiple memory safe programming languages before integrating them into their workflows.



The CSI includes technical and non-technical factors for software manufacturers to consider when developing their roadmap. These include picking a memory safe language, staff capabilities and resourcing, and prioritization guidance. Additional guidance includes elements that should be part of the roadmaps, including the following: defined phases with dates and outcomes, dates for memory safe programming languages in new systems, internal developer training and integration plans, external dependency plans, transparency plans, and CVE support program plans.



The authoring agencies urge software manufacturers to create and publish memory safe roadmaps to plan and communicate how memory safety vulnerabilities will be mitigated in their products.



The authoring agencies include CISA, NSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) and Computer Emergency Response Team New Zealand (CERT NZ), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK). The agencies jointly developed this report as part of their Secure by Design campaign to urge software manufacturers to prioritize design and implementation practices to reduce customer risk by using memory safe languages in their products.

25,"Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arun G. Rao Delivers Keynote Address at the Enforcement, Litigation and Compliance Conference: For the Drug, Device, Food and Tobacco Industries",https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-assistant-attorney-general-arun-g-rao-delivers-keynote-address-enforcement,"Thank you for the introduction and thank you to the Food and Drug Law Institute (FDLI) for inviting me to open the Enforcement, Litigation and Compliance Conference. I’m heartened to see many familiar faces and even more excited to see new participants in this year’s conference. It’s been busy at the Department of Justice, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share with you some of the significant accomplishments of the department’s Consumer Protection Branch over these last 12 months. And I look forward to hearing from the many distinguished panelists who will be participating in this conference over the coming days.

This morning, I’d like to provide updates on the progress of several of the branch’s major initiatives, and I also want to give highlight some significant recent department-wide policy developments. Two important themes run through all these efforts. First, where companies fail to abide by regulatory obligations and thereby jeopardize public health, the branch and its partners will not hesitate to act. Second, the branch takes seriously representations made to the public. Consumers making decisions about their health and well-being should be able to trust that when companies make health claims about products, those claims are supported by well-founded evidence, as the law requires. Where representations are unsupported, the department and our agency partners will swiftly and aggressively enforce laws designed to protect public health and consumer’s ability to make informed decisions about the products they use.

Before I proceed, however, I want to take a moment to recognize the dedicated public servants behind these efforts — both at the branch and at our agency partners. The mission of the Consumer Protection Branch is to enforce federal laws designed to protect the public’s health, safety, economic security and identity integrity. Staffed by more than 100 trial attorneys (and supported by a team of over 150 talented paralegals, investigators and contractors), the branch works closely with the (Food and Drug Administration) FDA and the (Federal Trade Commission) FTC, as well as a range of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, (Drug Enforcement Administration) DEA, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, (Department of Health and Human Services) HHS Office of Inspector General and HSI, among others. With the help of our partners, we bring enforcement actions across the country using the wide range of criminal and civil tools available to us — both to remedy misconduct and, where appropriate, to punish those companies and individuals responsible for that misconduct.

Enforcement actions that the branch has taken over the last two months provide a representative sample of the types of misconduct that our teams regularly seek to combat. Since October, in the health and safety space, the branch and its partners have secured:

Criminal trial convictions of two executives who failed to report dangerous product defects to the Consumer Product Safety Commission — part of the first-ever criminal prosecution for failure to report under the Consumer Product Safety Act;

Civil injunctions in two cases involving adulterated and misbranded dietary supplements, and in a third case involving unapproved contraceptives;

A civil resolution requiring a Puerto Rico-based pharmaceutical distributor to pay $12 million for its failure to report suspicious orders of opioids and other controlled substances; and

A criminal guilty plea from a CEO who caused the distribution of adulterated and misbranded medical devices.

These matters, which have included both civil and criminal resolutions, and which have involved both companies and individuals, demonstrate the branch’s commitment to protect American consumers by identifying and addressing violations of law that pose significant risks to health and safety.

Before I share some of the branch’s recent accomplishments, I’d like to spend a few minutes updating you on significant recent policy developments at the department.

One of the reasons I have enjoyed speaking at events the FDLI Enforcement, Litigation and Compliance Conference is and the opportunity to engage with professionals like you who are working diligently to help their companies or clients comply with the law and to identify and proactively address compliance issues. When I spoke at this conference last year, I previewed that Department of Justice components with criminal authority (including the branch) would soon be issuing policies related to the voluntary self-disclosure of misconduct. That has now occurred. In March, the branch published its voluntary self-disclosure policy, which is available at the branch’s website.

As Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco has explained, these polices are intended to encourage companies to invest in and promote a culture of compliance, and to ensure that companies that disclose and remedy misconduct can secure more favorable dispositions than those that fail to do so. Assuming no aggravating circumstances exist, a company that timely and voluntary self-discloses misconduct, fully cooperates and timely and appropriately remediates criminal conduct will not be required to plead guilty.

I’d like to explain what these disclosures look like in practice.

When must a disclosure be made, to secure the benefits of this policy? A disclosure must be made prior to the imminent threat of disclosure or a government investigation and must be timely (reasonably promptly after the company becomes aware of the offense), with the burden on the company to demonstrate the disclosure was, in fact, timely.

To whom must a disclosure be made, to secure the benefits of this policy? The branch’s policy provides that, to receive credit for a disclosure, the disclosure must be made directly to the branch. To be clear, however, the branch’s policy does not supplant existing obligations to report to appropriate regulatory agencies, nor is it intended to alter those existing practices and channels of communication.

What must be disclosed, to secure the benefits of this policy? All relevant facts known at the time of disclosure — including as to any individuals substantially involved in or responsible for the misconduct at issue — must be disclosed. The department recognizes that tension may exist between making a timely disclosure and gathering all relevant facts. In general, companies should resolve that tension in favor of disclosure, even if only preliminary investigative efforts have occurred — and, in so doing, make clear that the disclosure is based on those initial steps.

One important caveat: if a company satisfies all the requirements under the voluntary disclosure policy, the department may still seek a guilty plea if confronted with aggravating circumstances. These could include, for example, intentional or willful conduct that posed significant risk of death of serious bodily injury, conduct that is deeply pervasive throughout the company or knowing involvement by upper management in the misconduct.

Since being implemented, these voluntary self-disclosure policies have had an impact. Last month, the branch’s colleagues in the Criminal Division announced charges against a former executive for her role in multimillion-dollar Medicare fraud scheme. The executive and her co-conspirators are alleged to have submitted false and fraudulent information about chronic ailments that Medicare beneficiaries did not actually have. The announcement of those charges was accompanied by a public statement from the department that prosecution of the company had been declined, in part, because the company promptly and voluntarily self-disclosed, cooperated and agreed to repay approximately $53 million in overpayments.

The department is continuing to expand upon its efforts to encourage companies to prioritize compliance and to report misconduct. As Deputy Attorney General Monaco announced in October, department components — including the Consumer Protection Branch — are also updating voluntary self-disclosure policies to specifically address mergers and acquisitions. Going forward, acquiring companies that promptly and voluntarily disclose criminal misconduct, cooperate with the ensuing investigation and engage in timely and appropriate remediation, restitution and disgorgement will receive the presumption of a declination. To be timely, such disclosure must occur within six months of the date of closing, and companies will have one year from closing to remediate the misconduct, (although those timelines may change based on the department’s assessment of whether the timing of the disclosure and remediation was reasonable).

Moving from policy to practice, I’d like to turn back to some of the branch’s significant recent enforcement efforts related to consumer health and safety, including its efforts to ensure the safety of food, drugs and medical devices.

Illustrating the importance of sound quality control procedures (and the harm that can result when those procedures are inadequate), in February 2023 food manufacturing company Kerry Inc. pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of distributing adulterated cereal marketed as Kellogg’s Honey Smacks. As part of that plea, the company agreed to the largest-ever criminal penalty following a criminal conviction in a food safety case, paying a combined forfeiture and fine of over $19 million. The case stemmed from a 2018 outbreak of salmonellosis resulting from cereal produced at Kerry’s plant in Gridley, Illinois. The (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) CDC ultimately identified more than 130 cases linked to cereal manufactured at the Gridley plant. The branch’s investigation revealed that managers and employees at the Gridley plant did not adhere to appropriate practices to ensure sanitary conditions. Kerry’s director of quality assurance, Ravi Chermala, also pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor counts of causing the introduction of adulterated food into interstate commerce. Chermala admitted that he directed subordinates not to report certain information to Kellogg’s about conditions at the Gridley facility and instead instructed them to alter the plant’s program for monitoring for the presence of pathogens in the plant, thereby limiting the plant’s ability to accurately detect insanitary conditions.

This year, the branch and our agency partners also successfully pursued several enforcement actions against companies, executives, and employees involved in manufacturing or distributing unapproved medical devices. In January, Pennsylvania-based medical device distributor Jet Medical resolved allegations relating to a device intended to treat migraine headaches. Jet never sought approval or clearance from the FDA to distribute the device for this intended use, however, nor did it conduct an investigational study regarding the device’s safety and efficacy. Jet entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government, which included criminal penalties of $200,000 and the implementation of enhanced compliance measures.

And in October, the CEO of a Utah-based medical device company pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of causing the introduction of misbranded and adulterated devices into interstate commerce. The defendant, Mark Wright, admitted that he never sought approval or clearance from the FDA to distribute a device intended to be used to treat migraine headaches. And he admitted that in 2014, the FDA had recommended that the company proceed with an investigational study regarding the device’s safety and effectiveness, but the company never conducted the study. Instead, Wright continued to market the device with the intention that it be used to treat migraine headaches — and even provided healthcare providers with marketing materials and unsolicited directions for that unapproved use.

Misrepresentations to consumers also led the branch to secure injunctions under the FTC Act. In July, a federal court ordered the distributor of “Smoke Away” products to pay over $7 million in consumer redress and a $500,000 civil penalty to resolve alleged violations of the Opioid Addiction Recovery Fraud Prevention Act of 2018 and the FTC Act in connection with the marketing and sale of “Smoke Away” products as a quick, effective and easy way to quit smoking. The defendants had made misleading and unsubstantiated advertising claims, including that “Smoke Away” products eliminate nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms and enable consumers to quit smoking quickly, easily and permanently. The complaint alleged that these advertising claims were misleading and unlawful because they were not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.

New drug discovery and the identification of new indications for existing drugs is vitally important to keeping our nation healthy. And as technology has advanced, we have seen an explosion in FDA approvals — with the five-year annual approval rate average at more than double what it was just 15 years ago. Clinical trials play a central role in gathering the data necessary to demonstrate that these new drugs or indicated uses are safe and effective in combatting illness and disease. And the quality of that data is crucial to those trials. False or misleading data can lead to inaccurate results, which can have serious consequences for patients and the healthcare industry.

Unfortunately, there are certain companies and individuals who attempt to take advantage of the clinical trial process for financial gain by falsifying the identity of study participants, falsifying data or otherwise circumventing the guardrails created to maintain clinical trial data integrity. Clinical researchers who fabricate or falsify clinical trial data can adversely impact critical decisions made by life sciences companies and the FDA related to drug safety and efficacy. And as a result, these highly dangerous fraud schemes can endanger the lives of countless American consumers and erode confidence in FDA’s drug approval practice. As such, the investigation and prosecution of clinical trial fraud remains a high priority of the branch.

As part of our continuing efforts in this space, in September, the branch convicted at trial two individuals who, from 2015 to 2018, conspired to falsify clinical trial data for profit while working at AMB Research Center Inc. (AMB), a medical clinic located in Miami, Florida. Miguel Angel Montalvo Villa was co-owner, president and chief executive officer of AMB, and Ivette Maria Portela Martinez was as AMB’s pharmacist and data entry specialist. Montalvo and Portela used the names of individuals without their knowledge and listed those individuals as subjects who participated in a clinical trial for a drug that was being developed to treat a form of diarrhea. Montalvo and Portela falsified hundreds of pages of documents and entered that false information into clinical trial databases, to make it appear as though the purported subjects were fully participating in the clinical trial, when, in fact, they were not. And in connection with a 2018 FDA regulatory inspection of AMB, Montalvo told the FDA regulatory investigator that AMB had obtained informed consent from all purported clinical trial subjects — knowing that this was not true. Last week, the court sentenced Montalvo to 71 months in prison and Portela to 46 months in prison.

These convictions followed the sentencing in January of a clinical research coordinator involved in a separate clinical trial that studied the effectiveness of asthma drugs in children. The defendant, Jessica Palacio, was sentenced to three years in prison after being found guilty by a federal jury of making a false statement to a government investigator. Palacio submitted a false affidavit to an FDA investigator claiming that she had performed a screening visit of a child subject when, in fact, she had not. Palacio was the fifth defendant convicted and sentenced as part of the Branch’s investigation of a clinical trial firm called Unlimited Medical Research.

While we are proud of our recent successes in connection with this initiative, we know there is more work to do, and the branch will continue investigating and prosecuting clinical trial frauds in the years to come.

From 1999 to 2020, approximately 500,000 Americans died because of an overdose of prescription or illicit opioids. And nearly 250,000 more Americans have died of opioid-caused overdoses in the last three years. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, and opioids are the driving contributor to this crisis.

Combatting prescription opioid abuse has long been a priority at the Consumer Protection Branch. Over the years, the branch has helped lead several of the largest enforcement actions brought against opioid manufacturers, distributors and chain and local pharmacies, and as our nation continues to grapple with the ongoing opioid epidemic, the branch continues to pursue criminal and civil actions against entities and individuals across the prescription opioid supply chain. Companies that distribute controlled substances to pharmacies and other points of sale have an important responsibility to help stop the illegal distribution of controlled substances by reporting suspicious orders to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The branch works closely with its law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who fail to fulfill their reporting obligations.

In recognition of the complexity of these matters, in March 2023, Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta announced the creation of the Opioid Epidemic Civil Litigation Task Force, which formalizes and enhances coordination of the department’s existing work and will also consider new initiatives. Because of the scope and duration of the crisis, the task force includes U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the Consumer Protection Branch and the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other department components. The task force has been steering the department’s civil litigation efforts involving actors alleged to have contributed to the opioid epidemic.

We don’t need to look back far to identify successful enforcement efforts. Last month, in a case brought by the branch and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Puerto Rico, a federal court in Puerto Rico entered a consent decree requiring Droguería Betances LLC (Betances), one of Puerto Rico’s largest distributors of pharmaceutical drugs, to pay $12 million and make extensive improvements to its compliance program. The complaint alleged that Betances failed to report hundreds of suspicious orders for opioids and other controlled substances, including at least 655 suspicious orders for fentanyl and at least 113 suspicious orders for oxycodone (both of which are frequently misused products and significant contributors to the opioid crisis).

Finally, I want to highlight the federal government’s ongoing efforts to remove illegal e-cigarettes from the market. Illegal e‑cigarettes contribute to youth addiction and can lead to a lifetime of nicotine dependency. Nicotine is harmful to youth brain development, damaging the parts of the brain that control attention, learning, mood and impulse control. It also raises blood pressure and adrenaline, leading to increased heart rate and likelihood of heart attacks.

The collaborative approach being taken to address these dangerous, unlawful products illustrate the importance of using a range of tools to tackle pervasive misconduct — and have included the issuance by the FDA of hundreds of warning letters to retailers selling unauthorized tobacco products and to firms manufacturing and disturbing those unauthorized products, as well as the filing of dozens of civil penalty complaints.

And where the FDA’s warnings have not resulted in a change of behavior, the Consumer Protection Branch has filed civil enforcement actions — and has secured permanent injunctions in five cases and recently prevailed on summary judgment in another. The branch, together with our colleagues in Civil Appellate, also have defended the FDA in more than 60 petitions for review of the agency’s marketing denial orders and other actions on premarket tobacco product applications that e-cigarette manufacturers have filed in federal courts over the past 18 months. While much remains to be done, these actions demonstrate the branch’s strong commitment to protecting children and adults from unauthorized e-cigarette products.

In closing, I want to emphasize my deep appreciation to the branch’s key partners — our friends at the FDA and the FTC — for their support of our shared mission: to protect the health and safety of the American public.

Many thanks, once again, to FDLI for the invitation to speak with you today. I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight the achievements of our team."
26,Belgian National Charged with Crimes Related to Scheme to Illegally Procure Critical U.S. Technology for End Users in China and Russia,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/belgian-national-charged-crimes-related-scheme-illegally-procure-critical-us-technology-end,"In two separate indictments unsealed yesterday, Hans Maria De Geetere, 61, of Knokke-Heist, Belgium, is charged with crimes related to a years-long scheme to unlawfully export sensitive, military-grade technology from the United States to end users located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation.

Concurrent with the unsealing, authorities in Belgium, in coordination with the FBI’s Legal Attaché Office in Brussels, Belgium, executed search warrants and arrested De Geetere and others for questioning on Dec. 5 in connection with a Belgian investigation into De Geetere’s global illicit procurement scheme.

In addition, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added De Geetere and his companies, Knokke-Heist Support Management Corporation and European Trading Technology BV, to the BIS Entity List and the OFAC Specially Designated and Blocked Person (SDN) List for acquiring and illicitly diverting U.S.-origin electronic components used in missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, electronic warfare receivers, and military radar on behalf of parties in the PRC and Russia.

“As alleged, Hans Maria De Geetere orchestrated multiple smuggling schemes to unlawfully re-export advanced U.S. technologies to China and Russia,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. “The Justice Department is committed to working with partners, including through our leadership of the Disruptive Technology Strike Force, to hold accountable those who violate U.S. export control laws, and place personal profit over the security of the United States and our allies. We are grateful to the Belgian authorities for their coordination with U.S. law enforcement as they work to hold the defendant accountable under Belgian law.”

“Hans De Geetere allegedly acquired and illicitly diverted U.S.-origin electronic components to China and Russia that can be used in missiles, drones, and military radar,” said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “These coordinated actions, which include the unsealing of federal indictments against De Geetere, his arrest abroad, and additions to our Entity List, demonstrate our commitment to cutting off the flow of critical U.S. electronics to the PRC and Russia.”

“These indictments of Hans Maria De Geetere highlight years of deceit and deception for the benefit of the governments of the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation,” said Executive Assistant Director Larissa L. Knapp of the FBI’s National Security Branch. “These charges demonstrate the commitment of the FBI and our partners to coordinate and make the world safer, together, by preventing the illegal transfer of military-use technology to our adversaries.”

U.S. v. De Geetere et al., Eastern District of Texas

According to court documents in the Eastern District of Texas, between March 2016 and February 2018, De Geetere and co-defendant Eddy Johan Coopmans, 62, of Ponte Verda, Florida, conspired to illegally smuggle from the United States export-controlled field programmable gate array (FGPA) circuits to Russia and short-wave infrared surveillance (SWIR) cameras to the PRC. As alleged, the defendants wired partial payments totaling over $1.2 million in an attempt to acquire these items. Coopsmans pleaded guilty to the conspiracy on Oct. 5, 2022, and is pending sentencing.

“As alleged, Mr. De Geetere conspired with others to violate U.S. export controls and illegally smuggle sensitive American-made technologies to Russia and the PRC,” said U.S. Attorney Damien M. Diggs for the Eastern District of Texas. “This indictment should be an example that the Eastern District of Texas will aggressively pursue and prosecute those — no matter where they are in the world — who seek to avoid U.S. export laws to supply Russia and the PRC with microelectronics that can be used for nefarious purposes.”

U.S. v. De Geetere, District of Oregon

Separately, according to court documents in the District of Oregon, between April 2021 and August 2023, De Geetere attempted to illegally procure for export to the PRC controlled accelerometers valued at more than $930,000. Accelerometers are electronic devices that measure the vibration, tilt and acceleration of motion of a structure and are often used in aerospace and military systems. During an investigation into De Geetere’s activities, he falsely told a BIS agent that the accelerometers were intended for export to Belgium, whereas in truth, he sought to obtain them for end users in the PRC.

“Export control laws and regulations serve an important role in protecting our national security and this case demonstrates our commitment to holding individuals accountable wherever they reside,” said U.S. Attorney Natalie Wight for the District of Oregon. “We urge anyone with information about violations of export control laws to contact OEE and the FBI immediately.”

In the Eastern District of Texas, De Geetere is charged with one count of conspiring to smuggle goods and one count of conspiring to launder funds. He is further charged with three counts of making false statements and one count of smuggling goods in the District of Oregon. If convicted, he faces a maximum statutory penalty of five years in prison for conspiracy to smuggle goods and for each count of making false statements, 10 years in prison for smuggling of goods, and 20 years in prison for conspiracy to launder funds.

The case in the Eastern District of Texas was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Dallas and the FBI’s Dallas Field Office, with assistance from BIS’s Office of Export Enforcement (OEE), Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Services (DCIS), the Internal Revenue Service–Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), and the United States Postal Inspection Service. Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the Eastern District of Texas are prosecuting the case with assistance from Trial Attorney Derek Shugert of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES).

The case in the District of Oregon was investigated by OEE, with assistance from the FBI Portland Field Office and HSI Oregon. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Nyhus for the District of Oregon is prosecuting the case, with assistance from CES Trial Attorney Derek Shugert.

These actions were coordinated through the Disruptive Technology Strike Force, an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains, and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation-states. Under the leadership of the Assistant Attorney General for National Security and the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement, the Strike Force leverages tools and authorities across the U.S. Government to enhance the criminal and administrative enforcement of export control laws.

27,Former Kentucky Federal Corrections Supervisor Sentenced to 66 Months for Leading Cover-Ups of Inmate Assaults and Making False Reports,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-kentucky-federal-corrections-supervisor-sentenced-66-months-leading-cover-ups-inmate,"A former Bureau of Prisons supervisor, Kevin X. Pearce, 39, was sentenced yesterday to 66 months in prison followed by one year of supervised release for leading two cover-ups of assaults of inmates held at U.S. Penitentiary Big Sandy. Pearce was convicted after a six-day trial. His co-defendants, former corrections officers Samuel Patrick and Clinton Pauley, previously pleaded guilty and were respectively sentenced to 36 and 40 months in prison.

“As a supervisor, this defendant was responsible for safeguarding the rights of thousands of inmates, but he abused his authority by leading cover-ups of two violent assaults of inmates in his custody,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will continue to hold accountable law enforcement officials who violate federal civil rights laws or who cover up violations. We will protect the rights of all people, including those held inside our jails and prisons.”

“Not only did Pearce have a profound responsibility to protect people in his custody and care, he had an even greater one – to ensure that those under his supervision also protected them,” said U.S. Attorney Carlton S. Shier IV for the Eastern District of Kentucky. “He fell well short on both counts. Instead of honoring his obligations, he acquiesced in the abuse by his subordinates and then tried to cover it up. He now faces the consequences of this betrayal of the public trust placed in him.”

“Identifying and investigating law enforcement officials who deliberately violate the oath they take to protect and serve is of utmost importance at the FBI,” said Special Agent in Charge Michael E. Stansbury of the FBI Louisville Field Office. “Pearce not only carried a badge, but he was responsible for ensuring those under his supervision protected the civil rights of all inmates in their facility. FBI Louisville will continue to aggressively pursue public officials who choose to abuse their position of authority.”

“As a supervisor, Pearce had a duty to hold accountable Patrick and Pauley for assaulting inmates in their custody and care,” said Special Agent in Charge William J. Hannah of the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General (DOJ OIG) Midwest Region. “Instead, Pearce lied repeatedly to try to cover up these horrific crimes. The Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General will continue to aggressively investigate allegations of abuse in federal prisons and any efforts to conceal these heinous acts.”

According to court documents and evidence introduced at trial and sentencing, Pearce, who at that time held the rank of Operations Lieutenant, covered up assaults committed by his co-defendants, Patrick and Pauley, on March 30 and April 29, 2021. On March 30, Patrick and Pauley assaulted an inmate by spraying him in the face with pepper spray and kicking him in the head and upper body. Witnesses, including those who assaulted the inmates, testified that the inmate was not a threat and was compliant, and was assaulted for walking too slowly to his cell, rather than for any legitimate penological purpose. Pearce tried to cover up what happened by writing a false report and pressuring lower-ranking corrections officers to join the cover-up.

On April 29, 2021, Patrick and Pauley assaulted a second inmate by elbowing him in the head and punching him in the body. The victim of that assault had requested protection from other inmates. When the victim, who is white, revealed that he used to affiliate with Black gangs, Patrick referred to him as a “race traitor,” after which Patrick and Pauley both repeatedly struck him in the head and body. Pearce once again tried to cover up what happened by writing a false report and pressuring lower-ranking officers to join the cover-up. Pearce continued to stick with the cover-ups over a year later by making false statements to OIG and FBI agents who were investigating the assaults.

DOJ OIG and the FBI Louisville Field Office investigated the case.

28,Ohio Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Federal Hate Crimes Against Haitian Nationals,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ohio-man-sentenced-20-years-prison-federal-hate-crimes-against-haitian-nationals,"A Springfield, Ohio, man was sentenced in U.S. District Court yesterday to 20 years in prison for committing federal hate crimes targeting and attacking Haitian nationals residing in the area.

Izaye Eubanks, 22, pleaded guilty in August to both federal and local crimes. He admitted to committing hate crimes against at least eight Haitian nationals.

“This defendant is being held accountable for repeatedly assaulting and robbing members of the Haitian community in Springfield, Ohio, because of their national origin,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Attacks like these, where a group of individuals is targeted for violent abuse and robbery because of who they are, will not be tolerated. The Justice Department will continue to enforce our federal criminal civil rights laws to protect all people in this country, and we will prosecute predators who commit violent, bias-motivated crimes.”

“Hate and discrimination have never had a place in our society. As today’s significant prison sentence shows, they have no place today,” said U.S. Attorney Kenneth L. Parker for the Southern District of Ohio. “We will continue to prosecute hate crimes to the fullest extent of the law.”

“The hate crimes committed by Izaye Eubanks threatened and intimidated the immigrant community throughout the region,” stated Special Agent in Charge J. William Rivers of the FBI Cincinnati Field Office. “Because hate crimes have such a wide-ranging impact, investigating these crimes is a top priority for the FBI.”

According to court documents, in January and February, Eubanks committed various assaults, robberies and a carjacking of Haitian individuals because of the victims’ actual and perceived national origin. Eubanks would travel throughout Springfield looking for individuals he believed were from Haiti and then attack the individuals, usually by punching them and knocking them to the ground before robbing them of their money, cell phones, a vehicle and/or other personal belongings.

On Jan. 29, Eubanks assaulted and robbed a victim while the victim was walking to wire $300 in cash to his mother in Haiti. Eubanks punched the victim in the back of the head and neck, causing him to briefly black out, then robbed the victim of his cash, cell phone and ATM cards. That same day, Eubanks assaulted a victim as he left a Haitian market. Eubanks grabbed the victim by his shirt, pulled him out of his vehicle and punched him in the face before stealing the victim’s vehicle.

On Feb. 1, Eubanks directed juveniles to help him complete four separate attacks on five additional victims.

The FBI Cincinnati Field Office investigated the case.

29,Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks Announcing Four Russia-Affiliated Military Personnel Charged with War Crimes in Connection with Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-announcing-four-russia-affiliated,"Remarks as Delivered

Good morning.

I am joined today by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, FBI Director Chris Wray, Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole Argentieri, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Jessica Aber, and ICE Acting Deputy Director Staci Barrera.

Also here are Eli Rosenbaum, the head of the Department’s War Crimes Accountability Team, Christian Levesque, Lead Prosecutor for the War Crimes Accountability Team, and David Sundberg, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI Washington Field Office.

On February 24, 2022, Russia commenced its full-scale, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

In the nearly two years since, we have all seen invading Russian forces commit atrocities on the largest scale in any European armed conflict since the Second World War.

We have all heard the accounts of Ukrainian civilians targeted and executed, Ukrainian children forcibly deported, and Ukrainian women and girls sexually assaulted.

And as the world has witnessed the horrors of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, so has the United States Department of Justice.

That is why the Justice Department has filed the first ever charges under the U.S. war crimes statute against four Russia-affiliated military personnel for heinous crimes against an American citizen. Congress passed the U.S. war crimes statute nearly 30 years ago to give us jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes committed against American citizens abroad.

In an indictment returned yesterday in the Eastern District of Virginia, we have charged four Russia-affiliated military personnel with war crimes against an American citizen living in Ukraine. The charges include conspiracy to commit war crimes, including war crimes outlawed by the international community after World War II — unlawful confinement, torture, and inhuman treatment.

Like all defendants in the U.S. criminal justice system, the defendants in this case are entitled to due process of law and are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

We allege that in April of 2022, two commanding officers of Russia-affiliated forces, Suren Seiranovich Mkrtchyan and Dmitry Budnik, as well as two lower-ranking soldiers, whose first names are Valerii and Nazar, committed war crimes against an American citizen who had been living in Ukraine since 2021.

That victim was living in Mylove, a small village in Southern Ukraine, and was not participating in the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As such, the victim was what is known as a “protected person,” under international law.

After Russian forces invaded Mylove, the victim was abducted from his home by three of the defendants — Mkrtchyan, who was one of the commanding officers, and Valerii and Nazar, the lower-ranking soldiers — and their co-conspirators.

During the abduction, we allege that those defendants threw the victim to the ground while he was naked, tied his hands behind his back, pointed a gun at his head, and beat him with their feet, their fists, and the stocks of their guns.

We allege that they forced him into a building that Russia-affiliated forces were using as a jail, and into a closet that they were using as a jail cell.

We allege that, as they interrogated him, they tortured him. They beat him, again, with a gun. They punched him in his chest and stomach. They threatened to shoot him. They stripped off his clothes and took pictures. One of their conspirators threatened to sexually assault him.

And during the interrogation, when the victim’s answers did not satisfy the defendants, we allege that Budnik, who was also a commanding officer, threatened the victim with death and asked for his last words.

We allege that Nazar and other co-conspirators then took the victim outside. There, they forced him to the ground and put a gun to the back of his head. The victim believed he was about to be killed.

They moved the gun just before pulling the trigger, and the bullet went past his head. After the mock execution, the victim was beaten and interrogated again. At one point, he was told through an interpreter that he was “going to sleep,” and he was told by Mkrtchya: “goodnight” — leading the victim to believe, again, that he was about to be killed.

During his 10 days detained by Russia-affiliated forces, the victim in this case was tortured, threatened with sexual assault and execution, forced to perform manual labor, and beaten in the head, chest, and stomach with the soldiers’ feet, their fists, and their guns. Again and again, he believed he was going to die.

These charges against four Russia-affiliated military personnel are the Justice Department’s first criminal charges under the U.S. war crimes statute. They are also an important step toward accountability for the Russian regime’s illegal war in Ukraine. Our work is far from done.

I want to recognize the Criminal Division, including the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and the War Crimes Accountability Team, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security, including Homeland Security Investigations. Their diligent and skillful work is what made these historic charges possible.

I also want to recognize the incredible courage of our partners in Ukraine, specifically our counterparts in the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office. In the midst of war, Ukrainian prosecutors and investigators have risked their lives to pursue justice for the Ukrainian people. We are honored to stand alongside them.

Finally, I want to recognize our partners in the international community.

We will continue to work closely alongside them to gather evidence and build cases so that when the time comes, the United States and our partners will be ready to ensure accountability for Russia’s war of aggression.

This is an historic day for the Justice Department that builds on a long history.

The War Crimes Accountability Team prosecuting this case is modeled in part on the Justice Department’s decades-long effort to identify, denaturalize, and deport Nazi war criminals in the United States.

During that effort, the Department’s Office of Special Investigations brought more than 130 cases against perpetrators of Nazi crimes.

In the vast majority of those cases, the perpetrators were not identified until decades after they committed their horrific crimes.

This history should make clear that the Justice Department — and the American people — have a long memory. We will not forget the atrocities in Ukraine. And we will never stop working to bring those responsible to justice.

Throughout our work, we will continue to put our trust in the rule of law.

The rule of law is the best answer we have to crimes that cannot truly be answered.

The rule of law is how we pursue true accountability for the individuals responsible for those crimes, and how we deter future aggression.

And the rule of law is how we pursue justice in a way that protects people, and protects our shared humanity.

I am now honored to turn the podium over to Secretary Mayorkas."
30,Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri Delivers Remarks Announcing Four Russia-Affiliated Military Personnel Charged with War Crimes in Connection with Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-nicole-m-argentieri-delivers-remarks-announcing-four,"Thank you, Director Wray.

The charges announced today — the first under the federal war crimes statute — are historic. The Department of Justice is holding accountable four Russia-affiliated military personnel who committed war crimes in the course of Russia’s unlawful full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As alleged in the indictment, the defendants abducted, beat, and threatened to kill an American national. They even conducted a mock execution.

These charges send a clear message: the Criminal Division will pursue those who commit war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine. We are committed to bringing war criminals to justice — no matter where they are located — for brutal acts committed against Americans.

Last year, Attorney General Garland announced the launch of the War Crimes Accountability Team — led by prosecutors from the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section — to strengthen the department’s response to the atrocities being committed in Ukraine and to hold perpetrators of war crimes in Ukraine accountable. These charges were brought as part of that critical mandate. Those who would act with impunity should think twice — when we identify perpetrators of war crimes and the evidence supports charges, the Criminal Division will take action.

This case is the result of the strong collaboration between our War Crimes Accountability Team, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, and our key law enforcement partners: FBI and Homeland Security Investigations. Together, they have worked with great skill and tenacity to bring this historic criminal prosecution, emblematic of our collective resolve and commitment to holding perpetrators of war crimes accountable.

I would also like to express my immense gratitude to the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine for their substantial assistance in this investigation, and for their continued resolve to uphold the rule of law even in the face of an active invasion and ongoing war.

And now it is my pleasure to turn it over to Jessica Aber, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who has been an outstanding partner."
31,Four Russia-Affiliated Military Personnel Charged with War Crimes in Connection with Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-russia-affiliated-military-personnel-charged-war-crimes-connection-russias-invasion,"War crimes charges against four Russia-affiliated military personnel were unsealed today in the Eastern District of Virginia. The charges include torture, inhuman treatment, and unlawful confinement of a U.S. national in Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Suren Seiranovich Mkrtchyan, 45, Dmitry Budnik, Valerii LNU (last name unknown), and Nazar LNU were each charged in connection with their unlawful detainment of a U.S. national in the context of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The defendants are alleged to have interrogated, severely beaten, and tortured the victim. They also allegedly threatened to kill the victim and conducted a mock execution.

“As the world has witnessed the horrors of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, so has the United States Department of Justice,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “That is why the Justice Department has filed the first ever charges under the U.S. war crimes statute against four Russia- affiliated military personnel for heinous crimes against an American citizen. The Justice Department will work for as long as it takes to pursue accountability and justice for Russia’s war of aggression.”

“Thanks to the tireless and unprecedented work of federal law enforcement agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the Justice Department, four Russian soldiers, accused of unthinkable, unacceptable human rights violations against an American citizen, have been charged with war crimes and will be brought to justice,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “The indictments unsealed today send a clear message to Russia – our government will spare no effort and spare no resource to hold accountable those who violate the fundamental human rights of an American.”

“Since the start of their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Russia has weaponized human rights abuses to wreak unimaginable tragedy,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Today’s indictment – the first ever under the U.S. war crimes statute – makes clear that the FBI will work with the full cooperation of international law enforcement to bring justice to the victims of these atrocities. The human toll of the conflict in Ukraine weighs heavily on the hearts of the FBI, and we’re resolved to hold war criminals accountable no matter where they are or how long it takes.”

“Torturing and unlawfully confining a protected person are serious human rights abuses that must not go unpunished,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “These historic criminal charges – the first ever brought under the U.S. war crimes statute – are an important step in the Justice Department’s continuing efforts to pursue every avenue of accountability for those who commit war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.”

According to allegations in the indictment, Mkrtchyan and Budnik were commanding officers of military units of the Russian Armed Forces and/or the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and Valerii and Nazar were lower-ranking military personnel. The defendants are alleged to have been fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine when they allegedly committed war crimes.

In April 2022, Mkrtchyan and soldiers under his command allegedly abducted the victim, a U.S. national, from his home in the village of Mylove in the Kherson Oblast region in southern Ukraine and unlawfully confined him for at least 10 days. During the abduction, Mkrtchyan, Valerii, Nazar, and others allegedly threw the victim face down to the ground while he was naked, tied his hands behind his back, pointed a gun at his head, and severely beat him, including with the stocks of their guns. Mkrtchyan, Valerii, Nazar, and others then allegedly transported the victim to an improvised military compound in Mylove.

“These charges reflect that the defendants’ alleged actions are not only grave breaches of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, but also violations of U.S. law,” said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. “We are proud to be at the forefront of the Justice Department’s effort to hold perpetrators of war crimes violations accountable in Ukraine and will continue to pursue them. We thank our investigative partners on this case, the War Crimes Accountability Team, the FBI Washington Field Office, and Homeland Security Investigations for their outstanding efforts to gather evidence required for these charges.”

The indictment also alleges that Mkrtchyan and Budnik led and participated in at least two interrogation sessions during which the four defendants and others tortured the victim. During one interrogation, Mkrtchyan, Valerii, and Nazar allegedly stripped off the victim’s clothes and photographed him. The defendants and others then allegedly severely beat the victim, pointed guns at the back of his head, and threatened to shoot him. Budnik allegedly threatened the victim with death and asked for his last words. Shortly thereafter, Nazar and others allegedly conducted a mock execution. They allegedly forced the victim to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head, then moved the gun slightly and shot a bullet just past the victim’s head.

“These historic charges are the culmination of a complex investigation by the FBI and our partners that spans the globe,” said Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office. “The FBI will continue to work alongside our domestic and international partners to pursue justice and hold those accountable who commit such atrocities against others.”

“Acting on behalf of the Russian Armed Forces and the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, these four individuals allegedly violated the human rights of an American citizen,” said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). “According to the charges, they unlawfully detained and tortured the American citizen, and even went so far as to carry out a mock execution. The unsealing of these charges for war crimes is an important step in bringing the responsible parties to justice. HSI will continue to aggressively pursue anyone who violates the human rights of our American citizens – at home or overseas.”

The defendants are charged with three war crimes – unlawful confinement, torture, and inhuman treatment – and one count of conspiracy to commit war crimes. If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum penalty of life in prison.

The FBI Washington Field Office and HSI Washington, D.C., Field Office, with assistance from the FBI’s International Human Rights Unit and HSI’s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center, investigated the war crimes allegations in partnership with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Justice Department’s War Crimes Accountability Team, which is based in the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.

HRSP Trial Attorney and Lead Prosecutor for the War Crimes Accountability Team Christian Levesque, HRSP Trial Attorney Patrick Jasperse, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander E. Blanchard for the Eastern District of Virginia are prosecuting the case, with significant assistance from Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas W. Traxler for the Eastern District of Virginia. HRSP historians and other staff provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution.

The Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Appellate Section, Office of Enforcement Operations, and Office of International Affairs, as well as the National Security Division, also provided valuable assistance. The Justice Department is grateful for the substantial assistance the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine has provided in furthering the investigation.

Members of the public who have information about human rights violators in the United States or the location of the defendants named in this indictment are urged to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or through the FBI online tip form or HSI at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE or through the ICE online tip form. All are staffed around the clock, and tips may be provided anonymously.

An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."
32,Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks to Faith Leaders to Provide Update on Security Resources and Training,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-faith-leaders-provide-update,"Remarks as Delivered

Thank you, Secretary Mayorkas.

And thank you to everyone for attending today’s training.

We are meeting today at a time when the fear so many communities are facing is palpable.

Many Jews are living in fear that any sign of their Jewish identity could make them the target of a hate crime.

Many Muslims are living in fear that they will the victim of an Islamophobic attack.

Synagogues and mosques across the country are on high alert.

And many people of Arab and Palestinian descent are fearful of the threat of hate-fueled violence in their everyday lives.

I know that your communities are looking to you for guidance and protection at this difficult time. That is not an easy burden to shoulder. We are working every day to make sure that you do not have to shoulder it alone.

As always, but especially right now, the Justice Department is remaining vigilant in the face of threats of hate-fueled violence and terrorism.

We are closely monitoring the impact that the conflict in the Middle East may have in inspiring foreign terrorist organizations, homegrown violent extremists, and domestic violent extremists both here in the United States and abroad.

In this elevated threat environment, efforts to ensure that all people in this country are safe in their places of worship are particularly urgent.

We have all seen the sharp increase in the volume and frequency of threats against Jewish, Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities across our country since October 7th.

Last month, the Justice Department arrested a defendant in Utah for threatening a Palestinian rights organization. And we arrested a man in Arizona who had threatened to execute a rabbi and other members of the Jewish community.

These examples represent barely a fraction of the threats we know that communities across the country are facing.

First and foremost, I want to make clear to everyone participating today that the Justice Department is committed to protecting you and your communities, now and always.

The Justice Department has no tolerance for illegal threats fueled by bias of any kind. No person and no community in this country should have to live in fear of hate-fueled violence.

That is why, in the week following the October 7 terrorist attack, I directed all of our U.S. Attorney and FBI field offices to meet with law enforcement and community leaders to discuss what they are seeing on the ground and how we can best support them with regard to threats of hate-fueled violence.

Senior leadership at the Justice Department and I have done the same. In my conversations with law enforcement, community, and religious leaders, I have reiterated that the Justice Department has no higher priority than protecting the safety and civil rights of everyone in our country.

Protecting all people and all communities from hate-fueled violence was the Justice Department’s founding purpose in 1870, and it remains our urgent responsibility today.

And that is why, in addition to our investigative and prosecutorial efforts, the Department’s Community Relations Service (CRS) is working directly with community leaders, law enforcement, and civil rights organizations to provide support. CRS works in communities across the country to prevent and respond to hate crimes and facilitate dialogue, training, and mediation services.

This Department’s concern about illegal acts of hate is not new.

Over the past two years, every one of our 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices has brought together community groups, community leaders, and law enforcement at every level to build trust and strengthen coordination to combat unlawful acts of hate. To date, these offices have held over 300 events, bringing together more than 10,000 participants.

We launched this nation-wide program, called United Against Hate, because we know that combating hate crimes requires a coordinated, united effort.

We also know that effectively combating hate crimes requires building and strengthening trust with vulnerable communities before an incident occurs.

We will continue to expand on these efforts in the days ahead.

Thank you all for joining today’s training.

We all have different reasons why we are engaged in this work.

For me, I wanted to give back to the country — and to the system of laws — that took my grandmother in and protected her from religious persecution when she had nowhere else to go.

That protection is what distinguishes America from so many other countries. The protection of law, the Rule of Law, is the foundation of our system of government.

Ensuring that all people in our country are afforded that protection is the purpose that motivates me every single day.

To fulfill that promise, we must be vigilant, and we must act as partners.

Your presence at this training shows that each of you is committed to doing your part. I am committed to ensuring that the Justice Department is with you every step of the way.

Thank you."
33,Former IRS Employee Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering in Connection with COVID-19 Fraud,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-irs-employee-pleads-guilty-money-laundering-connection-covid-19-fraud,"A Tennessee man pleaded guilty yesterday in connection with a scheme to defraud the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, a federal stimulus program authorized to provide loans to small businesses experiencing substantial financial disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

According to court documents, Brian Saulsberry, 47, of Memphis, was employed by the IRS as a Program Evaluation and Risk Analyst in the Human Capital Office. Saulsberry submitted false EIDL applications and obtained $171,400 in loan funds. After obtaining the fraudulent loan funds, Saulsberry transferred the funds to his personal checking account. He then used the loan funds for purposes not authorized by the EDIL program, but instead transferred $100,000 to an investment account, knowing that the property involved in the transaction was derived from unlawful activity.

Saulsberry pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 5, 2024, and faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kevin G. Ritz for the Western District of Tennessee, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) J. Russell George, and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG) made the announcement.

TIGTA and SBA-OIG investigated the case.

Trial Attorney Thomas D. Campbell and Assistant Chief Justin M. Woodard of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Carroll L. André III for the Western District of Tennessee are prosecuting the case.

This case was brought as part of an interagency effort to combat and prevent CARES Act fraud by federal employees. In October 2022, the Justice Department announced charges against five former IRS employees for defrauding federal COVID-19 relief programs. All five defendants have been convicted.

On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Justice Department in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The task force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts. For more information on the department’s response to the pandemic, please visit www.justice.gov/coronavirus.

Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Justice Department’s National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) Hotline via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form."

I am also grateful to Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, who exhibits a commitment to access to justice every single day, and for her participation in today’s convening.

The pediment on the Supreme Court building promises “Equal Justice Under Law.” But we all know that there cannot be equal justice unless there is equal access to justice. So, this body is charged with “increas[ing] the availability of meaningful access to justice for individuals and families, regardless of wealth or status.”

This is a broad, but critical, mandate. And thanks to the varied domains and distinct expertise of Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (LAIR)’s 28 federal agency members, this Roundtable has unique tools and opportunities to dismantle barriers to justice.

In so doing, we can make advances in public safety, food security, housing, employment, and so much more.

We know that excessively complicated government forms, processes, and language can be major contributors to unequal justice in this country. You should not need a legal background to seek help from your government — nor to understand what your government is asking of you.

That is why we gathered last year to discuss the Roundtable’s work in examining the ways in which the federal agencies can simplify forms and processes.

LAIR created a “Simplification Roadmap” to solidify the principles of placing real people at the center of efforts to design programs and communications. While this benefits individuals, of course, it also helps ensure that government services have their intended reach and impact.

At last year’s gathering, we also heard about some of the thoughtful approaches that member agencies were taking to implement this principle to improve their own programs.

I want to briefly highlight two Justice Department initiatives that LAIR’s simplification work has motivated since we last met — both with outstanding leadership from the Office for Access to Justice (ATJ).

First, ATJ partnered with the Office of the Pardon Attorney to improve the form that individuals who have completed their federal sentence may use to petition for a Presidential pardon.

ATJ and the Office of the Pardon Attorney conducted research on pardon simplification efforts at the state level. They facilitated interviews with experts and individuals who have applied for pardons in order to figure out what barriers exist and how to address them. As a result of this feedback, they created a revised form that we believe will be easier for applicants to understand and complete.

On November 15, the new form was released for public comment in the Federal Register. We plan to implement additional feedback from stakeholders before finalizing the form in the coming spring.

ATJ used a similar process to work with the U.S. Trustee Program (USTP) to improve access to virtual bankruptcy proceedings. Although remote hearings can expand access for some, they can also impede access for others.

ATJ and USTP worked with legal aid providers to understand what is working and what can be improved. Together, they developed a plan to improve the design of USTP’s public-facing information, including to let people know what to expect during these hearings.

This is just the beginning. ATJ will continue to collaborate with the Department’s components to embed simplification principles and expand access to programs and activities across the Department.

I am also pleased that this year, LAIR has focused on an area that is near and dear to the heart of this former D.C. Circuit judge, namely federal administrative proceedings.

From the bench, I reviewed hundreds of administrative law matters. I saw again and again the way in which the complexity of administrative processes can interfere with access to government programs and services.

This can be because applicants unknowingly submitted the wrong application forms, did not understand what evidence they needed, and missed deadlines they did know existed.

Over the past year, LAIR’s staff worked with stakeholders, legal aid providers, and others to identify these barriers and assess potential solutions to addressing them. The report issued today presents two overarching strategies for doing just that:

First, agencies should engage in continued simplification efforts in the context of administrative proceedings. They should make forms easier to find, make evidence requirements more straightforward, and more effectively explain what participants should expect in administrative proceedings.

Second, the report addresses ways that agencies can increase representation in administrative proceedings, so that those who find themselves before federal agencies have experienced guides to help them navigate.

Sometimes, representation can and should include lawyers. But sometimes, it can be provided just as well by nonlawyers. These include navigators, accredited representatives, and ombuds offices.

Engaging in expanding the scope of who can provide guidance alleviates the strain on already overextended legal aid providers and expands more access to representation to more people.

The report issued today highlights the innovative ways in which your agencies are already making improvements. I look forward to hearing more this afternoon about your efforts and your progress.

Before I close, I want to recognize the Director of our Office for Access to Justice, Rachel Rossi; Executive Director of the Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable, Allie Yang-Green; and the entire ATJ staff for their efforts over the past two years to stand up and support this Roundtable.

When I reestablished ATJ, I certainly did not guess that in just two years it would become central to the whole-of-government effort to improve access to justice.

ATJ’s work — and the work that each of your agencies is doing — is essential. It is essential to building and sustaining public trust in the government, which is itself essential to ensuring the rule of law.

I look forward to hearing from everyone today. It is an honor to work alongside you."
35,White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable Issues Report,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/white-house-legal-aid-interagency-roundtable-issues-report,"Today, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and White House Counsel Ed Siskel co-chaired a convening of the Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (LAIR) where they announced the issuance of the 2023 LAIR Report, entitled Access to Justice in Federal Administrative Proceedings: Nonlawyer Assistance and Other Strategies. The Justice Department’s Office for Access to Justice facilitated the convening, which also featured remarks from Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, as well as the publication of the report, in accordance with the office’s directive to staff and direct the work of LAIR at the direction of the co-chairs.

“There cannot be equal justice without equal access to justice,” said Attorney General Garland. “But the complexity of administrative processes can interfere with access to government programs and services. The Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable’s 2023 Report identifies important strategies for addressing these barriers to promote just outcomes for the people and communities that federal agencies serve.”

The report highlights agency accomplishments and commitments in furtherance of LAIR’s mission to “increase the availability of meaningful access to justice for individuals and families, regardless of wealth or status.” It describes challenges individuals face in federal administrative proceedings to access government benefits or services, remedy rights violations or resolve disputes. The report also sets forth strategic solutions and highlights the work of LAIR’s 28 federal agency members to address these barriers.

“Community-focused alternative legal assistance models are an important way to augment the reach of legal aid providers,” said Associate Attorney General Gupta during the convening. “LAIR’s work reveals that many federal agencies have long utilized this type of innovative assistance — facilitating both attorney and non-attorney help to expand access to a wide range of federal government programs and resources.”

To help address these challenges, LAIR identifies two overarching strategies through the report:

Continue to develop and implement simplification strategies in administrative proceedings, building on LAIR’s 2022 work on people-centered simplification of government forms, processes, and language to increase access to government programs and reduce the need for legal help. Increase representation and assistance by lawyers and nonlawyers for people in administrative proceedings.

The report provides examples of LAIR agency activities supporting nonlawyer assistance and offers ways that agencies can make assistance available to more people by addressing accreditation, providing clear guidance on the allowability of nonlawyers, conducting targeted outreach, providing training resources, and funding nonlawyer programs alongside legal service programs. The report also shares LAIR agencies’ work supporting global efforts to advance access to justice in administrative proceedings.

“The Office for Access to Justice is committed to engaging with and learning from communities that are seeking access to government programs and services, as well as working with the legal aid and community service providers as trusted intermediaries,” said Office for Access to Justice Director Rachel Rossi. “Through LAIR’s work, we can better understand where barriers exist and identify persistent or recurring problems that affect impacted, underserved, and historically marginalized communities.”

At the convening, in addition to Attorney General Garland and Associate Attorney General Gupta, remarks were provided by the Second Gentleman of the United States, Douglas Emhoff. The roundtable, moderated by Director Rossi, also featured several LAIR agency principals and high-level officials from the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, State, and Veterans’ Affairs as well as the Administrative Conference of the United States, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Management and Budget, United States Digital Service, AmeriCorps, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, National Science Foundation, and United States Agency for International Development.

During the convening, agency principals and high-level officials discussed their activities and recent accomplishments to address access to justice challenges experienced by the people they serve and reaffirmed their commitment to collaborative efforts to mobilize resources and develop access to justice solutions.

LAIR is co-chaired by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and White House Counsel Ed Siskel. It convenes 28 federal agencies and offices to improve coordination among federal programs and increase availability of meaningful access to justice for individuals and families, regardless of wealth and status. Through interagency collaboration and stakeholder engagement, LAIR develops policy recommendations that improve access to justice in federal, state, local, Tribal, and international jurisdictions; advances relevant evidence-based research, data collection, and analysis of civil legal and indigent defense; and promulgates best practices. Additionally, LAIR assists with implementation of Goal 16 of the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development and provide access to justice for all. The Office for Access to Justice houses the Executive Director of LAIR, Allie Yang-Green, and staffs and directs LAIR’s work."
36,Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta Delivers Remarks at the Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/associate-attorney-general-vanita-gupta-delivers-remarks-legal-aid-interagency,"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery

Thank you, Attorney General Garland and White House Counsel Ed Siskel for convening us today. Thank you to the Second Gentleman for amplifying the need for access to justice across government. And of course, thank you to the Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (LAIR) members who make the work of this body real.

I also want to recognize all the people working behind the scenes. At the Justice Department, under Director Rachel Rossi’s leadership, our Office for Access to Justice (ATJ) has now grown to over 40 staff members. I want to thank Director Rachel Rossi for leading ATJ and the outstanding work the office has done over the last two years.

In addition to all their work on LAIR, just this past year ATJ published a report highlighting innovative approaches to reduce reliance on fines and fees, co-anchored a review of access to counsel in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and worked with the National Institute of Justice on a report evaluating public defense across the country. ATJ staff are here in force today to show their commitment to LAIR and its work.

As you have heard this afternoon, LAIR’s mission is to increase the availability of meaningful access to justice for individuals and families, regardless of wealth or status. LAIR puts that mission into practice by improving coordination among federal programs and funding sources; developing policy recommendations; advancing evidence-based research and data collection; and promulgating best practices.

This work is critical. Just last month, the World Justice Project released its annual ranking of countries on their compliance with various measures of the rule of law, including the accessibility and affordability of civil justice. Of 142 countries, the United States is 115th. Among the 46 wealthiest countries, the United States ranks 46th — let that sink in: we rank last on accessibility and affordability of civil justice. This means a lack of access to basic civil legal needs involving issues like housing and evictions, employment, or public benefits.

Yet, cross-sector and cross-agency collaboration, as we are demonstrating right here in this room, is a powerful tool to close this justice gap. Partnering across sectors of society and disciplines, and across federal agencies outside the legal profession and the Department of Justice alone, can open new doors, ideas, and strategies.

That is what LAIR’s work continues to reveal. In this year’s LAIR report, we addressed the use of nonlawyer assistance — shining a light on an innovative area ripe for discussion within the access to justice community, and also highlighting the longstanding leadership of the federal government in providing this type of assistance to close the justice gap.

We hear a lot these days about community-focused alternative legal assistance models being an important way to augment the reach of legal aid providers. LAIR’s work reveals that many federal agencies represented in this room have long utilized this type of innovative assistance — facilitating both attorney and non-attorney help to expand access to a wide range of federal government programs and resources.

A major benefit we have seen from LAIR is the ability of member agencies to learn about each other’s work and identify areas for future and continued collaboration. One of those areas is improved data collection and tracking, so that we may better understand access to justice gaps and resource needs and develop targeted solutions.

As noted in the 2023 report, going forward, LAIR will advance relevant evidence-based research and data collection, including by assisting with implementation of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

As we continue to pursue our collective mission to close the justice gap, LAIR serves as an example and a model, demonstrating how collaboration can promote creativity, research, better data, innovation, and new ideas to solve problems and close gaps.

The Justice Department looks forward to continued collaboration and engagement.

Thank you."
37,American Forests Partners with USDA Forest Service to Expand Reforestation across National Forests,https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/12/06/american-forests-partners-usda-forest-service-expand-reforestation,"$20 million agreement will help address 4-million-acre backlog of burned, damaged forests

Originally posted by American Forests

WASHINGTON - Today, American Forests announced a first-of-its-kind $20 million keystone agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service to help the agency organize and rapidly scale climate-adapted reforestation across millions of burned and degraded acres over the next five years.

Powered by the historic REPLANT Act, the comprehensive partnership will enable American Forests to aid the Forest Service to quickly assess, prioritize and plan for reforestation needs, fill gaps in climate-resilient restoration planning and bolster reforestation planning by expanding nursery production, growing the forestry workforce and increasing seed collection capabilities.

Activities under the partnership will include helping the Forest Service develop a climate-informed reforestation action plan for each region. The partners will also collaborate to engage and expand workforce and partnership opportunities with tribes and states, as well as rural and disadvantaged communities.

Enacted as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in late 2021, the REPLANT Act removed a cap on Forest Service funding for reforestation, allowing the agency to now access nearly ten times more in reforestation investments annually. American Forests helped catalyze the REPLANT Act, working in collaboration with bipartisan members of Congress.

“Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, USDA Forest Service and partners like American Forests are poised to make historic investments in reforestation as forests across the nation face extended droughts, catastrophic fires, pests and disease, all accelerated by climate change,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “The scale of this challenge means that we can’t do it alone, and this agreement is another step in making our forests – and communities – healthier, safer and more resilient.”

With this additional capacity, the Forest Service is now positioned to help address an estimated backlog of at least four million acres of National Forest System land in need of reforestation – a number that has jumped due to recent increases in severe wildfire.

“Reforestation is an important investment for the future and resiliency of forests across the country,” said Forest Service Chief Randy Moore. “This agreement with American Forests will help the agency reduce the backlog of reforestation needs to support wildfire and disaster recovery, identify future reforestation needs, and improve our ability to monitor the impact and outcomes of this important work.”

Together, the Forest Service and American Forests will use landscape-level planning and climate-informed restoration practices to advance goals identified in the agency’s National Forest System Reforestation Strategy (PDF, 7 MB) and Secretary Vilsack’s June 2022 Order, which directed the Forest Service to restore and create climate-resilient forests.

Across the U.S., a growing backlog of National Forest System lands need reforestation, driven in significant part by the escalating impact of climate change on U.S. forests. Large, high-severity wildfires are driving 81 percent of reforestation need on national forests, outpacing the agency’s capacity to restore these lands following such fires. Prior to the REPLANT Act, the Forest Service had only been able to address six percent of the reforestation backlog each year.

Building from the Forest Service’s National Reforestation Strategy, American Forests and the agency will develop 10-year REPLANT Act implementation plans designed to bring about tailored reforestation solutions for each region of the National Forest System. This new agreement provides a strategic launch point for implementing these solutions.

“American Forests is proud to lead on REPLANT Act implementation through this comprehensive partnership with the Forest Service,” said Jad Daley, president and CEO of American Forests. “Together, we will accelerate climate-smart reforestation across national forests, helping to restore the health of these priceless public lands.”

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6, 2023 – U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced ways the Biden-Harris Administration is fulfilling long-standing Tribal requests for USDA to support and better partner with Tribal Nations in empowering Tribal food sovereignty and co-stewardship of federal lands and waters. Secretary Vilsack announced the first grant recipients under the Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grant Program, as well as advances in Forest Service co-stewardship with Tribes, including 120 new agreements totaling more than $68 million in investments. Secretary Vilsack also announced the inaugural appointees of the new Tribal Advisory Committee.

Secretary Vilsack made the announcements at the 2023 White House Tribal Nations Summit, where Tribal leaders gathered for Nation-to-Nation conversations with President Biden and senior administration officials on key priorities, new policies and critical issues facing Tribal Nations.

“As Tribes have requested, we are reshaping our programs to incorporate Tribal and Indigenous perspectives, remove barriers, and encourage Tribal self-determination. USDA is working directly with Tribal Nations to support their decisions on how best to co-steward federal lands and forests and the traditions that have been passed down from ancestors and elders,” Secretary Vilsack said. “These investments will also create economic opportunities in Tribal communities, elevate the agency’s work to increase co-stewardship in forest management, while also increasing the availability of affordable, healthy protein sources from Indigenous animals that have been the backbone of Tribal food systems for generations.”

Coinciding with the White House Tribal Nations Summit, USDA shared a comprehensive list of USDA’s Indian Country accomplishments (PDF, 290 KB). This includes key efforts announced today:

USDA Announces Members of the Inaugural Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC)

Today, Secretary Vilsack, the Chair and Ranking member of Senate Indian Affairs, and the House and Senate Agricultural Committees named 11 new members to the inaugural USDA Tribal Advisory Committee. This is a permanent committee created by the 2018 Farm Bill to ensure Tribal perspectives are well represented at USDA and to ensure the Department’s policies and decisions are informed by the unique Nation-to-Nation relationship.

USDA Makes Historic Funding Available for Harvesting and Processing Indigenous Animals

Four Tribal Nations are receiving Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grants in the first round of funding announcements today:

The Alutiiq Tribe of Old Harbor in Alaska is receiving a $1 million grant to buy and modernize an unused processing facility that will help the community address food shortages due to climate change. Members of the Tribe live in a remote village accessible only by boat or small plane. Severe weather can delay food deliveries, and algae are depleting fishing stocks. The funding will allow the Tribe to increase the amount of local game and fish they can process using traditional methods. This includes meat from the Sitkalidak Bison Herd the Tribe manages.

The Tribal Government of St. Paul Island in Alaska is receiving a grant of more than $668,000 to re-establish a local reindeer meat processing operation at the Aleut Community Store. The Aleut community will use the grant to develop a program to harvest, process, market and sell local reindeer products. The project will increase the availability of locally sourced organic meat products and drive profits back to the island. It also will help Tribal members remember, relearn and practice traditional herding techniques important to the cultural heritage of the island.

The Tolowa Dee-ni’ Nation in southern Oregon and northern California is receiving a $2.4 million grant to expand a Food Sovereignty Program that provides the community a space and resources to learn traditional processing methods for local game and fish, including black-tailed deer, Roosevelt Elk and chinook salmon. The grant will allow the Tribe to pay for three staff positions, buy a mobile processing unit and outfit a recently built 6,000-square-foot Food Sovereignty Building with new equipment. The improvements will also allow the community, which doesn’t have a grocery store offering fresh produce or meat, to double the number of families they can feed.

The Assiniboine & Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana is receiving a grant of more than $191,000 to purchase a composter and walk-in freezer for the new Fort Peck meat processing facility, where they process bison, elk, deer, antelope and pheasant. The project will give people on the reservation a local Tribal-owned business for their meat processing and storage needs. The upgraded facility will also give the Fort Peck Tribes Fish and Game Department a local place to take bison to be processed and distributed to families in need.

Background: Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grant Program

USDA partnered with Oweesta Corp., a Native Community Development Financial Institution, to provide grants under the Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grant Program. Oweesta Corp. is selecting the grantees under the program.

USDA designed the program to support priorities voiced by Tribal Nations during consultations held over two years. It aims to expand processing opportunities using modern and traditional harvesting methods for animals native to North America such as bison, reindeer and salmon.

The program reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to work in partnership with Tribal Nations to advance prosperity and dignity for all Native peoples. It also supports the Administration’s priority to build a fairer, more competitive and more resilient food system by supporting local farms and businesses.

USDA Empowers Food Sovereignty and Bison Conservation

At the Summit, Secretary Vilsack announced a partnership with the Sitka Conservation Society to create a new curriculum to educate rural citizens, especially Alaska Native youth about the Federal Subsistence Management Board, which manage fish and wildlife for subsistence uses on federal public lands and waters in Alaska. Secretary Vilsack also announced a new public-private Tribal bison conservation partnership with the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). Both agencies are collaborating with the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC), Native Americans in Philanthropy (NAP), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), The Nature Conservancy, and other buffalo-focused nonprofit organizations. This relationship will improve upon the federal investments already being made by USDA-DOI Buffalo Initiative in grasslands and working lands restoration, Tribal buffalo conservation and expansion, and opening Tribal buffalo market opportunities.

Forest Service Significantly Expands Co-Stewardship Investments with Tribal Nations

In 2023, the Forest Service signed 120 new co-stewardship agreements, and nearly tripled annual co-stewardship investments with Tribal communities, to $68 million in Fiscal Year 2023, up from nearly $20 million in Fiscal Year 2022. These co-stewardship agreements align with Tribal priorities, like improving watersheds and wildlife habitat, managing invasive species, and addressing the conditions that fuel destructive wildfires. They also incorporate Indigenous knowledge like traditional plant management and ethnobotany, cultural interpretation, and traditional land stewardship methodologies and techniques.

These agreements mark important milestones in relationship-building with Tribal governments and are significant advancements in the co-stewardship of the ancestral lands of Tribal Nations. Highlights include:

Alaska: The Forest Service and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida have implemented a Memoranda of Understanding on co-stewardship of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area Federal Lands and Resources. This agreement will ensure that the history and cultural connection Tribes have to the glacier and the surrounding lands are represented through cooperative interpretive programs.

Minnesota: The Forest Service and the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (the Bands) entered a Memorandum of Understanding to provide for co-stewardship and protection of the Bands treaty-reserved rights under the 1854 Treaty. This agreement is the first between the Bands and the Forest Service. The Memorandum of Understanding recognizes the Bands as original stewards of lands now encompassing the Superior National Forest and outlines procedures to ensure that the Forest Service includes Tribal input into agency decision-making.

This agreement is the first between the Bands and the Forest Service. The Memorandum of Understanding recognizes the Bands as original stewards of lands now encompassing the Superior National Forest and outlines procedures to ensure that the Forest Service includes Tribal input into agency decision-making. South Dakota: Despite significant historical challenges in Tribal relationships, the Forest Service is joining with the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, Oglala Lakota Nation, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, and other Tribes to develop a co-stewardship agreement for the Pactola/He Sapa Visitor Center on the Black Hills National Forest. This Memorandum of Understanding will maximize opportunities for the participating Tribes to have a voice in telling their story, and provide a representation of Indigenous natural resource values, history, and culture to Black Hills National Forest visitors. It will further serve to educate agency staff, local communities, and the visiting public about the living legacy of the participating Nations.

Background: Forest Management Co-Stewardship

The Forest Service is implementing the “Strengthening Tribal Consultations and Nation-to-Nation Relationships: A USDA Forest Service Action Plan,” which elevates the agency’s work to increase co-stewardship with Tribes. The action plan guides the agency in fulfilling its general federal trust responsibilities, honoring treaty obligations, and supporting Tribal self-determination principles. It emphasizes the agency’s unique responsibility to ensure that decisions relating to federal stewardship of lands, waters, and wildlife examine how to safeguard the treaty rights and spiritual, subsistence and cultural interests of any federally recognized Tribe.

As part of this work, the Forest Service renamed the State & Private Forestry deputy chief area to State, Private, and Tribal Forestry. This symbolic move emphasizes the Forest Service’s commitment to elevating treaty obligations and respect for Tribal sovereignty to a paramount position within the agency’s culture and mission.

December 6, 2023 -

U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced ways the Biden-Harris Administration is fulfilling long-standing Tribal requests for USDA to support and better partner with Tribal Nations in empowering Tribal food sovereignty and co-stewardship of federal lands and waters. Secretary Vilsack announced the first grant recipients under the Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grant Program, as well as advances in Forest Service co-stewardship with Tribes, including 120 new agreements totaling more than $68 million in investments. Secretary Vilsack also announced the inaugural appointees of the new Tribal Advisory Committee.

Secretary Vilsack made the announcements at the 2023 White House Tribal Nations Summit, where Tribal leaders gathered for Nation-to-Nation conversations with President Biden and senior administration officials on key priorities, new policies and critical issues facing Tribal Nations.

“As Tribes have requested, we are reshaping our programs to incorporate Tribal and Indigenous perspectives, remove barriers, and encourage Tribal self-determination. USDA is working directly with Tribal Nations to support their decisions on how best to co-steward federal lands and forests and the traditions that have been passed down from ancestors and elders,” Secretary Vilsack said. “These investments will also create economic opportunities in Tribal communities, elevate the agency’s work to increase co-stewardship in forest management, while also increasing the availability of affordable, healthy protein sources from Indigenous animals that have been the backbone of Tribal food systems for generations.”

Coinciding with the White House Tribal Nations Summit, USDA shared a comprehensive list of USDA’s Indian Country accomplishments (PDF, 290 KB). This includes key efforts announced today:

USDA Announces Members of the Inaugural Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC)

Today, Secretary Vilsack, the Chair and Ranking member of Senate Indian Affairs, and the House and Senate Agricultural Committees named 11 new members to the inaugural USDA Tribal Advisory Committee. This is a permanent committee created by the 2018 Farm Bill to ensure Tribal perspectives are well represented at USDA and to ensure the Department’s policies and decisions are informed by the unique Nation-to-Nation relationship.

USDA Makes Historic Funding Available for Harvesting and Processing Indigenous Animals

Four Tribal Nations are receiving Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grants in the first round of funding announcements today:

The Alutiiq Tribe of Old Harbor in Alaska is receiving a $1 million grant to buy and modernize an unused processing facility that will help the community address food shortages due to climate change. Members of the Tribe live in a remote village accessible only by boat or small plane. Severe weather can delay food deliveries, and algae are depleting fishing stocks. The funding will allow the Tribe to increase the amount of local game and fish they can process using traditional methods. This includes meat from the Sitkalidak Bison Herd the Tribe manages.

The Tribal Government of St. Paul Island in Alaska is receiving a grant of more than $668,000 to re-establish a local reindeer meat processing operation at the Aleut Community Store. The Aleut community will use the grant to develop a program to harvest, process, market and sell local reindeer products. The project will increase the availability of locally sourced organic meat products and drive profits back to the island. It also will help Tribal members remember, relearn and practice traditional herding techniques important to the cultural heritage of the island.

The Tolowa Dee-ni’ Nation in southern Oregon and northern California is receiving a $2.4 million grant to expand a Food Sovereignty Program that provides the community a space and resources to learn traditional processing methods for local game and fish, including black-tailed deer, Roosevelt Elk and chinook salmon. The grant will allow the Tribe to pay for three staff positions, buy a mobile processing unit and outfit a recently built 6,000-square-foot Food Sovereignty Building with new equipment. The improvements will also allow the community, which doesn’t have a grocery store offering fresh produce or meat, to double the number of families they can feed.

The Assiniboine & Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana is receiving a grant of more than $191,000 to purchase a composter and walk-in freezer for the new Fort Peck meat processing facility, where they process bison, elk, deer, antelope and pheasant. The project will give people on the reservation a local Tribal-owned business for their meat processing and storage needs. The upgraded facility will also give the Fort Peck Tribes Fish and Game Department a local place to take bison to be processed and distributed to families in need.

Background: Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grant Program

USDA partnered with Oweesta Corp., a Native Community Development Financial Institution, to provide grants under the Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grant Program. Oweesta Corp. is selecting the grantees under the program.

USDA designed the program to support priorities voiced by Tribal Nations during consultations held over two years. It aims to expand processing opportunities using modern and traditional harvesting methods for animals native to North America such as bison, reindeer and salmon.

The program reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to work in partnership with Tribal Nations to advance prosperity and dignity for all Native peoples. It also supports the Administration’s priority to build a fairer, more competitive and more resilient food system by supporting local farms and businesses.

USDA Empowers Food Sovereignty and Bison Conservation

At the Summit, Secretary Vilsack announced a partnership with the Sitka Conservation Society to create a new curriculum to educate rural citizens, especially Alaska Native youth about the Federal Subsistence Management Board, which manage fish and wildlife for subsistence uses on federal public lands and waters in Alaska. Secretary Vilsack also announced a new public-private Tribal bison conservation partnership with the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). Both agencies are collaborating with the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC), Native Americans in Philanthropy (NAP), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), The Nature Conservancy, and other buffalo-focused nonprofit organizations. This relationship will improve upon the federal investments already being made by USDA-DOI Buffalo Initiative in grasslands and working lands restoration, Tribal buffalo conservation and expansion, and opening Tribal buffalo market opportunities.

Forest Service Significantly Expands Co-Stewardship Investments with Tribal Nations

In 2023, the Forest Service signed 120 new co-stewardship agreements, and nearly tripled annual co-stewardship investments with Tribal communities, to $68 million in Fiscal Year 2023, up from nearly $20 million in Fiscal Year 2022. These co-stewardship agreements align with Tribal priorities, like improving watersheds and wildlife habitat, managing invasive species, and addressing the conditions that fuel destructive wildfires. They also incorporate Indigenous knowledge like traditional plant management and ethnobotany, cultural interpretation, and traditional land stewardship methodologies and techniques.

These agreements mark important milestones in relationship-building with Tribal governments and are significant advancements in the co-stewardship of the ancestral lands of Tribal Nations. Highlights include:

Alaska: The Forest Service and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida have implemented a Memoranda of Understanding on co-stewardship of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area Federal Lands and Resources. This agreement will ensure that the history and cultural connection Tribes have to the glacier and the surrounding lands are represented through cooperative interpretive programs.

Minnesota: The Forest Service and the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (the Bands) entered a Memorandum of Understanding to provide for co-stewardship and protection of the Bands treaty-reserved rights under the 1854 Treaty. This agreement is the first between the Bands and the Forest Service. The Memorandum of Understanding recognizes the Bands as original stewards of lands now encompassing the Superior National Forest and outlines procedures to ensure that the Forest Service includes Tribal input into agency decision-making.

South Dakota: Despite significant historical challenges in Tribal relationships, the Forest Service is joining with the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, Oglala Lakota Nation, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, and other Tribes to develop a co-stewardship agreement for the Pactola/He Sapa Visitor Center on the Black Hills National Forest. This Memorandum of Understanding will maximize opportunities for the participating Tribes to have a voice in telling their story, and provide a representation of Indigenous natural resource values, history, and culture to Black Hills National Forest visitors. It will further serve to educate agency staff, local communities, and the visiting public about the living legacy of the participating Nations.

Background: Forest Management Co-Stewardship

The Forest Service is implementing the “Strengthening Tribal Consultations and Nation-to-Nation Relationships: A USDA Forest Service Action Plan,” which elevates the agency’s work to increase co-stewardship with Tribes. The action plan guides the agency in fulfilling its general federal trust responsibilities, honoring treaty obligations, and supporting Tribal self-determination principles. It emphasizes the agency’s unique responsibility to ensure that decisions relating to federal stewardship of lands, waters, and wildlife examine how to safeguard the treaty rights and spiritual, subsistence and cultural interests of any federally recognized Tribe.

As part of this work, the Forest Service renamed the State & Private Forestry deputy chief area to State, Private, and Tribal Forestry. This symbolic move emphasizes the Forest Service’s commitment to elevating treaty obligations and respect for Tribal sovereignty to a paramount position within the agency’s culture and mission.

Owner of Cross Island Fruits withholds information about pay practices

CENTRAL ISLIP, NY – The owner of a Lynbrook grocery store believed they could ignore requests from the U.S. Department of Labor and a federal court in New York to cooperate with an investigation of their company’s pay practices.

When the U.S. Marshals Service arrested and took Joseph Rossi into custody on Dec. 5, 2023, for repeatedly failing to provide information to the department’s Wage and Hour Division as part of a compliance investigation, the owner of Cross Island Fruits found out how wrong this belief was.

“Joseph Rossi now knows that refusing to comply with a federal investigation can have significant consequences, including arrest,” said Regional Solicitor of Labor Jeffrey S. Rogoff in New York. “Rossi’s arrest shows the U.S. Department of Labor is committed to using every available and appropriate legal tool to gather the facts, enforce the law and make sure employers do not hold the law in contempt.”

Although the department issued an administrative subpoena to obtain documents to determine if the pay practices of Rossi’s business complied with the Fair Labor Standards Act, the employer refused repeatedly to supply the subpoenaed documents. In response, the department’s Office of the Solicitor took the following actions in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York:

“The Wage and Hour Division must have access to an employer’s records to determine if their pay practices and employment operations comply with federal law,” explained Wage and Hour Division Regional Administrator Mark Watson Jr. in Philadelphia. “Employers cannot avoid their legal responsibilities by refusing to cooperate with investigators and withholding records they request.”

Cross Island Fruits is a grocery store located at 246 Hempstead Ave. in Lynbrook, New York.

The FLSA requires that most employees in the U.S. be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime pay at not less than time and one-half the required rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

44,HHS Announces Next Steps in Ongoing Work to Enhance Cybersecurity for Health Care and Public Health Sectors,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/12/06/hhs-announces-next-steps-ongoing-work-enhance-cybersecurity-health-care-public-health-sectors.html,"Concept paper highlights ongoing and planned steps to improve cyber resiliency and protect patient safety.
WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today released a concept paper that outlines the Department’s cybersecurity strategy for the health care sector. The concept paper builds on the National Cybersecurity Strategy that President Biden released last year, focusing specifically on strengthening resilience for hospitals, patients, and communities threatened by cyber-attacks. The paper details four pillars for action, including publishing new voluntary health care-specific cybersecurity performance goals, working with Congress to develop supports and incentives for domestic hospitals to improve cybersecurity, and increasing accountability and coordination within the health care sector.
According to the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR), cyber incidents in health care are on the rise. From 2018-2022, there has been a 93% increase in large breaches reported to OCR (369 to 712), with a 278% increase in large breaches involving ransomware. Cyber incidents affecting hospitals and health systems have led to extended care disruptions, patient diversions to other facilities, and delayed medical procedures, all putting patient safety at risk.
“Since entering office, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to strengthen the nation’s defenses against cyberattacks. The health care sector is particularly vulnerable, and the stakes are especially high. Our commitment to this work reflects that urgency and importance,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “HHS is working with health care and public health partners to bolster our cyber security capabilities nationwide. We are taking necessary actions that will make a big difference for the hospitals, patients, and communities who are being impacted.”
“Hospitals across the country have experienced cyberattacks, leading to cancelled medical treatments and stolen medical records. Such impacts are preventable – to keep Americans safe, the Biden-Harris Administration is establishing strong cybersecurity standards for health care organizations and enhancing resources to improve cyber resiliency across the health sector, including working with Congress to provide financial support for hospitals. Today’s announcement by HHS builds on Biden-Harris Administration’s work to operationalize smart cybersecurity practices in our nation’s most critical sectors, like pipelines, aviation, and rail systems,” said Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technologies.
“The health care sector is experiencing a significant rise in cyberattacks, putting patient safety at risk. These attacks expose vulnerabilities in our health care system, degrade patient trust, and ultimately endanger patient safety,” said HHS Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm. “HHS takes these threats very seriously, and we are taking steps that will ensure our hospitals, patients, and communities impacted by cyberattacks are better prepared and more secure.”
The HHS concept paper outlines the following actions:
Publish voluntary Health care and Public Health sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (HPH CPGs). HHS will release HPH CPGs to help health care institutions plan and prioritize implementation of high-impact cybersecurity practices.
Provide resources to incentivize and implement cybersecurity practices. HHS will work with Congress to obtain new authority and funding to administer financial support and incentives for domestic hospitals to implement high-impact cybersecurity practices.
Implement an HHS-wide strategy to support greater enforcement and accountability. HHS will propose new enforceable cybersecurity standards, informed by the HPH CPGs, that would be incorporated into existing programs, including Medicare and Medicaid and the HIPAA Security Rule.
Expand and mature the one-stop shop within HHS for healthcare sector cybersecurity. HHS will mature the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response’s (ASPR) coordination role as a “one-stop shop” for health care cybersecurity which will improve coordination within HHS and the Federal Government, deepen HHS and the Federal government’s partnership with industry, improve access and uptake of government support and services, and increase HHS’s incident response capabilities.

ACA Marketplace National Enrollment Snapshot
Nearly 7.3 million people have selected an Affordable Care Act (ACA) Health Insurance Marketplace plan since the 2024 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period (OEP) opened on November 1. This represents activity through December 2 (Week 5) for the 32 states using HealthCare.gov and through November 25 (Week 4) for the 18 states and the District of Columbia with State-based Marketplaces (SBMs). Total plan selections include more than 1.6 million people (23% of total) who are new to the Marketplaces for 2024, and 5.7 million people (77% of total) who have active 2023 coverage and returned to their respective Marketplaces to renew their coverage or select a new plan for 2024.
The 2024 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period runs from November 1, 2023, to January 15, 2024, for states using the HealthCare.gov platform. Consumers who enroll by midnight on December 15 can get full-year coverage that starts January 1, 2024. State-based Marketplace enrollment deadlines vary. State-specific deadlines and other information are available in the State-based Marketplace Open Enrollment Fact Sheet - PDF.
“On top of last year’s record numbers, enrollment for Marketplace health insurance at HealthCare.gov is again exceeding expectations,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Health care coverage means peace of mind. It means protection. And now, thanks to the historic Inflation Reduction Act, more Americans than ever can sign up for coverage with lower costs and better benefits. There’s still time, so I urge you to shop at HealthCare.gov and sign up for a health plan that meets your needs and your pocketbook.”
“I’m thrilled that more than 7 million people have signed up for Marketplace coverage nationwide since Open Enrollment began. The continued increase in enrollment is confirmation that the need for affordable, quality health care coverage is strong,” CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said. “I encourage those who are seeking health care coverage to visit HealthCare.gov before the December 15 deadline for their coverage to begin on January 1.”
The Biden-Harris Administration has continued its commitment to making health insurance available and affordable to everyone, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan continue to keep Marketplace coverage affordable. The administration continues to issue Navigator Awards, allowing organizations to hire staff who are trained to help consumers find affordable, comprehensive health coverage. Navigators, as they are known, have been key to helping consumers in every Marketplace state.
The Biden-Harris Administration encourages all families to visit HealthCare.gov and check out the health care coverage options and savings available to them. Because of continuing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, CMS expects 9 out of 10 customers to be eligible for savings. People with current coverage through HealthCare.gov are encouraged to return and shop to see if another plan better meets their needs at a lower cost.
Many people are eligible for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), however those who are no longer eligible for Medicaid or CHIP should visit HealthCare.gov to see if they are eligible to enroll in a low-cost, quality health plan today.
Individuals will also benefit from a highly competitive Marketplace. More than 90% of HealthCare.gov enrollees will be able to choose among three or more plans. Standardized plan options are available and offer the same deductibles and cost-sharing for certain benefits. These plans have the same out-of-pocket limits as other standardized plans within the same health plan category, making it easier for consumers to compare and choose plans. Most of these standardized plan options offer many services pre-deductible, including primary care, generic drugs, preferred brand drugs, urgent care, specialist visits, mental health and substance use outpatient office visits, as well as speech, occupational, and physical therapies.
Individuals can enroll or re-enroll in health insurance coverage for 2024 by visiting HealthCare.gov, or CuidadoDeSalud.gov, or by calling 1-800-318-2596 to fill out an application. Individuals wanting assistance signing up for coverage may go to Find Local Help on HealthCare.gov to find a Navigator, Certified Application Counselor, or agent or broker: https://www.healthcare.gov/find-assistance/.

DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES – During the 28th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, more than 30 countries launched the COP28 Declaration of Intent on the Mutual Recognition of Certification Schemes for Renewable and Low-Carbon Hydrogen and Hydrogen Derivatives.  Recognizing the key role of clean hydrogen in global decarbonization and meeting global energy needs, endorsers of the declaration seek to work toward mutual recognition of hydrogen certification schemes to help facilitate a global market.   The United States, which uses the term “clean hydrogen” rather than “low-carbon hydrogen” nationally, understands “low-carbon” in this document and others as inclusive of hydrogen produced with renewable energy, nuclear energy, or carbon capture and storage, and therefore not inclusive of hydrogen produced with unabated fossil energy, including natural gas. The United States along with many international partners emphasizes the importance of robust scientific assessments of lifecycle climate impacts of hydrogen, which a supplemental briefing document underlines. It will be important for future certification schemes and standards to reflect the best available science on the lifecycle climate impacts of hydrogen and its derivatives, including indirect impacts on GHG concentrations due to leaks. The United States looks forward to ongoing engagement with international partners to work toward the important goal of enabling mutual recognition of certification schemes.  The full text of the declaration is included below.

certification schemes for renewable and/or low-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives to support their respective hydrogen strategies and roadmaps, as well as the relevant enabling frameworks;   Considering that convergence towards a minimum set of fundamental design principles for certification schemes can address the risks of potential market fragmentation delaying the development of a global market for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives;   Considering the role of certification in increasing investor confidence in hydrogen as a new asset class;   Affirming the importance of a mutual recognition of certification schemes based on key principles that recognizes diverse policy choices with regards to strategies, roadmaps, policies and legislation for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives adopted by the Participants;  In recognition of the considerations listed above, declare their intention as follows:  In order to pave the way for development of a global market renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives, the Participants seek to work towards mutual recognition of their respective certification schemes;  The Participants seek accelerated development of technical solutions to enable mutual recognition of their certification schemes, including through cooperation of the Participants with and under the framework of the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE) and the Hydrogen Technology Cooperation Programme (Hydrogen TCP);  The Participants seek to, where possible, nominate government experts to IPHE and Hydrogen TCP to facilitate the development of relevant solutions for mutual recognition of their certification schemes for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives;  The Participants may consider further steps to support the process of mutual recognition of certification schemes, including by taking into account the adoption of or consistency with globally recognised standards, such as the ISO methodology for determining the GHG emissions associated with the production and transport of hydrogen;  The Participants intend to monitor progress on cooperation towards mutual recognition of certification schemes on an annual basis.  Participants   Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Australia, Belgium, Brunei, Brazil,

55,DHS Releases Physical Security Performance Goals for Faith-Based Communities,https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/12/06/dhs-releases-physical-security-performance-goals-faith-based-communities,"Developed by CISA, Performance Goals are Tailored for Faith-Based Organizations to Enhance Security

WASHINGTON – Building on longstanding efforts and redoubling work to support faith-based communities in response to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), released new resources to help houses of worship and other faith-based organizations enhance their security. These Physical Security Performance Goals – modeled after the successful Cybersecurity Performance Goals – are a collection of cost-effective actions specifically tailored for faith-based organizations that can be implemented to reduce risk without sacrificing accessibility. This is the latest resource the Biden-Harris Administration is offering to faith-based organizations in response to the current heightened threat environment.

“In this continued heightened threat environment, the Department of Homeland Security is committed to protecting every American’s right to live, express, and worship their faith freely and in safety,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “The physical security performance goals we are releasing today provide churches, synagogues, mosques, and other faith-based institutions with cost-effective, accessible, and readily implementable strategies to enhance their security and reduce the risk to their communities. I strongly urge all faith-based institutions to take advantage of this new resource and incorporate the security practices it outlines.”

“CISA remains fully committed to its longstanding partnership with faith-based leaders to advance the protection of houses of worship while preserving their open and welcoming environments,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “The agency has a long track record of supporting faith-based communities in improving physical and cyber security practices. These performance goals are the latest example.”

Because Houses of Worship are the center for regular faith-based services and gatherings across the country, they are vulnerable as potential targets for malicious actors. The Physical Security Performance Goals for Faith-Based Organizations establish a baseline set of security practices to help houses of worship plan for, protect against, and respond to threats. Understanding that all facilities are different, the goals allow organizations to create tailored, actionable plans that will address their specific needs and serve their community.

“While the threat environment continues to be challenging across all faiths, houses of worship and other faith-based organizations and people are often targets. Preparedness is key to mitigating risk,” said Mayya Saab, Executive Director of the Faith-Based Information Sharing and Analysis Organization and DHS Faith-Based Security Advisory Council Member. “The Physical Security Performance Goals for Faith-Based Communities resource provides a visual guide to a goal setting activity that can help houses of worship and faith-based organizations prioritize security goals based on understanding their unique risk. The guide will be especially helpful to less resourced houses of worship.”

“The Secure Community Network is proud to partner with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure the highest quality guidance for faith-based communities amidst a time of increased threat of hate and violence,” said Michael Masters, Secure Community Network National Director & CEO and DHS Faith-Based Security Advisory Council Member. “The opportunity to offer our organizational expertise throughout this process reflects the commitment of the Department and its leadership to ensure the safety and security of faith-based communities across the country. DHS guidance continues to set a high standard and example that our community is proud to follow, and we look forward to the work of our continued partnership.”

“This Physical Security Performance Goals for Faith-Based Communities is a clear, concise, and convenient tool that is outstanding for any religious organization seeking to establish performance goals and protocols for response,” said Ako Cromwell, Director of Global Security, African Methodist Episcopal Church. “While it is particularly useful for those of us in the faith-based community, the fundamentals delineated in this product are applicable across the spectrum for security professionals. As always, we are most grateful to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas, and all our Department of Homeland Security partners for their tireless efforts to keep us informed and secure.”

“Threats to houses of worship in the United States are increasingly complex and widespread, ranging from domestic hate ideologies to challenges intensified by transnational repression and geopolitical events,” said Sim J. Singh Attariwala, Senior Policy and Advocacy Manager of the Sikh Coalition. “We maintain that the federal government plays a pivotal role in safeguarding our communities. This responsibility includes providing comprehensive and accessible resources, such as this document, to address both home-grown and international threats effectively.”

As the Israel-Hamas conflict has escalated, DHS has met with hundreds of community leaders in addition to coordinating with state and local enforcement and has disseminated Departmental resources to ensure faith-based communities can access available resources in one place. The Department continues to engage with communities through our Faith-Based Security Advisory Council and through the Protecting Places of Worship initiative, an effort co-led by DHS, the Department of Justice and the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Through CISA’s regional security advisors, the Department also provides resources such as conducting assistance visits, vulnerability assessments, providing training, security and threat awareness and help to develop drills and exercises. Additionally, through the Department’s CP3 regional prevention coordinators, the Department shares information with community leaders on how to prevent acts of violence at the earliest possible stage.

In recent years, CISA has significantly increased its regional presence to meet the needs of stakeholders, including in faith-based communities, and regularly conducts extensive outreach to raise awareness of the available tools and resources that CISA makes available. You can read more about CISA's support to faith-based communities on CISA.gov."
56,Secretary Mayorkas Delivers Remarks at U.S. Department of Justice Press Conference,https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/12/06/secretary-mayorkas-delivers-remarks-us-department-justice-press-conference,"Secretary Mayorkas delivered the following remarks at a press conference announcing war crimes indictments at the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.

Thank you very much, Attorney General Garland.

In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security and its Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI, created the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center – the only U.S. government entity focused entirely on investigating these global atrocities. For 15 years, this select group of special agents, attorneys, intelligence analysts, criminal research specialists, and historians from across the federal government have worked together and with their international counterparts to hold those who engage in the perpetration of war crimes, genocide, torture, and other human rights violations accountable.

Today, an investigation more than a year in the making by this Center and its federal partners bears fruit. For the first time in our nation’s history, federal agents gathered sufficient evidence to bring charges of war crimes perpetrated against an American citizen – in violation of Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 2441. The allegations… detail gruesome events.

The agents who made this case possible were tireless in their investigation, giving extraordinary attention to every detail, and making considerable sacrifices throughout.

In August 2022, these HSI agents traveled with their DOJ and FBI partners to speak with an American citizen who had recently been evacuated from Ukraine, where he had been living with his wife.

The U.S. citizen told our HSI agents how, a few months earlier, he had been violently abducted from his home in the village of Mylove by members of the Russian armed forces. He told HSI investigators… that these Russians had stripped him naked, threw him face down to the ground, tied his hands behind his back, pointed a gun at his head, and severely beat him, including with the stocks of their guns.

The Russian soldiers then took him to a nearby Russian military compound and held him there illegally for 10 days. He reported that, while in forced captivity, he was subjected to two interrogation sessions, during which he was tortured by the four defendants named today. He reported that the Russian defendants had again stripped him naked, photographed him, and severely beat him about the chest and stomach.

One defendant staged a mock execution of him. After asking for the victim’s last words, one of the defendants named today forced the victim to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head, and pulled the trigger – purposely missing the victim’s head by mere inches.

Throughout this past year, our HSI agents, with the assistance of HSI’s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center and alongside our FBI partners, have worked to corroborate the victim’s allegations. They traveled internationally to interview the victim’s family. They identified and interviewed individuals who were present within the general vicinity of Mylove around the time the victim was held in captivity, who confirmed the Russian forces’ occupation in the area.

Based on the information they obtained, the HSI agents and their FBI partners were able to identify the four defendants whose indictments are announced today.

I am extraordinarily proud of these federal law enforcement agents. Thanks to their exceptional work, the United States will hold the Russian perpetrators of this unthinkable mistreatment, these unacceptable human rights violations, accountable.

The work of these agents, and the indictments unsealed today, speak to two fundamental truths.

First: there is no higher responsibility of government than to safeguard its people and their basic human rights. As today’s announcement makes clear, when an American citizen’s human rights are violated, their government will spare no effort, and spare no resources, to bring the perpetrators to justice.

Second: the evidence gathered by our agents speaks to the brutality, criminality, and depravity of Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian people have had, and must continue to have, America’s full support against Russia’s unjust, unprovoked, and unlawful war of aggression. We cannot allow such horrific crimes to be ignored; to do so would only increase the risk they will be repeated.

It is now my honor to introduce Chris Wray, the Director of the FBI.

57,Beware of Disaster Fraud,https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20231206/beware-disaster-fraud,"CHICAGO – After disasters, fraudulent activity typically increases, and con artists may try to get money from you or ask for your personal information to try and steal your identity. If your home or personal property was damaged in the September 17 – 18 storms and flooding, be careful when giving out your personal information.

Remember, FEMA, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), and other federal and state disaster workers will never ask for money and never require payment in any form.

Fraudulent Applications

If a FEMA inspector comes to your home and you did not submit a FEMA application, your information may have been used without your knowledge to create a FEMA application. If this happens, inform the inspector that you did not apply for FEMA assistance, so they can submit a request to stop further processing of the application.

If you did not apply for assistance but receive a letter from FEMA, call the FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362. If you use video relay service, captioned telephone service or others, give FEMA your number for that service. The Helpline will submit a request to stop any further processing of that application.

Other Disaster-Related Scams

FEMA crews, housing inspectors and other officials will be working in areas affected by the September 17 - 18 storms and flooding. Always ask to see I.D. FEMA personnel always have an official identification badge.

Be careful of unexpected phone calls or visits to your home from people claiming they work for FEMA. If unsure whether a visit or call is legitimate, contact the FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362 to verify.

Take Action



If you believe you are the victim of a scam, report it immediately to your local police or sheriff’s department.

They don't live in a high-risk flood zone. But flooding can happen anywhere, often to the surprise of residents who thought they were covered for disaster. When flooding happens, the damage is typically not covered by most standard homeowners' insurance policies. One inch of floodwater can cause up to $25,000 of damage in a home.

Flooding in Florida is common. After Hurricane Idalia, more than 5,000 flood claims were filed through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) with a total payout over $300 million to date, closing over 85% of the NFIP claims in the first 90 days after the event. In all, the Hazard Mitigation Community Education & Outreach has counseled over 11,000 survivors on the NFIP and other mitigation measures. The flood insurance program has more than 1.7 million policyholders across the state with total coverage exceeding $448 billion.

Residential and business property owners as well as renters can protect themselves from financial losses by having a flood insurance policy through the NFIP to insure buildings and/or their contents. Flood insurance coverage is available regardless of federal disaster declarations. There is a 30-day waiting period before new policies go into effect, so don't wait to obtain a policy.

In Florida, 468 communities participate in the NFIP; 10 communities do not. Residents can purchase a flood insurance policy if their community participates in the NFIP, no matter their flood risk. Coverage is available for residential and commercial buildings and the contents therein:

Up to $250,000 in building coverage and up to $100,000 in contents coverage for single-to-four family residential structures.

Up to $500,000 in building coverage and up to $500,000 in contents coverage for five-or-more family residential structures.

Up to $500,000 in building coverage and up to $500,000 in contents coverage for businesses.

As part of its disaster assistance, FEMA has provided Group Flood Insurance Policies (GFIP) to homeowners and renters after Hurricane Idalia. The group policies are 36-month NFIP insurance certificates for disaster survivors who live in a high-risk flood zone, sustain flood damage, do not have flood insurance, and receive FEMA disaster assistance. When a GFIP certificate expires, the survivor is responsible for obtaining and maintaining flood insurance. Failure to maintain flood insurance will affect their eligibility for future disaster assistance.

To purchase a policy, contact your insurance company or agent. In addition to the NFIP, flood insurance is also available from some private insurance providers. For an agent referral, call 800-427-4661 or visit https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance.

Selected projects must be located in underserved communities within the five Gulf states of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. Eligible projects for the newly created Healthy & Resilient Gulf of Mexico Grant program include those that support water quality improvement; habitat protection, enhancement and restoration; environmental education; and community resilience.“This historic funding will bring critical health protections, progress on shoreline and wetland restoration, jobs, and economic opportunities to the communities in the Gulf who have been overburdened by pollution,” said Acting Region 4 Administrator Jeaneanne M. Gettle. “We look forward to seeing the transformative projects that will work to advance protection and restoration of this vital watershed.” “Vulnerable Gulf Coast communities deeply understand the environmental harms they live with every day, and they are ready for solutions,” said Region 6 Administrator Dr. Earthea Nance. “This funding will provide investments in coastline habitats, water quality, and community resilience, thereby laying the foundation for a vital coastal ecosystem.”The EPA plans to award approximately five grants of up to $6 million each to eligible state agencies, interstate agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes, tribal organizations, local governments, and institutions of higher learning.

61,EPA takes action against Connecticut-based school bus transportation company for idling violations,https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-action-against-connecticut-based-school-bus-transportation-company-idling,"BOSTON (Dec. 6, 2023) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently reached a settlement with All Star Transportation, a Connecticut-based school bus transportation company, that violated state and federal clean air standards by allegedly allowing excessive idling of school buses at two locations in Connecticut. “Cutting down on pollution is a crucial part of achieving clean air, especially for children and for our communities who bear the brunt of this pollution,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator David W. Cash. “With settlements like this one, and through our efforts to replace diesel school buses with electric buses, EPA continues to make good on our mission to protect our communities’ basic rights to clean air and a clean environment.”All-Star Transportation, LLC is a company that owns and operates fleets of school buses in eighteen Connecticut communities. Under the terms of the settlement, All-Star Transportation, based in Waterbury, agreed to pay a penalty of $64,833 and certify compliance with state regulations. The settlement also requires the company to adopt a series of compliance measures at all its facilities. These include tracking school bus idling time via a telematics system; posting clear signage; updating driver training, including documenting any applicable regulatory exceptions when exceeding idling limit; conducting regular examinations of bus lots to prevent future violations; and addressing driver noncompliance.Connecticut's federally enforceable State Implementation Plan contains an anti-idling regulation that prohibits motor vehicles from idling for longer than three minutes, unless a specifically listed exception applies. EPA alleged that it observed 76 of All-Star’s school buses idling excessively during EPA’s investigation in New Milford and Brookfield, Conn., totaling more than 780 excess minutes. BackgroundIdling diesel engines emit pollutants that can cause or aggravate a variety of health problems including asthma and other respiratory diseases, and the fine particles in diesel exhaust are a likely human carcinogen. Diesel exhaust not only contributes to area-wide air quality problems, but more direct exposure can cause lightheadedness, nausea, sore throat, coughing, and other symptoms. Drivers, school children riding on the buses, facility workers, neighbors, and bystanders are all vulnerable.More information:EPA School Bus Idle ReductionExit EPA’s website"
62,Lockheed Martin,https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2023-12-05-successful-jagm-mr-guided-flight-test-demonstrates-tri-mode-seeker,"Successful JAGM-MR Guided Flight Test Demonstrates Tri-Mode Seeker, Multiple Target Discrimination

CHINA LAKE, Calif. (Dec. 5, 2023) – Lockheed Martin successfully conducted a JAGM-MR guided flight test on Dec. 2, 2023, at China Lake Test Range in California. The successful flight test demonstrated JAGM-MR’s tri-mode seeker and its ability to aid the missile to successfully discriminate between multiple targets.

“This next-generation weapon system offers greater accuracy in both target discrimination and recognition, delivering mission-focused capabilities that will provide our customers with an innovative 21st century security solution,” said Joey Drake, program management director of Air-to-Ground Missile Systems at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. “The enhanced tri-mode seeker provides a new level of precision guidance and defense capabilities, allowing JAGM-MR to lock onto the selected target even when there's multiple targets in the field.”

JAGM-MR’s tri-mode seeker employs a near-infrared (NIR) sensor, which is a third sensor incorporated into the guidance system compared to JAGM, which utilizes a dual-mode sensor system. The NIR sensor enhances missile performance, allowing for improved target tracking and guidance over a range of conditions and target sets.

“We’re investing in the future of our JAGM product line because not only will it help address much-needed capabilities by our customers, but it will provide them with a turnkey solution for the challenges that they face in today’s complex threat environment,” said Drake.

While last year’s successful live fire event demonstrated JAGM-MR’s 16 km increased range capability, this year’s guided flight test demonstrated the maturity of the fully functioning tri-mode seeker while concurrently highlighting its ability to target engagement at an increased stand-off range.

JAGM is designed and developed in Orlando, Florida. The weapon system is manufactured across various Lockheed Martin facilities in Dallas; Orlando and Ocala, Florida.; Archibald, Pennsylvania.; and Troy, Alabama. With more than 125,000 HELLFIRE and JAGM missiles produced, JAGM and JAGM-MR are the next-generation systems of choice in critical, precision engagement opportunities.

Team members from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center came together to spread holiday cheer with thousands on Dec. 5 during the 9th annual Huntsville Christmas Parade.
The Marshall float displayed a test version of the RS-25 engine – the workhorse engine that powered the space shuttle for more than three decades and is now used to power NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket for Artemis missions. The engine was outfitted with a handmade Santa Claus sleigh full of Christmas presents, crafted by Marshall’s Model and Exhibits Shop.
Children wowed and cheered as the sleigh passed through the city streets. Marshall volunteers dressed in fun holiday gear walked alongside the float passing out candy and stickers to attendees. 
The Marshall team was awarded third place for Best Float Design by the parade committee. Winning first place was the City of Huntsville Landscape Management, while second place went to the Ice Queen Alabama float.
“It’s amazing to see Huntsville’s growth through all the organizations that participated by making a float,” said Chad Emerson, grand marshal of the parade and managing director of Huntsville’s City Football Club.
The parade was presented by Bank Independent and hosted by radio station Mix 96.9, along with the VBC (Von Braun Center). This year, the parade’s theme was Christmas through the decades. More than 80 organizations decorated their floats to reflect Christmas in the past.
The parade had plenty of fun-filled activities for children in the VIP FunZone, sponsored by Lander’s McLarty Chevrolet. There, children took pictures with Santa Claus, met Elsa and Anna from Frozen, built gingerbread houses, and drank hot chocolate. The ticket also provided access to bleachers in the VBC’s Saturn Ballroom parking lot, where families could enjoy the parade. A donation of clothing for Kids to Love was all that was needed for tickers to the VIP FunZone.

The stage is set for the finale of NASA’s Break the Ice Lunar Challenge.
Conceived in 2020, Break the Ice tasked innovators with creating robotic systems that can traverse the volatile terrain of the Lunar South Pole. These robots must be able to dig into the Moon’s regolith – the dusty, icy “dirt” that makes up the lunar surface – and transport it to a secondary location for in-situ resource utilization processing.
If deployed on a NASA mission, these systems would operate in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon, an area that receives no sunlight. These technologies must survive bitterly cold conditions and cannot rely on solar power regeneration. If successful, NASA can excavate the regolith from this area and use the resources derived from the materials, like frozen water, to aid astronauts living on the Moon.
“Our goal is to provide solutions to make living on the Moon a reality, and Break the Ice directly contributes to that mission,” said Denise Morris, program manager for NASA’s Centennial Challenges. “Excavating lunar regolith before humans arrive on the Moon will allow us to find uses for that material before they get there – if we could build a lunar habitat out of the regolith or extract the water for our astronauts to drink, that means less mass on our vehicles and less work for our crews.”
Phase 1 of the competition focused on designing systems that could achieve three components: excavation, travel, and delivery. Of the 31 teams who submitted eligible proposals, 13 won cash prizes ranging from $25,000 to $125,000.
Phase 2, Level 1 opened in June 2022. Consisting of Phase 1 winners and newcomers, 25 teams developed their initial designs into prototypes with technical reports, engineering designs, and test plans. Six months later, 13 U.S. semifinalists were named, each earning an equal share of $500,000. Two international teams were also recognized as semifinalists, though they were not eligible to receive monetary prizes from NASA.
In Phase 2, Level 2, the finalist pool comprised of garage inventors, academics, industry professionals, and hobbyists from 11 U.S. states, the Netherlands, and India. Nine of these teams attempted a 15-day demonstration trial at their own testing sites to prove the capabilities of their prototypes. The teams live-streamed the tests and took turns hosting representatives from Centennial Challenges for in-person observations.
“What impresses me the most with this batch of competitors is their innate ability to each find unique ways to approach the solution,” said Break the Ice Challenge Manager Naveen Vetcha, who supports Centennial Challenges through Jacobs Space Exploration Group. “Each site visit provided our subject matter experts with new ways to think about this technology and operations, and some of these teams expanded our expectations for how to bridge this technology gap.”
The Phase 2, Level 2 winning teams are:
Three teams finished as runners up ($75,000 each):
In this last round of competitions, scheduled to take place in the spring of 2024, the above winners will bring their prototypes to a NASA-designated test facility for a series of head-to-head matchups. Expected testing includes excavation under reduced gravity – using gravity off-loading – and transportation over complex terrain, including rocks, craters, slopes, turns, and loose granular soil.
“Bringing the competitors to one central location is the best way to end a challenge like Break the Ice because it provides us with an opportunity to observe and test their designs in a common relevant environment,” said Mark Hilburger, a senior research engineer in the Space Technology Exploration Directorate at NASA’s Langley Research Center and principal technologist for Break the Ice. “These technologies must be thoroughly tested to survive on the Moon, so a test opportunity like this helps the teams prove if their prototypes are up to the task.”
This final round of competition will offer up to $1.5 million in cash prizes, split between first place ($1 million) and second place ($500,000). NASA will also award opportunities for teams to test their concepts at one of the agency’s Thermal Vacuum Chambers, which can simulate the temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions at the Lunar South Pole.
The Break the Ice Lunar Challenge is a NASA Centennial Challenge led by the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center with support from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Centennial Challenges are part of the Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing program led by NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate and managed at Marshall. Ensemble Consultancy supports the management of competitors for this challenge.

Engineers and technicians at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center recently installed a key component called the frangible joint assembly onto the adapter that connects the core stage to the upper part of NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket.
The cone-shaped stage adapter, called the launch vehicle stage adapter, will be part of the SLS mega rocket that will power NASA’s Artemis III mission to the Moon. The frangible joint sits atop the adapter and operates as a separation mechanism. The frangible joint is designed to break apart upon command, allowing the upper part of the rocket, NASA’s Orion spacecraft, and the crew inside Orion to quickly separate from the SLS core stage and adapter.
Frangible joint assemblies are widely used across the space industry in a variety of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft to efficiently separate fairings or stages during launch, during ascent, in orbit and during payload deployment. The stage adapter used for Artemis III is set to be the last of its kind as SLS evolves into a larger and more powerful configuration for future Artemis missions, beginning with Artemis IV. The adapter is fully assembled at Marshall by NASA and lead contractor Teledyne Brown, which is also based in Huntsville. Marshall manages the SLS Program.
SLS is part of NASA’s backbone for deep space exploration, along with Orion and the Gateway in orbit around the Moon, and commercial human landing systems. SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and supplies to the Moon in a single launch.

NASA conducted the third RS-25 engine hot fire in a critical 12-test certification series Nov. 29, demonstrating a key capability necessary for flight of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket during Artemis missions to the Moon and beyond.
NASA is conducting the series of tests to certify new manufacturing processes for producing RS-25 engines for future deep space missions, beginning with Artemis V. Aerojet Rocketdyne, an L3Harris Technologies Company and lead engines contractor for the SLS rocket, is incorporating new manufacturing techniques and processes, such as 3D printing, in production of new RS-25 engines.
Crews gimbaled, or pivoted, the RS-25 engine around a central point during the almost 11-minute (650 seconds) hot fire on the Fred Haise Test Stand at NASA’s Stennis Space Center. The gimbaling technique is used to control and stabilize SLS as it reaches orbit.
During the Nov. 29 test, operators also pushed the engine beyond any parameters it might experience during flight to provide a margin of operational safety. The 650-second test exceeded the 500 seconds RS-25 engines must operate to help power SLS to space. The RS-25 engine also was fired to 113% power level, exceeding the 111% level needed to lift SLS to orbit.
The ongoing series will stretch into 2024 as NASA continues its mission to return humans to the lunar surface to establish a long-term presence for scientific discovery and to prepare for human missions to Mars.
Four RS-25 engines fire simultaneously to generate a combined 1.6 million pounds of thrust at launch and 2 million pounds of thrust during ascent to help power each SLS flight. NASA and Aerojet Rocketdyne modified 16 holdover space shuttle main engines, all proven flightworthy at NASA Stennis, for Artemis missions I through IV.
Every new RS-25 engine that will help power SLS also will be tested at NASA Stennis. RS-25 tests at the site are conducted by a combined team of NASA, Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Syncom Space Services operators. Syncom Space Services is the prime contractor for Stennis facilities and operations.

A group of dead stars known as “spider pulsars” are obliterating companion stars within their reach. Data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory of the globular cluster Omega Centauri is helping astronomers understand how these spider pulsars prey on their stellar companions.
A pulsar is the spinning dense core that remains after a massive star collapses into itself to form a neutron star. Rapidly rotating neutron stars can produce beams of radiation. Like a rotating lighthouse beam, the radiation can be observed as a powerful, pulsing source of radiation, or pulsar. Some pulsars spin around dozens to hundreds of times per second, and these are known as millisecond pulsars.
Spider pulsars are a special class of millisecond pulsars, and get their name for the damage they inflict on small companion stars in orbit around them. Through winds of energetic particles streaming out from the spider pulsars, the outer layers of the pulsar’s companion stars are methodically stripped away.
Astronomers recently discovered 18 millisecond pulsars in Omega Centauri – located about 17,700 light-years from Earth – using the Parkes and MeerKAT radio telescopes. A pair of astronomers from the University of Alberta in Canada then looked at Chandra data of Omega Centauri to see if any of the millisecond pulsars give off X-rays.
They found 11 millisecond pulsars emitting X-rays, and five of those were spider pulsars concentrated near the center of Omega Centauri. The researchers next combined the data of Omega Centauri with Chandra observations of 26 spider pulsars in 12 other globular clusters.
There are two varieties of spider pulsars based on the size of the star being destroyed. “Redback” spider pulsars are damaging companion stars weighing between a tenth and a half the mass of the Sun. Meanwhile, the “black widow” spider pulsars are damaging companion stars with less than 5 percent of the Sun’s mass.
The team found a clear difference between the two classes of spider pulsars, with the redbacks being brighter in X-rays than the black widows, confirming previous work. The team is the first to show a general correlation between X-ray brightness and companion mass for spider pulsars, with pulsars that produce more X-rays being paired with more massive companions. This gives clear evidence that the mass of the companion to spider pulsars influences the X-ray dose the star receives.
The X-rays detected by Chandra are mainly thought to be generated when the winds of particles flowing away from the pulsars collide with winds of matter blowing away from the companion stars and produce shock waves, similar to those produced by supersonic aircraft.
Spider pulsars are typically separated from their companions by only about one to 14 times the distance between the Earth and Moon. This close proximity – cosmically speaking – causes the energetic particles from the pulsars to be particularly damaging to their companion stars.
This finding agrees with theoretical models that scientists have developed. Because more massive stars produce a denser wind of particles, there is a stronger shock – producing brighter X-rays – when their wind collides with the particles from the pulsar. The proximity of the companion stars to their pulsars means the X-rays can cause significant damage to the stars, along with the pulsar’s wind.
Chandra’s sharp X-ray vision is crucial for studying millisecond pulsars in globular clusters because they often contain large numbers of X-ray sources in a small part of the sky, making it difficult to distinguish sources from each other. Several of the millisecond pulsars in Omega Centauri have other, unrelated X-ray sources only a few arc seconds away. (One arc second is the apparent size of a penny seen at a distance of 2.5 miles.)
The paper describing these results will be published in the December issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and a preprint of the accepted paper is available online. The authors of the paper are Jiaqi (Jake) Zhao and Craig Heinke, both from the University of Alberta in Canada.

NASA’s Psyche spacecraft is on a roll. In the eight weeks since it left Earth on Oct. 13, the orbiter has performed one successful operation after another, powering on scientific instruments, streaming data toward home, and setting a deep-space record with its electric thrusters. The latest achievement: On Dec. 4, the mission turned on Psyche’s twin cameras and retrieved the first images – a milestone called “first light.”
Already 16 million miles from Earth, the spacecraft will arrive at its destination – the asteroid Psyche in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter – in 2029. The team wanted to test all of the science instruments early in the long journey to make sure they are working as intended, and to ensure there would be plenty of time to calibrate and adjust them as needed.
The imager instrument, which consists of a pair of identical cameras, captured a total of 68 images, all within a star field in the constellation Pisces. The imager team is using the data to verify proper commanding, telemetry analysis, and calibration of the images.
“These initial images are only a curtain-opener,” said Arizona State University’s Jim Bell, the Psyche imager instrument lead. “For the team that designed and operates this sophisticated instrument, first light is a thrill. We start checking out the cameras with star images like these, then in 2026 we’ll take test images of Mars during the spacecraft’s flyby. And finally, in 2029 we’ll get our most exciting images yet – of our target asteroid Psyche. We look forward to sharing all of these visuals with the public.”
The imager takes pictures through multiple color filters, all of which were tested in these initial observations. With the filters, the team will use photographs in wavelengths of light both visible and invisible to the human eye to help determine the composition of the metal-rich asteroid Psyche. The imager team will also use the data to create 3D maps of the asteroid to better understand its geology, which will give clues about Psyche’s history.
Earlier in the mission, in late October, the team powered on the magnetometer, which will provide crucial data to help determine how the asteroid formed. Evidence that the asteroid once had a magnetic field would be a strong indication that the body is a partial core of a planetesimal, a building block of an early planet. The information could help us better understand how our own planet formed.
Shortly after being powered on, the magnetometer gave scientists an unexpected gift: It detected a solar eruption, a common occurrence called a coronal mass ejection, where the Sun expels large quantities of magnetized plasma. Since then, the team has seen several of these events and will continue to monitor space weather as the spacecraft travels to the asteroid.
The good news is twofold. Data collected so far confirms that the magnetometer can precisely detect very small magnetic fields. It also confirms that the spacecraft is magnetically “quiet.” The electrical currents powering a probe of this size and complexity have the potential to generate magnetic fields that could interfere with science detections. Because Earth has its own powerful magnetic field, scientists obtained a much better measurement of the spacecraft magnetic field once it was in space.
On Nov. 8, amid all the work with the science instruments, the team fired up two of the four electric propulsion thrusters, setting a record: the first-ever use of Hall-effect thrusters in deep space. Until now, they’d been used only on spacecraft going as far as lunar orbit. By expelling charged atoms, or ions, of xenon gas, the ultra-efficient thrusters will propel the spacecraft to the asteroid (a 2.2-billion-mile journey) and help it maneuver in orbit.
Less than a week later, on Nov. 14, the technology demonstration built into the spacecraft, an experiment called Deep Space Optical Communications, or DSOC, set its own record. DSOC achieved first light by sending and receiving optical data from far beyond the Moon. The instrument beamed a near-infrared laser encoded with test data from nearly 10 million miles away – the farthest-ever demonstration of optical communications.
The Psyche team has also successfully powered on the gamma-ray detecting component of its third science instrument, the gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer. Next, the instrument’s neutron-detecting sensors will be turned on the week of Dec. 11. Together those capabilities will help the team determine the chemical elements that make up the asteroid’s surface material.
Arizona State University leads the Psyche mission. A division of Caltech, NASA’s JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) is responsible for the mission’s overall management, system engineering, integration and test, and mission operations. Maxar Technologies in Palo Alto, California, provided the high-power solar electric propulsion spacecraft chassis. Arizona State leads the operations of the imager instrument, working in collaboration with Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego on the design, fabrication, and testing of the cameras.

NASA is marking 25 years since the first two elements of the International Space Station were launched and joined in space. Today, the space station remains a global endeavor with 273 people from 21 countries now having visited the microgravity laboratory and has hosted more than 3,700 research and educational investigations from people in 108 countries and areas.
  Left: Launch of space shuttle Endeavour from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on the STS-88 mission to deliver the Unity Node 1 module. Middle: The STS-88 crew. Right: The Unity Node 1 module being lifted out of the cargo bay.
On Nov. 20 and Dec. 4, 1998, Zarya and Unity, respectively, launched into orbit as the first two modules of the International Space Station. On Dec. 6, 1998, the space shuttle Endeavour STS-88 crew, NASA astronauts Bob Cabana, Rick Sturckow, Nancy Currie, Jerry Ross, and James Newman, along with Russian Space Agency (now Roscosmos) cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, captured the Zarya module with the space shuttle’s robotic arm and mated it to Unity.
 Left: Zarya has been mated with Unity in the shuttle’s cargo bay and astronauts are outside making connections between the two modules. Right: The space station’s first two elements after release from the space shuttle.
Engineers thousands of miles apart designed and built the two modules and the elements first met in space. The STS-88 crew, commanded by Cabana, spent the next few days and three spacewalks making connections between the two modules before releasing the early station. Since the joining of Zarya and Unity, the space station has grown with additions from international partners, resulting in the largest and most complex piece of technology constructed in space. In November 2000, the space station received its first long-duration residents, Expedition 1, including NASA astronaut William Shepard, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko. Since that time, international teams have kept the space station permanently inhabited, performing routine operations and maintenance including dozens of spacewalks, and conducting world-class research in a wide array of scientific disciplines. From visiting spacecraft with cargo, crew, and private astronauts, to spacewalks for station upgrades, to science investigations and technology demonstrations, to commercial activities, to public outreach and STEM downlinks, the International Space Station is a busy orbital outpost and microgravity laboratory. Now, more than ever, utilization, advancements, and results are adding up for the benefit of humanity.

By Savannah Bullard
The stage is set for the finale of NASA’s Break the Ice Lunar Challenge.
Conceived in 2020, Break the Ice tasked innovators with creating robotic systems that can traverse the volatile terrain of the Lunar South Pole. These robots must be able to dig into the Moon’s regolith – the dusty, icy “dirt” that makes up the lunar surface – and transport it to a secondary location for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) processing.
If deployed on a NASA mission, these systems would operate in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon, an area that receives no sunlight. These technologies must survive bitterly cold conditions and cannot rely on solar power regeneration. If successful, NASA can excavate the regolith from this area and use the resources derived from the materials, like frozen water, to aid astronauts living on the Moon.
“Our goal is to provide solutions to make living on the Moon a reality, and Break the Ice directly contributes to that mission,” said Denise Morris, program manager for NASA’s Centennial Challenges. “Excavating lunar regolith before humans arrive on the Moon will allow us to find uses for that material before they get there – if we could build a lunar habitat out of the regolith or extract the water for our astronauts to drink, that means less mass on our vehicles and less work for our crews.”
Phase 1 of the competition focused on designing systems that could achieve three components: excavation, travel, and delivery. Of the 31 teams who submitted eligible proposals, 13 won cash prizes ranging from $25,000 to $125,000.
Phase 2: Level 1 opened in June 2022. Consisting of Phase 1 winners and newcomers, 25 teams developed their initial designs into prototypes with technical reports, engineering designs, and test plans. Six months later, 13 U.S. semifinalists were named, each earning an equal share of $500,000. Two international teams were also recognized as semifinalists, though they were not eligible to receive monetary prizes from NASA.
In Phase 2: Level 2, the finalist pool comprised of garage inventors, academics, industry professionals, and hobbyists from 11 U.S. states, the Netherlands, and India. Nine of these teams attempted a 15-day demonstration trial at their own testing sites to prove the capabilities of their prototypes. The teams live-streamed the tests and took turns hosting representatives from Centennial Challenges for in-person observations.
“What impresses me the most with this batch of competitors is their innate ability to each find unique ways to approach the solution,” said Break the Ice Challenge Manager Naveen Vetcha, who supports Centennial Challenges through Jacobs Space Exploration Group. “Each site visit provided our subject matter experts with new ways to think about this technology and operations, and some of these teams expanded our expectations for how to bridge this technology gap.”
The Phase 2: Level 2 winning teams are:
1st Place ($300,000): Starpath Robotics (San Francisco, CA)
2nd Place ($200,000): Terra Engineering (Gardena, CA)
3rd Place ($125,000): The Ice Diggers (Golden, CO)
Runners Up ($75,000 each):
In this last round of competitions, scheduled to take place in the spring of 2024, the above winners will bring their prototypes to a NASA-designated test facility for a series of head-to-head matchups. Expected testing includes excavation under reduced gravity – using gravity off-loading – and transportation over complex terrain, including rocks, craters, slopes, turns, and loose granular soil.
“Bringing the competitors to one central location is the best way to end a challenge like Break the Ice because it provides us with an opportunity to observe and test their designs in a common relevant environment,” said Mark Hilburger, a senior research engineer in the Space Technology Exploration Directorate at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and principal technologist for Break the Ice. “These technologies must be thoroughly tested to survive on the Moon, so a test opportunity like this helps the teams prove if their prototypes are up to the task.”
This final round of competition will offer up to $1.5 million in cash prizes, split between first place ($1 million) and second place ($500,000). NASA will also award opportunities for teams to test their concepts at one of the agency’s Thermal Vacuum Chambers, which can simulate the temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions at the Lunar South Pole.
The Break the Ice Lunar Challenge is a NASA Centennial Challenge led by the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center  in Huntsville, Alabama, with support from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Centennial Challenges are part of the Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing program led by NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate and managed at NASA Marshall. Ensemble Consultancy supports the management of competitors for this challenge.

74,"New Course from NASA Helps Build Open, Inclusive Science Community",https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/new-course-from-nasa-helps-build-open-inclusive-science-community/,"3 min read

NASA released its free Open Science 101 curriculum Wednesday to empower researchers, early career scientists, and underrepresented communities with the knowledge and tools necessary to embrace open science practices.
The curriculum’s initial goal is to train 20,000 scientists and researchers over the next five years, enabling them to embrace open science practices and maximize the impact of their work.
“NASA is committed to ensuring people around the world have equal and open access to science data whenever they need it,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “This innovative curriculum will support the White House’s Year of Open Science to help people make informed, research-based decisions that will benefit humanity and improve life here on Earth.”
Developed by NASA’s Transform to Open Science initiative in collaboration with subject matter experts, the curriculum is designed to meet researchers at every stage of their open science journey – catering to those new to open science, established researchers, and aspiring students looking to embark on scientific careers. It also helps prepare researchers to incorporate required open science data management plans when applying for NASA grant funding.
“We believe education is a shared endeavor that can be achieved through community-driven learning,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Our new curriculum is a testament to the incredible potential that emerges when open science experts from academia, industry, and government unite. With this initial rollout, we’re not just launching a course; we’re igniting a movement where learners actively shape the course’s trajectory.”
In its initial form, the Open Science 101 curriculum presents an introduction to the world of open science while also setting the stage for its continued evolution. It introduces learners to definitions, tools, and resources and provides valuable best practices throughout the scientific workflow. All five modules of the course are accessible through an open online platform, where participants can learn at their own pace. In addition to the platform, the modules will also be covered in virtual and in-person instructor-led training sessions.
To further support engagement and knowledge exchange, NASA has forged strategic partnerships with scientific associations, allowing open science to be taught during large annual meetings, special science team summer schools, and other events. These initiatives aim to create a dynamic learning environment where participants can interact with experts, ask questions, and explore the frontiers of open science. The diversity in learning options ensures that participants can choose the mode that best suits their learning style and schedule, optimizing the learning experience.
The Open Science 101 curriculum is accessible to all interested individuals, aligning with NASA’s commitment to inclusivity and promoting equitable access to scientific resources.

75,Secretary Raffensperger Joins Colleagues in Calling for Restored Trust in Electoral Systems,https://sos.ga.gov/news/secretary-raffensperger-joins-colleagues-calling-restored-trust-electoral-systems,"December 6th, 2023

From National Review

This is a perilous moment of global instability. The very ideals of constitutional democracy that define America are at risk in every corner of the world. Amid such darkness, the United States is a beacon of hope for those who struggle under dictators and autocrats and yearn for peace, freedom, and self-determination. For democracy.

As Republican state election officials, we believe in the power of citizens to choose their leaders freely and fairly, and we have faith in the integrity of the election systems currently in place to carry out the voters’ will. Nationally, we saw a successful 2022 midterm election. Many states worked to shore up confidence in the election process, adding many new legal provisions that our states of Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, and Utah implemented beginning in 2020. These reforms included preprocessing of absentee ballots, additional audits, and ballot-tracking. The outcome was a high-turnout election with not a single serious candidate contesting the election results. The system held up to scrutiny and won.

There are reasons why some still distrust the system. The main one is the toxic stew of disinformation, misinformation, and deliberate lies for profit or political advantage. And as conservatives, we recognize the damage caused by the drumbeat of falsehoods repeated about the 2020 elections. Despite the fact that the 2022 elections were largely undisputed and noncontroversial, there are still many voters who don’t believe they can have confidence in the 2024 elections.

This is a bipartisan problem, though. Democrats have also sown doubt about high-profile election results in 2000, 2004, 2016, and 2018. While Republicans acknowledge our responsibility, it will take both parties to break the cycle and restore voter trust.

Repairing trust in voting takes effort at the local, state, and federal level. As the top election officers in our states, we have both a responsibility and a unique opportunity to lead these efforts. While a plurality may distrust national elections, Americans, by and large, continue to have confidence in their state and local governments and in local elections. The loud voices that doubted the results of the 2020 election have been virtually silent about the results of the 2022 elections. This is the result of specific actions and practices we undertook to restore public trust in elections.

We are calling on conservative leaders at all levels to join us in implementing proven strategies that have rebuilt trust in our elections by adhering to three main principles. As chief election officials, we have all attempted to abide by these ideals in our own states.

First, we commit to publicly affirming the security and integrity of elections in the United States. Despite the polarized public narrative about differences in how elections are run between red and blue jurisdictions, a core baseline of laws and practices is in place across the country. These include practices such as testing all voting machines to ensure they are secure, conducting audits of ballots after every election to confirm the accuracy of the results, and storing paper ballots in secure facilities to maintain a paper trail. The challenge is that too many Americans are not aware of these common security measures. Our experience shows that knowledge of them increases public confidence in election processes and results.

Second, we will continue to use transparency and public outreach to reassure voters that elections work. Again, research and our own experiences have proven that public education about the voting and vote-counting processes builds public confidence in election results. We plan to continue public education and transparency practices, such as site tours of election facilities and ensuring access for poll watchers. We also can use the fact that voters trust their local elections to build trust for federal elections. After all, the same trusted local officials are responsible for administering national elections. To reinforce these messages, we will seek cooperation from trusted local leaders such as law enforcement, veterans, faith leaders, and civic groups.

Third, in the spirit of continuous improvement of our elections, we will continue to champion policy changes that help build trust. While Americans should already feel confident that our elections are conducted securely and accurately, prudent updates to election laws help improve public trust in elections. To that end, we encourage other states to join our states in preprocessing and tracking mail-in ballots, requiring voter ID for all ballot types, and performing audits. These practices have led to faster, more accurate, and more secure results and increased public trust in the outcomes.



We recognize that the 2024 election will be contentious. We know that even adhering to these principles by the letter will not completely eradicate election distrust. But this is a moment, one year out from Election Day, in which election officials across the country must lead. We pledge to do everything we can to help build trust in the very foundation of democracy: the vote.

Georgia is recognized as a national leader in elections. It was the first state in the country to implement the trifecta of automatic voter registration, at least 17 days of early voting (which has been called the “gold standard”), and no-excuse absentee voting. Georgia continues to set records for voter turnout and election participation, seeing the largest increase in average turnout of any other state in the 2018 midterm election and record turnout in 2020, and 2022. 2022 achieved the largest single day of in-person early voting turnout in Georgia midterm history utilizing Georgia’s secure, paper ballot voting system. Most recently, Georgia ranked #1 for Election Integrity by the Heritage Foundation, a top ranking for Voter Accessibility by the Center for Election Innovation & Research and tied for number one in Election Administration by the Bipartisan Policy Center."

77,California Labor Commissioner’s Office Reaches $5.5 Million Wage Theft Lawsuit Settlement to Compensate 148 Caregivers,https://www.dir.ca.gov/DIRNews/2023/2023-87.html,"NEWS RELEASE Release Number: 2023-87 Date: December 6, 2023

California Labor Commissioner’s Office Reaches $5.5 Million Wage Theft Lawsuit Settlement to Compensate 148 Caregivers

First Payment of $2 Million Distributed to Employees of Adat Shalom Board and Care

Los Angeles—The Labor Commissioner’s Office (LCO) has reached a $5.5 million settlement against Adat Shalom Board and Care Inc. to compensate 148 workers who worked at the employer’s six adult care facilities in Los Angeles. The employees cared for elderly residents 24 hours a day, six days a week, but were only paid for six hours each day. The first payment of $2 million under the settlement agreement has been distributed to the workers.

Workers employed at Adat Shalom from July 2014 to July 2017 should contact the LCO at 833-LCO-INFO (833-526-4636), as they may be entitled to owed wages and damages under this settlement agreement.

“For years, the employer paid these caregivers less than three dollars an hour and attempted to avoid liability by hiding assets. Our team took the employer to court to stop the illegal transfer of assets,” said California Labor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower. “My office is committed to collecting owed wages from employers engaged in wage theft and stopping these illegal practices. This settlement also secures an agreement by the employer to no longer operate a residential care business in California.”

  Release #87",https://www.dir.ca.gov/DIRNews/2023/2023-87.html,"NEWS RELEASE Release Number: 2023-87 Date: December 6, 2023

California Labor Commissioner’s Office Reaches $5.5 Million Wage Theft Lawsuit Settlement to Compensate 148 Caregivers

First Payment of $2 Million Distributed to Employees of Adat Shalom Board and Care

Los Angeles—The Labor Commissioner’s Office (LCO) has reached a $5.5 million settlement against Adat Shalom Board and Care Inc. to compensate 148 workers who worked at the employer’s six adult care facilities in Los Angeles. The employees cared for elderly residents 24 hours a day, six days a week, but were only paid for six hours each day. The first payment of $2 million under the settlement agreement has been distributed to the workers.

Workers employed at Adat Shalom from July 2014 to July 2017 should contact the LCO at 833-LCO-INFO (833-526-4636), as they may be entitled to owed wages and damages under this settlement agreement.

“For years, the employer paid these caregivers less than three dollars an hour and attempted to avoid liability by hiding assets. Our team took the employer to court to stop the illegal transfer of assets,” said California Labor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower. “My office is committed to collecting owed wages from employers engaged in wage theft and stopping these illegal practices. This settlement also secures an agreement by the employer to no longer operate a residential care business in California.”

The Labor Commissioner’s Office opened its investigation in June 2017 after receiving a report of labor law violations from the Pilipino Workers Center (PWC), and issued citations in 2018. The PWC is a non-profit, community-based organization that organizes and advocates low-wage workers, including residential care workers.

82,"Anything is Paw-sible, When You’re Prepared",https://news.caloes.ca.gov/anything-is-paw-sible-when-your-prepared/,"You may be ready for the next emergency, but did you remember to prep your pet? We usually make emergency preparedness plans for ourselves and our family, but we often times overlook our other important family members…our pets.

Preparing your pet before, during and after an emergency is very similar to preparing ourselves. One of the most important steps of pet emergency preparedness is to have a plan. To get started with pet preparedness plans, take into account the type of animal you have, the risks your household is vulnerable to and your pet’s needs.

Here are some general tips to help get your pet emergency ready:

Make sure you have an emergency kit for your pet. Items in the kit should include pet food, water, medications, veterinary records, blankets, etc.

Have an animal carrier and leash.

Make sure your pet has tags with contact information.

Keep a current photo of your pet and animal records.

Be familiar with local shelters. This may come in handy in case your pet goes missing.

Emergencies can be just as scary for animals as they are for humans. If you find yourself and your pets in the middle of an emergency, bring them inside to a safe area immediately. If you are ordered to evacuate, do not leave your pets behind. Evacuate with your animals as safely as you can, without putting yourself in danger. This stresses the importance of pet planning – so that you know you can avoid being in a difficult situation should you be in an emergency.

For those that have large animals that may require more planning in the event of an emergency, contact your local Office of Emergency Services for tips and large animal shelter information to aid in your animal disaster planning.

Through its Global Engagement Center, the State Department actively intervened in the news-media market to limit the reach and business viability of domestic news organizations by funding censorship technology and private censorship enterprises. Congress authorized creation of the Global Engagement Center expressly to counter foreign propaganda and misinformation. Instead, the agency weaponized this authority to violate the First Amendment and suppress Americans’ constitutionally-protected speech. The complaint describes the State Department’s project as “one of the most egregious government operations to censor the American press in the history of the nation.”

“I am proud to lead the fight to save Americans’ precious constitutional rights from Joe Biden’s tyrannical federal government,” said Attorney General Paxton. “The State Department’s mission to obliterate the First Amendment is completely un-American. This agency will not get away with their illegal campaign to silence citizens and publications they disagree with.”

The New Civil Liberties Alliance (“NCLA”) is serving as co-counsel. Mark Chenoweth, NCLA president and general counsel, said: “The federal government cannot do indirectly what the First Amendment forbids it from doing directly. The chilling censorship machinations alleged in this complaint will frighten all liberty-loving Americans to the core.”

As the lawsuit explains, The Daily Wire, The Federalist, and other conservative news organizations were “branded ‘unreliable’ or ‘risky’ by the government-funded and government-promoted censorship enterprises… starving them of advertising revenue and reducing the circulation of their reporting and speech—all as a direct result of [the State Department’s] unlawful censorship scheme.”

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar Updates List of Companies Engaging in Scrutinized Business Operations in Iran

(AUSTIN) — Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar announced today he has updated the list of companies engaging in scrutinized business operations in Iran.

Listed companies are subject to the provisions outlined in Texas Government Code Chapter 2270, which prohibit state governmental entities from contracting with these listed companies and require state and local governments to divest from these companies.

“I am proud of the work we have done to ensure Texas tax dollars do not go to companies supporting the brutal, authoritarian regime in Iran, a regime which has provided material support to organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah” Hegar said. “Recent geopolitical events have made this work more important than ever, and I am grateful to the Texas Legislature for entrusting me with this crucial responsibility.”

State governmental entities subject to the investment prohibitions and divestment requirements include the Employees Retirement System of Texas, Teacher Retirement System of Texas and political subdivisions of the state.

On the 30th day after receiving the updated list, a state governmental entity must notify the Comptroller's office of the listed financial companies in which the entity owns direct or indirect holdings. And not later than Jan. 5 of each year, such entities are required to submit a report to the presiding officer of each house of the Texas Legislature and the attorney general that identifies all securities sold, redeemed, divested or withdrawn in compliance with the Texas Government Code.

The Comptroller’s office continues to review information on an ongoing basis, and the list may be subject to change as often as quarterly."

The plan seeks to transform approximately 58 acres of the State-owned Creedmoor campus from surface parking lots, overgrowth, and vacant buildings into a vibrant new community with homes, recreational spaces, greenery, and neighborhood retail. It is the result of a six-month collaborative planning process led by Empire State Development and the Queens Borough President's Office, facilitated with help from the Metropolitan Urban Design Workshop. The plan, which was released today at a meeting with community stakeholders, is available here .

“Creedmoor represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity for New Yorkers to reimagine State land and plan for the emerging needs of tomorrow,” Governor Hochul said. “Working together in productive partnership with the community – and thanks to the leadership of Queens Borough President Donovan Richards – we can build more housing, create more jobs, and strengthen Eastern Queens for the next generation.”

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr. said, “The potential before us on the Creedmoor campus is limitless, as the new Creedmoor Master Plan boldly outlines. From thousands of units of housing to historic homeownership opportunities to school seats to community facilities to retail, this plan represents the single largest investment in Eastern Queens in generations, and I could not be more excited for the work ahead. It’s taken decades to get to this moment, and I’m deeply grateful to Governor Hochul, Empire State Development and the residents of Eastern Queens for their tireless dedication and partnership in developing this community-centric proposal from the ground up. We’re making history every day in Queens, and this project is yet another example of our borough’s bright future.”

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “After decades of unrealized promises about Creedmoor, today Governor Hochul, ESD, and Borough President Donovan stand together in partnership with the community to support this comprehensive plan to strengthen Eastern Queens. This vision represents a new opportunity for the neighborhoods around Creedmoor to finally move forward on local priorities and prepare for the community’s emerging needs.”

The Creedmoor Community Master Plan introduces over 2,800 units of new housing, with more than 55 percent designated as homeownership. This would represent the area’s single largest new investment in housing since the 1950s and its largest single expansion in homeownership opportunities in nearly 50 years. The Plan also introduces a mix of affordable rental options for seniors and families, and continues a nearly 80-year history of veteran housing in Eastern Queens by offering individuals who have served in the armed forces preferential access to a portion of the project’s units. In addition, the Plan designates approximately 14 acres for open space and sets aside locations for amenities such as a recreation center, daycare facility, school, and neighborhood retail.

The Plan’s development involved an extensive six-month community engagement process which included in-person and virtual workshops that identified priorities like a need for community gathering spaces, diverse housing options, neighborhood retail, and improved transit. Following the Plan's release, Empire State Development (ESD) will form the Creedmoor Community Advisory Committee to provide ongoing guidance on implementation. The next steps include commencing an environmental review process in 2024. ESD will also create a General Project Plan and will release requests for proposals (RFPs) to find development partners who will implement the Plan in phases.

Repurposing State Land for Housing

Governor Hochul announced a package of executive actions earlier this year to promote housing growth as part of an ongoing commitment to increasing the housing supply and addressing New York's housing crisis. As part of that package, the Governor directed state agencies to review lands in their ownership and control and determine whether those sites can be used for housing.

Yesterday, Governor Hochul unveiled a proposal to transform the former Lincoln Correctional Facility in New York City into a vibrant, mixed-use development with 105 units of affordable housing. The Governor has also announced requests for proposals to redevelop the former Bayview Correctional Facility and Javits Center's Site K in Manhattan and the former Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill with an emphasis on housing."

89,Governor Hochul Announces $100 Million in Federal Funding Now Available for High-speed Broadband Infrastructure Through Affordable Housing Connectivity Program,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-100-million-federal-funding-now-available-high-speed-broadband,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that applications are now open for the $100 million Affordable Housing Connectivity Program, a partnership led by Empire State Development’s ConnectALL Office in consultation with New York State Homes and Community Renewal to design and install broadband infrastructure at 100,000 affordable housing units across New York State. The program, which is federally funded through the Treasury Department's Capital Projects Fund under the American Rescue Plan Act, is the largest targeted investment in affordable housing connectivity in the nation. The request for applications is available here.

""As part of my administration's commitment to building safe, stable, affordable housing, we are leveraging a $100 million federal investment to give New Yorkers one of the most important household amenities we can offer –access to high-speed internet,"" Governor Hochul said. “With work, school, and essential government services going digital, affordable homes need affordable, reliable broadband, and this funding will help bolster our efforts to build housing equipped with the basic tools that New Yorkers need to succeed. I thank the New York delegation for supporting New York's Affordable Housing Connectivity Program and for their partnership in helping to create housing where New York families cannot just live but thrive.""

New York’s Affordable Housing Connectivity Program is a competitive grant program designed to fund high-speed, reliable broadband infrastructure to and within low-income housing buildings. Internet service providers are invited to apply for $100 million in federal funding for retrofits to provide internet infrastructure in affordable housing rental units to support high-speed internet.

Property owners must complete a survey to be considered for no-cost broadband upgrades to their building. ConnectALL will pair eligible properties with the best proposals from Internet Service Providers to complete the installation.

The Affordable Housing Connectivity Program complements Governor Hochul's bold agenda to increase the supply of housing, including affordable housing, and address New York's housing crisis. Earlier this year, the Governor announced a package of executive actions to promote housing growth across New York State, including: the prioritization of Pro-Housing Communities for $650 million in state discretionary funding; a statewide assessment of state-owned sites for potential housing opportunities; the start of an initiative to address regulatory hurdles to housing production; and the creation of a program to accelerate housing growth in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. As part of the FY 2023 Budget, Governor Hochul also secured funding for a five-year, $25 billion housing plan to build and preserve 100,000 affordable homes.

New York's ConnectALL Initiative

Governor Hochul created the $1.3 billion ConnectALL Initiative, the largest investment in New York's 21st century infrastructure, as part of her 2022 State of the State address. ConnectALL is designed to close New York State’s digital divide, transform the state's digital infrastructure, and ensure that all New Yorkers have access to reliable and affordable high-speed broadband internet service. Over the past year, the ConnectALL Office has conducted listening sessions, surveys, and focus groups in every region of the state and convened industry and stakeholder forums to design its signature grant programs.

ConnectALL mobilized a statewide effort to supplement federal broadband data, securing over $664 million in federal funding to address unserved and underserved rural areas, in addition to the $100 million available for the Affordable Housing Connectivity Program. ESD’s ConnectALL Office recently published drafts of New York State’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Initial Proposal, Vols 1 & 2, and the State’s Digital Equity Plan. These plans will help guide public investments to make high-quality, affordable, reliable broadband accessible to all New Yorkers. The public is encouraged to read the plans at www.broadband.ny.gov .

ConnectALL continues to work with state agencies and community partners to promote the Federal Communications Commission’s Affordable Connectivity Program, which now has more than 1.6 million New York households signed up for the monthly subsidy of $30, bringing nearly $50 million in total broadband savings for those households each month.

Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said, “$100 Million I secured in the American Rescue Plan is now available to connect thousands of families and residents across New York with high-quality internet service. From rural communities to bustling city neighborhoods, too many New Yorkers have struggled to obtain affordable, high-speed broadband, but with applications now open for the Affordable Housing Connectivity Program, we are one step closer to bridging the digital divide. The internet is not a luxury, it is essential infrastructure and this funding will help New Yorkers connect to new opportunities, education, healthcare and so much more right in their homes. Together with Gov. Hochul, we are taking bold strides to transform our state’s digital landscape, and boosting equitable internet accessibility to help New Yorkers thrive in today’s 21st century economy.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Limited access to reliable high-speed internet makes it harder for kids to do their homework, for seniors to access telehealth appointments, and for workers to take advantage of remote employment opportunities. High-quality internet is no longer a luxury – it is a necessity for everyday life. This federal funding will bring broadband to affordable housing units across New York and improve quality of life for New York families. I am proud to have fought to pass the American Rescue Plan to secure this funding and I will keep fighting for federal resources to close the digital divide once and for all.”

Representative Jerry Nadler said, “High-speed broadband is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Democrats are delivering affordable internet access to low-income homes across our state, keeping New Yorkers connected with their families as well as career and educational opportunities.”

Representative Gregory Meeks said, “High-speed broadband infrastructure being available in affordable housing is pivotal for New Yorkers. Affordable housing connectivity unlocks countless opportunities for residents. The $100 million in federal funds invests in personal and professional development by allowing people access to crucial resources such as online education, remote work, telehealth services and a world of information at their disposable. I am a major advocate of integrating high-speed broadband into affordable housing because we are bridging the digital divide. We are acknowledging that the internet is not a luxury but required in modern society. The federal funds assist in creating inclusiveness among our communities, where everyone, regardless of their economic circumstances, has the necessary resources to succeed.”

Representative Brian Higgins said, Access to quality, high-speed internet is a necessity in today’s world – for school, work, and for equal opportunity. Congress passed the American Rescue Plan to help people, businesses and communities come back stronger following the pandemic. I commend Governor Hochul’s leadership advancing broadband implementation and equity.”

Representative Paul Tonko said, “It has long been that case that broadband internet is an essential resource in our 21st century economy – whether to complete homework, access telemedicine, submit a job application, or simply connect with loved ones and the wider community. For years I’ve pushed at the federal level to improve access and affordability to broadband, including through my ACCESS BROADBAND Law and provisions in the American Rescue Plan. I’m glad to see those vital investments being put to good use for our New York communities and I’ll continue working to ensure everyone across our state can afford and access reliable internet.”

Representative Grace Meng said, “In Congress, I am proud to have helped create the over $7 billion Emergency Connectivity Fund that has increased internet access across our state and country including at schools and libraries in my congressional district in Queens. I am excited about this $100 million as well as I have long supported connecting more of our affordable housing units to the internet. Everybody deserves access to reliable, affordable and high-speed broadband, and as the New York representative on the Regional Leadership Council, I’m thrilled to see more federal funding going to our state. Thank you to Governor Hochul for her leadership on this issue.”

Representative Adriano Espaillat said, “I applaud Governor Hochul for launching the Affordable Housing Connectivity Program, a historic initiative that will bring high-speed broadband to 100,000 low-income housing units across New York State. This $100 million federal investment, made possible by the American Rescue Plan Act which I helped pass in Congress, will help close the digital divide and ensure that all New Yorkers have access to the Internet, which is essential for education, work, and health. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have fought for this funding, and I will continue to support Governor Hochul’s efforts to build safe, stable, and affordable housing for our communities.”

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, ""Having reliable, accessible and affordable broadband is essential to our economy and our quality of life. This program is a vital component of Governor Hochul’s ConnectALL initiative and will connect all New Yorkers, especially in communities that have historically been left behind.""

New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “Reliable access to the internet has become essential to participate in the modern workforce, receive an education, obtain health care services, and more, but far too often connectivity is an expense that working families struggle to afford. ConnectALL’s $100 million Affordable Housing Connectivity program will provide many New Yorkers affordable access to this essential service, furthering Governor Hochul's commitment to creating opportunities for historically underserved communities across the State.”

New York State Association for Affordable Housing President and CEO Jolie Milstein said, “Broadband connectivity is no longer a luxury – it is a necessity. With applications officially open, the ConnectALL program can ensure that thousands of New Yorkers have greater access to employment and educational opportunities across the state. Congratulations to the Hochul administration on this launch, and we look forward to deploying these critical resources to modernization retrofits across our affordable housing portfolio.”

This $100 million investment in New York State comes from the $10 billion in the American Rescue Plan's Capital Projects Fund. This is in addition to the historic federal funding secured in the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Law, which included a record $65 billion for the expansion of high-speed internet to connect the unserved, make internet affordable, and provide resources for digital literacy. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan are working in tandem to close the digital divide – providing access to high-speed internet in underserved communities and lowering costs for those who cannot afford it."

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

We're continuing to build on our nation leading work to make mental health and addiction care more accessible to all New Yorkers, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status. We had a chance today to talk to people who are dealing with co-occurring disorders.

What does that mean? You can have mental health challenges and have depression and suicidal thoughts, be bipolar, but also have substance abuse challenges, addiction to fentanyl, to opioids, and other addictive materials. Often you have to go to two different places. Think about that. You have to go here for your mental health services and then find time in your day, in your life. To then have to go find support for your addictions and to how you can get support and therapy for two different co-occurring disorders. We're changing that. That model does not work any longer. You come to a place here like VIP here in the Bronx who are doing an extraordinary job helping people heal completely.

And that's, those are the services we're intended here to provide. We also want to make sure that people know that this is a place where we can provide mobile services. We just invested over $200,000 in a unit I toured outside. The mobile medication unit. I talked to the nurse and the individuals involved there. They literally travel to different places. The one out front goes here in the Bronx, goes to Queens, goes to Manhattan.

And what they're doing is making sure that they can provide methadone or, Fentanyl test strips or Naloxone to people who won't have to take time out of their lives to get help and get services. They can do it right in the community where they pull up this van. So that was a $200,000 investment right here. But as I develop my third State of the State Address. This is the third year I'm making mental health a high priority. Discussions like I had here today with some of the staff and with some of the patients help me shape and understand where the investments need to go.

And this place here treats over 7,000 people a year. It's one of the largest opioid treatment facilities in the state. And again, it's all about that integrated care, that there's not one size fits all, that you come here for one service, you go there for another. It's all under one roof, and that's the power of what we're talking about here.

We're going to continue focusing on this model. We are now increasing – I'm announcing today – the number from 13 places like this, facilities in the State of New York, to 26. And we'll have one in each of the regions of the state. Six will be in New York City, seven Upstate. And this is just one phase of it as well.

We'll soon have 39 clinics. This will help serve thousands and thousands of New Yorkers, literally tripling the number of we've had since I came into office and making sure that we continue these investments. Also, people walk in the door, they don't have an insurance card, they don't have a doctor, they don't have any kind of coverage. We're investing an additional $11 million to help people overcome this. They can walk in the door and still get services and insurance will still be paid for.

We want to make sure that people's ability to access service, it's all about access, is not affected by their ability to pay. And that's what this is, why we're talking about – regardless of where they live, what their socioeconomic status is, their income levels, they all deserve to heal and that's what we're talking about here today with this announcement of continued funding, more resources, and supporting this model because it has been so successful."
93,Statement from Governor Hochul on the MTA Board Voting to Advance Congestion Pricing,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/statement-governor-hochul-mta-board-voting-advance-congestion-pricing,"“Congestion pricing means cleaner air, better transit and less gridlock on New York City's streets and today's vote by the MTA Board is a critical step forward. The proposal approved today heeds my call to lower the toll rate by nearly 35 percent from the maximum rate originally considered. This initiative will make New York City a global leader in transportation policy, and I'm grateful for the work of the Traffic Mobility Review Board to bring us to this milestone.”

AUDIO of the event is available here.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

I want to acknowledge that flu season is here again. And it has gone up – the number of flu cases in the State of New York is now defined as prevalent in the state, that's a new category. The flu is prevalent here in New York, they are up 25 percent over one week. Hospitalizations are up 30 percent. Very, very sad to report that there have been two pediatric deaths related to flu.

So, I want to make sure that everyone is reminded to get their flu shots. I had mine a couple days ago. And it's really important that we keep ourselves and our families safe."
95,"Governor Hochul Announces Doubling of Community Behavioral Health Clinics, Funding 13 New Clinics Across New York",https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-doubling-community-behavioral-health-clinics-funding-13-new-clinics,"New York State Office of Mental Health Commissioner Dr. Ann Sullivan said, “New Yorkers need to be able to access the services they need in one place that provides integrated substance use, mental health and physical health care. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics provide this comprehensive care and by expanding them statewide, we can greatly improve access across New York State. With this expansion, Governor Hochul is staying true to her commitment to ensure all New Yorkers have access to quality mental health care.”

Office of Addiction Services and Supports Commissioner Dr. Chinazo Cunningham said, “The creation of these new clinics follows through on the promise Governor Hochul made to expand the state’s continuum of care for those requiring services for behavioral, physical health, substance use and other co-occurring conditions. It demonstrates a firm commitment by the state to provide comprehensive care that meets the unique health care needs of all New Yorkers, and OASAS looks forward to continuing to expand this innovative model to help more people access help and support they need.”

VIP Community Services CEO Debbian Fletcher-Blake said, “VIP is pleased that the Governor is invested in the care of people with mental illness and substance use disorder. Her support for CCBHCs will undoubtedly change the way care is delivered in our State. This model of care symbolizes true integrated care. This funding is an investment in equitable health care for New Yorkers. I appreciate both OASAS and OMH for investing in this model.”

State Senator Samra Brouk said, “As Chair of the New York State Senate Committee on Mental Health, I’m grateful to Governor Hochul for her commitment to bolstering our state’s mental health infrastructure. These new Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics will help ensure that more New Yorkers can receive compassionate, dignified care in a timely manner by better aligning mental health care and addiction care and by reducing barriers to care. I look forward to continued collaboration with the Governor to transform our mental health system.”

State Senator Natalia Fernandez said, ""I am thrilled to see Governor Hochul's commitment to expanding access to mental health care through the funding of 13 new Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. This initiative is a critical step in ensuring that New Yorkers, regardless of their ability to pay, have access to person-centered and trauma-informed care for behavioral health issues. By tripling the number of clinics statewide, we are making strides towards a more integrated and comprehensive mental health care system. It is crucial we continue addressing the gaps in coverage and fighting for the recovery of every individual battling behavioral health issues, regardless of their circumstances.""

Assemblymember Aileen Gunther said, “Behavioral Health care is vital to all our communities. As a registered nurse and Assemblymember I have seen firsthand the struggle to provide adequate access to mental health care for all New Yorkers. I applaud Governor Hochul on the investment in 13 new behavioral health clinics. I have always fought for what was best for my constituents, and I look forward to working with Governor Hochul on further expanding our behavioral healthcare infrastructure so that all those in need of mental health support especially in rural and upstate Counties have the access they need.”"
96,"Following Ratification of SAG-AFTRA and WGA Contracts, Governor Hochul Directs State Agencies to Fast-track Process and Allow Film & TV Industry to Resume Economic Activity in New York",https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/following-ratification-sag-aftra-and-wga-contracts-governor-hochul-directs-state-agencies-fast,"Governor Kathy Hochul today directed State agencies to fast-track the process for film and television productions, allowing these industries to quickly resume work now that both SAG-AFTRA and the WGA have ended strikes and ratified contracts. The film and television production industry is a key economic driver for New York, adding over $9 billion in Gross Domestic Product each year.

“It’s critical that workers in all industries are fairly paid for their labor,” Governor Hochul said. “Now that the strikes are over, I am directing all relevant state agencies to fast-track approvals and permitting so that actors, writers and the dedicated middle-class professionals of this industry can get back to work.”

A copy of the Executive Chamber’s letter to State agencies is available here.

In anticipation of industry union strikes moving toward final agreements, New York State is preparing for the return of large-scale productions statewide. By December 11, State entities will review processes for marketing, making state-owned properties and services available for production and also identify ways to support business attraction. This includes expediting permits, keeping fees and direct personnel costs transparent and not exceeding the costs to the state, maintaining an industry point of contact within the agency to handle production requests, and ensuring the agency maintains a person or team to act as a liaison to expedite permits, clearances and the provision services. Properties and services provided by the state should be made available to the maximum extent practicable to production companies. Unresolved problems should be brought to MPTV and the Governor’s Office.

New York State’s Film and TV production industry generates millions of dollars in investment and supports thousands of production workers, caterers, hospitality workers, and small businesses in our communities every year. Unions, such as SAG-AFTRA and WGA, help to ensure high wages, full benefits and robust protections in the Film and TV Production sector and these jobs are accessible to a wide range of New Yorkers, with 44 percent of jobs in the industry available to workers without a 4-year degree. The industry is an important piece of New York State’s economy and according to the most recent independent evaluation, in 2021 and 2022, the film industry added over $18 billion in Real GDP and created more than 131,000 direct jobs."
97,Attorney General James Recovers $1.8 Million from New York City Diner Owner for Cheating Taxpayers,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-recovers-18-million-new-york-city-diner-owner-cheating,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today recovered more than $1.8 million from the former owner of two New York City diners for failing to report more than $650,000 in cash receipts and lying on tax statements. An investigation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) found that the former owner of the Georgia Diner in Queens and the Bridgeview Diner in Brooklyn, Dimitrios Kaloidis, underreported taxable receipts and filed false tax returns, violating the New York False Claims Act. The investigation found that the diners collected taxes from patrons on cash receipts, however, Mr. Kaloidis pocketed those taxes instead of reporting them to the state. As a result of this agreement, the estate of Mr. Kaloidis must pay $1,878,493 in penalties and owed taxes plus interest.

“When New Yorkers pay taxes, they should feel confident that those funds will help support our state's investments in education, health care, transportation, and services all residents rely on,” said Attorney General James. “By pocketing these tax dollars, the former owner of these diners violated New Yorkers' trust and deprived our state of essential resources. These recovered funds will now go to invest in our state, and hopefully this settlement sends a clear message that my office will hold tax cheats accountable.”

The OAG opened an investigation into the diners after receiving a whistleblower complaint. The New York False Claims Act allows private individuals to file civil actions on behalf of the government and to share in any recovery. The investigation found that from 2015 to 2022 the diners’ former owner, Dimitrios Kaloidis, systematically underreported taxable receipts and the unreported cash was used to pay business expenses or disbursed in $10,000 “bricks” to the former owner himself.

In addition, the investigation revealed that Bridgeview Diner in Brooklyn knowingly understated taxable receipts on its tax returns by maintaining two separate transactional books, only one of which was reported to the state. One set of books recorded credit card and cash receipts from diner sales in the morning, and the sales taxes on those transactions were remitted to the state. However, the diner also maintained a separate set of books in which afternoon cash transactions went unreported and pocketed by the former owner. The OAG also found that the Georgia Diner in Queens failed to remit sales taxes on cash receipts. Together, both diners failed to report more than $650,000 in taxes.

The estate of Dimitrios Kaloidis, who owned the diners until his death in 2019, has paid $1,187,272 in owed taxes plus interest and $334,307 in penalties. The agreement also requires the estate to pay $356,913 to the whistleblower.

Attorney General James would like to thank the Department of Taxation and Finance for its assistance in investigating this double-books tax evasion scheme.

At OAG, the investigation was led by Assistant Attorney General Laura Jereski of the Taxpayer Protection Bureau, with the assistance of Legal Support Analyst Iuliia Belyshkina, under the supervision of Senior Enforcement Counsel Bryan Kessler. The Taxpayer Protection Bureau is led by Bureau Chief Thomas Teige Carroll and Deputy Bureau Chief Scott J. Spiegelman and is a part of the Division for Economic Justice, which is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D’Angelo and First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy."
98,Attorney General James Announces Arrest of Manhattan Fentanyl and Gun Trafficker,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-announces-arrest-manhattan-fentanyl-and-gun-trafficker,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today announced a 94-count indictment charging Rafael Figueroa of Washington Heights, Manhattan with the sale of fentanyl, heroin, and firearms. The investigation conducted by the Office of the Attorney General’s (OAG) Organized Crime Task Force (OCTF) seized more than 1.5 kilograms of fentanyl and over 75 grams of heroin worth approximately $142,000, three loaded handguns, a loaded assault rifle, and three high-capacity ammunition feeding devices.

“Drug and gun traffickers put New Yorkers in danger and my office will continue to prosecute those who flood our communities with deadly weapons and narcotics,” said Attorney General James. “This takedown successfully removed dangerous opioids and firearms from our streets. I want to thank our partners in law enforcement for their assistance throughout this investigation.”



Firearms recovered by the investigation

As alleged in the indictment, from August 2022 to January 2023, Rafael Figueroa engaged in 11 separate sales of drugs and four separate sales of firearms. The year-long investigation, which began with sales of fentanyl in New York County, spread to Rockland County and eventually included additional sales of heroin and firearms. The investigation included hundreds of hours of physical surveillance, covert cameras, and undercover operations.

The indictment, unsealed before a Rockland County Court, charged Figueroa with 94 crimes. These include various counts of A and B-Felony level Criminal Sale and Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance, B, C, and D-Felony level firearms crimes, and Conspiracy to commit those crimes.

The charges against the defendant are merely accusations and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The investigation was led by OCTF Detectives Zylona Silva and Luis Flores, under the supervision of OCTF Detective Supervisor Bradford Miller, OCTF Assistant Chief Ismael Hernandez, and OCTF Deputy Chief Andrew Boss, along with investigators with the New York State Police (NYSP) Special Investigations Unit. The Attorney General’s Investigations Division is led by Chief Oliver Pu-Folkes.

Attorney General James would also like to thank NYSP Troops K and F and the Ulster County Sheriff’s Office for their assistance in this investigation.

The case is being prosecuted by OCTF Assistant Deputy Attorney General James Cudden, together with OCTF Legal Support Analyst Madeline Rosen, under the supervision of Downstate Deputy Bureau Chief Lauren Abinanti. Nicole Keary is the Deputy Attorney General in Charge of OCTF. The Division of Criminal Justice is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General José Maldonado."
99,South Fork Wind Delivers First Offshore Wind Power to Long Island,https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/2023-Announcements/2023-12-6-Governor-Hochul-Announces-South-Fork-Wind-Delivers-First-Offshore,"South Fork Wind Becomes First Utility-Scale Offshore Wind Farm in Federal Waters to Begin “Powering Up” in the United States

Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the successful delivery of clean power to Long Island from the first operational wind turbine at South Fork Wind, marking a historic milestone of the first utility-scale offshore wind farm in federal waters to begin “powering up” in the United States. The project has completed the installation of two turbines, with one operational, approximately 35 miles off Montauk with all 12 turbines expected to be installed by early 2024. Today’s announcement supports progress towards the State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal to install nine gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035.

“New York's nation-leading efforts to generate reliable, renewable clean energy have reached a major milestone,"" Governor Hochul said. ""South Fork Wind will power thousands of homes, create good-paying union jobs and demonstrate to all that offshore wind is a viable resource New York can harness for generations to come.""

This milestone, which comes just two weeks after the installation of New York’s first offshore wind turbine , was celebrated in East Hampton alongside joint-venture partners Ørsted and Eversource, state, county and local officials, advocates and community members. When complete, South Fork Wind will generate approximately 130 megawatts of renewable energy, enough to power approximately 70,000 Long Island homes. The renewable energy from South Fork Wind will eliminate up to six million tons of carbon emissions each year, the equivalent of taking 60,000 cars off the road.

Long Island Power Authority CEO, Thomas Falcone, said, “Today marks a significant step towards implementing Governor Hochul’s vision of a sustainable and resilient energy future for New York. Nearly eight years in the making, this first offshore wind turbine producing energy transforms that vision into a reality. LIPA is proud to support this landmark project on behalf of our 1.2 million customers on Long Island and in the Rockaways.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “This moment represents years of hard work, vision, and the courage to lead in our energy transition. Long Island residents are now experiencing first-hand the benefits of their homes and businesses being powered with clean, renewable electricity from South Fork Wind, and we congratulate the teams at Orsted, Eversource, LIPA, the local leaders and the workers who built this incredible project on celebrating first power today.”

Chair of the New York State Public Service Commission Rory M. Christian said, “Today’s delivery of clean, renewable electricity to Long Island is a major milestone in progress toward creating a clean-energy economy in New York State. It’s proof-positive that we will be able to reach our long-term goals to create a cleaner energy grid and a testament to Governor Hochul’s efforts to date.”

Secretary of State Robert J. Rodriguez said, “South Fork Wind is a major step forward in achieving the Governor’s clean energy goals. The nation is watching New York as we once again take the lead in offshore wind and continue to trailblaze toward a more sustainable future for New York’s communities. Thousands of Long Island households can now say they’re significantly reducing their carbon footprint. This project is a testament to the perseverance and coordination across all levels of government and industry. The Department of State played a key role in reducing the project’s siting impacts, creating a responsible path forward for this important development.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “Thanks to the support of Governor Hochul and the efforts of DEC’s partners at LIPA and NYSERDA, New York State is taking critical steps to reduce climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions while creating jobs and bolstering local economies. The successful delivery of wind-powered energy to Long Island’s South Fork is a notable milestone in moving New Yorkers toward a green future powered by cleaner sources of energy.”

Ørsted Group EVP and CEO Americas David Hardy said, “East Hampton has now made history as the first community in New York to receive clean energy from an offshore wind farm. South Fork Wind is not just a trailblazing project for the state, it’s also one of the foundations of America’s offshore wind energy industry and a testament to our team’s commitment, expertise and hard work. Thanks to the leadership of the Biden and Hochul administrations, and our state and local partners and supporters, South Fork Wind is powering up and setting the stage for a growing American industry.”

Eversource Energy Chairman, President and CEO Joe Nolan said, “South Fork Wind is a project by New Yorkers, for New Yorkers. Clean, renewable offshore wind energy is now flowing to the local grid in East Hampton thanks especially to the hard work of local union workers and contractors who helped us build South Fork Wind’s transmission system and onshore substation. This has been a year of firsts for New York’s offshore wind industry, and there’s a lot more to come in the weeks ahead for this groundbreaking project and the growth of the U.S. offshore wind sector.”

First approved by the LIPA Board of Trustees in 2017, South Fork Wind began construction in February 2022, beginning with the onshore export cable system that links the project to the LIPA energy grid, which was completed early this year. The wind farm reached its “steel in the water ” milestone in June 2023 with the installation of the project’s first monopile foundation. Van Oord’s offshore installation vessel, the Aeolus, is installing the turbines.

South Fork Wind includes the first U.S.-built offshore wind substation . More than 350 U.S. workers across three states supported construction of this offshore substation, a topside structure that collects the power produced by wind turbines and connects it to the grid. New York union workers supported its installation offshore.

Long Island-based contractor Haugland Energy Group LLC (an affiliate of Haugland Group LLC), installed the underground duct bank system for South Fork Wind’s onshore transmission line and led the construction of the project’s onshore interconnection facility. LS Cable installed and jointed the onshore cables with support from Long Island’s Elecnor Hawkeye. The onshore cable scope of work alone created more than 100 union jobs for Long Island skilled trades workers. Roman Stone, also on Long Island, manufactured concrete mattresses to protect the undersea cables, and Ljungstrom, located in western New York, in partnership with Riggs Distler & Company, Inc., provided specialized structural steelwork.

State Senator Anthony Palumbo said, “Today is an important step in meeting New York State's renewable energy goals and providing Long Islanders with lower cost, reliable clean power. Renewable power is a critical component of our energy future, and the State must work to ensure that New Yorkers continue to benefit from all aspects of this transition - from job opportunities to affordable energy, to a cleaner environment.”

Assemblymember Fred W. Thiele Jr., said “There can be no doubt anymore that climate change is real. Every day, we are seeing the adverse impacts on eastern Long Island and across the globe. New York State has been a leader in policy innovation attacking climate change. The enactment of the New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which I co-sponsored, established aggressive goals to substantially reduce carbon emissions by 2050 by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, like wind power. This project marks a significant first step toward reaching our climate goals.”

Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said, “Suffolk County is proud to be a national leader in clean and renewable energy. Through the collaboration and leadership of Governor Hochul, our regional officials and community stakeholders, we remain at the forefront of the offshore wind industry, helping to ensure the long-term sustainability and economic growth of our region.”

East Hampton Town Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc said, “The onset of production of clean, renewable wind power from the South Fork Wind turbines, and its delivery to our local electric grid system in East Hampton, is an exciting milestone that advances East Hampton Town’s comprehensive renewable energy goals as well as those of New York State. East Hampton Town is pleased to have worked with Orsted and Eversource to accomplish this goal.”

New York League of Conservation Voters President Julie Tighe said, “Today marks a major step for New York’s transition away from fossil fuels and toward a clean energy future. After years of planning and countless hours of labor and construction – many of those union hours – clean electricity from offshore wind has finally come ashore. With Governor Hochul’s bold environmental leadership, and with smart and innovative companies like Orsted and Eversource that are committed to developing – and capable of delivering – large-scale renewable energy projects, we know this is just the beginning.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “We applaud Governor Hochul for achieving this milestone. It is a testament to her commitment to ensuring New York meets its clean energy goals. We look forward to working with the Governor to ensure that our renewable energy future is built, operated, maintained, repaired, and manufactured by workers who earn good wages, and enjoy the benefits and protections guaranteed by union contracts.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, “Today marks a significant milestone in New York’s pursuit of its renewable energy goals and the establishment of a clean energy future that bolsters middle class careers, ignites economic growth and provides a greener environment for future generations to thrive in. The first delivery of clean energy to Long Island via South Fork is only the beginning of what offshore wind can bring to the table, and we are proud that our tradesmen and tradeswomen played a role in skillfully and efficiently assembling the first operational turbines in this critical project. They look forward to continuing their work get all 12 turbines generating wind power in the coming months, all while pursuing a union career that allows them to provide for their families and drive economic stimulus to their communities.”

Long Island Federation of Labor President John R. Durso said, “This project is being constructed with union labor. We expect it to be operated with union labor. This announcement, and the eventual completion of South Fork Wind, is proof positive we can address the climate crisis and create good union jobs in the process. We look forward to working with New York State, the offshore wind industry, and all other stakeholders who are interested in a brighter future with good family sustaining wages.”

Long Island Association President & CEO Matt Cohen said, “Long Island has made history and is officially the offshore wind capital of the country, and I congratulate Governor Hochul, the Ørsted and Eversource team, and the Long Island Power Authority on their successful public-private partnership and for not only delivering clean energy to the grid, but also for creating thousands of jobs and shepherding opportunities for small businesses.”

Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties President Matthew Aracich said, “I commend Governor Hochul for her persistent drive to bring offshore wind to market. Governor Hochul’s determination and vision continue to elevate New York State’s collaboration with skilled labor, creating the first utility-scale offshore wind farm in federal waters along the eastern seaboard. This climate-altering project represents a new economic opportunity providing choices for the next generation of local workers, who are seeking good-paying, stable careers which will provide the ability to remain employed on Long Island. As a result of this market demand, the offshore wind industry has partnered with labor to provide a pathway leading directly to the Building and Construction Trades through apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship programs like Opportunities Long Island. Unlike the shrinking workforce of many other communities around the country, our local Building Trades Council has grown significantly and in no small part due to the labor demand from Orsted/Eversource within the offshore wind industry.”

New York Offshore Wind Alliance Director Fred Zalcman said, “It is remarkable to witness the graceful turn of the turbines at the South Fork Wind Farm as it achieves first power, supplying the New York grid with the first of what promises to be a boundless supply of offshore wind energy. But this seemingly effortless conversion of the ocean breezes into carbon free electricity would not have been possible but for the vision of the Hochul Administration and countless leaders at all levels of government, the tremendous community support for this project as a means of transitioning to a clean energy future on the East End, and the perseverance of the project developers, Orsted and Eversource, in overcoming any and all obstacles, from pandemics to global supply chain challenges, that stood in the way. South Fork today joins the ranks of New York's signature infrastructure projects, and as with those projects, we stand to reap the benefits for generations to come.”

Win With Wind Founder Judith Hope said, “Our team of East Hampton citizens is thrilled to have been a part of this historic effort. We believe that active local support is essential to the future success of offshore wind in New York State.”

Citizens Campaign for the Environment Executive Director Adrienne Esposito said, “This is truly thrilling and historic. As the turbines turn, we also turn a page in the history of energy production. Wind turbines are beacons of hope for a cleaner, safer energy supply which benefits every New Yorker. CCE has supported offshore wind for 18 years and now to see it finally implemented is a dream turned into reality. A giant thank you to Governor Hochul and the NYSERDA team who have championed this landmark transition for a better future.”

Association for a Better Long Island Executive Director Kyle Strober said, “The powering up of the Southfork Wind Farm is not only an historic moment for Long Island but also our nation. This trailblazing project moves us closer to a renewable energy future and is made possible through the collaboration of the state, Orsted, Eversource, and local community and business leaders. Congratulations to Governor Hochul, the LIPA Board, and all involved parties. The Association for a Better Long Island is proud to support this initiative, recognizing its significant impact on our journey towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.”

Renewable Long Island Executive Director Gordian Raacke said, “Renewable Energy Long Island has been working alongside LIPA, Ørsted, East Hampton, and many other stakeholders for years to see the completion of the South Fork Wind project. This is exactly what New York State needs to meet the aggressive targets and timelines established in the state's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. It's great to know that homes are now using clean, renewable energy, immediately reducing our carbon emissions.”

Today’s announcement builds on the momentum established by the Governor’s announcement earlier this month, which publicized the largest state investment in renewable energy in United States history. The conditional awards included three offshore wind and 22 land-based renewable energy projects totaling 6.4 gigawatts of clean energy, enough to power 2.6 million New York homes and deliver approximately 12 percent of New York’s electricity needs once completed. When coupled with two marquee offshore wind blade and nacelle manufacturing facilities, this portfolio of newly announced projects is expected to create approximately 8,300 family-sustaining jobs and spur $20 billion in economic development investments statewide, including developer-committed investments to support disadvantaged communities.

New York State's Nation-Leading Climate Plan

New York State's nation-leading climate agenda calls for an orderly and just transition that creates family-sustaining jobs, continues to foster a green economy across all sectors and ensures that at least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities. Guided by some of the nation’s most aggressive climate and clean energy initiatives, New York is on a path to achieving a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century. A cornerstone of this transition is New York's unprecedented clean energy investments, including more than $55 billion in 145 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale up solar, nearly $3 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. These and other investments are supporting more than 165,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2021 and over 3,000 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, New York also adopted zero-emission vehicle regulations, including requiring all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in the State be zero emission by 2035. Partnerships are continuing to advance New York’s climate action with nearly 400 registered and more than 100 certified Climate Smart Communities, nearly 500 Clean Energy Communities, and the State’s largest community air monitoring initiative in 10 disadvantaged communities across the state to help target air pollution and combat climate change."

102,Is a “Rule” by another name still a Rule?,https://ncchamber.com/2023/12/06/is-a-rule-by-another-name-still-a-rule/,"In our latest NC Chamber Legal Institute Sidebar, we’re reviewing a case that involves a sales tax exemption for manufacturers who purchase equipment and machinery used to transform raw materials into finished goods. Sometime early next year, the NC Supreme Court will hear a case involving the NC Department of Revenue’s interpretation of the sales tax exemption for purchases of “mill machinery.” The specific tax issue in dispute will be of interest primarily to tax specialists, but the case highlights important rule of law issues that should interest anyone subject to regulation by executive branch agencies.  The outcome of the case could tell us a lot about how the Court will view agency action in the coming years. The case,NC Department of Revenue v. FSC II, LLC, involves the sales tax exemption for manufacturers who purchase equipment and machinery used to transform raw materials into finished goods (known as “mill machinery”). The exemption statute, which has been on the books for decades, has only two requirements: the taxpayer must be a manufacturer, and the purchased equipment must be mill machinery. The Department conceded that FSC II used the equipment in question to transform raw materials into a new product – hot mix asphalt. This would seem to satisfy both statutory requirements and entitle the taxpayer to the exemption. However, the Department of Revenue (“DoR”) denied the exemption. DoR argued that the exemption was only available if the taxpayer sold most of its manufactured product to third parties. FSC II sold hundreds of thousands of dollars of its hot mix asphalt to third parties, but used even more in its own construction projects. Because FSC II’s “primary purpose” was not selling to third parties, it did not qualify for the exemption. DoR thus effectively added a third requirement to the exemption statute. Anamicusbrieffiled in the NC Supreme Court on behalf of the NC Chamber Legal Institute argues that DoR’s attempt to enforce its “primary purpose” test violates the NC Administrative Procedure Act (NC APA).  The NC APA prohibits agencies, including DoR, from enforcing a “rule” unless the rule has been promulgated in accordance with certain procedures. The DoR is exempt from some of these procedures, but not all. For instance, DoR rules must be submitted to the Rules Review Commission and published in the North Carolina Register before they can take effect. DoR makes no claim that they followed these rulemaking procedures with respect to the “primary purpose” test. Indeed, the briefs in the case show that DoR attempted to enforce the “primary purpose” test in individual cases over several decades without ever making the rule known. The case thus may come down to whether the “primary purpose” test falls within the NC APA’s definition of a “rule.” The NC APA defines a rule, with limited exceptions, as “[a]ny agency regulation, standard, or statement of general applicability that implements or interprets an enactment of the General Assembly.”  The NC Chamber’samicusbrief makes the case that the “primary purpose” test squarely fits within the definition of “rule,” and qualifies for no exception to that definition because of its general applicability. The Supreme Court’s decision in the case could therefore have implications for the regulated public far beyond the scope of the mill machinery exemption. The case raises the fundamental question of whether citizens can be bound by rules never reduced to writing or publicly announced. The NC Chamber’s brief argues that the enforcement of such rules is incompatible both with fundamental fairness and with a sound business climate. “Players need to know the rules of the game before they roll the dice. When government agencies can exact penalties for the transgression of secret rules, even the most daring entrepreneurs will be reluctant to commit their capital into the future.” The DoR lost its case in both the Office of Administrative Hearings and the Business Court.  We hope the Supreme Court enunciates a clear and appropriate interpretation of agencies’ rulemaking obligation for the benefit of both the regulated community and regulatory agencies."
103,TRIP Report: Increases in North Carolina Freight Movement by 2050 Among the Highest in the US,https://ncchamber.com/2023/12/06/trip-report-increases-in-north-carolina-freight-movement-by-2050-among-the-highest-in-the-us/,"VALUE OF FREIGHT SHIPPED IN NORTH CAROLINA ANDINCREASES IN NORTH CAROLINA FREIGHT MOVEMENT BY 2050 AMONG HIGHEST IN U.S. U.S. freight demand surges amid significant congestion, e-commerce demands, increased fatal truck crashes, inadequate investment and record-setting logistics costs.Click herefor full report, appendix and infographics. Washington, D.C. –As the U.S. rebounds from the pandemic, the reliability, capacity, sustainability and safety of the freight transportation system will be critical factors in the nation’s ability to provide a supply chain that will meet the growing need for timely and safe movement of goods.  This is according to a new report released today byTRIP,a national transportation research nonprofit. The movement of freight is being transformed by advances in vehicle autonomy, manufacturing, warehousing and supply chain automation, increasing e-commerce, and the growing logistic networks being developed to accommodate consumer demand for faster delivery. TRIP’s report,America’s Rolling Warehouses: Opportunities and Challenges with the Nation’s Freight Delivery System, examines current and projected levels of freight movement in the U.S., large truck safety, and trends impacting freight movement. Freight delivery is expected to increase rapidly due to economic growth, increasing demand, changing business and retail models, and a significantly increased reliance on e-commerce. TRIP’s report concludes with a series of recommendations to improve the nation’s freight transportation system. In 2022 North Carolina’s freight system moved 478 million tons of freight, valued at $741 billion – the 13thlargest value of freight moved of all states. From 2022 to 2050, freight moved annually in North Carolina by trucks is expected to increase 64 percent by weight and 97 percent by value (inflation-adjusted dollars), the 15thlargest projected increase in the U.S. The TRIP report also found that eight percent of travel on North Carolina’s Interstate highways and 13 percent of travel on its rural Interstate highways is by combination trucks. From 2017 to 2021, an average of 169 people were killed annually in North Carolina in collisions involving a large truck, approximately 16 annual fatalities per 100 million population. The report’s appendix includes data for all 50 states in the following categories: amount of freight moved by weight and value (overall and by truck), projected increase in weight and value of freight shipped from 2022-2050, share of Interstate travel by combination trucks, and the number of traffic fatalities involving large trucks. “Freight movement in North Carolina is reliant on a transportation network of roads, rails and ports that must be well-maintained, efficient and safe,” said Jerry Cook, vice president of government and trade relations for Hanesbrands, Inc. “With North Carolina’s already high rate of freight movement projected to increase even more in the future, it is critical that adequate investments in our transportation system are made today to support the state’s economic health now and in the years to come.” While the amount and value of goods being shipped have risen to unprecedented levels, traffic congestion is increasing the cost of moving freight and reducing the economic competitiveness and efficiency of businesses that require reliable, affordable freight transportation. Traffic congestion resulted in $94.6 billion in additional operational costs to the trucking industry in 2022 as a result of commercial trucks being stuck in traffic for 1.3 billion hours. U.S. business logistics costs reached $2.3 trillion in 2022, representing 9.1 percent of U.S. GDP – the highest share ever. “The safety and efficiency with which people and goods move is critical to meeting the current and growing demands of a dynamic state economy and securing a prosperous and competitive future for North Carolina,” said Gary Salamido, president and CEO of the NC Chamber. “While we have made great strides, TRIP’s latest report underscores the need for investment in North Carolina’s transportation network.” According to the TRIP report, from 2017 to 2021, the number of fatalities in large-truck involved crashes in the U.S. increased 18 percent, from 4,906 to 5,788.  Approximately five-out-of-six people killed in crashes involving a large truck were occupants of the other vehicle involved in the crash or pedestrians or bicyclists.  While large trucks account for five percent of all registered vehicles and ten percent of all vehicle miles of travel annually, 13 percent of traffic fatalities occur in traffic crashes in which a large truck was involved. The most frequent event prior to fatal crashes between large trucks and another vehicle is the entering or encroaching into a large truck’s lane by the other vehicle. “The TRIP report describes in stark detail the current and future challenges that the trucking industry must overcome to meet the nation’s supply chain needs,” said Bill Sullivan, chief public affairs and advocacy officer for the American Trucking Associations. “Increased public investment in highway capacity expansion, truck parking facilities and other critical highway infrastructure is essential to improving highway safety and freight efficiency. The report’s recommendations provide a great roadmap for lawmakers to address the highway system’s deficiencies.” Multiple technological advances will transform how freight is delivered in the future. These include the growing use of artificial intelligence, which is driving manufacturing and increasing the efficiency of logistics; increased automation in warehousing and supply chains; expanded growth and reliance on e-commerce; changing global logistics patterns; advances in vehicle autonomy; and, the transition to environmentally friendlier fuels to reduce transportation greenhouse gas emissions.  A lack of adequate parking for large trucks and a shortage of available truck drivers, particularly for long-haul trips, challenge the safety and efficiency of the nation’s freight system.  In the last decade, U.S. retail e-commerce sales increased nearly four and a half times, from $64 billion in the second quarter of 2013 to $278 billion in the second quarter of 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly accelerated the growth in retail e-commerce, with U.S. e-commerce sales increasing from $160 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to $278 billion in the second quarter of 2023 – a 73 percent increase. “U.S. manufacturers have proven remarkable resilience following persistent supply chain disruptions that have impacted our operations, led to longer lead times on many things like components, and a left us with a tight labor market,” said Todd Stucke, incoming president of Kubota Tractor Corporation and executive officer of Kubota Corporation, as well as chair of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. “This unpredictability means that we must be laser focused on maintaining the health, safety, and efficiency of our freight transportation network. This is vital to making sure U.S. manufacturers can continue to adapt and meet the demand for our world-class products domestically and remain competitive globally.” “As Congress prepares to consider major legislation reauthorizing our national highway system, TRIP’s report highlights the vital role the nation’s freight transportation plays in the lives of Americans and offers a set of practical and effective recommendations to generate the investment, innovation and collaboration to ensure the continued viability of our nation’s freight network and supply chain,” said John Drake, vice president for transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.” TRIP’s report concludes with a series of recommendations to improve freight transportation by increasing capacity on the nation’s freight transportation system, particularly at major bottlenecks; improving the reliability and condition of intermodal connectors between major highways and rail, ports and waterways; continued development of vehicle autonomy and the further automation of warehousing; improving roadway safety and providing additional truck parking spaces to ensure adequate and timely rest for drivers; providing funding for freight transportation improvements that is substantial, continuing, multimodal, reliable, and, in most cases, specifically dedicated to freight transportation projects; and, providing a permanent, adequate and reliable funding fix to the federal Highway Trust Fund as a critical step towards funding a 21stCentury freight transportation system. “As consumers demand faster deliveries and a more responsive supply chain, the nation’s freight transportation network is facing unprecedented roadblocks in the form of increasing congestion and a lack of transportation funding to improve the nation’s transportation system,” said David Kearby, executive director of TRIP.  “A long-term, sustainable source of revenue that supports needed transportation investment will be crucial to improving the efficiency and safety of America’s freight transportation system.”"
104,Settlement Reached with World Recycling Company for Open Dumping,https://news.maryland.gov/mde/2023/12/06/settlement-reached-with-world-recycling-company-for-open-dumping/,"Settlement Reached with World Recycling Company for Open Dumping

Facilities Operated Open Dumps of Solid Waste in Baltimore City and Prince George’s County

BALTIMORE, MD (December 5, 2023) – Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown and the World Recycling Company (WRC) have agreed to settle a civil complaint that alleged, among other things, the company’s unauthorized acceptance and disposal of solid waste. The complaint, which was filed earlier this year in the Circuit Court for Prince George’s County on behalf of the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), sought civil penalties and an injunction ordering WRC to clean up open dumps and accumulated solid waste at two locations in Maryland.

By settling the Complaint, WRC has agreed to pay a $200,000 civil penalty, remove any accumulated solid wastes at its properties, implement an environmental remediation plan at its Baltimore City facility, and improve its operational procedures.

World Recycling Company has been in operation, as a recycling, sorting, and processing facility at locations in Cheverly and Baltimore City, since 2014. In 2018, WRC was the subject of a Department of the Environment administrative enforcement action, resulting in a Consent Order. Since 2019, after its building in Cheverly was destroyed by a fire, WRC has operated an unauthorized transfer station and open dump in Cheverly, storing and dumping roll-off containers of solid waste. Since 2021, WRC has allowed solid waste to accumulate on the property, creating an open dump, a habitat for vermin, and a fire hazard, as well as putting pollutants in a position to contaminate waters of the state.

“Every Marylander deserves to live in a healthy and safe community. My office will not tolerate a company – particularly one that is entrusted with improving our environment – putting the health and well-being of our residents in jeopardy,” said Attorney General Brown. “This settlement sends a clear message that we will continue to investigate and bring enforcement actions against violators that place our communities and our environment at risk, especially in communities that are already experiencing a greater amount of environmental burden than others.”

“This enforcement action sends a clear message that the Maryland Department of the Environment will not tolerate the operation of open dumps that threaten the health of families in already overburdened communities,” said Maryland Department of the Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain. “We are issuing a significant penalty, and we will make sure that the operator cleans up its act.”

The settlement ensures that WRC will be required to safeguard the State’s environment and natural resources while operating in Maryland."
