Blinken and Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Gabriela Sommerfeld Before Their Meeting

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Good afternoon, everyone. It’s a great pleasure to have Minister Sommerfeld, Minister García here with us – all of our colleagues from Ecuador – the ambassador. First, to both of you, congratulations and welcome to your new portfolios. I know the experience of starting out, having a very high inbox, and maybe not such a high outbox, but we’re grateful to have you here today.

Our two countries have benefited from decades of cooperation, and we see that cooperation on a bilateral basis. We see it on a regional basis. We see it even on a global basis, including with Ecuador as leader of the UN Security Council in this moment. The work that we’re doing together on migration, on hemispheric challenges like Haiti, as well as the global agenda at the UN could not be more important or more valued, and we’re grateful for that.

We’re also very focused on strengthening even more the bilateral partnership between our countries with President Noboa. I had the opportunity to speak to him on the phone a few weeks ago, and in particular areas like citizen security where we know we can do more together – all of the work that’s being done as well to strengthen even more our economic partnership. We look forward to talking about that. And just last week, we celebrated our Arturo Torres, who won one of our awards for the incredibly courageous work that he’s been doing to combat corruption. So it’s very good to have all of you here today and to pursue, strengthen, deepen the partnership between the United States and Ecuador.

Madam Minister.

FOREIGN MINISTER SOMMERFELD: Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, and thank you all for receiving this Ecuadorian delegation. It’s as well very important for Ecuador to make his – its first overseas visit to the U.S. to show how important is the U.S. for Ecuador regarding cooperation, regarding our bilateral relationship, strengthening work in security matters, economic matters, immigration matters. So thank you very much for receiving us here today."

We closely coordinated this action with the United Kingdom, which is concurrently targeting several key Hamas officials with sanctions. The United States and our allies and partners are steadfast in our commitment to dismantling networks that support Hamas funding streams as part of our continuous effort to prevent and deter its terrorist activity.

12:38 p.m. EST

MR MILLER: I think someone’s been messing with my podium. It’s a little low today.

All right. I don’t have any opening remarks, so —

QUESTION: You have nothing to say at all?

MR MILLER: I got lots to say. Go ahead.

QUESTION: All right.

MR MILLER: When have I ever had nothing to say? Just nothing to start with.

QUESTION: Okay. All right. So yesterday there was a vote at the – in the General Assembly, which was pretty overwhelming, and the President came out and made his remarks saying that Israel is losing international support, specifically – or one of the reasons: for indiscriminate bombing.

So I want to know, one, what does the administration think about the overwhelming nature of this vote yesterday? And two, does the State Department in particular share the President’s view that Israel has been indiscriminately bombing in Gaza?

MR MILLER: Let me take them in order. So first, with respect to the vote, I would say it’s not the first time that Israel has not done well in a vote in the UN. You’ve seen the UN take a number of votes, oftentimes by fairly dramatic margins with respect to Israel, when we have disagreed with the outcome of those votes. So this is not the first time that has happened.

I would think what you can take away from that vote, though, is that it is clear that the world wants this conflict to end, which is a goal that we share. We want this conflict to end; we don’t want to see it go on a day longer than is necessary. But we also don’t think that stopping the campaign right now and allowing the plotters of the October 7th attacks to continue to operate, to continue to command fighters, to continue to sit in their tunnels stockpiling weapons and maintaining the ability to continue to launch terrorist attacks against Israel is in the long-term security interests of anyone in the region.

We think that the October 7th attacks should have been a wake-up call to everyone that the status quo that has existed in Gaza is not in the national security interests of Israel, it’s not in the national security interests of the Palestinian people, it’s not in the national security interests of the broader region or, in fact, the world. So we think if you want to see lasting peace, which is our goal and we hope is everyone’s goal, including everyone who voted for that resolution, you need to see Hamas removed from authority in Gaza and governance established in Gaza that reflects the legitimate hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people and that can eventually lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

With respect your second question, so we have not made a formal determination to that question. What I believe the President was speaking to – and of course the White House can speak to his exact comments – was the impact of the large-scale bombing campaign that we’ve seen where thousands of civilians have been killed. And it’s something that we’ve spoken to that we have seen too many civilians killed. We understand Israel’s intent, but as the Secretary has said, what also matters is the results, which is why we have continued to encourage them to take additional steps to protect civilians from harm.

QUESTION: So there is no inquiry or ongoing, like, investigation into whether that has happened or not?

MR MILLER: We continue to monitor what’s happening, we continue to collect information at a variety of levels, but I don’t have any internal deliberations or processes to speak to.

QUESTION: Yeah, but is there —

MR MILLER: I’m just not going to —

QUESTION: — any credible collaboration or process –

MR MILLER: I’m just not going to speak to beyond what – beyond saying that we continue to monitor and collect information.

QUESTION: Well, does that – well, but, I mean, one could infer from that that, yes, there is an ongoing process inside the administration, or one could infer from it that there isn’t and it’s not something that is being considered.

MR MILLER: I’m – and I’m —

QUESTION: Is it something that is being considered —

MR MILLER: I am just not going to —

QUESTION: — as you look at, as you say —

MR MILLER: Sorry for interrupting you.

QUESTION: You’re continuing to monitor the situation, but as you continue to monitor the situation, is that something that you’re looking at?

MR MILLER: So I’m not going to speak to the internal deliberations. I’ll say we monitor – we are monitoring, we collect information, and we continue to engage in conversations with the Israeli Government about the importance of adhering to international humanitarian law as they conduct this campaign.

QUESTION: Okay. And my last one is – because you said that October 7th showed that the status quo in Gaza was not sustainable, but yet, over the last, like, almost decade, you and Israel have done virtually nothing to change the status quo in Gaza.

MR MILLER: So I will —

QUESTION: So —

MR MILLER: Let me speak to that exact question with respect to this administration. So we have, since day one, made clear our policy was the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. And you may recall, Matt, we were planning a trip to the Middle East for the week after the October 7th attacks and as part of that trip, the Secretary was going to visit Saudi Arabia, he was going to visit Israel, and we were going to talk about integration and normalization between those two states. And one of those – one of the things that we were – we had planned and put on the table was a very robust package of steps towards an independent Palestinian state. So it has not just been our policy, it is something we were actively working towards in the leadup to October 7th.

But again, October 7th has happened; it has changed the landscape of the Middle East. We have made clear that we have a certain set of principles that we think ought to be adhered to going forward. One of those principles is that Gaza cannot continue to be run by a terrorist organization and used as a launching pad for terrorist attacks against Israel.

QUESTION: What was the Gaza aspect of the – that was planned for the discussions with the Saudis and the Israelis before —

MR MILLER: So I’m not going to get – there was – it was a robust package. I’m not going to get into what the details were because, obviously, we have moved well beyond that – that plan.

QUESTION: Well, yeah, I know, but when you say that it made clear – October 7th made clear that the status quo in Gaza was not acceptable, what did this plan that you had with the Saudis envision for Gaza?

MR MILLER: I’m just not going to – I’m not going to speak to the details of that plan because, again, it has been very well overtaken by events.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: Can I just follow up on that, collecting information? Can you clarify what you’re – towards what end are you collecting information?

MR MILLER: Again, I – we are always monitoring the way this campaign is conducted. We are monitoring the way U.S. weapons are used. We are monitoring the way that other weapons are used. And we are in constant conversations with the government of Israel about steps that they can take to minimize civilian harm, about steps that they can take to establish enduring deconfliction routes – you’ve heard me talk about that from this podium before – so civilians can get out of harm’s way. There are a number of things that we continue to monitor and engage in conversations with the Israeli Government about.

QUESTION: Does the fact that you’re collecting information mean that you have seen potential signs of violations of international law that prompted you to start this?

MR MILLER: No, I would not take that conclusion at all. This is something that we always do with respect to conflicts all around the world, is that we monitor what’s happening, we collect information. But you should not read into it any more than that.

QUESTION: And then just on the UN resolution, it got more votes in favor than any of the General Assembly resolutions on Ukraine that denounced Moscow and demand it withdraw all its troops. Does that concern you at all and does the United States feel diplomatically isolated at all over its support for Israel?

MR MILLER: No, not at all. As I said, there is a long history of fairly overwhelming vote counts when it comes to resolutions that involve the state of Israel at the General Assembly. This is by no means a first. It goes back a number of years; it goes back decades on a number of different subjects. But as I said from this podium the other day, one of the things that we continue to hear about from our partners in the region and from countries all around the world is the indispensability of American leadership with respect to this issue. We hear it about other issues as well, but we’re talking about this conflict in the Middle East now. And you’ve seen this with the President convening G7 meetings that have produced statements calling for humanitarian pauses and other steps. You’ve seen this when the Secretary has traveled the world.

I can tell you when the Secretary travels and I sit in on his meetings – let’s leave aside the Middle East; when we were in Europe, when we were in Asia – we constantly hear from our counterparts both an encouragement of what we’re doing to try to keep the conflict from widening, to try to ensure that humanitarian assistance gets in. We hear the countries that want to engage with us and want to get information from us and want to ask us to do things on their behalf.

So we very much – what we see in our diplomatic engagements is, as I said, a continued demand from countries in the world that the United States of America continue to play a leadership role.

QUESTION: Matt, I wanted to follow up on what I asked you about the other day, about the images of the men who were detained and stripped in Gaza. Have you gotten any answers from the Israelis about these images?

MR MILLER: So I said the other day we were going to seek information from the Israeli Government. We have. What they have informed us is that they conduct searches on detained individuals in Gaza to ensure that they are not wearing suicide vests, that they don’t have other weapons, that they pose no danger to IDF forces. They made clear to us, however, that these photographs should not have been taken, should not have been released, and they made it clear going forward that that will not be their practice and that if they do conduct searches of detainees, they will give them their clothes back immediately. Those are obviously appropriate steps to take.

QUESTION: Did they say they would seek accountability for who took and distributed these images?

MR MILLER: I don’t have any further readout to give beyond what I just did.

QUESTION: And then more broadly, does the U.S. believe that Hamas can be militarily eliminated in the way that Israel is seeking?

MR MILLER: So certainly the military leadership, the current leadership of Hamas, can be militarily defeated. There are leadership individuals of Hamas who plotted the October 7th attacks. There are individuals who carried out the individual attacks who are hiding behind civilians in Gaza now. Those people can be found and they can be brought to justice. That is a military goal that we think is achievable.

However – and you’ve heard the Secretary speak to this – you can’t defeat an idea on the battlefield. So it is incumbent upon Israel, it is incumbent upon other countries in the region, it is incumbent upon the United States and every country around the world who wants to be a responsible player to present a better idea. And that is why you have heard the Secretary repeatedly say at the end of this conflict there needs to be a legitimate answer for the aspirations of the Palestinian people. It’s why you saw us outline principles in Tokyo about what post – the post-government – post-conflict environment should look like in Gaza, and it’s why you’ve seen the Secretary engage in diplomacy in the region to talk about how we need to start down the path towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

QUESTION: And do you believe that the Palestinian Authority can still be revitalized in a way that you guys have spoken to in the past to lead a unified Palestinian state? There was an AP poll today saying that 90 percent want Abbas to step down.

MR MILLER: So we do believe that. Obviously, the Palestinian Authority is not in a position to step in tomorrow and begin to administer Gaza. They’re not in a position tomorrow to step in and provide a secure – security assurances and policing and other security guarantees for Gaza. But we do believe that the Palestinian Authority is the representative of the Palestinian people, and a revitalized, reformed, revamped Palestinian Authority is the proper path forward for governance of a reunited West Bank and Gaza.

QUESTION: Could we just —

MR MILLER: Yeah.

QUESTION: Sorry, on the photos really quick. Is it okay if I follow up?

MR MILLER: Yes.

QUESTION: So it sounds like from you said that Israel said the images wouldn’t happen again but that the practice of strip searching would continue. Is that something you’re okay with?

MR MILLER: So I’m not going to speak to individual practices other than to say that we – there has been – it’s well known and well documented – a long history of suicide attacks against Israeli forces and against Israeli civilians. So Israel has to decide what the appropriate steps are for searching any detainees. But if they are going to take steps to remove detainees’ clothing if they think that’s what they have to do to guarantee that someone is not wearing a suicide vest or otherwise posing a threat, then the important thing is that they immediately return their clothes to them and that they behave in a way that’s consistent with the humane treatment of detainees.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR MILLER: Go ahead, Olivia. I’ll come back.

QUESTION: Thank you very much. Just to follow up on the points being raised by my colleague, if it is determined that there were war crimes committed in Gaza by either side again, is the U.S. committed to seeing accountability for the perpetrators of those crimes?

MR MILLER: So I don’t want to address a hypothetical. But of course, always in any country around the world, if we see violations of the laws of war or violations of international humanitarian law, of course we want to see accountability.

QUESTION: Okay. Two other separate topics on Israel. So where do conversations stand on whether aid can be not only inspected but admitted through Kerem Shalom crossing?

MR MILLER: So let me speak to the humanitarian – I’ll answer it —

QUESTION: Sure.

MR MILLER: But let me speak to the humanitarian assistance question in general. So we have seen progress on a number of fronts in the past 24 hours. We’ve seen progress in the establishment of enduring deconfliction routes in southern Gaza, both so civilians can move around safely to get food, to get clean water, to get medicine if they need it, and for humanitarian assistance to be delivered. We’ve seen Israel publicizing four-hour pauses in southern Gaza, which is important for these very same reasons, so assistance can get in and people can move about. We’ve seen fuel – we’ve seen an increase in the amount of fuel that’s being delivered in to run desalinization plants and cooking oil for bakeries. We expect that to continue to increase today.

And yesterday we saw Kerem Shalom open for inspections, which is important to increase the capacity to inspect trucks that are moving in, and that happened at our urging. It’s something we’ve been working with them on for some time, something the Secretary and other members of the government have raised and pushed Israel on. And we hope that Kerem Shalom will be open for transit soon. It’s my understanding that that’s a matter that’s before the Israeli Government today, maybe a vote on it today. We hope it will be approved and that Kerem Shalom will be opened not just for inspections but for cargo to move in through Kerem Shalom, which would alleviate some of the traffic that – the traffic situation that’s existed at Rafah, and would help get more aid in to the people who need it.

QUESTION: Okay. And how much aid do you estimate or do you know is going in right today?

MR MILLER: I don’t have – I don’t have an estimate on the number of trucks and others that went in today.

QUESTION: Somewhat separately, does the U.S. share the Israeli assessment that Yahya Sinwar is in Gaza?

MR MILLER: I am just not going to speak to those assessments. I will leave it to the Israeli Government to make. I will say it is our assessment that – without speaking to any one individual, that the leadership of Hamas, who plotted, planned, and in some respects – in some cases carried out the attacks, do remain in Gaza.

QUESTION: Sorry. Say that one —

MR MILLER: Do remain in Gaza. I just don’t —

QUESTION: The leadership —

MR MILLER: I just don’t want to speak to any one particular —

QUESTION: — particular individual. I mean, U.S. officials have said publicly that the U.S. is helping Israel develop Hamas leadership targets. Just as we discuss timelines and the urgency of Israel’s military objectives, it would seem that the U.S. would have a stake in knowing that that military objective of decapitating Hamas leadership is achievable, that they are in Gaza. So that’s why —

MR MILLER: There are two different things. One is what we know and one is – the other is what I’m willing to say at this podium.

QUESTION: Okay. I have one other question on Afghanistan —

MR MILLER: I’ll come back to you. Said, you’re out of – I think that’s Said. You’re a little – it’s a little – perhaps a little jarring not seeing you in your usual spot. It’s like Matt sitting at the back or something.

QUESTION: Apologies for being late. I have —

MR MILLER: It’s not my time.

QUESTION: Yeah.

MR MILLER: Sorry. Sorry to interrupt.

QUESTION: I have a quick question. Maybe you have touched upon it. If you have, indulge me. When the President said that Israel is doing indiscriminate shelling of the Palestinians, now wouldn’t that be sort of in violation of the Leahy law?

MR MILLER: So I did touch on this. And what I said, and I’ll repeat, is that we have not made any kind of formal determination of that nature. I think what the President was referring to is that large-scale bombing campaigns, even when carried out with the best of intentions and even when carried out against legitimate military targets, can lead to the unfortunate loss of civilian lives, which we have seen all too often in this conflict.

QUESTION: Yeah. Well, if the President’s terminology is accurate that it was used indiscriminately, would that be in violation of the Leahy law?

MR MILLER: Again, I’m not going to speak to ifs. I’m going to say we have not made that formal determination and —

QUESTION: Right.

MR MILLER: The White House can speak to the President’s specific comments, but that’s what I believe he was referring to.

QUESTION: But as far as – the Leahy law is very clear, right? So it would actually determine whether that whatever Israel did is in violation of that particular law.

MR MILLER: And as I said, we have not made that determination.

QUESTION: Okay, thank you.

MR MILLER: Okay. Yeah, go ahead.

QUESTION: Coming back to wiping out Hamas, what about the prospect of getting rid of its weapons? How is that done? Is there any way to verify that that could be done? Because it’s one thing to take out people, but if weapons still exist, someone could still take them up.

MR MILLER: So I will let the Israeli Government and the Israeli Defense Forces, which are in the middle of a campaign right now addressing this very question, speak to that in detail how they are going about doing that.

But I do think you get to one of the underlying problems here, which is we continue to see images coming out – like, so it’s one thing to – if Hamas – if you have a known command and control bunker where Hamas you know is operating. You can go and target that facility and collect the weapons. But one of the unfortunate things we have seen is that as Israel has moved into Gaza, you’ve seen images that the Israeli Government has made public where guns and weapons caches and rocket launchers and other military equipment are hidden inside homes, are hidden inside civilian infrastructure.

So it is a very serious problem that there exists not just a large number of Hamas fighters inside Gaza but a large amount of military equipment inside Gaza that of course poses a very legitimate security threat to Israel that they are going to have to deal with.

QUESTION: And then to come back to this localized four-hour pause to try to move in humanitarian aid, bigger picture, are there talks on trying to get four-hour pauses or four-day pauses to trade hostages for people held in Israeli prisons? Is there any progress on that?

MR MILLER: So I’m not going to speak to hostage negotiations from here. I’ve always made clear that that’s not something that I am willing to do, and you’ve heard that same answer from other members of this government.

What I will say is that we, of course, would support a renewed pause for the purposes of releasing hostages. We were disappointed that the last one ended. We were disappointed that Hamas reneged on its deal to produone ofthce women who it’s holding hostages, and we would welcome a resumption of a pause and welcome the resumption of a release of hostages, not just women but other hostages and ultimately the release of every hostage that Hamas is holding.

QUESTION: Are you seeing any indication that either party is willing to come back to the table, or are you sticking with the U.S.’s position that Hamas is holding up the resumption of these talks?

MR MILLER: Again, I just don’t think it’s productive for me to speak at all to negotiations in this regard.

Alex.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt. I have a couple of topics. Please bear with me. Let me get your reaction —

MR MILLER: I always do.

QUESTION: Thank you so much. Always appreciated.

MR MILLER: Well, I shouldn’t say always. I mostly do.

QUESTION: Give me your (inaudible) reaction on the today’s prisoners exchange between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Two points there. What role, if any, you guys have played in this, given timing of it? Assistant secretary was in the region. And secondly, do you view this as part of broader effort to move the needle in the peace process?

MR MILLER: So the under secretary – or the assistant secretary was in the region. This is something that we have encouraged, actively encouraged in talks with both governments. We welcome the return of the Armenian and Azerbaijani detainees earlier today and reports that additional confidence-building measures are being discussed. We will continue to work with Armenia and Azerbaijan to move the process forward. We continue to believe that peace is possible if both parties are willing to pursue it.

QUESTION: You made it clear last week that the Secretary is looking forward to having the ministers in town. What date did he have in mind?

MR MILLER: Stay tuned. I’m not going to make an announcement on that from here today.

QUESTION: Thank you. Moving to Ukraine if I may.

MR MILLER: Yeah.

QUESTION: Does the department have any position on Hungary’s blocking Ukraine European bid and also aid for Ukraine? I know your traditional position was we have no dog in it, but things are getting out of control in that part of the world.

MR MILLER: So I will say that we – the United States and the EU have been resolute in standing with Ukraine. We believe now is the time to step up that support. It’s vital in our – to our national security and that of our European partners. We appreciate the EU’s continued efforts to provide financial support to Ukraine and hope that the EU can quickly agree on funding for 2024 and beyond.

QUESTION: And broadly speaking respecting yesterday’s conversation in this town, also what’s being discussed in Europe, on the point of border issue – I don’t want to drag you into domestic politics, but is there any research or any —

MR MILLER: But you’re going to try. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: — let’s say assessment going on on it? Is the department doing any assessment on what will the European and American borders look like if we allowed Putin win the war against the largest country in Europe?

MR MILLER: I’m not going to answer that question. That’s a hypothetical I’m not going to get into because we want Ukraine to win this war, and that’s why we think it’s so important that the United States Congress provide the security assistance that we have requested to Ukraine so it can win this war.

QUESTION: Thank you. My last topic, I promise.

MR MILLER: Yeah.

QUESTION: Do you have any comment on the fresh charges against Alsu Kurmasheva in Russia and the latest developments, if there’s an update on —

MR MILLER: So I would say that we have seen those reports. We’re closely following her detention. We’re aware of the – that there may be possible charges against her because we’ve seen those reports. Again, we have sought consular access to her the Russian Government has not provided. We will continue to insist on it. They have acknowledged her detention to us, though they have not made a formal notification. And we, as always, take seriously our commitment to assist U.S. citizens abroad, and we will continue to do that in this case.

QUESTION: Now that they have acknowledged it, is there any doubt in your mind that she is wrongfully detained?

MR MILLER: That’s not a determination that we have made yet. But as I have said before, with all these cases, we are constantly assessing facts and the law and making the most appropriate determination.

QUESTION: Thank you so much.

MR MILLER: Go ahead.

QUESTION: I wanted to ask about the member of the Polish parliament who used a fire extinguisher to snuff out lights on a menorah in the parliament building there. I know the ambassador of Poland posted on X about this, but have you seen that video? Do you have any comment?

MR MILLER: I have not seen the video personally. I’ve seen the report. Obviously that seems — that would I think be an inappropriate action to take, but not having seen the video myself and only seen the preliminary reports, I’d refer you to the comment made by the ambassador.

QUESTION: This seems like a pretty blatant example of antisemitism.

MR MILLER: I would say that we have, unfortunately, in the wake of October 7th seen a dramatic rise in antisemitism around the world. That has been one of the unfortunate outgrowths of these attacks, in the aftermath of the attack. We have made clear antisemitism is inappropriate in any form, just as we have made clear that Islamophobia is inappropriate in any form. And we will continue to make that clear to countries around the world.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR MILLER: Go ahead.

QUESTION: Matt, I have two or three question. It’s small question. Israel is the best equipped army in the world, and they have the support of mighty USA. And they’re not fighting another country; they’re fighting a small group of people in Gaza strip. How come they are taking more than two months to win their goal? How come it’s still they are – it seems like they are struggling.

MR MILLER: They are facing an enemy who has had years to dig tunnels underneath a civilian population, to hide behind civilians, to arm itself, and who showed on October 7th possess, unfortunately, quite significant military capacity and quite significant ability to inflict torture upon the – inflict terrorism on the Israeli people. So I think what you’ve seen is they are facing a very brutal, entrenched opponent, and they are well within their right to do everything they can to take on that opponent and do everything possible to ensure that October 7th is not repeated.

QUESTION: The second question I have: Three-time prime minister of Bangladesh, Begum Khaleda Zia – there’s a media report that she was being poisoned and ill-treated while she was in government custody. Now they are not allowing her to go – go to have an adequate treatment and she’s dying. UN already made the request for her treatment abroad. Does America has any plan to make the same request?

MR MILLER: Let me take that question back and get an answer. Go ahead.

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

MR MILLER: Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt. I have a couple of questions on Bangladesh and one on Sri Lanka. Could you please share the State Department’s stance on the investigative report by Financial Times today, which reports that Sheikh Hasina’s government in Bangladesh orchestrated a planned propaganda campaign involving fake news, fake videos, using artificial intelligence tools against the United States and Bangladesh opposition political parties in the context of upcoming dummy election?

MR MILLER: So we have seen the concerning news of deep fakes in election-related disinformation in Bangladesh. It’s part of a worrying trend around the globe of using AI to manipulate and influence democratic processes.

QUESTION: Six international human rights organization urge the international community to stand for the protection of fundamental rights in Bangladesh as the regime makes the whole country in prison ahead of so-called election of banning political activities, except election campaign from December 18.

On the other end, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Momen and his deputy claim that they will also be able to manage United States. After forming the government, he mentioned that U.S. will support the government. What is your response on that?

MR MILLER: So we are deeply concerned by the reports of mass arrests of thousands of opposition members and reports of torture in prison. We urge all sides to exercise restraint and avoid violence. We urge the Government of Bangladesh to work with all stakeholders to create conditions in which all may participate in the pre-election and election environment freely, without fear of violence or retribution. It is our belief that a healthy democracy benefits from a variety of voices speaking freely, engaged in dialogue and discussion in an exchange about the issues of the day.

QUESTION: On Sri Lanka, in a bipartisan resolution of the Senate Foreign Relation Committee asks the Government of Sri Lanka to listen to the – and respect the rights of – the Sri Lankan people by addressing corruption and sharing justice for human rights abuse and holding free, fair, local and provincial elections without further delay. What is your comment on that?

MR MILLER: So we always support accountability for corruption and, of course, the holding of free and fair elections.

QUESTION: On Bangladesh.

QUESTION: Matt.

MR MILLER: Go ahead. Yeah.

QUESTION: Yes. The Pakistani army chief is in Washington seeking U.S. support against alleged terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan. What kind of support is the U.S. willing to offer Pakistan, and will drone strikes be considered?

MR MILLER: So I’m not going to comment in – with respect to his meetings, other than that generally speaking we look forward to partnering with the Pakistani Government on regional security and defense cooperation. We have taken a number of steps to partner with them this year on antiterrorism activities. In March, the United States and Pakistan held a high-level counterterrorism dialogue to discuss the shared terrorist threats facing our two countries and to develop strategies to cooperate in critical areas, such as border security and countering the financing of terrorism. And we fund several counterterrorism capacity-building programs in Pakistan focused on law enforcement and justice, and we look forward to carrying out that work.

QUESTION: Can I ask on Afghanistan?

MR MILLER: Yeah. Go ahead.

QUESTION: CBS spoke with the family of Ryan Corbett, an American who’s been unlawfully detained by the Taliban, has been held captive there for 16 months. We were told as part of our reporting that Special Representative Tom West just met with Taliban representatives in Doha, and per their – the State Department’s readout of that meeting, detainees, including Ryan, were a central focus of the conversation. A Taliban readout didn’t mention detainees at all, so we’re curious how willing you believe the Taliban to be to engage on the topic of detainees at this moment.

MR MILLER: So I don’t want to try to assess their willingness. What I will say is that, of course, we have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. Not just in this meeting but in previous meetings we have continually pressed for the release of Americans detained in Afghanistan. Special Representative West did meet with a representative of the Taliban this week and pressed for the release of Ryan Corbett and other American detainees. It is something that we never lose focus on, and I’d say that from the Secretary on down, a number of people in this – this building and this administration work on it. So I wouldn’t want to assess their willingness other than to say it is the highest priority for us and we will continue to work on it.

QUESTION: One quick follow-up, because I believe the last sort of formal readout of U.S. officials’ interactions with the Taliban was issued in July. How would you characterize the level, the pace, the tenor of interactions with the Taliban since that time, including in recent months?

MR MILLER: I wouldn’t want to – I’m like searching for an adjective in my head. I don’t think I have one to characterize other than to say that we meet with them when it’s in our interest to do so, and one of the reasons we do meet with them is we think it’s – we want to see these Americans returned and we want to do everything in our power to do so.

QUESTION: Thank you.

QUESTION: Matthew, sir?

QUESTION: Matt, can I —

MR MILLER: Next time maybe I’ll think of an adjective.

QUESTION: Can I ask —

MR MILLER: Go – no, go ahead. Or you.

QUESTION: Thank you.

MR MILLER: Yeah, you, go ahead. Not you. Go ahead. Right there, yeah. Sorry, I don’t know your name, but go ahead.

QUESTION: Eva. I’m with Epoch Times.

MR MILLER: Okay.

QUESTION: Thank you for taking my question. So yesterday, a – the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party issued a bipartisan policy proposal with 150 recommendations, and they are calling to – for a reset on the relationship with China. Specifically, some of the recommendations include restricting outbound investment and raising tariffs on goods imported from China. So I’m wondering, like, how much support would you perceive from the Biden administration on these policy proposals?

MR MILLER: So I’m not going to speak with respect to those specific proposals, but we have imposed restrictions on outbound investment. We have imposed sanctions and export controls that target specific sectors of the Chinese economy when we’ve seen inappropriate activities. We have made clear to the Chinese Government – the Secretary has made this clear, the President has made this clear – that we will continue to take those actions when it is in our national security interest to do so, but at the same time, we want the ability to work with China both on issues of mutual concern between our two countries and on broader global issues when it makes sense to do so.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: Okay, thank you. I have two questions. First one: Israel has an actual – a serious plan to flood the tunnels in Gaza with seawater. This action will threaten the lives of hostages and cause environmental disaster. Do you agree with this military plan? And what are you going to do to stop Israel from this madness plan?

MR MILLER: So I’ve seen the reports of that activity. I will leave it to Israel to speak to the details of its military campaigns, but I will make clear publicly the same thing we’ve said to them privately, that with respect to any tactic that they carry out, it should be done with – in compliance with international humanitarian law and in a way that is designed to maximize civilian protection.

QUESTION: Okay, the other question: The American administration consistently express its concern about the safety of civilian in Gaza, but in fact, the weapons supplied by United States are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of civilian, most of them children, women, and elderly people. So why doesn’t United State administration put strict condition on the use of these weapons to protect the Palestinian civilians?

MR MILLER: So there – with respect to every weapon that we transfer, not just to Israel but to every country around the world, there are conditions on the transfer of those weapons and we expect that they will be used in full compliance with international humanitarian law. And one of the things that we continue to engage with the Government of Israel about is that – is steps that they can take to minimize civilian harm. You’ve heard me talk about those steps from here today. You’ve heard me talk to them other days, as has the Secretary, as has the President.

We believe that far too many Palestinian civilians have died as a result of this conflict. We want to see Israel take additional steps to protect innocent civilians. We want to see them establish these enduring deconfliction zones and enduring pauses so – that are predictable so civilians know where they can go to get out of harm’s way, so civilians – so humanitarian assistants know that they can bring assistance in. I’ll go back to what I’ve said a number of times, which is this is such a difficult problem because you have Hamas continuing to embed itself in civilian homes, in civilian infrastructure, to use civilians as human shields, but that doesn’t in any way lessen Israel’s burden to do everything it can to protect civilians, and that is what we are engaging with them on a daily basis to try to achieve.

QUESTION: Okay, thank you.

MR MILLER: Come over here.

QUESTION: Thank you. I’ll just follow up Biden’s remarks yesterday. In the same remarks, Biden said that Netanyahu has to change, and this came hours after Netanyahu said that there is a disagreement with the – Biden regarding the post-Hamas Gaza. I don’t – I know you don’t comment on White House – Biden’s remarks, but has there been —

MR MILLER: Who’s got a radio on in the room? Or walkie-talkie. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: Has there —

MR MILLER: Sorry, sorry. It’s – I would say sorry, but it actually wasn’t me interrupting. Go ahead.

QUESTION: Has there been any contacts with the Israelis regarding this after Biden’s remarks yesterday? And what was the reaction from the Israelis? How is – does the U.S. plan to overcome this disagreement with Netanyahu government?

MR MILLER: So I’m not going to speak to any conversations that we may or may not have had since – in the last 24 hours, but I will say we have been quite clear for some time that there are steps that we think Israel needs to take that you have seen the Israeli Government come out and say they’re not prepared to take. And you’ve seen that at times we’ve overcome those disagreements; you saw it when the Secretary traveled to the region and wanted to achieve an increase of humanitarian assistance. The Israeli Government wasn’t able – willing to do it at first; we reached an agreement. You saw the Secretary come to the region and say we want to see humanitarian pauses implemented and the prime minister come out and say they were unwilling to do so, and then a few days later implement them. And you have seen most notably, I think, a very disagreement between us and the Government of Israel about the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

So the same – the case that we have made to them privately, and we will continue to make publicly to them and to other countries in the region and around the world, is that there can be no lasting peace and security in the region without meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. We believe that is not just in the interests of the Palestinian people, but in the long-term security interests of the Israeli people.

One of the things that you have heard the Secretary say a number of times when talking about the steps that we have urged the Israeli Government to take is that a lot of the things we encourage them to do are not just the morally right thing to do, but are in Israel’s security interests, and that’s a case that we will continue to make to them.

QUESTION: Yeah, thank you, Matthew. Yesterday the Iranian foreign minister said that – and he confirmed that his government is receiving messages from Washington weekly. But he said that this has nothing to do with Iran and these groups who are attacking the U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, they are defending the people in Gaza. Do you think that the Iranian Government derailing your messages and they are not taking your messages, and they have no will to rein their groups in Iraq and Syria from attacking your forces?

MR MILLER: So I will say that the Secretary’s had a number of conversations, including a face-to-face meeting in Baghdad with Prime Minister Sadani, and has been very clear on two things: one, that we expect the Iraqi Government to take action against the groups that have carried out forces – that have carried out attacks against U.S. forces, and most recently against the U.S. embassy in Iraq, and that if they don’t, we will not hesitate to take the actions that we need to take to defend our personnel in the region. And I think I’ll leave it at that.

QUESTION: Yeah. Yesterday there were a call between Secretary Blinken and Prime Minister Sudani, and in the statement –

MR MILLER: That’s what I was just referring to, yeah.

QUESTION: Yeah, in the statement you – it’s been said that the Secretary noted that these groups are doing these attacks with the support of Iran. But do you aware of that the groups that you named in the recent statements and the Pentagon statements, they are part of the popular mobilization groups, Hashd al-Sha’bi, and these groups are funded by the Iraqi Government; they’re receiving this year 2.7 billion from the Iraqi budget. Have you requested the Iraqi Government to cut the funds to these groups?

MR MILLER: Again, I am not going to speak to our private diplomatic conversations, other than to say that we have made quite clear that we expect the Iraqi Government to take action to hold these groups accountable.

QUESTION: Are you worried about the –

MR MILLER: Let me go – let me go here, and then we’re going to wrap for today, unless –

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt.

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

MR MILLER: Yeah, go ahead – no, no, in front of you. Sorry. Go ahead.

QUESTION: I have a —

MR MILLER: Go – go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt. I know a lot of people are asking a question on Bangladesh. Do you have any new news for new sanction against Bangladesh before election on 7th of January?

MR MILLER: I do not have any new sanctions to announce today. It is our longstanding practice not to preview sanctions actions before we take them.

And with that, I will wrap for today. Thanks, everyone.

(The briefing was concluded at 1:19 p.m.)"
8,Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry’s Remarks to the Press at the Conclusion of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28),https://www.state.gov/remarks-to-the-press-at-the-conclusion-of-the-un-climate-change-conference-cop28/,"Text as prepared. A full recording of the press conference is available on the UNFCCC website.

SECRETARY KERRY: Good afternoon, everyone — and thank you for joining us today.

I want to first thank the entire UAE team, the other Parties, and the secretariat for their spirit of cooperation and diligent work over the past two weeks to finalize this first global stocktake.

The global stocktake addresses an issue that is at the core of the climate crisis. For the first time at a COP, fossil fuels have been on the table as a major part of our negotiations.

The decision embraces transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems so as to achieve net-zero by 2050. And the first and easiest thing that countries need to do to make this commitment a reality is to stop building new unabated coal.

I am grateful for the efforts of people around the world who helped us reach this outcome. Just a few months ago, youth organizers led more than 70,000 people in marching through the streets around the UN General Assembly to call for action on fossil fuels.

Clearly, we would have liked to have seen ever greater ambition, as called for by these organizers and frontline communities around the world – particularly small island states for whom we know this is an immediate crisis. And we will continue to press for a more rapid transition, in recognition of the risks they face.

The United States supported this call for clearer language about the need to largely phase out fossil fuels, but we know this was a compromise between many Parties. And that does not detract from its significance.

In particular, we would highlight that the use of any transitional fuels needs to be aligned with 1.5 degrees, which means that they will play a limited and temporary role while we largely phase out fossil fuels in our energy systems by 2050, with abatement technologies focusing on hard to abate sectors.

As agreed to in the Sunnylands Statement that we and the PRC released prior to COP, this document calls for the next set of NDCs to be economy-wide and cover all greenhouse gases. In addition, it includes a much stronger and clearer call on 1.5-aligned NDCs than we have ever heard before.

The direction to triple renewable energy, double energy efficiency, phase down unabated coal power, and halt and reverse deforestation and degradation by 2030 will be foundational to our efforts for the next seven years and beyond.

This text also aligns with the decisions the marketplace has already made. The message coming out of this COP is that we are moving away from fossil fuels – and we are not turning back.

The United States is leading the charge on this on the home front through investments in the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – investments that are bolstering our economic and energy security, while also bringing down the costs of clean technologies globally.

In addition to the progress on mitigation, this COP has also successfully delivered a framework on the global goal on adaptation, providing momentum to increase resilience to the increasingly severe climate impacts facing communities around the world.

On finance, this outcome makes abundantly clear that we must transform the international financial system to pursue and achieve our climate goals.

The global stocktake underscores that we must continue to drive investments in climate action at all levels, put policies in place to incentivize change, and shift finance away from the things that put our shared prosperity at risk.

With 190 countries coming together around this result, it’s clear that no one country can do this alone.

And this decision makes clear that we will stand by and support our partners in developing countries every step of the way, as they take ambitious steps to build clean energy systems and resilient futures for everyone.

President Biden is committed to these efforts. Last week, the United States announced that U.S. climate finance is expected to exceed $9.5 billion in 2023, on track to meet the President’s pledge of over $11 billion in 2024 – which includes a significant scaling up of adaptation finance through the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE).

Let’s also not lose sight of what we achieved in the first week of this conference – starting with the unprecedented adoption of a major item on the first day of a COP to operationalize loss and damage funding arrangements, leading to over $700 million in immediate pledges from both developed and developing countries.

We also made major announcements across a number of sectors – from $1 billion in new grant funding for methane to over 40 new announcements to cut emissions from shipping.

And we made progress in elevating critical issues such as gender, health, peace, and food systems, some of which for the first time had dedicated days at the COP.

In closing – I’ll note that I was privileged to lead the U.S. delegation as Secretary of State when we produced the Paris Agreement in 2015. At that time, the world was headed toward as much as 4 degrees of warming. As a response, Parties came together to try and limit warming to well below 2 degrees and aspiring to 1.5.

Now it is crystal clear how important it is to limit to 1.5 – and that is repeated throughout this decision.

So it is a privilege to be here, eight years later, after the adoption of the first global stocktake – with nations around the world committed to taking the actions necessary to keep 1.5C alive."
9,"Testimony of Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Before the Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee On Oversight And Investigations, U.S. House",https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1982,"As Prepared for Delivery

Chairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Green, and Distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak on what the U.S. Department of the Treasury is doing to combat terrorist financing. October 7 was a day of horror. The brutality of the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel—killing indiscriminately, sparing neither children nor the elderly—was an affront to our shared humanity, and a stark and somber reminder of the constant threat posed by terrorist organizations like Hamas. Along with the rest of the Biden Administration, I am dedicated to doing all I can, together with members of this Committee and others, to prevent such events from reoccurring.

The Administration is also firmly resolved in support of Israel’s right to defend itself and committed to working with our Israeli partners to identify and disrupt terrorist financing. As the members of this Committee know well, terrorist organizations are sustained by financial support. They require a source of income to purchase the instruments of terror, to recruit and train individuals, and ultimately to carry out their attacks all over the world. It is my responsibility as the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes to identify and disrupt terrorist financing in the United States and abroad.

Since the attacks, Treasury has redoubled its efforts to identify and freeze the finances of Hamas and other Iran-backed terrorist groups. We have prioritized investigating the specific financial flows that enabled Hamas to carry out its attacks, and work to strengthen a global coalition to counter terrorist financing, in no small part because Hamas now will be more dependent than before on financing from outside of Gaza. My purpose today is to give an account of Treasury’s goals and actions, including our efforts to engage allies and partners in the private and public sectors, to close off the financial systems from abuse by terrorists.

As background, reports have indicated Hamas has an annual budget of around $500 million. Hamas has traditionally been able to raise funds for its terrorist activities from an array of sources, including taxation and extortion of trade and economic activity in Gaza, donations both large and small, a portfolio of corporate investments across Africa and the Middle East, and direct support from Iran. Alongside fiat currency, Hamas uses virtual assets and virtual asset service providers as a store of value and means to launder funds. Virtual assets represent a relatively modest portion of its overall financial picture but are still a cause for serious illicit finance concerns.

The financial facilitators of Hamas spend their money purchasing weapons and munitions, covering operational expenses, broadening their regional influence, and enriching their elite leaders, who live in luxury abroad. At the same time, Gaza struggles economically and hundreds of thousands of its people remain impoverished.1

The U.S. Treasury Department has historically used the full scope of its authorities to impede Hamas’s funding, developing expertise to identify and track Hamas financial flows, through targeted financial sanctions, and by engaging international partners on these efforts. The State Department designated Hamas both as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially

Designated Global Terrorist in 1997 and 2001, respectively, making it subject to blocking sanctions by Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Sanctions designations of the group’s leaders, financial facilitators, investments, entities, and instrumentalities span over two decades, and have blocked tens of millions of dollars linked to Hamas from transiting the U.S. financial system.2 Recognizing the dangerous role that Iran plays, both in funding Hamas specifically, and in destabilizing the region more broadly, Treasury has sanctioned nearly one thousand individuals and entities connected to the Iranian regime and its proxies to date.3

As the U.S. Treasury and other partners have applied pressure on the group over years, Hamas has innovated and adapted its financial strategy. It has kept its accounts in plain sight and in the shadows and systematically manipulated deficiencies in financial crime regimes across jurisdictions to its financial benefit. The most recent attacks and war with Israel should be seen as a particular call to action to truly starve Hamas of funding for terror, enhance international financial institutions’ vigilance to identify these illicit funds, and to expand the international community’s tough targeted measures to arrest terrorist assets.

As a strategic matter, Treasury sanctions have targeted the full scope of how Hamas raises and moves funds to include financial facilitators, revenue generators, and even virtual asset exchanges that enable acts of terror by Hamas, its Iranian patron, and its counterpart regional terrorist proxies that seek to advance the violent agenda of destabilization and harm to Israel.

Since the October 7 attacks, Treasury has released 3 separate sanctions tranches focused on Hamas, designating over 50 additional individuals and entities linked to Hamas and Iran, across multiple jurisdictions. Tomorrow, Treasury will announce another tranche of sanctions on Hamas entities. Moreover, Treasury’s recent enforcement action against Binance, the largest virtual asset exchange in the world, included charges based on its failure to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists, including Hamas’ militant wing Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and ISIS.4

Furthermore, over the last few months Treasury has maintained its careful scrutiny over funds linked to Iran, including funds restricted overseas for humanitarian purposes. We have announced new designations targeting Iran’s support for terrorist proxies, including on those linked to Hizballah and Houthi financial facilitators.

These targeted measures will continue, Treasury’s vigilance will continue, and Treasury will maintain a forward-leaning sanctions posture to uncover the financial networks supporting Hamas. It is Treasury’s responsibility to do so to ensure that the U.S. and global financial systems do not enable or are not abused by groups conducting these heinous terrorist attacks.

Disrupting Hamas’s international financial networks requires international action, and to this end we need sustained action from our foreign counterparts. Treasury’s actions to designate entities, freeze funds, and exert targeted financial pressure are only the start of our overall strategic work.

In the wake of the Hamas attacks, Treasury reached out to our foreign counterparts to share information and press them to expand their efforts. Two of the earliest calls I made were to my counterparts in Israel and in the Palestinian Authority to convey my horror at the attacks and offer our support to investigate and disrupt terrorist financing. I and other leaders at the Treasury Department engaged directly with counterparts across the Middle East and Europe to convey the Administration’s support for Israel and the intent to use all the tools at our disposal to expose and disrupt Hamas’s money for terror. Treasury has in place a formal network to work with regional counterparts to share information and target terrorist leaders and entities, referred to as the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, which we promptly convened in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in October following the attack to closely examine Hamas’ terrorist attacks and to discuss with our Gulf partners the need to intensify efforts to investigate and prosecute terrorist financing.

Additionally, Treasury Under Secretary Nelson recently traveled to Türkiye to discuss the urgent need for Turkish efforts to freeze Hamas funds. We have pointed out explicitly to Türkiye instances in which Hamas’s activities violate their own domestic securities and financial auditing laws. Hamas leaders live and move freely in Türkiye5 Qatar6, and elsewhere, publicly solicit funds, and enjoy financial services and the ability to collect commercial revenue on investments. In Deputy Secretary Adeyemo’s recent travel to Europe in late October, he pressed partners to investigate entities with possible ties to Hamas and ensure no funds can move from European jurisdictions to the terrorist group.7

My team also followed up with substantive, technical outreach to our partners in Australia, Japan, Canada, and throughout Europe, which has led to complementary sanctions actions by Australia, the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom to designate Hamas-related targets through their own domestic authorities. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) engaged financial intelligence unit (FIU) counterparts across the world to enhance and expedite information sharing efforts. This has led to the formation of an international task force of FIUs from Australia, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, Israel, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and others that will enable partners to better work with their respective domestic law enforcement authorities to identify and stop terrorist funding channels.8

In addition to direct outreach to foreign governments, Treasury has also directly engaged the private sector both in the United States and abroad to refine the red flags and indicators of terrorist financing and underscore the imperative to report and freeze terrorist funds. On October 20, FinCEN issued an alert providing financial institutions with red flag indicators of terrorist financing, as well as a new Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) key term specifically for Hamas to encourage more and better SAR filings to FinCEN related to Hamas. These filings assist in deepening Treasury’s analysis of Hamas financing and its ability to expose and disrupt it through sanctions, law enforcement action, or concerted work with foreign counterparts. Treasury has

also engaged multiple financial institutions and money services businesses (MSBs), including those who focus on cash, currency exchange, remittance and virtual asset transfer, to highlight our increased concern and compliance expectations.9

Additionally, Treasury announced a Notice of Proposed Rule Making on October 19 that identifies international convertible virtual asset mixing as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern, including because of the ability of terrorist groups like Hamas and PIJ to use such services to obscure and launder illicit funds.10 My team is also in the final stages of preparing the 2024 National Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessments, which will include specific analysis of the financing for Hamas and other Iran-aligned terrorist groups, and the risk they pose to our financial system. These assessments will be published early next year and will provide a basis for U.S. financial institutions to evaluate and update their own risked-based approach to their anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs.

Alongside these counter-illicit finance activities, Treasury has a significant role to play in addressing the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza to ensure that our financial measures do not negatively impact legitimate aid going to the people of Gaza. The United States is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian territories and is rigorously focused on this aid being able to flow, while guarding against risks of finance diversion. Accordingly, Treasury has had direct, regularized, and close engagement with representatives of non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and U.S. government implementers of humanitarian assistance. In convening these discussions, Treasury’s goal is to understand the challenges that these organizations face, address these challenges, and raise awareness about those who are seeking to abuse charities and the non-profit sector to gather and launder funds for terrorism.

In sum, Treasury’s response to Hamas and its funders over decades has been broad and aggressive. Indeed, it is the core mission of my office to focus on terrorist financing and innovating to adapt to the evolving ways terrorist make and spend money. As this Committee fully appreciates, Hamas’s attacks, and their relationship with Iran, pose a threat to the safety and stability not only of Israel, but to the region more broadly, and to American interests.

Although we have different roles to play, all of us here share a common interest: preventing acts of terror. Secretary Yellen and Deputy Secretary Adeyemo have previously spoken about how to confront these challenges—by maintaining U.S. leadership abroad, meeting all our financial commitments, and adapting our laws to meet the challenges posed by new and emerging financial technologies. On these issues and more, I look forward to working with the members of this committee and taking any questions you may have for me today.

10,Russian Cyber Actors are Exploiting a Known Vulnerability with Worldwide Impact,http://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3616384/russian-cyber-actors-are-exploiting-a-known-vulnerability-with-worldwide-impact/,"FORT MEADE, Md. - The National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and co-authoring agencies warn that Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) cyber actors are exploiting a publicly known vulnerability to compromise victims globally, including in the United States and in allied countries. To raise awareness and help organizations identify, protect, and mitigate this malicious activity, the authoring agencies have jointly released the Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), “Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Exploiting JetBrains TeamCity CVE Globally.”



The CSA details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by the SVR actors, technical details of their operation, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and mitigation recommendations for network defenders.



“Russian cyber actors continue taking advantage of known vulnerabilities for intelligence collection,” said Rob Joyce, Director of NSA’s Cybersecurity Directorate. “It is critical to ensure systems are patched quickly, and to implement the mitigations and use the IOCs listed in this report to hunt for adversary persistent access.”



The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Polish Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW), CERT Polska (CERT.PL), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) collaborated with NSA and the FBI to assess the SVR cyber actors’ recent malicious activities.



The SVR cyber actors, who are also known as Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT 29), the Dukes, CozyBear, and NOBELIUM/Midnight Blizzard, have been targeting Internet-connected JetBrains TeamCity servers globally as early as September 2023. Victims identified in the report include companies that provide software for billing, medical devices, customer care, employee monitoring, financial management, marketing, sales, and video games, as well as hosting companies, tool manufacturers, small and large IT companies, and an energy trade association.



The CSA notes that SVR actors exploit a known vulnerability, CVE-2023-42793, to gain initial access to the TeamCity servers and then perform malicious activities, such as escalating privileges, moving laterally, deploying additional backdoors, and taking other steps to ensure persistent, long-term access to the compromised network environments.



According to the CSA, software developers use TeamCity servers to manage and automate software development, compilation, testing, and releasing. Access to a TeamCity server can provide malicious actors with access to source code, signing certificates, and the ability to subvert software compilation and deployment processes and conduct malicious supply chain operations.



The agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations in the advisory to improve their cybersecurity posture based on the SVR cyber actors’ malicious activity. Mitigations listed in the CSA include implementing a patch issued by JetBrains TeamCity, deploying host-based and endpoint protection systems, using multi-factor authentication, and auditing log files.

11,Justice Department Publishes Model Legislation to Help States Reduce Gun Violence and Improve Gun Safety,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-publishes-model-legislation-help-states-reduce-gun-violence-and-improve,"The Justice Department published two pieces of model legislation for states to consider to help address the continuing epidemic of gun violence affecting communities across the country. The model legislation is drawn from commonsense gun-safety statutes already on the books in a broad cross-section of states.

First, the Department published model legislation to help states craft appropriate requirements for securing firearms kept in residences and vehicles and to ensure that those firearms do not fall into the hands of children, teens, and prohibited persons. Second, the Department published model legislation to help states craft appropriate requirements for the prompt reporting of lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement. The resources for states announced today follow model legislation on extreme risk protection orders first published by the Justice Department in June 2021.

“Whether stolen from lawful gun owners or found by children and teens, unsecured firearms are responsible for thousands of injuries and deaths across our country each year,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “We cannot resign ourselves to losing our neighbors, our loved ones — even our children — to misuse of firearms that could have been kept safely out of reach. The model legislation announced today provides states with new tools to improve the safety of legally-owned firearms and reduce the tragic toll of gun violence in our communities.”

Empirical evidence shows that the secure storage of firearms saves lives. Keeping firearms and ammunition locked has been associated with a lower risk of firearm injuries for children and teens in homes where guns are stored. Safe storage protects both minors and adults by preventing unintentional shootings and decreasing the risk of gun suicides, gun thefts, and criminal discharges of firearms. Based on similar laws already on the books in over a dozen states, the model secure-storage legislation will help additional states craft laws to reduce the risks associated with unattended firearms.

Every year, thousands of firearms are lost or stolen out of vehicles, businesses, and private homes. The timely reporting of lost and stolen firearms allows police to develop investigative leads and identify patterns that might indicate the involvement of illicit firearms traffickers. Based on similar laws already in effect across 15 states and D.C., the model theft/loss-reporting legislation will help additional states craft laws to ensure prompt and responsible engagement with local law enforcement.

These model bills provide a framework that will help more states enact sensible gun-safety laws. Both pieces of model legislation are accompanied by detailed commentary that will make it easier for states to assess various policy options and select appropriate requirements, notices, and penalties. The Justice Department encourages states to consider adopting their own versions of this model legislation to ensure safer communities across the country.

The model legislation on secure firearm storage is available here. The model legislation on reporting lost and stolen firearms is available here."
12,Former Chicago-Area Return Preparer Sentenced to Prison for Filing False Tax Returns,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-chicago-area-return-preparer-sentenced-prison-filing-false-tax-returns,"A former Illinois woman was sentenced today to 14 months in prison for willfully preparing false tax returns on behalf of her clients.

According to court documents and statements made in court, Erica Early, formerly of Robins and Richton Park, Illinois, operated a tax preparation business for clients located in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana, and often charged $1,000 to prepare basic, uncomplicated tax returns. Early falsely inflated her clients’ income to maximize the Earned Income Tax Credit and falsely claimed education-related credits on their behalf. Early, who was a U.S. Postal Service employee during some of the time she was engaged in preparing the false returns, also falsified her own tax returns, claiming education credits she knew she was not eligible to receive.

Early concealed her scheme by preparing clients’ returns as a “ghost preparer,” marking them as self-prepared instead of identifying herself as the paid preparer. Initially, Early directed her fees and client refunds to her personal bank account that was then closed by the bank after detecting fraudulent activity. Early then began requiring her clients to obtain prepaid debit cards in their names that Early would use to deposit her clients’ refunds as well as receive her preparation fee, avoiding the use of traditional banks.

In addition to the term of imprisonment, U.S. District Judge Elaine E. Bucklo for the Northern District of Illinois ordered Early to serve one year of supervised release and to pay $515,990 in restitution to the United States.

Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division made the announcement.

IRS Criminal Investigation investigated the case.

Assistant Chief Matthew J. Kluge and Trial Attorney Boris Bourget of the Tax Division prosecuted the case."

“We are glad that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear this important case. While the litigation continues, the stay the Court entered earlier this year means that mifepristone will remain available under the conditions approved by the FDA based on its expert scientific judgment. The Justice Department will not cease its efforts to defend the FDA’s authorities and expertise in this area.”"
14,Man Pleads Guilty to Concealing War Crime Charge in Croatia,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-pleads-guilty-concealing-war-crime-charge-croatia,"An Ohio man pleaded guilty today to possessing a green card he illegally obtained by concealing that he had been charged with a war crime in Croatia prior to emigrating to the United States.

According to court documents, Jugoslav Vidic, 55, of Parma Heights, in applying to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States, falsely stated that he had never been charged with breaking any law even though he knew he had been charged in Croatia with a war crime against the civilian population. Vidic also falsely stated that his only past military service was in the Yugoslav Army from 1988 to 1989 and omitting his service in the Serb Army of Krajina and its predecessors during the civil war in the former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 1995. As a result of these materially false statements, Vidic was approved for lawful permanent status and received a green card.

“Jugoslav Vidic knew he had been charged with a war crime, concealed that fact from U.S. immigration officials so he could enter the United States, and enjoyed lawful status in this country for nearly 20 years,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Thanks to the dedication of prosecutors, law enforcement, and our international partners, Vidic will serve prison time and then be removed from this country. His conviction demonstrates that no human rights violation is too distant for the Justice Department to seek accountability.”

“By pleading guilty, Jugoslav Vidic admitted that he lied in his application to become a lawful permanent U.S. resident, hiding the fact that he had been charged with and convicted in absentia of committing war crimes in Croatia,” said U.S. Attorney Rebecca C. Lutzko for the Northern District of Ohio. “He also admitted to concealing his military service during the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, including in the specialized ‘Red Berets’ unit. Vidic tried to outrun his past, but today it caught up with him. Our country has long provided opportunities for refugees searching for a better life, but America extends that privilege with the expectation that applicants respect basic human rights and are truthful about their personal history. The Justice Department will hold accountable anyone, such as Vidic, who abuses our immigration system by trying to hide his crimes against humanity.”

Vidic was charged with a war crime in Croatia in 1994 and convicted in absentia in 1998. The Croatian court found that during an attack by ethnic Serb forces in Petrinja, Croatia, on Sept. 16, 1991, Vidic cut off the arm of civilian Stjepan Komes, who died afterward. Vidic knew about the Croatian charges when he immigrated to the United States as a refugee in 1999, applied to become a lawful permanent resident in 2000, and was interviewed by U.S. immigration officials and received his green card in 2005.

“This guilty plea underscores the importance of these complex investigations and the closure they can provide to victims’ families,” said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). “HSI special agents, along with our law enforcement partners both here in the United States and across the globe, will continue the vital work of ensuring that war criminals like Vidic can no longer hide from justice.”

“The FBI is committed to ensuring that perpetrators of war crimes find no safe haven in the United States and are held accountable for lying and fraudulently obtaining U.S. citizen privileges,” said Assistant Director Michael Nordwall of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “The FBI will continue to work alongside our domestic and international partners to pursue justice — no matter how long it takes.”

Vidic pleaded guilty to one count of possessing an alien registration receipt card knowing it had been procured through materially false statements. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29, 2024. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

As part of the plea agreement, Vidic agreed to the entry of a judicial order of removal from the United States. Vidic would be required to serve any sentence imposed in the United States before being removed.

HSI and the FBI are investigating the case with coordination provided by the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center, including the FBI’s International Human Rights Unit. The Justice Departments thanks the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration of the Republic of Croatia, which were both instrumental in furthering the investigation.

Trial Attorney Patrick Jasperse of the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew W. Shepherd and Jerome J. Teresinski for the Northern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs also provided assistance.

Members of the public who have information about human rights violators in the United States are urged to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or through the FBI online tip form, or HSI at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE or through the ICE online tip form.

15,Louisiana Man Sentenced to More Than Three Years in Prison for Dogfighting,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/louisiana-man-sentenced-more-three-years-prison-dogfighting,"A Louisiana man was sentenced today to 41 months in prison for his role in a conspiracy to sponsor, exhibit, possess and transport animals in an interstate animal fighting venture, and to possessing an animal in such a venture, all in violation of the Animal Welfare Act.

Antonio Damon Atkins, 35, of Baton Rouge, is the final of seven total defendants to be sentenced for participating in an interstate dogfighting ring. Atkins previously pleaded guilty. An Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation originally uncovered the ring.

Six of the defendants have already been sentenced, receiving the following for their dogfighting convictions:

Eric “EZ” Williams, Baton Rouge: 60 months in prison

Corey Brown, Baton Rouge: 50 months in prison

Clay Turner, Loranger, Louisiana: 36 months in prison

Dangelo Dontae Cornish, Greensburg, Louisiana: 16 months in prison

Aquintas Kantrell Singleton, Baton Rouge: 12 months and a day in prison

David Guidry III, of Independence, Louisiana: 12 months and a day in prison

“Today’s sentencing is the final chapter of a grim conspiracy to train and kill dogs for sadistic sport,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “We commend the investigators and prosecutors who worked on this case and brought these individuals to justice.”

“With the sentencing of Antonio Atkins today, the culmination of hard work and prosecution of seven defendants has been successfully completed,” said U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Gathe Jr. for the Middle District of Louisiana. “The question becomes: would this case have been discovered if not for an OCDETF lead? This is the true power of the federal government as we see all our agency partners working collectively to send a message that it is not worth violating the Animal Welfare Act. I commend these agencies, along with my office, in working together to achieve justice.”

""Mr. Atkins and the other defendants in this case are faring much better than the dozens of animals they tortured and killed,"" said Special Agent in Charge Douglas A. Williams Jr. of the FBI New Orleans Field Office. ""The FBI thanks its partners for their help in dismantling this vicious operation.""

“The cruel and inhumane practice of animal fighting has no place in a civilized society and is a clear violation of federal law,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Matthew T. Wilkins of the Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General (USDA-OIG). “The outstanding work of our law enforcement partners and USDA-OIG agents who investigated this case made it possible to bring these operators of a major animal fighting venture to justice. This agency has made animal fighting a high priority to demonstrate that these vicious acts of cruelty to animals will not be tolerated.”

The FBI and USDA-OIG investigated the case.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Evans for the District of Minnesota, formerly of the Justice Department’s Environmental Crimes Section, prosecuted the case along with Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lyman E. Thornton III and Jeremy Johnson for the Middle District of Louisiana."
16,Man Sentenced for $11.4M Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Scheme,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-sentenced-114m-medicare-and-medicaid-fraud-scheme,"A Louisiana man was sentenced today to three years in prison for his role in a multi-year scheme to bill Medicare and Medicaid for medically unnecessary durable medical equipment (DME).

According to court documents, from January 2016 to June 2022, Craig L. Lovelace, of Destrehan, billed Medicare and Medicaid through his DME supply company, Advanced Medical Equipment, Inc. (AME), approximately $11.4 million for supplying respiratory support and nutritional support DME — including ventilators, tracheostomy supplies, and feeding tubes — that were not medically necessary or not provided as represented, and for which AME was paid approximately $7.96 million. Lovelace then directed the forgery of medical records, physician notes, and provider signatures in response to audits and record requests to cover up the scheme. Lovelace personally obtained over $3.4 million in proceeds from the scheme, which he used to pay for personal vehicles, personal chef services, events, and entertainment.

On Aug. 17, Lovelace pleaded guilty to health care fraud.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Special Agent in Charge Jason E. Meadows of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry made the announcement.

HHS-OIG and the Louisiana Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigated the case.

Trial Attorney Kelly Z. Walters of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas D. Moses for the Eastern District of Louisiana prosecuted the case.

The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s efforts to combat health care fraud through the Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program. Since March 2007, this program, currently comprised of nine strike forces operating in 27 federal districts, has charged more than 5,400 defendants who collectively have billed federal health care programs and private insurers more than $27 billion. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with HHS-OIG, are taking steps to hold providers accountable for their involvement in health care fraud schemes.

17,Justice Department Announces Funding Opportunities to Support Public Safety in Tribal Communities,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-funding-opportunities-support-public-safety-tribal-0,"The Justice Department today announced the opening of the 2024 Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS) period for comprehensive funding to American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes. CTAS funding supports crime prevention activities, victim services and coordinated community responses to violence in Indian Country.

Administered by the department’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), the solicitation includes guidance on how federally recognized Tribal governments and Tribal consortia can apply for funding to aid in the development of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to public safety and victimization.

“The Office of Justice Programs is committed to working with Tribes and Tribal communities to provide a wide array of services and supports to help keep their communities safe,” said Assistant Attorney General Amy L. Solomon of OJP. “Our grants provide funding to Tribes for their juvenile justice and criminal justice systems, including providing support to victims and families, helping to strengthen Tribal court systems and enabling tribes to develop, expand or strengthen approaches along the juvenile justice continuum.”

The funding from OJP’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and Office for Victims of Crime, along with funding from the COPS Office, can be used for a range of public safety and justice-related projects and services. These include enhancing law enforcement, advancing fair and effective adult and juvenile justice systems and reducing juvenile delinquency and improving youth outcomes. In addition, the grants serve American Indian and Alaska Native victims of child abuse, sexual assault, domestic violence and elder abuse.

“The COPS Office is well aware of the vital role Tribal law enforcement plays in ensuring the safety and well-being of our Native American communities,” said Director Hugh T. Clements Jr. of the COPS Office. “Our commitment to providing them with the resources they need — including officers, equipment and training — is unwavering. By investing in the capabilities of Tribal law enforcement, we strengthen the fabric of justice that spans across state, local, Tribal, and territorial jurisdictions.”

In FY 2023, the department awarded 182 CTAS grants, amounting to more than $96 million in CTAS funding to 111 Tribes and Tribal consortia across the United States.

The grants.gov application deadline for CTAS is March 5, 2024, at 8:59 p.m. ET, and the JustGrants deadline is March 12, 2024, at 8:59 p.m. ET.

The department will also facilitate a series of webinars to guide applicants through the application process. Details, including how to register for these webinars, will be made available online in the coming weeks here."
18,Brothers Sentenced to More Than 35 Years Combined for Manufacturing and Distributing Machineguns Intended for ISIS,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/brothers-sentenced-more-35-years-combined-manufacturing-and-distributing-machineguns,"Moyad Dannon, 25, of Fishers, Indiana, was sentenced today to 200 months, equivalent to 16 years and eight months, in federal prison followed by a lifetime of supervised release, after pleading guilty to attempting to provide material support or resources, namely, firearms, to a designated foreign terrorist organization. His brother, Mahde Dannon, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in October 2021, after pleading guilty to the same charges.

“The defendants in this case fused together two grave threats to Americans’ security by attempting to support a brutal terrorist organization through the illicit manufacture of ghost guns,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “Just as we’ve done in the fight against terrorism, the Justice Department is committed to prevention — stopping gun violence before it happens by cracking down on the illegal production and trafficking of ghost guns.”

“The defendant showed an absolute disregard for the rule of law and is being held accountable for his actions,” said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. “Working with his brother, the defendant produced large caches of privately made firearms and attempted to place them in the hands of ISIS members overseas to be used against U.S. service members and allies. The FBI and our partners worked tirelessly to prevent the weapons from reaching their intended destination, and ensured these defendants faced justice for their attempts to support a foreign terrorist organization. We will continue to aggressively investigate anyone who tries to help terrorists and endangers the lives of others.”

“Violent extremists inspired by events abroad continue to pose a threat to our local communities and to our national security. Indiana is not immune from the poison of radicalization, fueled by terrorist propaganda available online,” said U.S. Attorney Zachary A. Myers for the Southern District of Indiana. “For nearly a year, these defendants worked persistently to arm murderous terrorists with deadly, illegal weapons. Cases like this demonstrate the need for law enforcement agencies to use all available lawful means to identify, disrupt, and prosecute national security threats here at home. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Fishers Police Department, these dangerous men have been held accountable for their actions and our communities will be safe from them for many years.”

According to court documents, in June 2018, the Dannon brothers devised a scheme to deliver stolen firearms to a convicted felon who was cooperating with the FBI.

Between July 2018 and December 2018, the Dannon brothers sold a number of illegally obtained firearms to the cooperating individual. Around the same time period, the Dannon brothers also began to manufacture untraceable “ghost guns” by purchasing firearms parts online and assembling those parts into fully-functioning, .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles, which they sold to an FBI undercover agent.

In late 2018, the Dannon brothers began manufacturing untraceable, fully automatic, .223 caliber rifles, using much the same process they used to manufacture the semi-automatic rifles, and selling those to the undercover agent and confidential informant (CI).

Shortly thereafter, Moyad Dannon accompanied the undercover agent to a location near the U.S. southwest border in an effort to market that rifle, and additional fully-automatic rifles, to a potential buyer who was also cooperating with the FBI. During that trip, Moyad Dannon learned that the potential buyer sought to ship the weapons to a location in the Middle East, where they would be used by ISIS. ISIS is a designated foreign terrorist organization pursuant to Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Despite learning of the ultimate destination of the weapons, the Dannon brothers agreed to manufacture and sell at least 55 additional fully automatic “ghost guns” to the buyer from the American southwest border, believing those weapons would be shipped to the Middle East, to ISIS and its members.

On May 15, 2019, the Dannon brothers manufactured five untraceable, fully automatic, .223 caliber rifles from parts they had purchased online. At that time, the Dannon brothers were fully aware that the plan was to send the five automatic rifles overseas to ISIS. After building the fully automatic rifles, the Dannon brothers sold all five weapons to undercover FBI agents posing as employees of the buyer from near the southwest border. The Dannon brothers were arrested immediately thereafter by the FBI.

Between February and May of 2019, Moyad Dannon had numerous and extensive conversations with an undercover agent who he believed was a member of ISIS then fighting in Syria. During those conversations, Moyad expressed his desire to travel from Indiana to ISIS-controlled areas of Syria, where he sought to utilize his knowledge of firearms and other skills to provide direct military assistance to ISIS in its fight against the United States and Syrian government.

In a search following his arrest, FBI agents located a flash drive on Moyad’s keychain containing approximately 16 gigabytes of ISIS propaganda, including graphically violent videos depicting ISIS fighters beheading civilians and hostages, and ISIS snipers killing U.S. military personnel. Identical ISIS propaganda videos were discovered on a laptop computer.

The FBI’s Indianapolis Field Office’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Fishers, Indiana, Police Department investigated the case.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew Rinka, Kate Olivier, and Kelly Rota for the Southern District of Indiana and Deputy Chief Paul Casey and Trial Attorney Kevin Nunnally of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section prosecuted this case."
19,"Congress Must Act to Fully Fund WIC in 2024, Or Risk Nutrition Security for Millions of Women, Infants and Children",https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/12/13/congress-must-act-fully-fund-wic-2024-or-risk-nutrition-security,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13, 2023 – The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provided vital nutrition assistance to nearly 6.7 million pregnant women, new mothers, babies, and young children across the country in September of this year (see table). For the past 25 years, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has committed to fully funding WIC to serve every eligible pregnant woman, infant, mother, and child who applies. But this year, despite repeated Administration requests, Congress has yet to fully fund this vital program. Without the necessary additional funding, millions of eligible pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children are at risk of missing out on WIC’s critical nutrition assistance at some point next year.

WIC costs are higher this year than last year, in part because more eligible people are signing up for the program – meaning more pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children are getting access to nutritious food and important health resources they need to thrive. However, in the two Continuing Resolutions enacted so far this year, Congress did not provide the additional $1 billion in estimated funding needed to ensure WIC can serve all those who seek its services in fiscal year 2024.

It is critical that Congress provide additional funding for WIC in the January appropriation. The longer Congress puts off fully funding WIC, the greater the risk to mothers, babies, and children seeking nutrition and health support from the program. Through the two recent Continuing Resolutions, Congress has indicated that the U.S. Department of Agriculture and states should spend current funding at a faster rate in order to serve everyone who is eligible for the first half of the fiscal year (or through March 2024), but they haven’t provided the funds to cover the program once those resources run out. That means that if Congress does not address the needed funding when they ultimately pass a full-year appropriation, the impact of cuts would be magnified because USDA will have to absorb all of them in the final months of the fiscal year.

To illustrate the scale of the funding shortfall at this point in the year: If Congress were to fund the program at the current, lower Continuing Resolution level for the remaining months of the fiscal year, the $1 billion shortfall that will occur is equivalent to 1.5 months of benefits for all program beneficiaries. The $1 billion shortfall also equals the estimated cost of providing six months of benefits to all pregnant women and infants participating in WIC.

A federal funding shortfall of this magnitude presents states with difficult, untenable decisions about how to manage the program. Many states would likely implement waiting lists for applicants to reduce costs. Under program rules, waiting lists would be implemented first for non-breastfeeding postpartum women, next for children ages 1 to 5 years old who do not have higher-risk medical issues, and then for pregnant and breastfeeding women and infants who do not have higher-risk medical issues. But given the size of the funding shortfall, it is likely that waiting lists would stretch across all participant categories, affecting both new applicants and mothers, babies, and young children enrolled in the program who are up for renewal of benefits.

To provide a sense of the number of people whose benefits could be at risk if states turned to waiting lists, even for short periods, USDA estimates that 810,000 eligible people apply for WIC services in a given month nationwide, which includes those new to the program and those whose WIC benefits are up for renewal. Many states would likely have to utilize waiting lists for an extended period to address the funding gap that would result if Congress funded WIC at the Continuing Resolution level for the rest of the year.

Estimated Number of Applicants WIC Clinics Process Monthly in FY 2024

Infants 170,000 Children 370,000 Pregnant 110,000 Breastfeeding 80,000 Postpartum 70,000 Total 810,000

Indeed, it is possible that even waitlisting applicants and taking other cost-cutting measures like reducing clinic hours would not be enough to close the shortfall. In that case, some states might be forced to discontinue or suspend benefits for current participants – which is allowed by program rules as a last resort.

Cutting off access to WIC for pregnant women, new mothers, and infants and children would have severe and harmful consequences. An abundance of research shows the critical role that WIC plays in supporting maternal health and child development. WIC participation during pregnancy is associated with lower risk of preterm birth, lower risk of low birthweight, and lower risk of infant mortality. Children on WIC are also more likely to consume a healthier diet, and this impact grows the longer a child stays on WIC.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service recently found that household food insecurity increased last year, at a time when significant safety net enhancements that helped people through the worst of the pandemic began to end, and the enhanced Child Tax Credit enacted in the American Rescue Plan expired. More than half of food insecure families reported gaining assistance through federal nutrition programs like WIC to make ends meet—an indication of how important the programs are in helping to support families, and what’s at risk if Congress cuts or underfunds them.

Nearly 40 percent of America’s infants participate in WIC, which is available only to pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children who meet income guidelines and are determined to be at nutritional risk by a health professional. Families with young children, particularly infants, can struggle to make ends meet. The Biden-Harris Administration understands this and is committed to giving America’s children the healthiest start at a good life. Curbing access to nutrition security programs like WIC is counter to this effort and instead punishes parents and children.

Seeks to retain qualified, experienced workers in the federal services workforce

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the final rule to implement the requirements of Executive Order 14055, “Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts,” which seeks to prevent the displacement of skilled and experienced workers in the federal services workforce.

The final rule will provide economic benefits and enhanced efficiency in covered federal service contracts by promoting the retention of experienced workers. Retaining these workers reduces disruption in service delivery when contracts are transferred, maintains physical and information security, and provides the federal government with an experienced, well-trained workforce familiar with government personnel, facilities and requirements. The final rule will cover service contracts such as those used to employ security, janitorial, cafeteria and grounds maintenance services.

“The final rule safeguards the rights and benefits afforded to federal service contract workers and provides peace of mind and a measure of economic security to these workers and their families,”explained Wage and Hour Division Administrator Jessica Looman. “The new regulations also benefit taxpayers and contractors by ensuring continuity of services and reducing costly employee turnover.”

EO 14055 requires that contractors and subcontractors that work on covered federal service contracts, which include most contracts valued at or above $250,000 covered by the Service Contract Act, must in good faith offer service employees employed under the predecessor contract a right of first refusal of employment on the successor contract, helping prevent the displacement of skilled and experienced workers in the federal services workforce.

The final rule reflects consideration of public comments submitted in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on July 15, 2022.

Specifically, the final rule does the following:

Establishes standards and procedures for implementing and enforcing Executive Order 14055.

Specifies contracting agency and contractor obligations under the order.

Creates an investigation process familiar to federal contractors to protect workers from displacement.

Specifies how the order applies to subcontracts.

Identifies sanctions and remedies that may be imposed by the department under the order.

Executive Order 14055 builds upon Executive Order 13495, signed by President Obama, that established a non-displacement requirement for federal service contractors. The order was rescinded in 2019.

The final rule announced today will increase job security and improve the well-being of employees on federal service contracts and take effect on Feb. 12, 2024. It will apply to solicitations issued on or after the effective date of the final regulations issued by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council.

22,Court orders Haslett healthcare facility owner who allegedly threatened to fire employees for cooperating with investigation to attend anti-retaliation training,https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20231213,"Court orders Haslett healthcare facility owner who allegedly threatened to fire employees for cooperating with investigation to attend anti-retaliation training

Safe Haven Assisted Living of Haslett must also pay $16K in back wages, damages

GRAND RAPIDS, MI – A federal court in Michigan has ordered the owner of a Haslett assisted living facility,

who allegedly threatened to fire three employees after she suspected they cooperated with a U.S. Department of Labor investigation, to attend training on federal anti-retaliation regulations and pay back wages and damages.

On Dec. 11, 2023, District Judge Jane M. Beckering of the Western District of Michigan, Southern Division in Grand Rapids, issued the consent judgment and order requiring Safe Haven Assisting Living of Haslett LLC and owner Tamesha Porter to pay $16,500 in back wages and liquidated damages to the three affected former employees.

The action follows a February 2023 lawsuit filed by the department in relation to its Wage and Hour Division’s findings that, after the division reviewed 18 months of Safe Haven’s pay practices, Porter regularly threatened termination and tried to identify employees she believed had cooperated with investigators. After one of the employees resigned, Porter contacted their prospective employer and made claims of the employee’s misconduct at Safe Haven.

“This case’s resolution restores back wages earned and compensates three workers harassed by Tamesha Porter for exercising their rights to cooperate with federal investigators, a clear violation of the workers’ protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act,” explained Wage and Hour Division District Director Mary O’Rourke in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The order also requires Safe Haven Assisted Living to display a fact sheet about the Fair Labor Standards Act’s anti-retaliation provisions and to distribute it to current and future employees. The facility must also provide neutral job references for the former employees.

“Tamesha Porter and Safe Haven Assisting Living of Haslett LLC have been held accountable for trying to threaten and intimidate employees during a U.S. Department of Labor investigation,” said Regional Solicitor of Labor Christine Heri in Chicago. “We will take all necessary actions to protect the legal rights of workers to their full pay and against retaliatory action.”

The division’s review of Safe Haven’s payroll records from Aug. 16, 2020, through Dec. 12, 2021, found the company and Porter failed to pay the affected workers for breaks not taken because of work demands. By doing so, the employer violated the FLSA’s overtime provisions.

An earlier, Jan. 17, 2023, consent judgment issued by the federal court in Grand Rapids required Porter and Safe Haven Assisting Living of Haslett LLC to pay $15,238 in back wages and damages to six of the facility’s workers. Porter has made the payments.

The Fair Labor Standards Act’s anti-retaliation clause forbids any person from terminating or in any other manner discriminating against any employee because of such employee’s protected activities, including filing a complaint or cooperating with a Wage and Hour Division investigation.

This follows the release of the HTI-1 proposed rule in April 2023. The HTI-1 final rule advances patient access, interoperability, and standards, including the following:
Algorithm Transparency: Establishes first of its kind transparency requirements for the artificial intelligence (AI) and other predictive algorithms that are part of certified health IT. ONC-certified health IT supports the care delivered by more than 96% of hospitals and 78% of office-based physicians around the country. HHS’ leading-edge regulatory approach will promote responsible AI and make it possible for clinical users to access a consistent, baseline set of information about the algorithms they use to support their decision making and to assess such algorithms for fairness, appropriateness, validity, effectiveness, and safety.
USCDI Version 3: Adopts the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 3 (v3) as the new baseline standard within the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Certification Program) as of January 1, 2026. Developers of certified health IT will also have the ability to move to USCDI v3 sooner. USCDI v3 includes updates to prior USCDI versions focused on advancing more accurate and complete patient characteristics data that could help promote equity, reduce disparities, and support public health data interoperability.
Enhanced Information Blocking Requirements: Revises certain information blocking definitions and exceptions to support information sharing, and adds a new exception to encourage secure, efficient, standards-based exchange of electronic health information under the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common AgreementSM (TEFCASM).
New Interoperability-Focused Reporting Metrics for Certified Health IT: Implements the 21st Century Cures Act’s requirement to adopt a Condition of Certification (the “Insights Condition”) for developers of certified health IT to report certain metrics as part of their participation in the Certification Program. These metrics will give more insight into how certified health IT is used in support of care delivery.
“The public feedback and participation in the HTI-1 process was tremendous,” said Micky Tripathi, Ph.D., national coordinator for health information technology. “Through the HTI-1 final rule, our upcoming HTI-2 proposed rule, and our broader efforts, ONC continues its important work to build health care’s digital foundation, make interoperability easier, and ensure that digital information and tools are being appropriately used to support patient access and to improve the health and well-being of all Americans.”
The HTI-1 final rule is posted at HealthIT.gov/HTI-1 and will be submitted to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) in the coming days. For more information, resources, and educational events on ONCs regulatory programs, please visit HealthIT.gov."

Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is providing an update on its efforts to create a unified Human Foods Program (HFP) and new Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) model, including additional details about the proposed structure, status of activities and timeline for next steps. These proposed changes will strengthen the agency’s ability to oversee and protect the human food supply and other products it regulates.

The FDA’s proposed reorganization package is now under review at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which begins the formal external review process. After more than a year of work following the findings and recommendations of a Reagan-Udall Foundation evaluation and other feedback, this is a significant step in the process. Following several remaining critical steps, the agency is hopeful implementation will occur sometime in calendar year 2024.

“Moving our proposal forward is an exciting milestone in our ongoing modernization initiative,” said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D. “This is a unique moment in the history of the FDA. We began this journey knowing we had a real opportunity in front of us to make meaningful and lasting change. By working to build a unified Human Foods Program and a more resilient model for our field operations, we also found ways to improve the way we work together as a whole—inside and outside the agency—to better meet our public health mission.”

In addition to previous announcements, the FDA’s proposed reorganization package includes the following new updates that not only shifts how the agency’s foods and field work is conducted, but also impacts a number of additional FDA offices outside of these programs. The proposed changes highlight the agency-wide nature of the proposed reorganization package, including:

Making the FDA’s HFP and product Centers solely responsible for receipt, triage and closing consumer and whistleblower complaints, rather than this role being split between Centers and field Offices. This will refine the processing of complaints, ultimately improving our ability to detect problems faster.

Renaming ORA as the Office of Inspections and Investigations (OII) and solidifying its role as the frontline of the FDA’s field-based inspection, investigation and import operations.

Establishing an Office of the Chief Medical Officer (OCMO) in the Office of the Commissioner to strengthen central coordination of cross-agency medical issues, including special populations such as people with rare diseases and children. This includes a new Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response to support medical countermeasure policy, emergency preparedness work and medical product shortage coordination across the agency.

Merging the Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and the Office of Regulatory Science and Innovation (ORSI) to form a new office; both offices are currently housed within the FDA’s Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). This new merged office in OCS, proposed as the Office of Regulatory and Emerging Science, will strengthen support of regulatory science and preparedness research efforts.

Creating an Office of Enterprise Transformation. This proposed new office in the Office of the Commissioner will work across the FDA to drive high-priority cross-cutting business process improvement efforts. The proposed shift will result in more strategic and efficient use of agency resources.

In addition to HHS’ review, there are several critical steps remaining before the agency can implement the proposed reorganization. These steps include review by the Office of Management and Budget, providing Congress with a 30-day notification period, issuing a Federal Register notice and engaging in all necessary negotiations with Unions representing impacted staff.

The FDA’s reorganization proposal has closely tracked with the agency’s efforts to enhance its infant formula response processes following the Abbott infant formula recall in February 2022. Last year, the agency conducted an Internal Evaluation of the FDA’s Infant Formula Response to identify areas for improvement. The FDA is now releasing a progress update on the important actions the agency has taken to address these recommendations as part of the proposed HFP and ORA new model. Although work is ongoing, there has been significant progress. For example, the FDA has:

Reevaluated the agency’s infant formula staffing needs and provided substantive input for the development of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, which authorized the creation of an Office of Critical Foods (OCF) (including infant formula products). The FDA has now begun to announce, interview, and staff many positions related to the OCF as well as other positions, which will help to support infant formula oversight and regulation. This has included the hiring of a Chief Critical Foods Officer, a Senior Advisor for Critical Foods Enforcement and Compliance, and a Senior Regulatory Counsel for Critical Foods.

Began establishing a critical foods investigator cadre, which will solely focus on the inspection and oversight of the infant formula (and other critical foods) industry. Hiring for the cadre is currently underway, and specialized training programs are continuously being developed, piloted and deployed as a part of that effort.

The FDA remains committed to keeping the public up to date as the proposal continues to be developed.

Washington, DC -- Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced $817 million from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 385 Safe Streets and Roads for All (SS4A) grants. The SS4A program grants go directly to regional, local, and Tribal communities for implementation, planning, and demonstration projects driven at the local level to improve safety and help prevent deaths and serious injuries on the nation’s roadways. The funding helps communities address roadway safety through a comprehensive approach that uses all types of interventions, which aligns with DOT’s National Roadway Safety Strategy. These funds will help tackle the preventable crisis of deaths on the nation’s roads through safer people, roads, and vehicles, appropriate vehicle speeds, and improved post-crash care. This first-of-its-kind program was created by the President’s infrastructure law and is a part of the more than $14 billion in the law dedicated to roadway safety.

This announcement includes 48 implementation grants focused on safety projects and strategies, and 337 grants for planning and demonstration activities.

Through three announcements in 2023, including this one, SS4A grants have provided $1.7 billion in direct funding to over 1,000 local communities. Combined these will improve roadway safety planning for around 70% of the nation’s population.

""Through the Safe Streets and Roads for All program, we have now announced safety funding going directly to communities representing seventy percent of the people living in this country,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “We are acting to confront the crisis of safety on our nation’s roads, helping communities work to reduce traffic deaths to the only acceptable number: zero.”

“USDOT is excited to support communities all across the country as they design and deliver safer roadways,"" said U.S. Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg. ""USDOT is committed to making our nation’s roadways safer and more livable for all who drive, walk, bike, and roll.""

These funds will help communities in the development of road safety action plans and improve unsafe roadway corridors by implementing effective interventions. Additionally, these funds can be utilized to test out safety features such as separated bicycle lanes or curb extensions at intersections.

A few of the communities and projects being funded by the awards announced today include:

The City of Detroit, Michigan was awarded $24,800,000 to improve safety and bus stop accessibility at 56 high-crash intersections served by the Detroit Department of Transportation bus service.

Webster County, Iowa was awarded $8,456,908 in funding to improve the safety of 32.5 miles of rural county roads that have been identified as high-risk locations for crashes and fatalities.

The City of Billings, Montana received $3,557,923 in funding to implement safety countermeasures at 11 intersections and 6 corridors, including high-visibility crosswalks, improved lighting and signing, sidewalks and shared-use paths and more, in support of a Safe Routes to School initiative.

The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County, which covers the Reno, Nevada, Metropolitan Area, was awarded $8,963,112 in funds to implement multiple improvements along East Sixth Street, including a road diet and the addition of bicycle lanes.

The City of El Paso, Texas, received $9,900,065 in funding to transform the North Yarbrough Drive corridor to improve intersection safety, launch a Safe Routes to School program, and expand its education and encouragement efforts.

The Metropolitan Government of Nashville-Davidson County was awarded $13,049,572 in funding to implement improvements along Nolensville Pike, a major State route that connects downtown Nashville to residential neighborhoods in Davidson County.

Thirteen of the 48 Implementation Grant award recipients are a part of the Thriving Communities Network, showing the Department’s commitment to supporting places to successfully apply for Federal funding through technical assistance and better coordination across federal agencies.

View the list of SS4A awards.

The funding for surface transportation initiatives that improve road safety has more than doubled thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The $9 billion in funding states have received via the Highway Safety Improvement Program and the $570 million in funding that will enhance safety at over 400 rail crossings nationwide are just two of the latest in a suite of roadway safety investments. Applications for the next round of SS4A are anticipated to open in February of 2024. Federally recognized Tribal governments that apply can use Tribal Transportation Funds for non-Federal match when applying for SS4A.

26,U.S. Department of Transportation Announces New Rural Autonomous Vehicle Research Program,https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-announces-new-rural-autonomous-vehicle-research-program,"Wednesday, December 13, 2023

The first-of-its-kind Rural Autonomous Vehicle (RAV) Research Program will lay a foundation for bringing the potential benefits of automated vehicles to rural and Tribal communities across the U.S.

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT or the Department) announced a $25 million funding opportunity for its Rural Autonomous Vehicle research program. Accredited universities are eligible to apply for this competitive, six-year cooperative agreement program.

Recipients will use RAV program funding to conduct research regarding the benefits and responsible application of automated vehicles and associated mobility technologies in rural and Tribal communities. One $15 million award will focus on passenger transportation, and a separate $10 million award will focus on movement of freight to support and enable automated freight and delivery vehicles serving rural areas.

“Automated vehicles have the potential to enhance roadway safety and increase mobility options for all Americans, including older Americans, low-income households, people with disabilities, and those who cannot or choose not to drive,” said Dr. Robert C. Hampshire, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology and Chief Scientist. ""Disparities in mobility and economic development opportunities in rural and Tribal communities leave many in those underserved communities unable to get to where they need to go to meet the needs of their daily life regularly, reliably, and safely; or to get necessary goods delivered. This research will move the needle forward,” Hampshire said.

Nineteen percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, and almost a quarter of all Americans aged 65 and older reside in rural communities. Yet, 47% of all roadway fatalities and 34% of all public highway-rail grade crossing fatalities occur on rural roads. Emergency response times are more than twice as long in rural areas as compared to urban areas.

The RAV program funds collaborative research and pilot deployment activities to support a future rural transportation system that is safe, advances American competitiveness, and supports good-paying jobs. The Department will empower workers and expand access to skills, training, and the choice of a union. They will have a seat at the table in shaping innovation. This funding opportunity devoted to rural and Tribal applications of automated vehicle technologies will help the Department advance mobility and safety solutions for the entire transportation sector, in a manner that serves U.S. DOT’s policy priorities as outlined in the Department’s Innovation Principles. In particular, the RAV program will allow for meaningful experimentation, and provide opportunities for collaboration, while encouraging better outcomes.

Wednesday, December 13, 2023

WASHINGTON – Today, the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS) announced the release of an independent survey of public and private infrastructure investments to enhance marine shipping on the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway System. These investments sustain 241,286 U.S. and Canadian jobs and help contribute to the safe, efficient, and sustainable movement of the135.7 million metric tons of cargo that moves along the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway. The survey conservatively estimates that $8.4 billion has been or is committed to be spent on Great Lakes/Seaway infrastructure investments between 2018-2027.

Prepared by Martin Associates of Lancaster, Pa., and titled, “Infrastructure Investment Survey of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway System,” the survey quantifies recent and ongoing investments in the navigation system that help support long-term planning and the achievement of economic development goals, while also building confidence in the Great Lakes Seaway System’s future viability.

“The survey’s conclusion is clear: both the public and private sector recognize that maritime commerce on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway remain essential to the economies of the United States and Canada, and are investing to protect this irreplaceable system,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “Through President Biden’s infrastructure law, we are investing in marine shipping, which will continue to support high quality jobs, strengthen America’s supply chains, and drive sustainable economic growth.”

“The Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway System and its countless ports, terminals, ship owners, and cargo owners support the most sustainable and cost-effective way to haul goods to and from North America,” said Adam Tindall-Schlicht, GLS Administrator. “The importance of this vital conduit for North American trade is clear, and this survey shows that governments and the maritime industry are jointly focused on supporting marine shipping’s environmental and technological leadership through significant ongoing investment. Simultaneously catalyzing this robust trade corridor is the goal.”

The survey, which reported $8.4 billion in infrastructure investments between 2018-2027, identifies specific categories of investment including:

$636 million invested in vessel enhancements between 2018 and 2022 for new ships and vessel upgrades, with at least another $328 million planned between 2023 and 2027.



$2.1 billion invested to enhance port and terminal infrastructure between 2018 and 2022, with at least another $1.1 billion planned between 2023 and 2027.



$3 billion invested in waterway infrastructure, including locks, breakwaters, and navigation channels, between 2018-2022, with at least another $1.2 billion planned between 2023 and 2027.

These results reflect a conservative measure of future investments in the navigation system, as we expect more investments to be made between now and 2027. Also, this survey does not seek to quantify expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs.

The survey is part of a larger project undertaken by a public/private sector committee of American and Canadian maritime organizations, including the GLS and the Canadian St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation. That project produced a study titled, “Economic Impacts of Maritime Shipping in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Region,” released in July. That study found that maritime commerce on the Great Lakes Seaway System annually sustains 241,000 U.S. and Canadian jobs, $36 billion in economic activity, $18 billion in personal income, and $6 billion in federal, state/provincial, and local taxes each year.

In addition to the billions invested by private marine shipping organizations in research and development, new infrastructure, and new service offerings, the survey captures major governmental funding initiatives aimed at enhancing infrastructure and improving supply chains. This public investment is led by the Biden Administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, which are aimed, in part, at investing in green technologies and transportation infrastructure enhancements.

28,VA offers rural Veterans options to connect with providers,https://news.va.gov/126698/va-rural-veterans-options-connect-providers/,"There are more than 4 million Veterans in the United States who live in rural areas. Rural communities face unique health care challenges, such as fewer local health care options and longer travel times to visit medical centers.

VA is working to expand access to care in rural communities through telehealth and other virtual means. VA telehealth is a convenient care option that allows Veterans to connect with their VA providers from anywhere.

If you or a Veteran you know would benefit from VA virtual care, keep reading to learn about some options to consider.

Need internet access? Request a Digital Divide Consult

According to the Office of Rural Health, 20% of Veterans in rural areas do not access the internet at home. VA is working to close this “digital divide,” the gap between people who do and do not have access to the internet and internet-connected devices, such as smartphones, tablets and computers.

Social workers assist Veterans with technology options

For Veterans who want to use VA telehealth but don’t have internet service or an internet-connected device, their VA care team can refer them to a social worker who will assist the Veteran with their internet and technology options. This Digital Divide Consult is a process that connects Veterans who don’t have internet access or a video-capable device with programs and resources that may be able to provide the internet service or technology needed for video visits. More than 140,000 Veterans across the country have gone through the consultation process to date.

Once a Veteran can get online, they can have video telehealth appointments from home. This reduces the time and expense of traveling to a VA facility—an important benefit for Veterans in rural parts of the country.

If you’re interested in a Digital Divide Consult, talk with your VA provider.

Learn About Clinical Resource Hubs

All 18 of VA’s Veterans Integrated Service Networks have Clinical Resource Hubs that offer a combination of in-person care and telehealth services. When local VA facilities have gaps in service capabilities, Clinical Resource Hubs can offer Veterans a full range of VA services.

Use VA Video Connect with fewer worries about cellular data fees

Through VA Video Connect, VA’s videoconferencing app, Veterans can have secure video visits with their VA care team using an internet-capable device.

AT&T, SafeLink by TracFone, T-Mobile and Verizon help Veteran subscribers avoid data charges when using VA Video Connect on their networks. This enables Veterans to connect with their VA care team with fewer worries about data fees. For more information, visit the mobile carrier programs webpage.

Find an ATLAS location near you

If a Veteran doesn’t have in-home internet access or doesn’t wish to have video appointments from home, they can see if there is an ATLAS (Accessing Telehealth through Local Area Stations) site in their area. ATLAS sites offer Veterans comfortable private spaces equipped with internet access and the technology needed to meet with VA providers through VA Video Connect.

Sites must be associated with the VA medical center where the Veteran is enrolled in care. ATLAS sites are located in select American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts, Walmart stores and more.

Check out My HealtheVet and VA apps

Veterans can use My HealtheVet, VA’s online patient portal, to manage their care from home. They can use it to request their VA prescription refills, review their VA medical records, manage their VA appointments and connect with their VA providers directly through Secure Messaging.

Veterans can also take charge of their health with the tools on the VA App Store. VA apps are designed to help Veterans with sleep issues, weight management, tobacco cessation, the effects of military sexual trauma, anger management and much more.

VA provides a variety of ways for Veterans to access high-quality care remotely. If you or a Veteran you know would benefit from virtual care options, contact your VA care team or visit the Office of Connected Care website."
29,Central Iowa Veterans build confidence through climbing,https://news.va.gov/126558/iowa-veterans-build-confidence-through-climbing/,"The effort that Veterans put in at the therapeutic rock climbing session sponsored by VA Central Iowa hospital is reflective of the journey many of them have taken over their military careers.

Every month, Klay Queck, recreational therapist at Central Iowa VA, leads a group of Veterans of varying abilities to an indoor climbing venue to help them with their recovery.

“We do this to help keep these Veterans active,” he said. “Climbing is a great, safe exercise that gives these Veterans a real feeling of accomplishment and confidence.”

Rock climbing participants Crystal McManus, Megan McDowell, Klay Queck and Brian Kampling

Queck began this inspirational program two years ago, after feedback from Veterans that they wanted more active therapy options.

And it is active. A normal night climbing the 37-foot wall means a couple hours of tying ropes, tightening shoes and donning harnesses, all leading to intense exercise that gives the Veterans an invigorating workout and allows them to work together in a collegial atmosphere.

Since implementing the program, Queck says rock climbing has been a huge success with dozens of Veterans taking part. Veterans respond to the therapy with a renewed interest and energy.

“You can stay active and meet other Veterans.”

Crystal McManus, who served in the Army National Guard and Reserve for 29 years, got involved because she thought this would be a great way to stay active along with her other interests. She also sees social benefits. “I like kayaking and biking and staying active. And it’s safe because we are on a belay. You can stay active and meet other Veterans,” she shared.

The belay is a safety system that allows climbers to be secured to a rope while they climb. Queck is so committed to the program that he earned his belay certification so he can directly lead more activities for the group.

McManus added that rock climbing is physically tiring and mentally invigorating. “From the first time I did it as a beginner, it has improved my upper body strength and also built my confidence each time I did it. When I first heard about this, I thought it sounded fun. You can be all levels of experience from skilled to beginner. I think everyone should try it.”

The monthly climbing outings usually include six to eight Veterans who enjoy the camaraderie with Veterans who understand what they have been through.

“To help these Veterans on their health journey, we offer a wide variety of therapeutic activities,” said Central Iowa VA director Lisa Curnes. “We work to provide the health care and activities Veterans deserve and have earned.”

This program is one of several recreational activities Central Iowa VA supports to help Veterans on their journey from military to civilian health. Other programs include therapeutic and mindfulness activities, such as yoga and creative writing. They also offer more active outings, like pickleball, kayaking and Tai Chi."
30,More than 3 million volunteers to take part in National Wreaths Across America Day,https://news.va.gov/127029/3-million-national-wreaths-across-america-day/,"National Wreaths Across America Day is on Saturday, Dec. 16, and will take place at more than 4,200 participating locations across the country. This number of locations, which includes Arlington National Cemetery, is more than 500 above last year’s total.

Wreaths Across America anticipates that more than 3 million volunteers—a third of whom are children—will participate in National Wreaths Across America Day. The event provides a wonderful opportunity for communities to gather during the busiest time of year to pause and say thank you to all who have served and sacrificed for our freedom. With each balsam wreath placed, the volunteer will also say that service member’s name out loud and keep his or her memory alive.

National Wreaths Across America Day is a meaningful event that takes place each December across the country. Wreaths Across America’s mission is to remember the fallen, honor those who serve and teach the next generation the value of freedom. It’s a year-long mission that bring together communities and families all over the country.

Wreaths Across America is successful year after year thanks to the help of millions of volunteers and sponsors. Every sponsorship received not only honors an American hero with the placement of a fresh balsam Veteran’s wreath in December, but it also supports the year-round program. Some of Wreaths Across America’s new and existing free programs include:

The TEACH Program, with downloadable lesson plans and service-based learning for youth of all ages.

The Mobile Education Exhibit is a museum on wheels that travels the country sharing the mission and creating free events for the community, while serving as a “Welcome Home” unit for Vietnam War Veterans.

The National Museum and Gold Star Family History & Hospitality House are located at the National Wreaths Across America Headquarters in Columbia Falls, Maine. These exhibits offer guests an opportunity to learn more about the mission while experiencing the many stories of service, sacrifice and success shared with the program over the last 15 years.

Our Veteran outreach efforts include partnerships with Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) working to support living Veterans and their families nationwide. We offer resources and access to support and host open discussions about important topics impacting this community via our owned channels, including Wreaths Across America Radio, a voice for America’s Veterans. This commercial-free station shares stories of those who served (and their families), while highlighting the many like-minded programs supporting this demographic around the country.

The Remembrance Tree Program is a free program that allows people to create a replica dog tag for a loved one who served; it also allows them to select a tree to hang that tag on the balsam tip lands in Columbia Falls, Maine, where Wreaths Across America is headquartered. Every three years, the tree will be “tipped” to collect the balsam used to make Veterans’ wreaths for placement on National Wreaths Across America Day.

Additionally, there are more than 6,000 local sponsorship groups supporting the mission across the country. These groups represent local charities, VSOs and programs giving back to the local community throughout the year. Since 2007, Wreaths Across America’s $5 pay-back group sponsorship program has resulted in more than $22 million in contributions being made to organizations, enabling them to provide care for our active duty service members, Veterans and their families.

There are many ways you can help support the Wreaths Across America mission. To sponsor a wreath, find a sponsorship group or location to support in your community, or find details for volunteers wanting to participate at an event, please visit www.wreathsacrossamerica.org."

If a noncitizen arrives and has no legal basis to remain in the United States they will be processed and removed quickly, consistent with U.S. law.

In keeping with standard practice, the United States ensures that all noncitizens without a legal basis to remain in the United States are properly screened for valid protection claims and withholding of removal in accordance with our laws and U.S. international obligations. This applies to all noncitizens, regardless of nationality, to ensure the orderly and humane processing, transfer, and removal of single adults and family units. During each of the past two weeks, we have conducted over thirty repatriation flights transporting thousands of individuals back to their country of origin and have repatriated over five thousand individuals directly to Mexico.

Noncitizens placed into removal proceedings present their claims for relief or protection from removal before immigration judges in the immigration courts, which are administered by the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. Due to operational security reasons, ICE does not confirm or discuss future or pending transportation operations.

ICE Air Operations facilitates the transfer and removal of noncitizens, including family units, via commercial airlines and chartered flights in support of ICE field offices and other DHS initiatives. In fiscal year 2022, ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations conducted 72,177 removals to more than 150 countries worldwide.

B-roll for removal flights is available on DVIDS. DHS has made additional videos available to the public and the media including b-roll footage of removal flights, a public service announcement, and testimonials from migrants who have been removed."

Individuals and business owners who sustained losses in the designated areas can begin applying for assistance by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov, by calling 1-800-621-3362 or by using the FEMA App. If you use a relay service, such as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, give FEMA the number for that service."
33,FEMA Awards Floyd County More than $1.6 Million for Property Acquisitions,https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20231213/fema-awards-floyd-county-more-16-million-property-acquisitions,"Frankfort, Ky. – FEMA has approved two projects totaling $1,675,804 in federal funding to Floyd County for the acquisition of properties affected by the July 2022 floods in Eastern Kentucky.

Thirteen flood prone properties that were directly affected by the July 2022 flooding event will be acquired by the Floyd County Fiscal Court, demolished and turned to green space. Funds will be used to acquire these properties at fair market value pre-event, demolish the homes and remove all debris. Once demolished properties will be deed-restricted and any future open space proposals will be subject to pre-approval by FEMA.

The first project, for the acquisition of thirteen properties, totals $2,094,754. The federal share of 75% ($1,571,062) will be contributed by FEMA and the remaining non-federal share of 25% will be contributed by a combination of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, local governments and homeowners.

The second project provides funds totaling $104,738 for Floyd County to manage the acquisitions program. This award is pursuant to Section 1215 of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, which amended Section 324 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Assistance Act, allowing Subrecipient Management Costs (SRMC) up to 5% of the total project cost, available to the subrecipient at a federal cost share of 100%.

As a condition of these grants, the relevant, commonwealth, tribal, territorial or local government must maintain the property as open space in perpetuity.

These projects will protect the community from the direct impact of severe storm events and provide a long-term solution to existing and future hazardous conditions. These acquisition and demolition projects will protect against future flooding events. Activities will be completed in strict compliance with federal, commonwealth and local rules and regulations.

The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) is managed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the projects are administered by the local community. FEMA does not acquire properties directly from the property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate in the property acquisition process the pre-flood fair market value of the property. A licensed appraiser determines the fair market value. This program is voluntary, and homeowners can withdraw from the program if they are no longer interested.

HMGP provides funding to state, local, tribal and territorial governments so they can develop hazard mitigation plans and rebuild in a way that reduces, or mitigates, future disaster losses in their communities. When requested by an authorized representative, this grant funding is available after a presidentially declared disaster.

Until recently, Lakeshore Railcar was an industrial user of the publicly owned wastewater treatment plant in East Chicago. As an industrial user, the company was required to pretreat its wastewater to reduce pollutants—including cyanide—below certain limits prior to discharging the wastewater to the public sewer system. Between April 2017 and May 2023, Lakeshore violated the discharge limit for cyanide 31 times. Lakeshore Railcar also failed to follow EPA-approved methods for measuring the amount of cyanide in its wastewater discharge. Lakeshore Railcar’s violations posed a potential risk to the Grand Calumet River, as well as Lake Michigan seven miles downstream.Prior to signing the settlement, Lakeshore Railcar stopped generating and discharging industrial wastewater to the East Chicago plant and dismantled its wastewater pretreatment operation.

37,California Labor Commissioner Collects Over $1.1 Million in Wages and Penalties for 74 Workers on a Public Works Project,https://www.dir.ca.gov/DIRNews/2023/2023-91.html,"NEWS RELEASE Release Number: 2023-91 Date: December 13, 2023

California Labor Commissioner Collects Over $1.1 Million in Wages and Penalties for 74 Workers on a Public Works Project

San Bernardino—The Labor Commissioner’s Office collected $1.1 million in wages and penalties resulting from a prevailing wage assessment against general contractor Stronghold Engineering and its subcontractor, Perry Coast Construction, both based in Riverside. The wages collected will compensate 74 workers for underpayment of prevailing wages owed for their time working at the Monterey Conference Center, as well as nearby Portola Plaza in Monterey.

California Public Works laws were enacted to protect and benefit workers and the public. The laws guarantee minimum wages on publicly funded projects and provide opportunities for employment to apprentices.

“The law requires that workers on construction projects financed with $1,000 or more in public funds must be paid no less than the prevailing wage,” said Labor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower. “These workers were cheated out of their hard-earned wages, and contacted my office to hold Stronghold Engineering and Perry Coast Construction accountable for their actions.”

The Labor Commissioner’s Office opened its investigation in May 2017 after a complaint of public works violation was filed by a worker claiming underpayment of prevailing wages, as well as unpaid overtime and holiday rates, fringe benefits, and travel expenses.

The investigation also found that Perry Coast Construction failed to comply with apprenticeship standards or with public works contractor registration requirements.

The Labor Commissioner’s Office cited Stronghold Engineering and Perry Coast Construction in October 2020 for underpayment of prevailing wages to 74 workers, liquidated damages and interest on the wages, and training funds. Both the contractor and subcontractor filed a joint request for review in December 2020, but eventually agreed to resolve all claims with the Labor Commissioner’s Office for $1.1 million to be paid to the affected workers, and withdrawing their joint request for review in July 2023.

California Invests $17 Million to Expand Apprenticeships to New Industries

Sacramento—The California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) and its Division of Apprenticeship Standards (DAS) have announced award recipients of $17 million for Apprenticeship Innovation Funding (AIF). This announcement was made through an AIF Awardee announcement video, along with the list of award recipients.

AIF aims to expand and sustain apprenticeship programs in new sectors, such as healthcare, advanced manufacturing, technology, education, and more. The money awarded will help both new and existing apprenticeship programs grow and scale to meet the needs of more employers and create more earn and learn pathways for job seekers.

“This funding allows California to support new programs that are pioneering apprenticeship in their industry. It’s about investing in our most valuable resource – the people of California,” said DIR Director Katie Hagen.

“This is more than funding; it is a catalyst for creating a more equitable and accessible onramp into a career, and a better prepared workforce to fuel a thriving California economy,” said DAS Deputy Chief Adele Burnes.

AIF is one part of the State’s recent historic investments in apprenticeship and other earn and learn pathways. Other new funding includes a youth apprenticeship grant program, Equal Representation in Construction Apprenticeship grants, and an increase to the reimbursement rate for training in building and construction apprenticeships. These efforts are helping California achieve Governor Newsom’s goal of serving 500,000 apprentices by 2029.

For updates on AIF, subscribe to the DAS Newsletter.

The Department of Industrial Relations’ Division of Apprenticeship Standards consults with employers to develop a skilled workforce, by establishing innovative apprenticeship programs that offer training, to create viable career pathways for Californians.

Take measures to safeguard your property against potential rain damage. Secure and cover outdoor items such as lawn furniture, grills and umbrellas. Clear gutters and downspouts of debris to ensure proper drainage. Identify and fix any possible leaks or drainage issues. Also, consider installing sump pumps and other flood prevention measures like sandbags.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

Ensure your family and community have emergency preparedness plans in place. This includes creating either a Go-Bag or Stay Box with essential items such as non-perishable food, water, flashlights, batteries and a first-aid kit. Make sure your family is aware of evacuation routes and shelter locations if flooding becomes a significant concern. Establish a family communication plan in case family members are separated during an emergency. Designate a meeting point and ensure everyone has a way to stay in contact, such as cell phones or two-way radios.

DISASTER DRILLS

Know and practice emergency evacuation routes. Practice emergency drills with your family and community to ensure that everyone knows what to do in case of a flood or other disaster. Regular drills can help reduce panic and increase the efficiency of your response. As a part of your drills, make sure your vehicle(s) are maintained and are prepared with an emergency kit in the event you are informed to evacuate.

POWER

Severe weather conditions can create power outages. Sign up for local alerts with your utility company to stay informed about possible power outages and public safety power shutoffs in your area. For those who are at high risk and require power for medical needs, contact your local utility providers for the medical baseline program which offers early notifications of possible shutoffs giving residents time to adjust their emergency plans. Generators can also be helpful when the power goes out. Generators should be used properly, like using them outdoors and keeping them dry and protected from the elements.

PROTECT YOUR PETS

If you have pets, make sure to include them in your disaster preparedness plan. Have pet carriers, food, water and medications ready for their needs. Identify pet-friendly shelters in your area.

EMERGENCY CONTACTS

Compile a list of important emergency contacts, including local authorities, emergency services and utility companies. Share this information with family members and neighbors so that everyone knows who to contact in case of an emergency.

INSURANCE COVERAGE

After assessing your local risks, review your insurance coverage. Ensure that you have the correct coverage for your property’s risk. Standard homeowner’s insurance may not always include floods, fires, tsunamis or earthquakes.

DURING RAIN

As weather patterns threaten to bring increased rainfall and potential flooding to California, Cal OES wants to remind all residents and communities that it is essential to stay safe during increased rainfall. Storms can bring unpredictable and severe weather conditions, stay informed and follow the guidance of local authorities to navigate the challenges that may arise during this weather event. Staying informed can make a significant difference when it comes to dealing with storm related rains and potential flooding.

EMERGENCY ALERTS

Emergency alerts from county or local officials can notify you quickly about life-saving information. Signing up for these free alerts will notify the community about potential disasters, dangers and emergencies and what to do to stay safe. Find local emergency alerts in your community HERE.

STAY INFORMED

Stay updated with the latest weather forecasts and storm predictions provided by reliable sources such as the National Weather Service, your local news, local or state emergency services and local authorities. Monitoring these sources will help you understand the potential risks and timing of storm related rainfall in your area. Listen to local authorities when told to evacuate.

POWER OUTAGES

Severe weather conditions can create power outages. Sign up for local alerts with your utility company to stay informed about possible power outages and public safety power shutoffs in your area.

NEVER DRIVE IN FLOODED AREAS AND AVOID UNNECESSARY TRAVEL

Never attempt to drive, walk or swim through flooded areas. A mere six inches of fast-moving water can knock an adult over and 12 inches of rushing water can carry away most cars. It’s recommended that when you see flooding to turn around, don’t drown. Water may be deeper than it appears and can hide hazards like downed powerlines, trees and more.

During heavy sustained precipitation, it’s best to limit unnecessary travel. If travel becomes necessary, check for any road closures, adjust your travel route according to road conditions. This is especially important as normal travel routes may be flooded or closed due to dangerous conditions. Keeping your vehicle maintained can also lower any potential risks while traveling. To continue to lower potential risks, increase the distance between cars while driving, keep your eyes on the road at all times, slow down and look out for any standing water. Finally, just like traditional vehicles, there is risk when driving an electric vehicle during any potential storm season. Keep the electric vehicle charged and avoid any flooding or standing water.

PROTECT YOUR PETS

As heavy rainfall continues, make sure to keep your pets close and have pet carriers, food, water and medications ready for their needs in the event local authorities request evacuation. Identify pet-friendly shelters in your area."

45,State­ment on the Third Anniver­sary of Jason Landry’s Disappearance,https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/statement-third-anniversary-jason-landrys-disappearance,"Three years ago this week, a Texas college student named Jason Landry disappeared. Attorney General Paxton and the Office of the Attorney General’s Cold Case and Missing Persons Unit wish to reaffirm their unwavering commitment to this investigation and to pursuing all credible information received from the public. Mr. Landry, a student at Texas State University, was last seen on December 13, 2020. Mr. Landry’s abandoned vehicle was discovered in the early morning hours of December 14, 2020, on a rural roadway just outside of Luling, Texas.

Since receiving a request for investigative assistance from the Caldwell County District Attorney’s Office and the Caldwell County Sheriff’s Office in February 2022, the OAG’s Cold Case and Missing Persons Unit has dedicated hundreds of hours of investigative resources to the case. This includes conducting extensive forensic testing, issuing numerous search warrants, interviewing dozens of witnesses, and enlisting the assistance of experts with a wide range of specialized backgrounds from multiple government agencies and non-profit organizations.

In November 2023, the OAG Cold Case and Missing Persons Unit hosted an extensive roundtable case review of the Landry investigation alongside experts in digital forensics, geospatial sciences, data mapping, criminal intelligence, and other relevant fields from agencies including the FBI, the Texas Rangers and Department of Public Safety, Texas Search and Rescue, the Caldwell County District Attorney’s Office, and the Travis County Constable’s Office (Precinct 3). The panel thoroughly examined all parts of the case and concluded that all credible leads and investigative steps have been thoroughly pursued up to this point. The Texas OAG’s Cold Case and Missing Persons Unit considers this matter to be an ongoing and active investigation and encourages anyone with credible information about the case to contact the Unit at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/coldcasetips.

Fiscal Notes: Regular Session Wrap-Up of Texas’ 88th Legislature

(AUSTIN) — In the November/December issue of Fiscal Notes, the Texas Comptroller’s office highlights some of the most impactful pieces of legislation that came out of the Regular Session of the 88th Legislature, which adjourned May 29.

“The year began with my January projection that state revenue collections would exceed anything we’ve ever seen before,” Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar said. “The historic revenue numbers allowed lawmakers to make key investments that will be critical for our state's long-term growth. Legislators also passed much–needed and meaningful property tax relief to assist homeowners already grappling with housing affordability and price inflation.”

Fiscal Notes’ summary of the session includes budget numbers for the 2024-25 biennium and a focus on issues such as economic development, fentanyl poisoning, rural law enforcement, state family leave, broadband, water and electric grid infrastructure, and higher education.

This issue of Fiscal Notes also provides an analysis of property taxes. In 2020, Texas had the sixth highest “effective” property tax rate in the country, meaning homeowners here paid more in property taxes, on average, than did residents of most other states that year. And as local governments and school districts raise tax rates to cover increasingly expensive public services, coupled with skyrocketing home values, homeowners may receive heftier property tax bills each year. We also examine steps lawmakers took to help alleviate the property tax burden shouldered by homeowners and businesses.

Fiscal Notes furthers the Comptroller’s constitutional responsibility to monitor the state’s economy and estimate state government revenues. It has been published since 1975, featuring in-depth analysis concerning state finances and original research by subject-matter experts in the Comptroller’s office.

Fiscal Notes is available online and can be received by subscribing via the Comptroller's website."

48,Governor Hochul Announces Holiday Season “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” Enforcement Initiative,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-holiday-season-drive-sober-or-get-pulled-over-enforcement-initiative,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that the New York State Police will participate in the national enforcement initiative to crack down on impaired driving this holiday season. The New York State Police will participate in the national “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” campaign, which runs from Wednesday, December 13, 2023, through Monday, January 1, 2024.

""Impaired driving is reckless, dangerous and illegal, and we have zero tolerance for it on New York's roadways,"" Governor Hochul said. “We’re sending a clear message this holiday season that those in violation of our vehicle and traffic laws will be ticketed or face criminal charges.”

In addition to the DWI checkpoints and patrols, Troopers will be watching for distracted drivers, vehicle occupants who are not properly buckled up, and drivers violating the “Move Over Law,” which requires motorists to exercise extreme caution when passing emergency vehicles that are stopped in or on the side of the road. State Police will also conduct underage drinker enforcement details statewide.

New York State Police Acting Superintendent Dominick L. Chiumento said, ""We wish you all a wonderful Holiday season and a Happy New Year! We will be doing our part to ensure the holidays remain safe. Our members will remain vigilant upon your roadways to prevent needless tragedies that result from reckless and impaired driving. Please think twice before getting behind the wheel of a vehicle if you’ve been drinking. If you have had a drink, there are numerous options available that will provide safe passage to your destination. Together, let’s make safety on our roadways a priority this holiday season.”

These traffic enforcement campaigns are funded by the Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee (GTSC), which promotes and supports participation of law enforcement agencies at the state, county and local levels in high-visibility enforcement efforts. Grant funding is intended to provide for supplemental traffic enforcement and engagement during those times of the year, like the holidays, when there is greater potential for drivers impaired by alcohol or drugs to be on the road.

New York State DMV Commissioner and GTSC Chair Mark J.F. Schroeder said, “Getting together with family and friends to celebrate the holidays brings great joy, and it is incumbent on all of us to make sure that we are keeping ourselves and others safe in the process. Have a plan if you know that your celebrations will involve alcohol. It only takes a moment to figure out how to get home safely, and it will spare many moments of heartache and difficulty down the road if you haven’t made that plan.”

The Have a Plan app can help. The free app from the Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee and the NYS STOP-DWI Foundation allows you to designate a driver, call a cab or ride share, and to review the consequences of impaired driving. You can even use the app to report a drunk or drugged driver. The app is available for Apple, Android, and Windows smart phones.

In an effort to ease travel during the busy holiday weekends, temporary lane closures for road and bridge construction projects on New York State highways will be suspended beginning Friday, December 22 at 6 a.m. through Tuesday, December 26 at 6 a.m. Construction will also be suspended from Friday, December 29 at 6 a.m. through Tuesday, January 2 at 6 a.m. to ease travel for motorists.

Motorists are advised that some work may continue behind permanent concrete barriers for emergency repairs. The construction suspension aligns with New York State’s Driver’s First Initiative, which prioritizes the convenience of motorists to minimize traffic congestion and travel delays due to road and bridge work.

Text stops, including park-and-ride facilities, rest stops, service areas and parking areas along state highways support the state’s effort to reduce distracted driving. The New York State Thruway Authority will also continue its tradition of offering free coffee and hot tea to travelers along the Thruway from 11 p.m. New Year’s Eve through 7 a.m. New Year’s morning to promote safety and alert driving.

The Thruway Authority reminds motorists that 12 service areas are closed and under construction as part of the $450 million private investment and modernization project. Fuel services remain open at all locations. Motorists can view the service areas and plan their stops on the Thruway Authority’s website and on the free mobile app.

Thruway Authority Acting Executive Director Frank G. Hoare said, “By suspending construction activities, motorists traveling over these busy holiday weekends should see fewer delays. We urge motorists to make safety a priority on their travels. Slow down and Move Over for emergency vehicles and Thruway personnel responding to incidents, don’t drive distracted and leave plenty of time for stops. We thank our partners at the New York State Police for patrolling the Thruway and keeping motorists and our employees safe.”

New York State Department of Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said, “The holiday season is one of the most wonderful times of the year, but for travelers, it can also be one of the most stressful. The Department of Transportation wants to do everything it can to provide a safe and hassle-free journey for motorists, and is suspending construction activities to help ease traffic, as law enforcement agencies focus their efforts on the safety of the traveling public. We wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season and we urge all those traveling to please do so safely, so that together we can make sure everyone reaches their destination safely.”

During the enforcement campaign, Troopers will be using both marked State Police vehicles and Concealed Identity Traffic Enforcement (CITE) vehicles as part of the operation. The CITE vehicles allow Troopers to more easily identify motorists who are using handheld devices while driving. CITE vehicles allow the Trooper to better observe distracted driving violations. These vehicles blend in with every day traffic, but are unmistakable as emergency vehicles once the emergency lighting is activated.

During last year’s crackdown, as reported by the GTSC, law enforcement statewide issued 94,372 tickets. Of those tickets 18,222 were for speeding, 3,028 were for distracted driving, 2,684 were for seatbelts, 472 for the “Move Over Law” and 3,139 individuals were arrested for impaired driving. 66,827 motorists were ticketed for other infractions.

If you drive impaired and break the law, you will face consequences and be held accountable. New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services data shows that felony and misdemeanor arrests for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs result in a conviction in approximately 90 percent of cases.

The New York State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also offer these tips to make the holidays safer for all:"
49,Governor Hochul Announces Additional $25 Million Available for Local Municipalities to Drive Clean Energy Action and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-additional-25-million-available-local-municipalities-drive-clean,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced $25 million in additional funding is now available under the State’s Clean Energy Communities Program for local municipalities to drive high-impact clean energy actions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program, which recognizes local clean energy leadership and provides implementation grants, helps reduce municipal energy use, lower costs, and offers additional support for projects located in disadvantaged communities. This announcement supports the State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 85 percent by 2050.

“Advancing our climate and clean energy goals is a top priority as we experience the increasingly damaging impacts of climate change and extreme weather,” Governor Hochul said. “This initiative provides critical support to municipalities leading by example with investments in cleaner, more efficient solutions that lower energy costs while ensuring a clear path to building community-wide resiliency and a more inclusive green economy for everyone, especially for those historically underserved.”

Administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the Clean Energy Communities Program helps county, city, town, or village governments identify and implement high-impact actions that save energy and cut costs. By achieving Clean Energy Communities designation, participants qualify for grants for additional clean energy projects. Through a network of regionally based Clean Energy Communities Coordinators, municipalities receive guidance to navigate the program, and help in identifying, prioritizing, and implementing the most effective strategies based on their specific community needs.

With this additional funding, NYSERDA is expanding offerings to include more eligible project options and incentives as well as updating the program’s point system for high impact actions. Each high-impact action is worth points that communities collect upon completion of the action. Grant levels will be based on the number of points earned as well as the community’s size. In addition, awarded projects located in a New York State disadvantaged community can qualify for an additional 50 percent in funding for grants over $5,000.

Applications for the program will be accepted on a rolling basis through December 31, 2025, or until funds are exhausted, whichever is sooner. Grant applications will be accepted through an online portal at nyserda.ny.gov/CEC.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “NYSERDA is proud to partner with municipalities that are working toward or have achieved the Clean Energy Communities designation in New York State. With an improved program offering more flexibility and options to achieve designation, local governments across the state will gain greater access to funding for their efforts to lower carbon emissions and advance energy efficiency for the betterment of their residents.”

The expanded Clean Energy Communities Program will help more cities, counties, towns and villages join the more than 533 local governments that have already earned the Clean Energy Community designation. Since the program launched in 2016, more than 883 local governments across New York State have completed 3,836 high-impact actions through the program. The program also helps address persistent disparities due to the impacts of climate change in historically underserved and marginalized areas by providing additional incentives for disadvantaged communities.

Many communities that are designated NYSERDA Clean Energy Communities are also registered or certified Climate Smart Communities under the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which supports local efforts to meet the economic, social, and environmental challenges posed by climate change. New York State currently has over 400 local governments registered and certified as Climate Smart Communities across the State, representing more than 9 million New Yorkers.



New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “DEC looks forward to continuing to work with communities across the state as they take action to help address the threat of climate change. Under Governor Kathy Hochul’s leadership, NYSERDA’s Clean Energy Communities program and DEC’s complementary Climate Smart Communities program encourage local leaders to incorporate clean energy, climate resiliency, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions to help build a stronger and more resilient New York State.”"

51,"On National Day of the Horse, Governor Hochul Signs Legislation to Prevent Equine Cruelty",https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/national-day-horse-governor-hochul-signs-legislation-prevent-equine-cruelty,"Governor Kathy Hochul today signed legislation to prevent equine cruelty to recognize National Day of the Horse. Legislation S.2163B/A.5109A prohibits the slaughter of horses for human or animal consumption. Legislation S.1677A/A.3552A increases fines for selling disabled Equidae.

“Nearly 20 years ago, the U.S. Congress declared December 13 to be National Day of the Horse,” Governor Hochul said. “Here in New York, we are marking this occasion by signing new laws to address animal cruelty and the mistreatment of horses in our state.”

Legislation S.2163B/A.5109A prohibits the slaughter of horses for human or animal consumption by individuals or corporations.

State Senator Joseph P. Addabbo said, ""Today, as we celebrate National Horse Day, it's an opportunity to reflect on the significant economic, historic, and cultural impact that horses have had on our society. In honor of this special day, I am thankful that Governor Hochul will be signing my two bills aimed at safeguarding these magnificent animals from cruelty. The first bill, S.1677A, enhances the penalties with appropriate fines for the sale of disabled horses at auctions and extends these protections to mules and donkeys. The second bill, S.2163B, prohibits the slaughter of horses for both human and animal consumption. These animals, acknowledged for their contributions towards labor, agriculture, recreation, transportation, and various other purposes, deserve to be treated with the utmost care, and I join Governor Hochul in addressing the need for equine protections and the importance of this cause, which includes the end of horse slaughter and the prevention of animal cruelty.""

Assemblymember Deborah J. Glick said, “I’m very gratified that Governor Hochul has signed my bill banning the sale, purchase or transport of horses for the purpose of Slaughter for human consumption. Having worked for 19 years on this legislation to become law, today is a great day for New York State and for the horses who deserve better than the fate so many have faced in the past. I want to thank Governor Hochul for her support of this critical humane legislation.”

Legislation S.1667A/A.3552A updates fines for selling disabled horses at auctions. This legislation also expands the law to protect mules and donkeys. The current fine for selling these animals is only $5 and has not been updated since 1965.

Assemblymember J. Gary Pretlow said, “On National Horse Day, I’d like to thank Governor Hochul for signing our bill to stiffen penalties and increases fines for selling disabled Equidae. Every year, thousands of horse auctions are held in the United States, attracting farmers, ranchers, pleasure-horse owners, riding stable operators and unfortunately - slaughterhouse buyers. The current violation for auctioneers to accept abused or neglected horses has not been updated since 1965 and as such, stands at only a fine of $5. Such a paltry amount does not act as a deterrent to off-loading ill and injured animals. We needed to do better!”"
52,Governor Hochul Announces Completion of Central East Energy Connect Transmission Line,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-completion-central-east-energy-connect-transmission-line,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the completion of the Central East Energy Connect transmission project, which is an upgrade of transmission lines between Marcy in Oneida County and New Scotland in Albany County to relieve congestion and enable integration of more renewable energy into the state power grid. The 93-mile transmission line project involved the installation of more than 650 new steel transmission monopoles as well as the construction of two new state-of-the-art transmission substations at Gordon Road in Rotterdam, and in Princetown, both in Schenectady County, which will allow for increased power transfer capacity and more reliable transmission. The newly rebuilt transmission corridor can carry nearly five times the amount of electricity as the old lines, enough to power approximately 2 million homes. The New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll celebrated the completion of the project today accompanied by LS Power CEO Paul Segal, and President and CEO of the New York Independent System Operator Rich Dewey, along with other state energy and environment representatives.

“Upgrading New York's transmission system is key to building our clean energy future,"" Governor Hochul said. “This upgraded line from Marcy to Albany was built on time and within budget and will enable more renewables to power New York's homes and businesses. New Yorkers will benefit from this investment in the state’s power grid today and into the future.”

The more than $600 million CEEC transmission improvement project, built for approximately $200 million less than the estimated cost provided by New York Independent System Operator’s (NYISO) independent evaluation, kicked off construction in February 2021. The project upgraded energy transmission capacity along an existing 93-mile transmission line in the Mohawk Valley and Capital Region, a heavily congested corridor for energy transmission. A joint project by LS Power Grid New York and the New York Power Authority (NYPA), the upgrades allow for the flow of more renewable energy across the state and help put New York on track to meet its nation leading clean energy goals under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which includes a zero-emissions electricity sector by 2040, 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and economy-wide carbon neutrality.

The CEEC upgrade project involved replacing existing lines and wooden poles, some of which are about 60 years old, with stronger steel monopoles in existing utility rights-of-way and building two new substations. In total, the project removed approximately 1,250 aging transmission structures and replaced them with more than 650 monopoles. This work increased the resiliency of the line to strengthen it against extreme weather and supports the transmission of clean energy across the state. View recent photos of line construction.

The project is part of a larger buildout of transmission projects across the state, including more than 1,000 miles of planned transmission investments that will maximize the use of renewable energy for parts of the state that rely heavily on fossil fuel plants.

In addition to the completion of the CEEC project, several other New York State transmission projects are progressing toward completion or are completed and in service, including NYPA’s Smart Path which was completed earlier this year and Smart Path Connect, a transmission rebuild project in the North Country and Oneida County that NYPA is working on with National Grid. Two recently energized transmission lines are New York Transco's New York Energy Solution , which recently completed the rebuild of approximately 54 miles of transmission lines in the Hudson Valley, and NextEra Energy Transmission New York's Empire State Line Project which completed approximately 20 new transmission miles in Western New York.

LS Power CEO Paul Segal said, “We’re extremely proud to have completed the CEEC project on time and on budget. Thank you to NYISO for selecting LS Power Grid New York and thank you to our project partner, NYPA, for helping steer this project to success. With the energization of the CEEC transmission facility, LS Power Grid New York will help expand and strengthen New York state’s electric grid and meet the state’s clean energy goals. Moreover, the project’s success underscores why a transparent and competitive process to build transmission infrastructure is so important – as it delivers savings to consumers. In this case, LS Power Grid New York provided cost containment provisions that reduced costs for New York state electricity ratepayers by more than $200 million over the life of the project.”

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “New York’s clean energy economy depends on a robust, resilient, reliable power grid. The Central East Energy Connect corridor was plagued by congestion and outdated infrastructure related problems for decades. Now with the state’s prioritization of clean energy infrastructure investment, a more streamlined bidding process, and the industry’s synergy in working together to upgrade our transmission system, we are making great progress in modernizing our grid. I am so proud of our transmission team and our colleagues at LS Power for completing this Central East Energy Connect project within three years.”

New York Independent System Operator President and CEO Rich Dewey said, “Congratulations to LS Power Grid New York and the New York Power Authority on the timely completion of this important transmission upgrade. This investment will improve grid resiliency, move more clean energy as we electrify the economy, attract economic development, and advance the state’s climate goals.""

State Senator Joseph Griffo said, ""It is important that we continue to invest in, upgrade and modernize our energy infrastructure. This project will provide more individuals, families, businesses and communities with access to reliable energy.""

Assemblymember Marianne Buttenschon said, “As New York continues to grow so does the demand for affordable energy. We must continue to explore all sources of safe and affordable energy. This upgrade is one aspect of how we can meet the demand of the power grid for both our residents and businesses.”

New York State's Nation-Leading Climate Plan

New York State's nation-leading climate agenda calls for an orderly and just transition that creates family-sustaining jobs, continues to foster a green economy across all sectors and ensures that at least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities. Guided by some of the nation’s most aggressive climate and clean energy initiatives, New York is on a path to achieving a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century. A cornerstone of this transition is New York's unprecedented clean energy investments, including more than $55 billion in 145 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale up solar, nearly $3 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. These and other investments are supporting more than 165,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2021 and over 3,000 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, New York also adopted zero-emission vehicle regulations, including requiring all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in the State be zero emission by 2035. Partnerships are continuing to advance New York’s climate action with nearly 400 registered and more than 100 certified Climate Smart Communities, nearly 500 Clean Energy Communities, and the State’s largest community air monitoring initiative in 10 disadvantaged communities across the state to help target air pollution and combat climate change."

AUDIO of the Governor's remarks is available here.

PHOTOS of the event will be available on the Governor's Flickr page.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

I want to acknowledge that we just, in the last 90 minutes or so, received some very disturbing news from the Supreme Court of the United States. Remember, these are the same nine justices who, a year and a half ago, overturned Roe v. Wade, setting back American women 50 years in terms of their progress toward freedom, reproductive freedom.

So, they've decided that they are going to take up the case that could ban medication abortions nationwide in a very short time. And again, over half of abortions in America are by medication assisted treatment that allows people to do this in the privacy of their home and not have to have a major surgical procedure.

And this is not just going to affect MAGA states like Texas and Mississippi where abortion is already restricted, but actually a state like New York. And here's why, if they determined that the FDA was inappropriate in allowing this to be used for abortion, they could ban this across the entire nation.

Now, we'd had an idea that this could happen, so that's why we immediately took action. When we first learned that they were going to be attempting to restrict this, immediately, we secured a five-year supply of this medication – 150,000 doses. So, if there is a banning of this, that New York would have a stockpile at least to have this available for the next five years for the women of New York.

And also, when the Dobbs decision was leaked – remember that memo that came out that we found out even before the decision came out in June of 2022 that we would take immediate action, allocating $35 million to go to abortion providers, anticipating an increase in volume when you look at the fact that women must be going somewhere or else they're being forced to have these government mandated pregnancies.

Even a state like Texas, at one time had 50,000 abortions or about 38 in the last year. So, it's extraordinary. So, we wanted to establish New York as a safe harbor, making sure that we had protections, a shield law to protect any provider that would dispense medication in order to help an out of state individual receive an abortion.

We also had an extraordinary session to ensure that these rights would be protected, not just in our state law, but also enshrined in our constitution, and that'll be on the ballot next November. So, bottom line is women are scared across America. They saw what happened in Texas. They're now at risk of losing this simpler way that relieves a lot of the stress from an abortion by having the medication assisted and that's in danger right now.

And as the Governor of New York, as a female Governor of New York, this is something that women of this state need to know, that I'll keep fighting for their rights and letting the rest of the nation know that this is a harbor, a safe harbor for all of you to come to should these rights be jeopardized and stripped away by the MAGA Supreme Court."

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

First of all, we are here today for one reason, not the least of which it's very close for me to come to for my office, but I'm here to say thank you. This is a season we reflect back on many of our blessings, and we are so blessed that since 1843, there has been an organization that attracts a team as well as volunteers, the Community Service Society, and just helping people overcome life's hardness and giving people a shot to say, “you're going to be okay.”

And so, I'm grateful there's people that are so selfless and so caring of their fellow brother and sister that they would be part of this organization and of course they would, they are great partners with the State. We need something done. We need to have a call center set up for people to know whether they're going to be off the Medicaid rolls because of the pandemic changes and what happened and why.

We need to know that there's a place they can call and get an answer. And this is that place. So, I want to give all of you a round of applause for what you do for us.

And David Jones as leader and our chairman of the board and everyone else associated with— we are thankful. That there's people like you who do stand up. I also do want to recognize Beth Finkel here today. When I need someone who can be the voice of people that are my age, I call on Beth Finkel in her age to as the New York State Director of AARP, which is an organization that is synonymous with fighting for people and getting them what they deserve in life and as they, particularly as they age. And so thank you, Beth, for all you do for us.

And you're going to be hearing shortly from Anthony Calafiura. Is that how you get it right? Calafiura? Did I get it close enough? Anthony is going to tell you a story of what it's like to be a student and have to deal with medical debt. And so, these are the people that we're fighting here today.

Also, we have our great leaders in our State Legislature. These are their bills. I have to give credit where credit is due. They come up with them, they sometimes hold hearings, they work with their staffs, they work with the advocates. And I'm so sorry Elizabeth can't be here today. Let's give another round of applause for Elizabeth. The Chair of the Health Committee, Senator Gustavo Rivera, thank you for being such a great champion. Julia Salazar, always grateful for the vision that you bring representing not just your district, but also the people of this State and Amy Paulin, Assemblymember, one of our bill sponsors. Thank you.

These are the people who care so much. And Karines Reyes, Assemblymember, who's actually a registered nurse. So, we've done a lot together because she has seen firsthand the challenges that people have. I'm grateful to Marjorie Velázquez, also Councilmember, Chair of the Consumer Protection Committee. I want to thank her for her leadership. And of course, it’s always nice to have the voice of experience who served in office, I believe 50 years, Dick Gottfried, is that accurate? 52 and a member of the CSS board, so it's great to see you. But in a couple of minutes, we're going to be signing bills that will target it for one reason, to lift the crushing burden of debt off our fellow New Yorkers, and it weighs them down heavily.

We're banning opportunistic drug makers from jacking up prices to gouge prices at a time when people need some release. We're tackling automatic renewals from hidden credit card fees that quietly siphon money out of your bank account when you're doing something else. And also, the money goes from your bank account into the coffers of the big corporations because they know they can take advantage of you.

And we think about taking together all these protections will help shield New Yorkers from predatory practices. There are literally people who are conspiring against your pocketbook and to help you not get a better chance at life, but to help you go further into debt and that's what we're talking about.

And the stress that this causes for people – you think about, a mother sitting in a parking lot, deciding whether she should take her child into an emergency room or not. Is she going to be able to pay for this? Is she going to be straddled with debt? The level of stress this causes, think about an elderly citizen who's taking their prescription drugs, opens up the bottle, empties it on the table, and cuts the pill in half to make sure it can last. This is what people are doing, not in other countries, but this is happening in America today. And that's what we're fighting here against.

And we have actually 340,000 New Yorkers who are struggling with medical debt right now. That's large in the entire population of my hometown on the other side of the State. That's how many people there are that are dealing with this every single day. Medical debt is such a vicious cycle. It truly hits low-income earners, but it forces them to stay low-income earners because they can never get out from under it.

And that's what we're talking about, and it starts unexpectedly. No one thinks, “Oh, I think I'm going to get sick this year and run into debt. I'm going to need major surgery to stay alive,” no one thinks like that. It happens to everybody. But if you've got money in your bank account, you're going to be okay.

If you have a really good insurance program that doesn’t ask a lot of questions and covers everything – out of network service as well, you're okay. But so many New Yorkers don't have that luxury. They don't have that. And to me, that's just a basic human right to have the ability to get health care without sliding into crushing debt.

So, that's what we're talking about. No one plans to go into an emergency room, no one plans to break a leg. I broke a few ribs and two wrists my first year as Lieutenant Governor. I didn't plan for that. I walked around with a cast on for a long time, or a chronic illness. Like I said, the copays can sometimes be so much as well. So, hospitals sometimes will offer you a medical credit card. Oh, that sounds nice. A nice credit card from the hospital, the people are taking care of me. But the payments are so high. And pretty soon, unbeknownst to you, you fall in the debt, and you have a black mark on your credit report.

So, that's when you start spiraling. Prospective landlords aren't going to call you back when they see that, right? You're trying to be able to rent a place, maybe get a little bigger place, you got a family. The bank won't give you a car loan, if you don't live close enough to public transportation. You want to get a cell phone; cell phone companies are looking at your debt and they can turn you away as well. Even a prospective employer, you want to get a new job but you're in debt, you’re like, I didn't know I was in such debt. I didn't know this illness was going to happen. I didn't know this would be a mark on my life forever.

So, it's really hard for people and what I want to do is talk about how we get them out of it because it's wrong on so many levels. In your credit score, we're talking about medical debt and some of the practices of unscrupulous businesses. Your credit score is supposed to measure how responsible you are with your money. It's an arbitrary way, but they'll say if you have a good credit score, that means you manage your money well, that we’ll let you take out loans. But it's not based on adjusting for life's realities. It wasn't mismanagement or a character flaw that brought you to this place. It's just expenses you didn't count on in life. How could you have budget for something that's unforeseen?

That's what we're talking about, how to get out from under that debt. And it can happen to any of us, but again, as I said, some of us have an easier chance of getting out of it. And debt collectors know you're afraid of them. They know you're afraid, and they will haunt you. They will stalk you. They'll call you in the middle of the night. They'll sometimes see you in a public place. They're out there to get you, and that is just adding more misery to existing misery. And that's all consuming, and it's frightening for people. And sometimes they just strong arm you, and I want to correct that system. A system that preys on people who are in pain and in desperate need of care.

So, I'm signing a bill that bans hospitals, health care providers, and ambulances from reporting medical debt to your credit agencies. Let's take that right off. That will not be factored in there. That's going to be, people can focus on getting healthier and not focus on whether or not someone's going to catch you and trap you and make you spiral even more, so that's what we're talking about. We're just the second state in the nation to do this. I'm proud of that. New York leads, the others will follow.

So, this is an extraordinary opportunity, and it builds on a bill I signed last year that prevents hospitals and nursing homes from putting liens on your homes. Can you imagine that? And thank you, thank you for the leadership of getting that through as well, the legislature, our Senators, and Assemblymembers.

And garnishing, they garnish your wages over medical debt. Again, think about this scenario. You are sick. You lost time off work, you may or may not get back, so you don't have the source of income, you run into debt, and then how do you get out from under it? Oh, by the way, they're also going to garnish your wages. That's a big word for saying we're taking your money, okay? They're taking your money. So, how are you going to get ahead?

And when you think about the crushing debt on people, it's college loans, it's credit card debt, and also medical debt as well. And also, let's talk about those opportunistic drug suppliers. Oh, they are something else. You're laughing because you've seen what they would do. And they'll manipulate and overcharge customers for medicine, especially when there's a shortage. That's about as low as it gets, in my opinion. People stay alive because of these drugs that are available, but all of a sudden, a lot of people want them, so there's a shortage. So, instead of going and making more. Now let's just charge more for what we have so we can bring in the same profits and not really care about the people that are saying, “What do you mean it costs that much? A year ago, it cost this and now it costs this much more.”

We're just stressing out people all the time here. Come on, let's give everybody a break. And Big Pharma might call that the invisible hand of the free market where they can do what they have to do. We have two other words for it. We call it price gouging.

A year ago, it cost this and now it costs this much more. We're just stressing out people all the time here. Come on let's give everybody a break. And big pharma might call that the invisible hand of the free market where they can do what they have to do. We have two other words for it. We call it price gouging.

That is price gouging here in the state of New York. And I'm signing a bill today that bans the sale of medicine at unconscionably excessive prices during a drug shortage, as defined by the FDA. So, there's a shortage. There's a shortage. You're saying there's a shortage? Okay, but you can't jack up the prices because you're hurting the people that we're fighting for every single day.

Two other bills I'll be signing today plug in key consumer protection gaps. They don't, they're not as egregious as the medical debt, but over time, it just keeps adding up and up. And they found out, a study that was done by Chase Bank found that 71 percent of Americans waste over $50 a month on unwanted subscription fees that you may have signed up for, may have been a promotion.

Say, oh, for a dollar a year, you can get this subscription, and all of a sudden, you're paying 300 a year after that. It happens all the time. It happens to everyone. And two thirds forget a recurring payment, guess what, they're going to a debt as well. We've seen it. You see that random charge on your credit card?

Who has time to take a half a day off work, because I've tried this, to try and call somebody to get the bill taken off because I don't even remember signing up for that. Maybe I wanted to watch Disney Plus for a day to watch Hamilton when it first came out. I don't want to watch Disney Plus anymore. They're great people, great shows. Maybe when my granddaughter gets older, but I'm not using it right now, and I'm still paying for Disney Plus, because I don't know how to stop it. No offense to Disney Plus. It's a great program, and Hamilton was fabulous, but a lot of people are in that situation.

It takes a lot of time and effort to say, I'm done with this, or it was supposed to be a trial period. I want the trial to end, but they make it so hard, right? It's intentionally designed to be hard, so the money keeps going to them and out of your pockets. The automatic renewal has to stop, and they have to notify you, we're saying, okay, how about letting people know before, when it's a 10 day free trial and all of a sudden you're paying $51 for three months and then it keeps going up and then an automatic renewal is now $73 a month.

This is YouTube TV I'm talking about. This is real. So, the tech giants, uh, we love what they do. We want them to change their practices. Okay, we want, we're happy they're here. Be prosperous. Give us more content. It's great. Give us more subscriptions, more shows to watch. But I think ultimately people are counting on you to lose track and to forget about it. And that's built into the business model, and they make it intentionally hard to cancel. Look at what everyone did during the pandemic. The streaming services kept you. Connected people. You had something to talk about. Did you see the latest episode of Mrs. Maisel? I did. I saw them all. So, it was something to talk about. It was a human connection. You're watching all the shows and Ted Lasso and I'm not going to go down that path. But this is what's happened to New Yorkers. The people here, we're here to protect. And we're going to make sure that we're signing a law today. That requires businesses to notify consumers of any upcoming automatic renewal or continuous service charge.

At least let people know in clear language, simple, push here to cancel. Let's make it simple for people because life is hard enough. And also, they have to have very clear instructions on how to cancel anything. Last bill I am signing today, they will address invisible credit card fees that drive up the cost of goods and services. Invisible for a reason, right? Business model based on this. More businesses have begun charging customers extra when they swipe their credit card. Who knew this? Does anybody know this? Basically, we are a credit card society. People don't walk around with cash. People have no idea what this green stuff is that's from a long time ago.

It's PayPal, there's other ways to do it, but if you have a credit card, you don't even know that they're charging extra fees to use it, and it's buried as a surcharge, a service fee, a convenience fee, or they just skip it and supposedly give discounts, people pay with cash, except no one uses cash.

Let's be, make them be transparent. Let us know what you're doing. Let's have the true price up front when you're making your decisions, and that's what this new law will make us, will make, ensure as well, every cent counts for people. When you're living on the edge, every penny counts. And what we're talking about today can help you whether you find yourself in medical debt where you're a senior citizen like my father used to sign up for everything and now that he's gone, we're seeing his credit card. Like Dad, you didn't even watch these services. So, it happens to people unknowingly. It all adds up and it can send families into ruin. I don't want to hear any more about families making these tough, tough, tough decisions. Let's just give people a break. And especially our seniors who are so vulnerable, they are intentionally preyed upon by these services, by the drug manufacturers who take advantage of them, and no one should ever have to make a horrible choice between their physical health and their financial health.

Today, we're making a difference. And I want to thank everybody who had a role in this. All the advocates who got the job done, got this over the finish line, I want to applaud all of you. Thank you everybody for being part of helping make history here in the state of New York."
55,"Governor Hochul Signs Four New Laws to Protect Consumers from Price Gouging, Medical Debt and Unfair Business Practices",https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-signs-four-new-laws-protect-consumers-price-gouging-medical-debt-and-unfair,"Legislation S.4907A/A.6275A prohibits hospitals, health care professionals and ambulances from reporting an individual’s medical debt to credit agencies.

According to a 2023 study from the Urban Institute, 740,000 New Yorkers have medical debt on their credit reports with people of color twice as likely to have medical debt referred to a credit bureau and low-income people three times more likely. By prohibiting hospitals, health care professionals, and certified ambulances from reporting medical debt to credit agencies, this legislation will make it easier for New Yorkers to get jobs, secure credit, rent an apartment, pay for their children’s education and build long-term wealth.

State Senator Gustavo Rivera said, “I am so grateful to Governor Hochul and our coalition for standing together to relieve New Yorkers from the burden of medical debt's impact on credit reports. The Fair Medical Debt Reporting Act will stop medical debt from damaging patients' financial stability and mitigate the fear of seeking medical care due to cost in our most vulnerable communities. I look forward to working together to eradicate medical debt and ensure quality, affordable healthcare for every New Yorker.”

Assemblymember Amy Paulin said, “Today is a victory for New Yorkers with the signing into law of three of my consumer protection bills. Legislation S.4907A/A.6275A addresses the immense problem of medical debt affecting thousands of New Yorkers. This new law will prohibit medical debt from being collected or reported by a consumer reporting agency. We must protect patients from being punished for doing the right thing: taking care of their family member's physical and mental health.”

State Health Commissioner Dr. James V. McDonald said, “Governor Hochul’s actions prohibit medical debt from being collected from a consumer protection agency or included as a part of a consumer report, which has disproportionately affected older New Yorkers and persons of color. This legislation addresses the toll medical debt has taken on individuals’ financial security and is a significant step toward protecting all New Yorkers from medical debt and providing them the financial freedom they deserve.”

AARP New York State Director Beth Finkel said, “This new law will remove obstacles to New Yorkers’ ability to buy homes, get loans or save for retirement. No one should risk putting their financial future in jeopardy by getting the medical care they need, and AARP New York applauds Governor Hochul for signing this bill. Prohibiting medical providers from sending medical debt to credit reporting agencies will especially help older New Yorkers, whose income often decreases while their medical expenses increase – and whose numbers are growing fast. Plus, older Black and Hispanic/Latino families face much higher debt burdens than older white families. We thank bill sponsors Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Amy Paulin and their respective houses for passing this legislation earlier this year and making this new law possible.”

Community Service Society of New York President and CEO David R. Jones said, “Governor Hochul has shown tremendous leadership in tackling the state’s medical debt crisis, having enacted four bills into law in the past two years, including legislation banning healthcare providers from placing liens on patients’ homes and garnishing their wages in medical debt collection cases. By signing the Fair Medical Debt Reporting Act today, the governor is making it clear that protecting New Yorkers from predatory medical debt collection practices that can cause financial ruin for consumers continues to be a priority for her Administration.”"
56,Audio & Rush Transcript: Governor Hochul Calls Out Texas Abortion Ban on CNN’s This Morning,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/audio-rush-transcript-governor-hochul-calls-out-texas-abortion-ban-cnns-morning,"Earlier today, Governor Kathy Hochul appeared on CNN’s This Morning.

AUDIO of the event is available here.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Phil Mattingly, CNN: Joining us now, Democratic Governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, we appreciate your time, Governor, welcome.

Governor Hochul: Good morning.

Phil Mattingly, CNN: I want to start on Texas because I think this is a very, very central issue, not just politically, but I think it's people trying to understand the post-Roe environment in particular states. What was your response when you saw it play out?

Governor Hochul: This is the nightmare that every woman has feared since we actually got the leaked memo about the Dobbs decision, that it would go against 50 years of rights that women fought so hard for. My mother's generation fought for those rights. I benefited from those rights. And now those rights will not be there for my daughter and my granddaughter. So that is, to me personally, it's abhorrent. And as a woman, it's tragic, but as a Governor, I have a different philosophy on this. And we'll talk about that, what we're doing next November on the ballot in the State.

Poppy Harlow, CNN: That’s exactly what I wanted to talk about so abortion is going to be on the ballot it is going to be on the ballot to codify that right in this State as people go also to vote on, which is amazing that we don't have it yet, an Equal Rights Amendment in this country for women. Why is it important in a state like New York where you don't really have the threat from the legislature of getting rid of abortion rights to have that codified on the ballot this way?

Governor Hochul: There actually are threats. I mean, there was an election for Governor last year and there was an opponent who had said that he would put in a pro-life Health Commissioner. Health Commissioners have a lot of power. That could have happened right here in the state of New York, regardless of what the law says. So as soon as we heard about Dobbs, I convened the Legislature in an emergency session. I said, “let's get this codified not just in State law, but enshrined in our State constitution.” So future Governors, whatever their philosophy may be, if it's if it's at odds with these values, that they will not be able to successfully strip those rights away from New York women. And I'm calling on all state Governors, regardless of your own philosophy, let the women of your state decide. It happened in Kentucky. It happened in Ohio. Put it on the ballot. Let these women decide their own destiny and not have a bunch of MAGA men determining the outcome of their lives and indeed their health.

Phil Mattingly, CNN: You make a point, the electoral success on abortion that Democrats have had on this issue over the course – not just the midterm elections, but also the off-year election as well. New York is going to be center stage for the House of Representatives to some degree. To somebody would say you're just putting this on the ballot, given it's a blue state because you want to juice turnout for the midterm or for 2024.

Governor Hochul: That's pretty cynical because as you pointed out, we don't even have an Equal Rights Amendment in the state of New York. So we are enshrining many rights: reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, rights for people with disabilities. We're enshrining all the rights that could be jeopardized by future Governors and putting them on the ballot. This was a decision that was made prior to the Dobbs decision, I assure you, because it takes two cycles of the Legislature. So now we've gone through four years ago. So I would say I disagree with that assessment, but this is time for a place like New York to stand up, be a beacon of hope and really be the safe harbor. Women of Texas, businesses in Texas who employ women, where people have wives and daughters and mothers, come to New York, come to a place like this, make a statement.

Poppy Harlow, CNN: Do you see this as an economic case to be made to bring a lot of business that has fled to states like Florida and Texas because of some of their more, seen as pro-business policies or tax structure, etc., as coming back here as a result of that?

Governor Hochul: First of all, we are pro-business in the State.

Poppy Harlow, CNN: I knew you were going to say that, but you know the counterargument.

Governor Hochul: But also we're pro-women. We're pro human rights. We're pro freedom for women. We're freedom loving here in the state of New York. We don't think that MAGA judges and an Attorney General from the state of Texas who's just trying to elevate his profile and get more clicks and be the darling of the MAGA right, they should not be the ones who make these determinations. So after the Dobbs decision, I literally took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal and said, “if you value your freedoms of your employees and your workers come to New York where they will be protected.” In other states, other states where we actually honor women, respect them and think that they should be able to determine what happens to their own body. And not have someone say to a young mother, Kate Cox, 31-year-old mother, who wanted to grow her family and was so devastated when she found out that her baby had a fetal genetic disease that could result in death upon, even earlier, pre-term death, or as soon as a baby is born, it would die or the mother could die. I mean, this is what the exception of the Texas law provided and the judges still went against her. This shakes you to a core as a woman and it is it is so reprehensible. I'm proud to stand up, not just for New York women, but all across America and say this is wrong. This is our country, America, in 2024, almost. What have we come to? We must stand up at election time and change the course of history.

Phil Mattingly, CNN: You mentioned the election, I'm not connecting the two here, but there was a pretty significant moment yesterday in the state of New York in terms of redistricting, where that might head going forward. Is it your sense right now that Democrats will as aggressively pursue specific maps as they did with the maps and end up being overturned?

Governor Hochul: My view is this, as Governor, I have to make sure that the process plays out according to law. That's all this was about. And a judge in the rural part of New York had a different determination on who had those rights. And the Court of Appeals, that predated the Court of Appeals that I had some say over, they had a different opinion on this. I'm not putting my finger on the scale saying it would be good for Democrats or Republicans, it's not my job. My job is to say the process is an Independent Redistricting Commission decides it, and if they can't come to a decision, the State Legislature decides, not a rural judge. That's all we're talking about here.

Poppy Harlow, CNN: It is seen as going to be a big boon for Democrats. We'll watch as it plays out.

Governor Hochul: We shall see.

Poppy Harlow, CNN: We shall see. Governor, nice to have you. Thank you very much.

Governor Hochul: Thank you.

Poppy Harlow, CNN: Appreciate it."
57,Attorney General James Issues Statement on the Completion of Trial Against Donald Trump,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-issues-statement-completion-trial-against-donald-trump,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James issued the following statement after her office rested its case against Donald Trump and the Trump Organization for years of financial fraud:

“Today, after 11 weeks of trial, we rested our case against Donald Trump and the Trump Organization for years of financial fraud. While the judge already ruled in our favor and found that Donald Trump engaged in years of significant fraud and unjustly enriched himself and his family, this trial revealed the full extent of that fraud — and the defendants’ inability to disprove it. We look forward to presenting our closing argument on January 11.”"
58,Attorney General James Leads Multistate Coalition  Condemning Texas Supreme Court Decision Upholding the State’s Dangerous Abortion Ban,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-leads-multistate-coalition-condemning-texas-supreme-court,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James and a coalition of 11 attorneys general released the following statement after the Texas Supreme Court denied abortion access to Kate Cox, a pregnant woman whose health and life were at risk as a result of a lethal fetal diagnosis. Ms. Cox was forced to travel out of state to receive abortion care.

“No one should be forced to fight in court and leave their home state just to receive the health care they need. As this case shows, abortion bans pose dangerous health and safety threats wherever they are enacted. Decisions about abortion care should be made between patients and their doctors, not politicians. We will continue to fight to ensure everyone has the freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions.”

On December 8, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked a lower court’s ruling that would have allowed Ms. Cox to obtain an abortion under the exception to the state’s abortion bans permitting abortions in cases of risks to the pregnant person’s life. On December 11, the Texas Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision, preventing Ms. Cox from seeking an abortion, even though she had learned that her fetus had a fatal genetic condition and her doctor had testified that continuing to carry the pregnancy would jeopardize her life, her health, and her future fertility. The court found the legislative exception to Texas’s abortion bans did not encompass Ms. Cox’s condition because she had not shown it was sufficiently “life threatening.”

Joining Attorney General James in condemning the Texas Supreme Court’s decision are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Vermont, and the District of Columbia.

Attorney General James has been a national leader in protecting abortion access. Earlier in December, she obtained a court order stopping a militant anti-abortion group from blocking access to reproductive health care clinics in 13 counties across the state. In October, she led a multistate coalition urging the Supreme Court to protect access to medication abortion nationwide after leading the same coalition in filing a series of briefs in the district court and the court of appeals. In September, Attorney General James took action to protect abortion access at the Jefferson County Correctional Facility. In March, Attorney General James, together with Governor Hochul, sent a letter to the CEOs of Walgreens (owner of Duane Reade), Rite Aid, and CVS to demand answers about the companies’ plans to make the abortion medication mifepristone available in New York state. Attorney General James has also fought to preserve access to abortion care in medical emergencies, leading a series of briefs in support of the United States Department of Health and Human Services interpretation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). Following the Supreme Court’s decision to end Roe v. Wade, Attorney General James launched a pro bono legal hotline to provide legal support to patients and healthcare providers nationwide. Prior to the fall of Roe, Attorney General James helped lead coalitions of attorneys general to fight restrictive abortion bans in Arizona, Indiana, and Mississippi."
59,"Clean Energy Communities Program Helps Reduce Energy Use, Lower Costs and Offers Additional Support for Projects Located in Disadvantaged Communities",https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/2023-Announcements/2023-12-13-Governor-Hochul-Announces-Additional-25-Million-Available-For-Local-Municipalities,"Clean Energy Communities Program Helps Reduce Energy Use, Lower Costs and Offers Additional Support for Projects Located in Disadvantaged Communities

Governor Kathy Hochul today announced $25 million in additional funding is now available under the State’s Clean Energy Communities Program for local municipalities to drive high-impact clean energy actions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program, which recognizes local clean energy leadership and provides implementation grants, helps reduce municipal energy use, lower costs, and offers additional support for projects located in disadvantaged communities. This announcement supports the State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 85 percent by 2050.

“Advancing our climate and clean energy goals is a top priority as we experience the increasingly damaging impacts of climate change and extreme weather,” Governor Hochul said. “This initiative provides critical support to municipalities leading by example with investments in cleaner, more efficient solutions that lower energy costs while ensuring a clear path to building community-wide resiliency and a more inclusive green economy for everyone, especially for those historically underserved.”

Administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the Clean Energy Communities Program helps county, city, town, or village governments identify and implement high-impact actions that save energy and cut costs. By achieving Clean Energy Communities designation, participants qualify for grants for additional clean energy projects. Through a network of regionally based Clean Energy Communities Coordinators, municipalities receive guidance to navigate the program, and help in identifying, prioritizing, and implementing the most effective strategies based on their specific community needs.

With this additional funding, NYSERDA is expanding offerings to include more eligible project options and incentives as well as updating the program’s point system for high impact actions. Each high-impact action is worth points that communities collect upon completion of the action. Grant levels will be based on the number of points earned as well as the community’s size. In addition, awarded projects located in a New York State disadvantaged community can qualify for an additional 50 percent in funding for grants over $5,000.

Applications for the program will be accepted on a rolling basis through December 31, 2025, or until funds are exhausted, whichever is sooner. Grant applications will be accepted through an online portal at nyserda.ny.gov/CEC .

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “NYSERDA is proud to partner with municipalities that are working toward or have achieved the Clean Energy Communities designation in New York State. With an improved program offering more flexibility and options to achieve designation, local governments across the state will gain greater access to funding for their efforts to lower carbon emissions and advance energy efficiency for the betterment of their residents.”

The expanded Clean Energy Communities Program will help more cities, counties, towns and villages join the more than 533 local governments that have already earned the Clean Energy Community designation. Since the program launched in 2016, more than 883 local governments across New York State have completed 3,836 high-impact actions through the program. The program also helps address persistent disparities due to the impacts of climate change in historically underserved and marginalized areas by providing additional incentives for disadvantaged communities.

Many communities that are designated NYSERDA Clean Energy Communities are also registered or certified Climate Smart Communities under the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which supports local efforts to meet the economic, social, and environmental challenges posed by climate change. New York State currently has over 400 local governments registered and certified as Climate Smart Communities across the State, representing more than 9 million New Yorkers.

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “DEC looks forward to continuing to work with communities across the state as they take action to help address the threat of climate change. Under Governor Kathy Hochul’s leadership, NYSERDA’s Clean Energy Communities program and DEC’s complementary Climate Smart Communities program encourage local leaders to incorporate clean energy, climate resiliency, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions to help build a stronger and more resilient New York State.”

State Senator Kevin Parker, Senate Energy and Telecommunications Chair said, ""In order to meet the Clean energy and climate change mitigation objectives of New York State, it is crucial that communities throughout the state implement measures to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. I am pleased to see NYSERDA continue to expand this program, particularly by providing more opportunities for projects in underserved communities.""

Assemblymember Didi Barrett, Assembly Energy Chair said, “When we passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), we made a commitment to meet communities where they are and help bring them along as we transition to a clean energy economy. Our municipalities need access to funding, information, and guidance and I am pleased to see this additional $25 million has been made available through the Clean Energy Communities Program to help our communities on this journey while minimizing the burden on taxpayers.”

New York State Association of Counties Executive Director Stephen J. Acquario said, ""Our energy transition is one of the most critical aspects of our time. It affects the economy, environment, travel, housing, offices, facilities, nearly every part of our lives. NYSERDA’s Clean Energy Communities Program provides a tested framework and supportive material to help our counties navigate this transition, embrace sustainable energy practices, and walk down a path to a more carbon-free future. We commend Governor Hochul for her environmental stewardship, ensuring a greener legacy for the next generation.”

New York State Conference of Mayors Executive Director Barbara Van Epps said, “Facilitating the shift from traditional energy sources to sustainable energy systems is a crucial element of any strategy focused on decreasing emissions and tackling climate change. NYSERDA's Clean Energy Communities Program will make it easier for cities and villages to advance the State’s energy objectives and achieve their own energy goals.”

Association of Towns Executive Director Gerry Geist said, “Making more funding available for municipalities under the Clean Energy Communities Program is a great investment in New York. Local governments understand the importance of addressing climate change, and the fact that hundreds of towns are part of the Clean Energy Communities program is a testament to that. The flexibility of the program works well given how diverse municipalities are across the state, and the program is a great example of local governments and the state working together.”

The Clean Energy Communities Program is funded through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Clean Energy Fund (CEF). For more information on Clean Energy Communities, please visit NYSERDA's website.

New York State's Nation-Leading Climate Plan

New York State's nation-leading climate agenda calls for an orderly and just transition that creates family-sustaining jobs, continues to foster a green economy across all sectors and ensures that at least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent, of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities. Guided by some of the nation’s most aggressive climate and clean energy initiatives, New York is on a path to achieving a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century. A cornerstone of this transition is New York's unprecedented clean energy investments, including more than $52 billion in 118 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale up solar, nearly $3 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. These and other investments are supporting more than 165,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2021 and over 3,000 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, New York also adopted zero-emission vehicle regulations, including requiring all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold in the State be zero emission by 2035. Partnerships are continuing to advance New York’s climate action with nearly 400 registered and more than 100 certified Climate Smart Communities, nearly 500 Clean Energy Communities, and the State’s largest community air monitoring initiative in 10 disadvantaged communities across the state to help target air pollution and combat climate change.

60,"Governor Glenn Youngkin Announces Additional Funding and Waiver Slots for Virginians with Developmental Disabilities, Enhancing Support ",https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018954-en.html,"RICHMOND, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin today announced an additional $300 million over the biennium to fund enough priority one waiver slots for every Virginian with a developmental disability on the waitlist today. There are currently over 3,400 Virginians on the priority one waiting list for Medicaid Home and Community-Based Developmental Disability (DD) waiver slots, meaning these individuals urgently need the services and supports offered by the waiver in a year or less. Increasing waiver slots and reducing the waitlist has been a key priority in Governor Youngkin’s transformational Right Help, Right Now plan and the administration continues to deliver on those commitments today. Earlier this year, Governor Youngkin signed a budget funding 500 new waiver slots, on top of the 600 new slots that were approved in the FY 2024 budget by the General Assembly. “One year ago, I promised to enhance our support for Virginians with developmental disabilities and their families,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “Today, I am proud to announce we are one step closer to the goal of providing enough priority one slots for everyone in urgent need of services by the end of my term. Through these improvements, we are giving Virginians with disabilities the supports and services they need to live their best lives in their communities.” “We’ve heard from Virginians and their families about the important difference a DD waiver can have in their life or the life of a loved one,” said Secretary of Health and Human Resources John Littel. “Whether it be paying for in-home care or the kind of assistive technology that can help an individual avoid living in a hospital, nursing home, or other institution, we know that these waivers can change lives.” Waivers can cover services such as medical care, employment supports, assistance for community living, behavioral interventions, and other items like medical goods and assistive technology. DD Waivers are administered jointly by the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS) and the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS). Virginia has three waivers for individuals with a developmental disability: Building Independence for individuals 18 and older; Family & Individual Support; and Community Living. There is a waiting list for these waivers, and the slots are assigned based on urgency of need. Local community services board (CSB) staff assesses each individual that meets the criteria for a waiver to establish their priority needs level of 1, 2, or 3 on the waitlist. “We have been making plans through Right Help, Right Now to address the priority one waitlist, and we believe community providers will have the capacity to deliver services for this critical infusion of waiver slots,” said DBHDS Commissioner Nelson Smith. “Waiting for urgently needed help on a long list is unacceptable – we are working hard to get these families the help they desperately need.” Launched in December 2022, Governor Youngkin’s Right Help, Right Now plan is a comprehensive approach to improving Virginia’s behavioral health and developmental disability systems. The plan is built on six pillars, sets clear and achievable three-year goals, and includes immediate action to get people the “right help, right now.” Addressing the priority one waitlist is a goal of Workstream Three, which seeks to expand the capacity of community services to better serve individuals with mental health, substance use, and developmental disabilities."
61,Governor Youngkin Announces $2 Billion World-Class Entertainment District in Virginia,https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018886-en.html,"RICHMOND, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin today announced a $2 billion public-private partnership to create a world-class Entertainment District in the City of Alexandria at Potomac Yard. This new 9 million-square-foot district developed by JBG SMITH will feature the global corporate headquarters for Monumental Sports & Entertainment (MSE), an industry-leading Arena for both the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards, a state-of-the-art Monumental Sports Network media studio, the Wizards practice facility, a performing arts venue, and an expanded esports facility, in addition to bringing new retail, residential, restaurants, hotels, conference, and community gathering spaces. The project, a partnership among the Commonwealth of Virginia, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the City of Alexandria, and JBG SMITH, will bring more than 650 relocated MSE headquarters positions to Potomac Yard. The Arena, Phase 1, and future phases of development are estimated to generate a combined $12 billion in economic impact for the Commonwealth and City of Alexandria and create approximately 30,000 jobs over the next several decades. Subject to legislative approval by the Virginia General Assembly, the Entertainment District will break ground in 2025 and open in late 2028. “This is the most visionary sports and entertainment development in the world, bringing together entertainment, sports, and technology in the most advanced innovation corridor in the United States: a once-in-a-generation and historic development for the Commonwealth, sports fans, and all Virginians. The Commonwealth will now be home to two professional sports teams, a new corporate headquarters, and over 30,000 new jobs – this is monumental,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “This was only made possible through consistent collaboration between Virginia’s economic development team, the Monumental Sports & Entertainment team, the City of Alexandria, our administration and the Virginia General Assembly’s Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission, and JGB SMITH. Virginia is undoubtedly the best place to live, work, raise a family, and now watch basketball or hockey.” “Ensuring a stable financing structure was the Commonwealth’s top priority, and we are confident this transformational project is a win-win for Virginia, the City of Alexandria, and Monumental Sports & Entertainment,” said Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings. “All project investments backed by the Commonwealth and the City will be paid back in full by incremental project revenues; there is no upfront investment by the Commonwealth and no existing taxes or tax increases are a part of this financing plan. This tremendous opportunity will drive billions in total economic impact over 40 years.” “The Commonwealth of Virginia is truly a catalyst for innovation, and this transformational project represents a unique opportunity for the region's premier sports and entertainment company to forge meaningful connections with Virginia Tech, and other corporate partners in the region, including Amazon, Boeing, and Raytheon. This district will generate tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic impact, creating a prime regional destination,” said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Caren Merrick. “It is an honor to partner with Monumental Sports & Entertainment, VEDP, the City of Alexandria, and JBG SMITH on this historic win for Virginia.” “Investments in the Commonwealth's transportation infrastructure, including the Potomac Yard-VT Metro Station, enable developments like this to become powerful regional economic drivers. Today's announcement underscores the importance of strengthening our multimodal transportation network, and it is exciting to see this world-class Entertainment District come to fruition,” said Secretary of Transportation W. Sheppard Miller III. “We look forward to working with Monumental Sports & Entertainment and the City of Alexandria, as well as the regional business community, to ensure future investments in the National Landing corridor support the safe and reliable movement of automotive, pedestrian, and transit users to and from this cutting-edge District.” “We are committed to providing world-class fan experiences while continuously evolving our teams, deepening community ties, and solidifying our role as leaders at the forefront of sports and technology,” said Monumental Sports & Entertainment CEO Ted Leonsis. “The opportunity to expand to this 70-acre site in Virginia, neighboring industry-leading innovators, and a great academic partner, would enable us to further our creativity and achieve next-generation, leading work – all while keeping our fans and the community at the forefront of everything we do.” “The economic impact of this project cannot be overstated. This Entertainment District will house the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards, providing dedicated fans with a world-class arena from which to cheer on their hometown teams, as well as a performing arts venue, an expanded e-sports facility, and a variety of new restaurants, retail establishments, and community gathering spaces. This will mean more local jobs and more local revenue that will translate into additional funding for public schools, police departments, fire departments, and so much more. It’s a slam dunk for economic development and a layup for job creation,” said U.S. Senator Mark R. Warner. “Alexandria’s ability to attract this ambitious project is a direct result of the success of previous investments made in Potomac Yard and across our city,” said Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson. “It is our collective strategy and vision for purposeful economic growth that will ensure Alexandria remains a vibrant, accessible, and inclusive community for all.” “Monumental Sports’ major commitment to National Landing marks another milestone in its evolution into a model, 21st-century urban destination in Northern Virginia and will serve as a powerful catalyst for growth and opportunity in the neighborhood,” said Matt Kelly, Chief Executive Officer at JBG SMITH. “We are grateful for Governor Youngkin’s leadership and look forward to partnering with his administration, the City of Alexandria, Virginia Tech, and Monumental Sports in cultivating a dynamic district anchored by world leaders in commerce, sports, entertainment, and higher education.” Located on the Potomac River just across from Washington, D.C., the Entertainment District is easily accessible by all modes of transportation and is minutes from the newly opened Potomac Yard-VT Metro Station, Ronald Reagan National Airport, community bike paths and foot trails, and underground parking. Joining National Landing as part of Potomac Yard, the Entertainment District will be adjacent to the Virginia Tech Innovation Campus and near Amazon HQ2, creating opportunities for unique partnerships between MSE and Virginia Tech focused on entrepreneurship, sports analytics, immersive technologies, and innovative new business and media strategies. “We’re excited by Monumental Sports & Entertainment’s plans to be our neighbor in Potomac Yard,” said Virginia Tech President, Tim Sands. “We believe in the great potential of this location, and are eager to welcome others who are passionate about this community and building an exciting and vibrant future together.” “Securing this public-private partnership is truly a game changer for the City of Alexandria, the region, and the Commonwealth, benefiting a generation of Virginians and putting Potomac Yard on the map as a regional sports, entertainment, and innovation destination,” said Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission Chair Delegate Barry Knight. “The thousands of jobs and economic impact generated by this project cannot be overstated, and I am proud the MEI Commission could play a role.” “Thanks to everyone who played a role in this historic project for the City of Alexandria and the Commonwealth,” said Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission Vice Chair Senator George Barker. “ Accelerating economic development in Virginia is a top priority, and the Entertainment District will have a ripple effect on the economy and catalyze additional investments for decades to come. I am pleased the MEI Commission could be part of the collaboration to help secure this critical project.” Monumental Sports & Entertainment is one of America’s leading sports and entertainment companies. Its people, players, teams, and events bring excitement and joy to millions. The company invests and innovates to consistently raise the game so they can deliver extraordinary experiences that will inspire and unite their community, fans, and partners. The Youngkin Administration and Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked with the City of Alexandria, JBG SMITH, and the General Assembly’s Major Employment and Investment (MEI) Project Approval Commission to secure the project for Virginia. In the upcoming General Assembly session, legislators will be asked to approve the creation of a new Virginia Sports and Entertainment Authority. The $2 billion transformational investment will be supported through bonds issued by the to-be-created Authority, as well as a $403 million investment by MSE. The bonds will be repaid through annual rent paid by MSE, arena parking revenues, District naming rights, and incremental taxes generated by the Arena and Phase 1 development. There is no upfront investment or inclusion of any taxes already being collected by the Commonwealth to repay the bonds and there will be no tax increases for local residents. The City of Alexandria will also contribute $56 million toward the construction of the performing arts venue in partnership with MSE, and $50 million toward underground parking development. The land and buildings will be owned by the to-be-created Virginia Sports and Entertainment Authority. The Virginia Sports and Entertainment Authority will enter into a 40-year lease with the company. The project includes $110 million in on-site infrastructure including site development and roadway, signal, and intersection improvements funded through the bonds. VDOT, Alexandria DOT, MSE, JBG SMITH, and transportation consultants continue to refine a detailed analysis of the National Landing corridor needs, with input from regional partners, the business community, and residents to ensure a safe, reliable, and successful Entertainment District. Potential transportation improvements will focus on transit, roadway, smart mobility, and neighborhood protection.

This Entertainment District will house the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards, providing dedicated fans with a world-class arena from which to cheer on their hometown teams, as well as a performing arts venue, an expanded e-sports facility, and a variety of new restaurants, retail establishments, and community gathering spaces. This will mean more local jobs and more local revenue that will translate into additional funding for public schools, police departments, fire departments, and so much more. It’s a slam dunk for economic development and a layup for job creation,” said U.S. Senator Mark R. Warner.

“Securing this public-private partnership is truly a game changer for the City of Alexandria, the region, and the Commonwealth, benefiting a generation of Virginians and putting Potomac Yard on the map as a regional sports, entertainment, and innovation destination,” said Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission Chair Delegate Barry Knight. “The thousands of jobs and economic impact generated by this project cannot be overstated, and I am proud the MEI Commission could play a role.”

“Thanks to everyone who played a role in this historic project for the City of Alexandria and the Commonwealth,” said Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission Vice Chair Senator George Barker.“Accelerating economic development in Virginia is a top priority, and the Entertainment District will have a ripple effect on the economy and catalyze additional investments for decades to come. I am pleased the MEI Commission could be part of the collaboration to help secure this critical project.”

Monumental Sports & Entertainment is one of America’s leading sports and entertainment companies. Its people, players, teams, and events bring excitement and joy to millions. The company invests and innovates to consistently raise the game so they can deliver extraordinary experiences that will inspire and unite their community, fans, and partners.

The Youngkin Administration and Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked with the City of Alexandria, JBG SMITH, and the General Assembly’s Major Employment and Investment (MEI) Project Approval Commission to secure the project for Virginia.

In the upcoming General Assembly session, legislators will be asked to approve the creation of a new Virginia Sports and Entertainment Authority. The $2 billion transformational investment will be supported through bonds issued by the to-be-created Authority, as well as a $403 million investment by MSE. The bonds will be repaid through annual rent paid by MSE, arena parking revenues, District naming rights, and incremental taxes generated by the Arena and Phase 1 development. There is no upfront investment or inclusion of any taxes already being collected by the Commonwealth to repay the bonds and there will be no tax increases for local residents. The City of Alexandria will also contribute $56 million toward the construction of the performing arts venue in partnership with MSE, and $50 million toward underground parking development. The land and buildings will be owned by the to-be-created Virginia Sports and Entertainment Authority. The Virginia Sports and Entertainment Authority will enter into a 40-year lease with the company.

The project includes $110 million in on-site infrastructure including site development and roadway, signal, and intersection improvements funded through the bonds. VDOT, Alexandria DOT, MSE, JBG SMITH, and transportation consultants continue to refine a detailed analysis of the National Landing corridor needs, with input from regional partners, the business community, and residents to ensure a safe, reliable, and successful Entertainment District. Potential transportation improvements will focus on transit, roadway, smart mobility, and neighborhood protection.

This public-private partnership is subject to legislative approval by the Virginia General Assembly and the City of Alexandria.

63,Governor Moore Announces First Items in 2024 Legislative Agenda to Support and Empower Maryland Military Families,https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/governor-moore-announces-first-items-in-2024-legislative-agenda-to-support-and-empower-maryland-military-families.aspx,"Legislative Package Will Make 2024 ‘Year for Military Families’ in Maryland ​





ANNAPOLIS, MD — Governor Wes Moore today declared 2024 as the ‘Year for Military Families’ in Maryland and announced a package of legislation that will support and empower Maryland’s servicemembers, military spouses, and caregivers. This is the first legislation announced by the Moore-Miller Administration for the upcoming 2024 legislative session of the Maryland General Assembly.







“Our military families sacrifice everything so their loved ones can serve. They are just as much a part of the American story as those in the armed forces,” said Gov. Moore. “States have a duty to answer the service and sacrifice of our military families with strong support. That’s why we’re advocating for this package of legislation in the coming session.”





Next year, the administration will introduce the Families Serve Act of 2024. This legislation will create stronger pathways to employment for military families by allowing private-sector employers to implement preferential hiring for spouses of active duty servicemembers. For the state government, the legislation will expand the preferential hiring process currently in place for veterans to include military spouses.





The Governor also announced the Time to Serve Act of 2024, which doubles military leave available to state employees who serve in the National Guard or military reserves. This legislation will give servicemembers enhanced flexibility to use their leave for personal purposes like spending time with family, rather than for purposes relating to their service in the Guard or reserves. The bill will additionally expand Disaster Service Leave for state employees from 15 days to 30 days.





“We have a great responsibility to show our appreciation for those who serve — our veterans, and their families and caregivers — not just in words, but in action,” said Lt. Gov. Miller. “In Maryland, we are taking action, and I am proud to support our administration’s efforts to make the Year for Military Families a reality as the chair of the Maryland Joins Forces initiative.”





Prior to the announcement, the governor and lieutenant governor met with military families and advocates at the Starbucks in Annapolis – one of over 100 dedicated ‘Military Families Stores’ across the country.





Military spouses currently experience an above-average unemployment rate of 21%. Twenty-six percent of enlisted families suffer from low or very low food security. This concerted effort by the Moore-Miller Administration will address the unique challenges military families face, including through increasing opportunities for employment.





In addition to legislation announced by the governor, the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs will introduce legislation to support military families; to add a military spouse representative to the Maryland Military Installation Council, and to waive special license plate fees for Gold Star license plates.





The governor also expressed support for multiple bills proposed by Senator Dawn Gile, Delegate Andrew Pruski, Delegate Stephanie Smith, and Delegate Adrian Boafo. This legislation includes a bill to rename the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs to the Maryland Department of Veterans and Military Families, a bill to designate military status—including being a military spouse—a protected class for hiring purposes, ​​and a bill to establish an Interstate Cosmetology Licensure Compact to reducing unnecessary burdens related to cosmetology licensure – including burdens faced by military spouses.





“As a proud military spouse, I have witnessed the resilience of fellow military spouses as they navigate persistent obstacles in their professional journeys,” said Senator Dawn Gile. “By working with the Moore-Miller Administration to draft legislation aimed at renaming the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs and establishing military status as a protected class, we affirm our shared dedication to recognizing the unique challenges faced by military families. This isn't merely the right thing to do; it's a crucial investment in our state's military community and an imperative for the recruitment, readiness, and retention of military servicemembers.”







“This bill will empower and equip our agency to advocate for military families every day, just like we do for veterans right now, and I’m excited to partner with Senator Gile to see this enacted,” said Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Woods.





In addition to legislative action, the administration also launched the Maryland Joins Forces campaign last month. Chaired by Lieutenant Governor Miller, the campaign supports military families across five key pillars: employment, food and housing insecurity, education, health and wellness, and volunteer service. This initiative is modeled off of the White House’s ‘Joining Forces’ initiative. Maryland is the very first state to implement this program at the state level.





The Moore-Miller Administration is also supporting legislation authorizing Gold Star Families to apply – at no cost – for special license plates attesting to their status.





“Gold Star Families have sacrificed beyond compare for our country,” said First Lady Dawn Moore. “This legislation goes a small way toward honoring and recognizing their service.”





“Strong military families will contribute directly to our national security,” said the Adjutant General of the Maryland National Guard, Major General Janeen L. Birckhead. “Maryland is committed to being a national leader in addressing the needs of military families. Making 2024 the ‘Year for Military Families’ provides us with an opportunity to thank them for their sacrifices in service to our country.”
