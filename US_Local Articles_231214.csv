Officers were called to the 1100 block of Lee Street near a Texaco shortly before 8 p.m. in the Oakland City neighborhood regarding the shooting. At the scene, police said they found three people suffering from gunshot wounds.

The victims were alert when taken to a hospital. Their conditions were not released."

Crews arrived on State Street around 2:45 a.m., within four minutes of the 911 call being made, and found heavy fire coming from the front of a home. It is located just a few blocks from Georgia Tech’s campus, but students did not live there, Gray said.

One person had already escaped by jumping from an elevated window on the main floor and sustained an ankle injury, officials said. That person was found lying in the backyard and let firefighters know that six others were still inside.

Three of those victims could walk and needed only minor assistance getting out, Gray said. Three others had to be rescued. One of them was brought out through the front door, another through the basement and the third through a window. Two of the rescued victims were unconscious and in critical condition with severe burns, Gray said. They did not survive.

The third victim, who sustained injuries during the fire and was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital, was eventually pronounced dead, the fire department announced Wednesday evening.

Gray said it took 13 fire units with 50 firefighters to get the blaze under control. At least four of those units had already been working the Mount Zion fire, he added, and two of them went on to fight a third fire a couple of hours later in southeast Atlanta.

That one was reported closer to 5 a.m. nearly seven miles away at a home on Sawtell Avenue in the Lakewood Heights neighborhood. It was brought under control quickly, and no injuries were reported as the home was vacant, Gray said.

“We’re prepared to handle these types of incidents — the multiple incidents — but it is very taxing on the command staff, as well as especially the firefighters, the boots on the ground,” Gray said.

Some of the firefighters left the firehouse around 12:30 a.m. and battled all three blazes before making it back, Gray underscored.

“But you know, you can talk to any member in Atlanta Fire and Rescue, and they’ll tell you that that’s the kind of day that they love, is to be able to come to work and respond to calls and try to make a difference in the community,” he said. “Every one of them will tell you, ‘That’s what we’re paid to do. That’s what we love to do. That’s the passion that we have for the job.’ So you won’t hear anybody complaining.”

The Mount Zion Road fire isn’t the first to be reported at the Terraces at Highbury Court apartments, which is among 272 of the metro area’s persistently dangerous complexes, according to an investigation by the AJC that looked into serious crimes, lax maintenance and other hazards in Atlanta neighborhoods.

In January, a fire destroyed one of the three-story buildings. It was not clear if anyone had to be rescued, but no one was injured. Eleven months later, the cause of that fire remains under investigation, fire department spokesperson Alyssa Richardson said.

Several other incidents have been reported at the complex, including the shooting death of a man in October 2022. Another man was hurt in a shooting a month earlier, and a third was shot a month before that. From 2017 to 2021, there were 108 crimes there, including another homicide in 2019, 24 aggravated assaults, seven robberies, a rape and one case of sodomy.

Wednesday’s fires all remain under investigation, officials said. The Red Cross confirmed it is assisting the victims.

That’s when advances in DNA allowed investigators in two separate labs to positively identify the woman found dead 16 years ago: 24-year-old Nicole Alston. It was the latest in a string of cold cases in metro Atlanta and Georgia solved in recent months with the help of DNA technology. The evidence had been collected at the crime scenes, but the science simply hadn’t progressed far enough to solve the cases when they happened.

In September, Cobb County investigators solved the 1972 homicide of 9-year-old Debbie Lynn Randall by identifying her killer, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution previously reported. William Rose’s DNA was found on Randall; he died just two years after he killed the little girl.

“If you made a mistake, if you left something behind, technology is going to find you,” longtime investigator Morris Nix said when Randall’s case was solved. “Technology was seeking out William Rose and was looking for William Rose. Technology does not get old, it doesn’t retire, it doesn’t get sick and it doesn’t quit. Technology was seeking William Rose and it found him in the grave.”

In the Troup case, Alston’s last known address was Manhattan, New York, but she had moved to the Atlanta area in July 2006, her family told investigators. Then, she went missing and her family never heard from her again.

When the remains were found, they were sent to the GBI Crime Lab for identification.

“The only determination made was that it was an obvious homicide and the victim was an unidentified adult black female,” the sheriff’s office said.

After an in-depth investigation, the case went cold. Earlier this year, DNA was sent to Innovative Forensic Investigations in Emporia, Virginia, and Gene by Gene Laboratories in Houston, Texas, for analysis. Those forensic results were then sent to the GBI for comparison, and this week, Troup investigators learned that the DNA matched that of Alston.

Now, investigators have shifted the focus to finding the woman’s killer, the sheriff’s office said.

Anyone with information regarding the case is asked to call the Criminal Investigation Division at 706-883-1616 or Crime Stoppers at 706-812-1000."

B. Almy was the only one to vote against the removal of the books. She also voted against the board’s original directive.

Explore Marietta school district to review books for sexually explicit content

Five of the 23 removed books are on the American Library Association’s list of the most challenged books in 2022. Six are on the organization’s list of 100 most banned and challenged books in the 2010s.

While some thanked the board and Rivera for their efforts, others wondered whether the directive would open the door for more extensive removal of books based on content that small groups of people didn’t agree with.

“To ban every book in a public school that contains inappropriate content or language, we might as well only have children’s books,” said Bella Gantt, a Marietta High School student, on Tuesday. “Furthermore, let us not misconstrue restriction as protection.”

A September directive outlined an appeals process under which parents can complain about books and appeal decisions. Two books — “Flamer” by Mike Curato and “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” by Jesse Andrews — had already been removed from the school’s library. The school board denied a parents’ request to return “Flamer” to shelves in November. On Tuesday, it denied another parent’s request to return “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” to shelves.

The Marietta school board set a deadline of Jan. 11 for any appeals related to the books being removed from the library. The original directive did not set a deadline.

The Marietta school system is the latest to remove books, but it’s been a frequent occurrence across the metro Atlanta area this year. The much larger Cobb County School District has made waves this year for also removing “Flamer” and “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.” Most recently, Cobb announced its intent this year to push lawmakers to establish a rating system for books like the one that exists for movies in order to “prevent inappropriate material from being accessed by children.”

Cobb police said officers with an organized crime task force were “involved in an incident” around 9:15 p.m. that started when the suspect, Robert Shirling, allegedly fled from a traffic stop in a Jeep Gladiator near Sandtown Road and Hollyridge Drive. He was pulled over for having a warrant for violation of a court order for possession, police spokesperson Officer Aaron Wilson said.

“The situation escalated when Mr. Shirling attempted to ram an officer with his vehicle, prompting a pursuit that entered the southbound lanes of (I-75) toward Atlanta and continued through various surface streets,” police said."

The 28th Conference of Parties, or COP28 talks brought together countries that have joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Reports indicate the world will likely fail to meet the goal set in 2015 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise in 2022, and it’s nearly certain that 2023 will go down as the hottest year in recorded history.

The agreements reached in Dubai will have implications in Georgia.

Here’s what else you need to know.

A pledge to triple nuclear

Though the world now relies more on renewables like wind and solar power, nuclear energy is still responsible for roughly 10% of the global electricity supply. Many experts think adding more greenhouse gas-free nuclear energy is key to preventing even more dangerous levels of global warming.

The U.S. and 21 other countries pledged to work together to develop enough new reactors to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050. The declaration says that nuclear must grow for the planet to reach net-zero emissions.

Georgia is central to America’s hopes of reviving the industry. Plant Vogtle near Augusta is home to the first two new reactors built from scratch in the U.S. in more than 30 years.

Credit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com Credit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com

Vogtle, however, has been dogged by cost overruns and delays. The total cost is now more than $35 billion, double original forecasts. Most of the added cost will fall on Georgia electricity customers.

The U.S. government and nuclear proponents have expressed hope that Vogtle would spark a nuclear renaissance, and unlock huge amounts of carbon-free energy. So far, that vision has not become reality, though some utilities have explored new reactors, and detractors point to Vogtle’s costs.

Crackdown on gas leaks

The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made news during COP28 when it announced new rules aimed at limiting major gas leaks from oil and gas operations.

The U.S. power industry and Georgia’s largest utility, Georgia Power, are moving away from coal-fired power plants, the country’s dirtiest source of electricity. But as they do, many are bridging the gap — in part — by adding huge amounts of natural gas to their systems. Georgia Power has proposed an expansion of its natural gas capacity, as well as solar and battery storage systems, to help meet an increase in electricity demand the company says is coming.

Gas power plants produce fewer heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions than coal-fired ones, but extracting and transporting gas often releases huge amounts of methane — an even more potent greenhouse gas.

The new rule announced by President Joe Biden’s administration would force oil and gas producers to curtail methane leaks. The EPA estimates the combined economic and health benefits of the regulations could be worth more than $7 billion annually.

Georgia emissions buck global trend

Global greenhouse gas emissions are up, but Georgia’s appear to be down.

Analysis produced earlier this year by the climate research group Drawdown Georgia found that total greenhouse gas emissions in Georgia fell by 5% between 2017 and 2021, even as the state’s economy and population grew. On a per person basis, the emissions drop was even more significant — about 8%.

Credit: Jason Getz/AJC Credit: Jason Getz/AJC

The group attributed most of the decrease to the growth of clean energy and the shuttering of coal power plants. Still, emissions from other sectors in Georgia remain stubbornly high.

Though more consumers are choosing electric vehicles — which produce zero tailpipe emissions — transportation emissions surpassed pre-COVID levels in 2021. Georgia has also lost some of its available carbon sinks, like forests, which pull heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and are a critical buffer against further warming.

While experts have cheered Georgia’s progress, they say deeper emissions cuts are needed to meet the international 1.5 degrees Celsius goal.

A win for solar

The COP28 agreement includes a pledge to triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030.

It’s likely that Georgia companies will help meet that global demand, especially for solar panels.

Korean solar manufacturer Qcells recently completed an expansion of its existing plant in Dalton, which can now produce 30,000 solar panels per day.

The company is building a second factory in Cartersville that’s expected to employ 2,000 workers and open in 2024. The Cartersville plant will boast a fully integrated domestic supply chain for all components, from solar ingots and wafers to cells and finished panels.

Once both factories are online, Qcells says it will be able to build 8.4 gigawatts of panels each year in Georgia. That’s equal to about 40% of all the new solar capacity installed nationwide last year and enough to power 1.3 million homes.

7,[Georgia] https://www.ajc.com/news/,"Remembering Terry Maple, who turned Atlanta’s zoo from worst to one of best in U.S.",https://www.ajc.com/news/obituaries/terry-maple-turned-zoo-from-worst-to-one-of-best-in-us/WGF6IZDKQJHTHELAR242IDHUOE/,"Maple created a capable core team, raised money, instituted an expansive rebuild and rebranding program — including the birth of the moniker Zoo Atlanta — established corporate partnerships that helped foot the bills and transformed the zoo into a top-drawer educational and research facility. All that in the space of just a few years.

“He was a dynamic man,” said Gail Eaton, who once served the zoo as vice president of marketing and communications under Maple. “He knew what he wanted and he kept going until he got it.”

Mollie Bloomsmith, a noted animal researcher and a former Georgia Tech psychology student mentored by Maple, echoed that.

“He was a brilliant guy and extremely ambitious, and he had a vision of what was needed to improve animal welfare,” Bloomsmith said.

After touching a tremendous number of lives both two- and four-legged, the 77-year-old Maple died Dec. 3 after suffering complications from an infection.

Maple had a winning smile and ready laugh, along with a robust physique that friends would point out reminded them of his sliverback charges. He also had a propensity for sharing a drink and a story, and his charisma could light up a room.

Combining his relentless optimism with canny marketing, he used tools such as the zoo’s best-known resident, gorilla Willie B., and local media to get the community behind his plans.

Maple’s signature projects drew widespread acclaim.

He replaced the empty, barred cages with naturalistic outdoor habitats including trees, grass and natural structures. Animals were brought out of solitary confinement into social groups. They sired more offspring. A heightened emphasis on education captivated visiting school children and their parents.

“I think the best day of my career was everybody who worked together — and Terry crying with happiness — because Willie B. stepped onto grass for the first time since he was three years old,” said Rita McManamon‚ recruited as the zoo’s chief veterinarian. It marked the debut of the Ford African Rain Forest, another public-private partnership with Maple’s stamp on it.

Long and painstaking negotiations with the Chinese culminated with giant pandas Lun Lun and Yang Yang being loaned by the Chinese to the zoo in 1999, a buzzy event across all of Atlanta. At the time it was one of only three zoos in the country exhibiting them.

Friends and family say a bond with animals infused Maple’s childhood, igniting a passion that led to a to a Ph.D in psychobiology at the University of California-Davis and an eventual professorship at Tech.

Maple kept a part-time position with the university while running Zoo Atlanta. He brought Georgia Tech graduate psychology students to Grant Park to study all animals great and small.

“The projects were focused mainly what I’d call animal welfare,” said Bloomsmith, who now heads behavior management programs at the Emory National Primate Research Center. “How can we better take care of animals in a zoo setting?”

The studies ranged from trying to determine whether animals in the petting zoo needed a “retreat space” to how well orangutans could solve problems with a joystick-equipped computer. Maple spread the resulting knowledge far and wide, through a journal he founded. He penned many books.

Exhibiting his passion could take some unusual forms and showed his humor. The veteran scientist was known to show up at scientific conferences wearing a gorilla suit.

“And he made up these — he called them psongs,” said daughter Molly. He would rewrite popular songs into scientific ditties. “Sixteen Candles” became “Sixteen Mandrills.” “I Believe I Can Fly” morphed into “I Believe I’m a Fly.” And he was not shy about bursting into song, or psong, at any moment.

The veteran zoo administrator departed in 2002, returning to Georgia Tech and later helming the Palm Beach Zoo. He left vivid memories behind for those who knew him.

“I’m having trouble imaging a world without Terry Maple,” Eaton said."

Related Articles TV Streaming | List: Netflix’s top 50 titles in its new release of 2023 data The report, titled “What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report,” is set to be published twice a year, going forward, the company said in a memo.

The report measures the hours viewed for every title, the premiere date and whether the title was available globally. The report included only titles that had more than 50,000 hours viewed.

It’s among the most in-depth metrics Netflix has released about its subscriber engagement. As part of the Writers Guild of America contract ratified in October, streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+ pledged to increase transparency about how many hours certain programs are streamed.

This report covers 18,000 titles, measuring views from January to June 2023. Here’s what viewers spent the most hours watching:

• The Night Agent, season 1 (812.1 million hours). Spy thriller.

• Ginny & Georgia, season 2 (665.1 million hours). Young widow and her children move to Massachusetts town.

• The Glory, season 1 (662.8 million hours). Korean series about a bullied woman’s revenge plot.

• Wednesday, season 1 (507.7 million hours). Addams Family spinoff.

• Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story (503.3 million hours). Six-episode prequel to historical romance.

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during a conference call about the report that the most effective way to measure engagement is through viewing hours.

“It’s easy to understand. It mirrors third parties like Nielsen in the US. It makes Netflix very easy to compare to other streaming services,” he said.

Back when Netflix was in the early stages of its business, it wasn’t in its best interest to focus on transparency, Sarandos said, because “it didn’t want to provide roadmaps to future competitors.”

“We were building a new business and we also needed room to learn,” he said.

But that lack of transparency created an “environment of mistrust around the data.”

“This is probably more information than you need. But I think it creates a better environment for the Guild, for us, for the producers, for creators,” Sarandos said.

The company said more than 60% of Netflix titles released between January and June showed up on its weekly Top 10 lists, which Netflix began publishing in November 2021.

“This is a big step forward for Netflix and our industry,” the company said in a release. “We believe the viewing information in this report — combined with our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists — will give creators and our industry deeper insights into our audiences, and what resonates with them.”

Series dominated the list. The top movies were:

No. 14: The Mother , action movie with Jennifer Lopez as a trained assassin

, action movie with Jennifer Lopez as a trained assassin No. 20: Luther: The Fallen Sun , Idris Elba as a disgraced detective hunting a killer

, Idris Elba as a disgraced detective hunting a killer No. 23: Extraction 2, action-adventure starring Chris Hemsworth

The Oakland Police Department is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. No arrests were announced Wednesday night.

Previously set out for the public, the menorah was smashed and its pieces strewn around the area, according to Jewish Community Relations Council spokesperson Cassandra Huffman. Anti-Semitic graffiti was also sprayed on benches near the display.

The CEO of the JCRC, Tyler Gregory, said he was shocked but not surprised by the vandalism.

“I can’t tell you how many times people have texted me images of anti-Semitic graffiti (around) Lake Merritt over the past couple of months,” Gregory said in an interview with the Bay Area News Group. “I’m not shocked it would happen here.”

Gregory, in a separate statement, called the crime “devastating” and a “vicious act (that) unequivocally deserves condemnation. Jews in the county should not have to live in fear.”

The incident comes at a time when concern is rising – both locally and nationally – about anti-Semitism. At a Senate hearing in late October, FBI Director Christopher Wray said anti-Semitism was reaching “historic levels” in the United States.

The bus carried five student passengers and a driver, said UC Santa Cruz Police Chief Kevin Domby and a campus spokesperson.

The bus was traveling down a hill on Coolidge Drive and left the road before it collided with the historic structure. The bus came to rest in a grassy area and the impact crumpled its front end.

Four of the injured students were taken to Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz to receive care for moderate to minor injuries, UCSC wrote in a campus update Wednesday. Two others were taken to Valley Medical Center trauma center in Santa Clara with major injuries, according to Domby.

Domby said his department was still investigating the cause of the crash Tuesday evening.

The crash damaged the Cowell Lime Works Historic District’s more than 160-year-old lime kiln and may have caused structural issues, according to the university. Officials asked the public to avoid the area in order to prevent injury. Related Articles Crashes and Disasters | San Jose: Old Bayshore Highway off-ramp blocked after big rig overturns

The traumatizing event caused a ripple in the UCSC community, spreading quickly by word of mouth and social media posts, as students gathered in small groups near the crash Tuesday night. Students were in the midst of course finals this week, according to the university. Many of the students speculated on a possible cause of the crash, frequently referencing last month’s campus shuttle engine fire.

Fourth-year student Alexandra Anest and her boyfriend Albert Supradit came out to see what happened shortly after the crash, having noticed numerous ambulances, fire trucks and a police presence in the area after returning from an off-campus shopping trip. Anest said she had injured her ankle earlier in the day and needed to take a similar bus to get back to her room just a couple of hours before the crash.

“So, I got on the Loop and I sat on the Loop until I got home,” Anest said. “Now, I’m seeing the Loop and I’m like, is that the Loop that I was just on? It’s crazy.”

UC Santa Cruz administration is offering support to students in need via its Counseling and Psychological Services program and via Slug Support, with information available at caps.ucsc.edu and deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program.

EL BOSQUE, Mexico (AP) — People moved to El Bosque in the 1980s to fish. Setting out into the Gulf of Mexico in threes and fours, fishermen returned with buckets of tarpon and long, streaked snook. There was more than enough to feed them, and build a community — three schools, a small church and a basketball court on the sand.

Then climate change set the sea against the town.

Flooding driven by some of the world’s fastest sea-level rise and by increasingly brutal winter storms has all but destroyed El Bosque, leaving piles of concrete and twisted metal rods where houses used to line the sand. Forced to flee the homes they built, locals are waiting for government aid and living in rentals they can scarcely afford.

The U.N. climate summit known as COP28 finally agreed this month on a multimillion-dollar loss-and-damage fund to help developing countries cope with global warming. It will come too late for the people for El Bosque, caught between Mexico’s economically vital national petroleum company and the environmental peril that it fuels.

A rusting sign at the town’s entrance says over 700 people lived in El Bosque two years ago. Now there are barely a dozen. In between those numbers lie the relics of a lost community. At the old, concrete fishing cooperative, one of the few solid buildings left, enormous, vault-like refrigerators have become makeshift storage units for belongings — pictures, furniture, a DVD of Guinness World Records 3 — that families left behind.

Guadalupe Cobos is one of the few still living in El Bosque. A diabetic, she improvises a cooler for her insulin after each flood cuts power. Residents’ relationship with the sea is “like a toxic marriage,” Cobos said, sitting facing the waves on a recent afternoon.

“I love you when I’m happy, right? And when I’m angry I take away everything that I gave you,” she said.

Up to 8 million Mexicans will be displaced by climate change-driven flooding, drought, storms and landslides within the next three decades, according to the Mayors Migration Council, a coalition researching Mexican internal migration.

Along with rapidly rising water levels, winter storms called “nortes” have eaten more than one-third of a mile (500 meters) inland since 2005, according to Lilia Gama, an ecology professor and coastal vulnerability researcher at Tabasco Juarez State University.

“Before, if a norte came in, it lasted one or two days,” said Gama, sitting above the university’s crocodile enclosure. “The tide would come in, it would go up a little bit and it would go away.”

Now winter storms stay for several days at a time, trapping El Bosque’s few remaining locals in their houses if they don’t evacuate early enough. A warming climate spins up more frequent storms as it slams into ultra-cold polar air, and then storms last longer — fueled by hotter air, which can hold more moisture.

Local scientists say one more powerful storm could destroy El Bosque for good. Relocation, slowed by bureaucracy and a lack of funding, is still months away.

As the sun sets over the beach, Cobos, known as Doña Lupe to neighbors, pointed to a dozen small, orange stars on the line of the horizon — oil platforms burning off gas they have failed to capture.

“There is money here,” she said, “but not for us.”

As El Bosque was settled, state oil company Pemex went on an exploration spree in the Gulf — tripling crude oil production and making Mexico into a major international exporter.

As the international community clamors for countries to wind down fossil fuel use, the single leading cause of climate change, Mexico next year plans to open a new refinery in its biggest oil-producing state, just 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of El Bosque.

Gulf of Mexico sea levels are already rising three times faster than the global average, according to a study co-authored by researchers from the United Kingdom’s National Oceanography Center and universities in New Orleans, Florida and California this March.

The stark difference is partly caused by changing circulation patterns in the Atlantic as the ocean warms and expands.

The acceleration has also strengthened massive coastal storms like hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, researchers said, and doubled records of high-tide flooding from the Gulf up to Florida.

“In the 10 years before the acceleration, you might have had a period of rather slow sea-level rise. So people might have gotten a feeling of safety along the coastline, and then the acceleration kicks in. And things change very rapidly,” said lead scientist Sönke Dangendorf.

When Eglisa Arias Arias, a grandmother of two, moved to El Bosque alone, she was excited to have her own garden for the first time, and it was rarely troubled by the sea. Her house was flooded in a storm on Nov. 3 and she has rented an apartment a short drive inland.

“I miss everything. I miss all the noise of the sea. I mean the noise of this sea,” she said.

Swathes of the coast known as the Emerald Coast in the state of Veracruz are storm-battered, flooded and falling into the sea, and a quarter of neighboring Tabasco state will be inundated by 2050, according to one study.

Around the world, coastal communities facing similar slow-motion battles with the water have begun beating what is called “managed retreat.” Locals on the Gaspé peninsula of Quebec have been gradually fleeing the coast for over a decade, and just last year New Zealand’s government promised financial aid for some of the 70,000 homes it said will soon need to seek higher ground.

Very little, however, seems managed about the retreat from El Bosque. When the Xolo family fled their home on Nov. 21, they left in the middle of the night, all 10 children under a tarpaulin in pouring rain.

Now they practice math on an app. In the carcass of El Bosque’s primary school, attendance books are still on the floor with sodden pages and, in the preschool, alphabet cutouts cling to the wall.

First Áurea Sanchez, the Xolo family matriarch, took her family to a shelter at the local recreation center inland. Then, a few days later, a moving van arrived unannounced to remove the center’s only fridge and the shelter was closed.

“It can’t be,” Sanchez remembers thinking. “They can’t leave us without food without telling us right?”

Later that afternoon, an official arrived to announce the closure.

When The Associated Press visited El Bosque at the end of November, a moderate storm had flooded the one road to the community so that it was accessible only by foot, or motorbike. That same day the shelter was closed, apparently permanently, with papered-over windows and a government sign advertising “8 steps to protect your health in the event of a flood.”

The national housing department, responsible for operating the shelter, did not respond when asked why it was closed, or if it would reopen.

Meanwhile, new houses will not be ready before fall 2024, according to Raúl García, head of Tabasco’s urban development department, who added that, “I wish we could do it faster.”

Advocates, and García himself, said the process is too slow, and that Mexico needs new laws to cut through bureaucracy and quickly make money available for victims of climate change. Mexico does have a fund for climate adaptation, but for 2024 most of it will be spent on a train project already widely criticized for destroying parts of the Yucatan jungle.

Instead, President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador, born just a few hours inland, has made oil development a key part of his nationalist platform. That might change if polls prove accurate and former Mexico City Mayor and accomplished scientist Claudia Sheinbaum is elected president next year. Despite being Lopéz Obrador’s protégé, she pledges to commit Mexico to sustainability, a promise which is more urgent than ever.

Since she fled her home on Nov 3. Arias spends some afternoons with her niece, helps her neighbors with the dishes or bakes upside-down pineapple cake with them. These are welcome distractions from the now-daily deliberation between buying food and paying rent.

More difficult still, however, are her memories of El Bosque and her home by the waves.

“I would go to sleep listening to the sea’s noise and I would wake up with that, with that noise. I would always hear his noises and that’s why when I would talk to him I would tell him I know I’m going to miss you because with that noise you taught me how to love you.”

When the flood came for Arias’ house, she only asked the sea for enough time to collect her things, and it gave her that.

“And so, when I left there, I said goodbye to the sea. I gave him thanks for the time he was there for me.”"

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Nearly 200 countries agreed Wednesday to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels — the first time they’ve made that crucial pledge in decades of U.N. climate talks though many warned the deal still had significant shortcomings.

The agreement was approved without the floor fight many feared and is stronger than a draft floated earlier in the week that angered several nations. But it didn’t call for an outright phasing out of oil, gas and coal, and it gives nations significant wiggle room in their “transition” away from those fuels.

“Humanity has finally done what is long, long, long overdue,” Wopke Hoekstra, European Union commissioner for climate action, said as the COP28 summit wrapped up in Dubai.

Within minutes of opening Wednesday’s session, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber gaveled in approval of the central document — an evaluation of how off-track the world is on climate and how to get back on — without giving critics a chance to comment. He hailed it as a “historic package to accelerate climate action.”

The document is the central part of the 2015 Paris accord and its internationally agreed-upon goal to try to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The goal is mentioned 13 times in the document and al-Jaber repeatedly called that his “North Star.” So far, the world has warmed 1.2 degrees (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s. Scientists say this year is all but certain to be the hottest on record.

Several minutes after al-Jaber rammed the document through, Samoa’s lead delegate Anne Rasmussen, on behalf of small island nations, complained that they weren’t even in the room when al-Jaber said the deal was done. She said that “the course correction that is needed has not been secured,” with the deal representing business-as-usual instead of exponential emissions-cutting efforts. She said the deal could “potentially take us backward rather than forward.”

When Rasmussen finished, delegates whooped, applauded and stood, as al-Jaber frowned, eventually joining the standing ovation that stretched longer than his plaudits. Marshall Islands delegates hugged and cried.

Hours later, outside the plenary session, small island nations and European nations along with Colombia, held hands and hugged in an emotional show of support for greater ambition.

But there was more self-congratulations Wednesday than flagellations.

“I am in awe of the spirit of cooperation that has brought everybody together,” United States Special Envoy John Kerry said. He said it shows that nations can still work together despite what the globe sees with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. “This document sends very strong messages to the world.”

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that “for the first time, the outcome recognizes the need to transition away from fossil fuels.”

“The era of fossil fuels must end — and it must end with justice and equity,” he said.

United Nations Climate Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates that their efforts were “needed to signal a hard stop to humanity’s core climate problem: fossil fuels and that planet-burning pollution. Whilst we didn’t turn the page on the fossil fuel era in Dubai, this outcome is the beginning of the end.”

Stiell cautioned people that what they adopted was a “climate action lifeline, not a finish line.”

The new deal had been floated early Wednesday and was stronger than a draft proposed days earlier, but had loopholes that upset critics.

“The problem with the text is that it still includes cavernous loopholes that allow the United States and other fossil fuel producing countries to keep going on their expansion of fossil fuels,” Center for Biological Diversity energy justice director Jean Su told The Associated Press. “There’s a pretty deadly, fatal flaw in the text, which allows for transitional fuels to continue” which is a code word for natural gas that also emits carbon pollution.

Goals agreed at earlier summits have not been reached, in part because major emitters have not fulfilled their climate promises, or have declined to sign on.

The deal also calls for tripling the use of renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency. Earlier in the talks, the conference adopted a special fund for poor nations hurt by climate change and nations put nearly $800 million in the fund.

The deal doesn’t go so far as to seek a “phase-out” of fossil fuels, despite the pleas of more than 100 nations including small island states and European nations. Instead, it calls for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade.”

German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said the difference between phase-out and transitioning away could be seen as a positive: “I think the ‘phase-out’ was about sending a clear signal. And I think the ‘just transition away from’ is a way of phrasing the phase-out with the equity component included in it” for poorer nations who can’t act as quickly as richer ones.

Li Shuo of the Asia Society said when the two phrases are translated into Mandarin or Japanese there is essentially no difference.

He said “there were times in the last 48 hours where some of us thought this could fail.” But “we stayed at it. People showed good faith. People stepped up.”

President Joe Biden called it “one significant step closer” to keeping the 1.5 degree goal within reach, but said it depends on countries doing more “to build a safer, more hopeful future for our children.”

The deal says that the transition would be done in a way that gets the world to net zero greenhouse gas emissions — where emissions entering the atmosphere are balanced by those removed — in 2050, and carbon pollution to peak by the year 2025, but gives wiggle room to individual nations like China to peak later.

It was the third version presented in about two weeks and the word “oil” does not appear anywhere in the 21-page document. “Fossil fuels” appears twice.

Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, a Nobel Peace Prize winning climate activist, said while it is an important milestone “to finally recognize that the climate crisis is at its heart a fossil fuel crisis,” he called the deal “the bare minimum” with “half measures and loopholes.”

“Whether this is a turning point that truly marks the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era depends on the actions that come next,” Gore said.

NEW YORK — A powerful rally across Wall Street sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated that the cuts to interest rates investors crave so much may be coming next year.

The Dow jumped 512 points, or 1.4%, to top 37,000 and surpass its prior peak of 36,799.65 set at the start of last year.

Other, more widely followed indexes of U.S. stocks also leaped. The S&P 500 rose 1.4% and is within 2% of its own record. The Nasdaq composite also gained 1.4%.

Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they can relax the pressure on the economy and goose prices for all kinds of investments. Markets have been rallying since October amid rising hopes that cuts may be on the way.

Rate cuts particularly help investments seen as expensive, lower quality or that force their investors to wait the longest for big growth. Some of Wednesday’s bigger winners were bitcoin, which rose nearly 4%, and the Russell 2000 index of small U.S. stocks, which jumped 3.5%.

Apple was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500, rising 1.7% to its own record close. It and other Big Tech stocks have been among the biggest reasons for the S&P 500’s 22.6% rally this year.

All the excitement came as the Federal Reserve held its main interest rate steady at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, as was widely expected. It’s hiked that rate up from virtually zero early last year in hopes of slowing the economy and hurting investment prices by exactly the right amount: enough to snuff out high inflation but not so much that it causes a painful recession.

With inflation down sharply from its peak two summers ago and the economy still solid despite high interest rates, hopes have been rising that the Fed can pull off that perfect landing. And in a press conference Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said its main interest rate is likely already at or near its peak.

While acknowledging that inflation is still too high and the battle against it is not over, Powell said Fed officials don’t want to wait too long before cutting the federal funds rate, which is at its highest level since 2001.

“We’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long” before cutting rates, he said. “We know that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake.”

That’s why Wall Street’s focus was squarely on the projections that the Fed released showing where policy makers see the federal funds rate ending 2024. They showed the median official expects it to be at roughly 4.6%.

While that implies a less steep cut than many traders on Wall Street are expecting, it’s more than the median Fed official was predicting three months ago.

Following the release of the projections, traders on Wall Street upped their bets for rate cuts in 2024. A majority of bets now expect the federal funds rate to end next year at a range of 3.75% to 4% or lower, according to data from CME Group.

Treasury yields tumbled in the bond market on such bets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.01% from 4.21% late Tuesday. It was above 5% in October, at its highest level since 2007. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, sank to 4.43% from 4.73%.

They both had already been down earlier in the morning, after a report showed prices at the wholesale level were just 0.9% higher in November than a year earlier. That was softer than economists expected.

Such drops in yields and rallies for stocks, though, may be threatening to undo the very future investors are banking on, according to more cautious investors.

Lower yields in the bond market make it easier for U.S. households to get a cheaper mortgage and for U.S. businesses to borrow money to expand. Rising stock prices, meanwhile, give stock-owning households more wealth. All that could put upward pressure on inflation, which could eventually force the Fed to actually hike rates again, warned Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

He also said it’s unlikely the Fed will cut rates as many times as traders are expecting in 2024 unless there’s a recession. He is expecting the U.S. economy to fall into a moderate recession early next year.

On Wall Street, Vertex Pharmaceuticals jumped 13.2% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after it reported encouraging data from a study for a potential pain treatment for patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

That helped offset a 6.7% loss for Pfizer, which gave a revenue forecast for 2024 that was weaker than analysts expected. Much of the shortfall was due to expectations for its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment.

Southwest Airlines lost 3.8% after it raised its forecast for how much it will spend on fuel costs during the end of 2023.

All told, the S&P 500 rose 63.39 points to 4,707.09. The Dow added 512.30 to 37,090.24, and the Nasdaq gained 200.57 to 14,733.96.

15,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,Warriors' Draymond Green suspended indefinitely by NBA,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/13/warriors-draymond-green-suspended-indefinitely-nba-says/,"LOS ANGELES — The NBA suspended Draymond Green indefinitely, the league announced Wednesday in a statement that provided vague language for the terms required for him to return to play.

Green was suspended for hitting Jusuf Nurkic, earning him a Flagrant 2 foul and ejection in the Warriors’ loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night.

“He will be required to meet certain league and team conditions before he can return to play,” the league statement reads.

This is Green’s second suspension of the season just 23 games into the year and marked his third ejection of the season. Green will be out for the Warriors’ next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday and likely more depending on the terms.

This suspension has all the makings to bury the Warriors as they hope to escape a 10-13 start to the year in complete disarray. Green is Golden State’s most important cog after Steph Curry, fueling and connecting both the offense and defense. With starters Andrew Wiggins and Klay Thompson benched in crunch time of Tuesday’s loss, it appears the foundation is crumbling along with this untimely suspension. As coach Steve Kerr, Steph Curry and the rest of his teammates have said without hyperbole: They need Green to win.

“All the pieces fit for a reason,” Curry said on Tuesday. “They have for a very long time. So when you’re missing one, it’s tough. We still had opportunities to win the game tonight. I didn’t shoot the ball well in the second half… We want to be able to overcome the incident, his ejection, but we need everybody available, that’s how we’re built. It’s no secret to our success.”

Joe Dumars, the Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations and mentor of Green, has said the NBA works within a repeat offender framework for Green, specifically, based on his past transgressions.

After the loss, Green said he was agitated by Nurkic holding onto him during an inbound play and was trying to “sell” the foul by swinging his arms around.

“I’m not one to apologize for things I meant to do,” Green said. “But I do apologize to Jusuf. Even though I didn’t intend to hit him, I sell calls with my arms. I don’t fall to sell a call. I’m not a flopper. I was just selling the call because he was grabbing and pulling my hip. So, I spun away. And, unfortunately, I hit him…So, I apologize to Jusuf because I didn’t intend to hit him.”

Nurkic told reporters this: “That brother needs help. I’m glad he didn’t try and choke me. But at the same time, it had nothing to do with basketball. I’m just out there trying to play basketball and they’re out there swinging. I think we saw that often. I hope whatever he got in his life it gets better.”

Green’s first suspension this season came against the Minnesota Timberwolves for putting Rudy Gobert into a chokehold and pulling him off teammate Klay Thompson. Green was issued a five-game suspension for the incident, a harsher punishment because of the repeat offender rule that only appears to apply to Green."
16,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,Buster Posey says SF Giants' Shohei Ohtani pursuit harmed by city,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/13/buster-posey-sf-giants-free-agency-efforts-impacted-by-san-francisco-crime-homeless-issues/,"Despite offering the same contract as his other suitors, the Giants lost out on Shohei Ohtani, extending their drought of landing superstars.

Via either free agency or trade over the past several years, the Giants have tried unsuccessfully to land Aaron Judge, Bryce Harper, Giancarlo Stanton and now Ohtani. Although they reportedly signed Korean center fielder Jung Hoo Lee this week to a six-year, $113 million deal — the richest for a position player in franchise history — the last two true blockbuster acquisitions were Barry Zito in 2007 ($126 million for seven years) and Barry Bonds 14 years prior.

In an interview with Andy Baggarly of The Athletic, part-owner Buster Posey pointed to the city of San Francisco’s issues with crime and homelessness, and the perception of those issues, as a factor in their failed free-agent pursuits.

“Something I think is noteworthy, something that unfortunately keeps popping up from players and even the players’ wives is there’s a bit of an uneasiness with the city itself, as far as the state of the city, with crime, with drugs,” Posey told The Athletic. “Whether that’s all completely fair or not, perception is reality. It’s a frustrating cycle, I think, and not just with baseball. Baseball is secondary to life and the important things in life. But as far as a free-agent pursuit goes, I have seen that it does affect things.”

The concept of San Francisco hurting the Giants’ chances at free agents isn’t new. Last winter, president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi described the city as a “polarizing place” for some players because of factors beyond baseball.

Since Posey’s comments, national reporters like Buster Olney and Ken Rosenthal have said they’ve heard the same concerns from agents and players.

Although Ohtani never expressed outright concerns about the city while meeting with the Giants, Baggarly reported that San Francisco’s pursuit of the two-way phenom was affected by his potential reservations about living in the Bay Area.

San Francisco’s reputation has taken a hit in recent years, particularly since the pandemic. In-person work has diminished, leaving downtown feeling desolate at times. Some pockets of the city, particularly the Tenderloin, see high rates of crime, drug abuse and trafficking, homelessness and squalor. National media outlets, often conservative-leaning ones, have bashed the city’s problems, painting it as a failure of liberal political leadership.

Crime statistics paint a different story. There were 544 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents in 2022, per the San Francisco Chronicle — 14th among large cities. MLB cities Houston, Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle were more dangerous than San Francisco on a violent crime basis.

Professional athletes also aren’t living in the roughest patches of the region, either; many commute from leafy suburbs like Lafayette or Atherton.

Yet as Posey noted, perception can be powerful. Visiting clubs typically stay in hotels in Union Square, which could give the wrong impression to some. The Giants have had a lot of success attracting players with Bay Area roots — Sean Manaea, Joc Pederson, Mitch Haniger — who have more of an affinity and familiarity with the region.

The city’s perception is certainly not the only reason the Giants have struck out on free agents. They haven’t landed an impact position player free agent since Barry Bonds in 1993. The ballpark is cold and unfriendly to all hitters, but especially lefties. California has the highest state income tax rate in the country (though that doesn’t seem to bother players in the glamor market of Los Angeles).

The Giants pitched Ohtani on the opportunity to join an arguably unmatched lineage of legendary players — Mays to Bonds to Posey to…Ohtani — who have donned orange and black. Ohtani ended up staying in Southern California, signing a landmark 10-year, $700 million contract with historic deferrals with the Dodgers.

“I just feel that him coming to the Giants could have been transformative, obviously for the baseball team but it also would’ve given the city a boost that we’ve all been looking for,” Posey said.

The city of Los Angeles has many of the same issues as San Francisco. One way or another, the Dodgers have found ways to overcome them in meetings with free agents. Posey and the rest of the Giants’ brass will need to hone their own best pitch to get the results they — and the fan base — are looking for."

Israel must not drive

Palestinians from Gaza

Since President Biden’s initial declaration of unconditional support for Israel, Israel’s forces have killed over 18,000 Gazans, 70% women and children. Facing growing international condemnation, administration officials have tried to hide behind ineffectual pleadings to Israel to reduce civilian casualties, but the continued provision of a flood of U.S. weapons has only fueled the slaughter. The U.S. veto of a recent Security Council cease-fire proposal has exposed U.S. complicity in the relentless carnage.

Claiming to target Hamas, Israeli forces have actually destroyed much of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure. Fuel, electricity, fresh water and food have been choked off. Housing, medical facilities and sanitation infrastructure have been targeted and destroyed creating wastelands of rubble that could be used to justify the forced displacement of the entire population. That would constitute a monstrous crime of genocidal ethnic cleansing which America must not tolerate.

According to David French in his opinion piece, the Supreme Court has ruled that in the absence of an immediate threat, our government cannot punish a person who advocates violence.

If he is correct, then our First Amendment needs to be changed to prohibit any form of speech advocating violence to people or the environment now or in the future. Just because you may strongly disagree with someone does not mean that you have the right to advocate that they be harmed. Instead, you should work toward peacefully resolving issues through education, logic and examples.

18,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,Russian missile attack on Kyiv wounds dozens,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/13/russian-missile-attack-on-kyiv-wounds-dozens/,"By Hanna Arhirova and Karl Ritter | Associated Press

KYIV, Ukraine — A barrage of Russian missiles targeted Kyiv on Wednesday, wounding at least 53 people, officials said, as the Ukrainian president sought more military support in Europe after a trip to Washington secured no new pledges.

Loud explosions rocked Ukraine’s capital at 3 a.m. as the city’s air defenses were activated for the second time this week. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 10 ballistic missiles toward Kyiv and all were intercepted by air defenses, but their debris struck homes and a children’s hospital.

The attack underscored the continuing threat to Ukraine from the Kremlin’s missile arsenal in the 21-month war. Russia has been stockpiling its air-launched cruise missiles from its heavy bomber fleet, according to a recent assessment by the U.K. Ministry of Defense.

That may herald another heavy winter bombardment of Ukraine’s power grid. Moscow last year targeted energy infrastructure in an effort to deny Ukrainians heat, light and running water and break their fighting spirit.

As winter sets in and hinders troop movements, allowing little change along the front line, long-range air bombardment plays a growing role.

Ukraine has dwindling supplies of air defense munitions and other ammunition. That prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Washington on Tuesday in an effort to persuade lawmakers to approve President Joe Biden’s request for $61.4 billion for Ukraine. His trip accomplished no breakthrough.

Zelenskyy said on Telegram that he and Biden agreed to work on increasing the number of air defense systems in Ukraine. “The terrorist state has just demonstrated how crucial this decision is,” Zelenskyy said, referring to the overnight strikes.

On Wednesday, he met in Oslo with Nordic leaders who feel keenly the potential threat from nearby Russia and are among Kyiv’s staunchest supporters.

Zelenskyy may also attend a European Union summit on Thursday in Brussels, where the continent’s leaders are expected to discuss their backing for Ukraine. Officials did not confirm such a trip.

“Russia is eager to exploit divisions,” the senior leaders from Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden said in a joint statement in Oslo. “We must continue to stand united against Russia’s illegal and immoral war.”

They vowed “comprehensive assistance” for Ukraine. “Now is not the time to tire,” the Nordic leaders said, amid signs of war fatigue among Kyiv’s foreign supporters.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said her government will unveil a Ukraine support package of almost 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) this week. Norway announced it will give additional air defenses to Ukraine, taking them from its own stocks to ensure speedy delivery.

Separately, Latvia and Ukraine announced an agreement on the production of drones, a key part of the war.

In the overnight missile attack, debris from the intercepted weapons fell in Kyiv’s eastern Dniprovskyi district, injuring dozens of people, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Kitschko said on Telegram. Twenty people, including two children, were hospitalized, and 33 people received medical treatment on the spot.

An apartment building, a private house and several cars caught fire, while the windows of a children’s hospital were shattered, Klitschko said. Falling rocket debris also damaged the water supply system in the district.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, 10 Russian drones were shot down, most of them in the Odesa region, the Ukrainian air force said.

In other developments, a “hacktivist” group called SoIntsepek claimed responsibility for a major cyberattack Tuesday against Ukrainian internet and cell phone provider Kyivstar, which serves more than 24 million mobile customers across the country.

“The persona was probably fabricated by the GRU to launder their operations publicly,” Mandiant threat analyst John Hultquist said in an emailed statement, adding that Sandworm is responsible for “most major disruptive cyberattacks we know about.”

A Kyivstar spokeswoman said the company hoped to restore all service by end of Wednesday but the network integrity company Kentik Inc. said only a fraction had been restored by the afternoon.

Meanwhile, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in a report that Russian forces this year have “continued to use explosive weapons with wide area effects in their attacks on densely populated urban areas of Ukraine … both in areas close to heavy fighting and in cities far from the contact line.”

The governmental organization added in the report published Wednesday that Ukrainian armed forces, though on a much smaller scale, also shelled populated areas of Ukraine that are occupied by Russia, causing civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.

19,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Child arrested in ‘swatting’ plot that terrorized Orange County synagogues,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-13/child-arrested-in-swatting-plot-that-terrorized-orange-county-synagogues,"The FBI arrested a child Tuesday in connection with dozens of “swatting” incidents targeting synagogues throughout the nation this summer — including two in Orange County.

The agency did not provide the minor’s age, gender or name. The juvenile was taken into custody at home, said spokesperson Laura Eimiller, but the FBI did not identify the city.

The practice of “swatting” refers to when an individual or group of people intentionally misinform law enforcement of a fake threat so that authorities respond to a specified location with tactical units or SWAT teams.

Authorities say the juvenile suspect was arrested on suspicion of two such incidents at Orange County synagogues.

Congregation B’nai Israel in Tustin was evacuated after being targeted with a swatting call on July 22.

Police also responded to a fake bomb threat in Fullerton on Aug. 12. Law enforcement could be seen entering Temple Beth Tikvah about 45 minutes into a Saturday morning Shabbat service that was streamed on Facebook.

About two minutes later, Rabbi Mati Kirschenbaum asked templegoers to evacuate the building.

Those were just two of the dozens of hoax threats allegedly made against religious, educational and public institutions across the country this summer.

Authorities allege the minor suspect helped a group suspected of reporting false threats against at least 25 synagogues in 13 states between July and August.

The FBI says the juvenile created the server that hosted the swatting network. That server, which has since been taken down, was a safe space for extremist activity, including “the glorification of highly publicized mass killers,” according to the agency.

“The false swatting threats made in this case drained law enforcement resources and caused a negative financial impact on local communities,” an FBI statement said. “Evidence has shown that making false threats can cause significant distress to victims and can cause physical injury to first responders or other victims.”

The Orange County’s district attorney’s office is expected to bring charges against the suspect, according to the FBI."
20,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Oakland’s largest menorah found destroyed days after lighting ceremony,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-13/oaklands-largest-menorah-found-destroyed-days-after-lighting-ceremony,"Oakland’s Jewish community celebrated the official lighting of the city’s largest menorah at Lake Merritt on Dec. 10.

Joined by local dignitaries, more than 100 members of Oakland’s Jewish community celebrated the beginning of Hanukkah with the 18th annual Grand Menorah Lighting at Lake Merritt on Sunday.

Three days later, the giant menorah was found shattered, with parts lying in and beside the lake — and antisemitic remarks scribbled onto the cement block that had served as its pedestal.

Mayor Sheng Thao, who attended the celebration Sunday night, said in a statement Wednesday that she’s asked the Oakland Police to investigate the incident as a hate crime. Oakland Police did not respond to a request for comment.

Rabbi David Labkowski of the Chabad Jewish Center of Oakland said that by 8 a.m. Wednesday, all that was left of the menorah were bits and pieces on the ground and “hateful graffiti all over the area, especially where the menorah once stood.”

“We found the pieces all over,” he said. “It just seemed like somebody destroyed it, literally chopped it up into pieces. This is 350 pounds of steel.”

Thao condemned the vandalism and said the menorah at Lake Merritt is “a long-standing and important symbol of Oakland’s Jewish community.”

“I want to be very clear that what happened was not just an attack on Oakland’s Jewish community but our entire city and our shared values,” she said. “We stand together against hate, against antisemitism and against bigotry in any form.”

California State Senator Nancy Skinner, who represents Berkeley and Oakland, called the destruction of the menorah an act of cowardice and applauded Thao’s call for the Oakland Police to investigate the incident as a hate crime.

“Destroying a symbol of hope and light is a despicable act and is especially hurtful on this sixth day of Hanukkah,” she said in a statement.

The rise in antisemitic discourse and incidents appears to have lowered attendance at the annual lighting ceremony, which can see upward of 200 people, Labkowski said. The Anti-Defamation League recorded nearly five times more antisemitic incidents between Oct. 7 and Oct. 23 of this year than during the same period last year. Over half of the incidents were directly linked to the Israel-Hamas war.

Rabbi Mark Bloom, the head rabbi at local Temple Beth Abraham, said the vandalism of the menorah is sad but not unexpected, given the rise of antisemitic rhetoric in Oakland.

“I was not surprised when you have that kind of rhetoric happening all over the city: graffiti, vandalism, city council meetings,” he said. “Words turn into actions for some people.”

In an Oakland City Council meeting that went viral on social media in November, the council voted 6 to 2 against condemning Hamas, which some attendees had defended in their comments.

“There’s kind of a general panic [in the Oakland Jewish community],” Bloom said. “We think we’re going to be okay, but it’s really scary.”

“The malicious destruction of a public menorah in Lake Merritt, Oakland, accompanied by hateful graffiti, is just the latest example of rampant antisemitism tearing apart the Bay Area,” Tyler Gregory, chief executive of the Jewish Community Relations Council Bay Area, said in a statement.

The Chabad Jewish Center of Oakland will hold another lighting ceremony Wednesday at 7 p.m., replacing the destroyed menorah with one moved from Piedmont Avenue.

“It’s devastating,” Labkowski said. “It’s really upsetting and it just makes our resolve stronger to want to build bigger.”"
21,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Jury awards $25 million to sexual abuse victim of Santa Barbara Unified high school coach,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-13/jury-awards-25-million-to-sexual-abuse-victim-of-santa-barbara-unified-high-school-coach,"Jurors have awarded $25 million to a former Santa Barbara Unified School District student who was abused by an assistant coach later convicted of felony sex crimes involving other boys.

The Santa Barbara County Superior Court jury reached the verdict after a three-week trial in which attorneys for the victim, now a young man, presented evidence that the school district had repeatedly ignored warnings about the abuser, Justin Sell, who worked as a coach and security guard at Goleta’s Dos Pueblos High School.

Sell was convicted in 2014 of sexually abusing students and is now a registered sex offender.

Jurors heard about a series of incidents involving Sell that alerted school officials to his behavior before and during the time of the boy’s abuse between 2008 and 2011.

Last Friday, the jury found that the school district was liable for 80% of the damages suffered by the boy, whose abuse began when he was 15 and Sell was in his late 20s. To shield the identity of the now 30-year-old victim, he was referred to in the case as John Doe 2.

“The school district and its employees had multiple missed opportunities to get rid of a person they acknowledged was a problematic employee,” said John Taylor of Taylor & Ring, a law firm known for bringing some of the largest abuse cases in California. “They repeatedly chose to protect the employee over the safety of the kids.”

Sell was also accused of grooming and sexually abusing two other Dos Pueblos students, who were identified in litigation as John Doe 1 and John Doe 3. In June 2013, Sell was arrested and charged with multiple felonies involving two boys, including stalking and sexual abuse. He agreed to a plea deal and sentenced to one year in jail and five years’ probation. Those two accusers are also suing the district.

In response to the jury verdict, the school district issued a statement noting that the abuse happened years ago.

“There is never an excuse for abhorrent behavior from an employee regarding a minor student,” the district said. “The school district deeply empathizes with any student who finds themselves in a vulnerable position in a school environment where children should feel safe. Although the conduct in this matter occurred more than a decade ago, the school district has an ongoing commitment to strict standards of professional conduct, proper supervision of employees, and a variety of methods of reporting inappropriate behavior.“

Sell is currently living and working in Santa Barbara.

“The jury recognized the lifelong harm that childhood sexual abuse inflicts on its victims,” said attorney Natalie Weatherford. “The verdict represents a step forward in the young life of the plaintiff and validation that the abuse was not his fault.”

Even before Sell began to groom the boy, school administrators had warned Sell about eating lunch with freshman boys rather than doing his job.

Then in the 2007/2008 school year, according to court documents, Sell punched a student in the face on campus. Multiple school employees were aware of the incident, yet it was not reported to law enforcement as was required by law, the lawsuit stated.

In 2008, the lawsuit says, Sell began giving food and gifts to the boy identified only as John Doe 2. Their interaction would evolve after the boy was injured during wrestling and Sell claimed to be able to treat him, according to the lawsuit,

Sell then began giving the boy massages, as well as sexually touching him in front of other boys, according to the evidence presented at trial. He also got the boy alone outside of school and coerced him into a sex act, according to the lawsuit.

During that period, the school district promoted Sell to a permanent employee as a campus safety assistant. In the same year Sell was promoted, though, the head football coach reported Sell’s inappropriate behavior to the athletic director and school principal at least three times, according to the litigation.

In the fall of 2010, the head football coach terminated Sell as an assistant due to Sell’s insubordination and refusal to stop spending time with one of the two other boys who are now suing. Sell nonetheless kept his job as a campus security guard with full access to the campus and students.

In 2010, John Doe 1’s parents made a formal complaint to the school, but school officials did not inform the police despite their legal obligation to do so, according to the lawsuit.

In the spring of 2011, the district transferred Sell to Santa Barbara High School and, a few months later, entered into a confidential resignation agreement with him, allowing him to resign his security guard position instead of being fired. As part of that deal, the district agreed to provide a “neutral” recommendation about Sell to his potential future employers, according to court documents.

But in the spring of 2013, a classmate of John Doe 2 told authorities that Sell stalked and sexually abused the boy, and not long after, a second boy also alleged abuse.

Sell was accused of creating a fictitious Facebook account that Santa Barbara Police said he used to post demeaning comments about the boy and to befriend the boy’s contacts.

When Santa Barbara police arrested Sell, a news release by the department alleged that Sell admitted to nearly all of the acts described by John Doe 1. According to the police, Sell told a detective that he stalked John Doe 1 because he perceived that his friendship with John Doe 1 was failing.

Santa Barbara County’s District Attorney charged Sell with multiple counts of stalking and sex crimes with two minors. In a plea deal, Sell pleaded no contest to oral copulation with a minor, contact with a minor with the intent to commit a sexual offense, and stalking."
22,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Vulnerable California Republicans vote for Biden impeachment inquiry,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-12-13/biden-impeachment-inquiry-house-vote-california-republicans,"From left, Reps. Michelle Steel (R-Seal Beach), Mike Garcia (R-Santa Clarita) and Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills) are seen in the Cannon tunnel during a vote Nov. 30, 2022.

House Republicans on Wednesday voted to formalize an impeachment inquiry against President Biden, intensifying their investigation into unproven allegations that the president benefited from his son’s overseas business dealings.

The vote is a formality, but it puts the House GOP — including vulnerable California members who face competitive reelection contests next year — on record in support of moving toward impeaching Biden. Then- Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) , egged on by former President Trump and the most far-right members of his caucus, launched the inquiry without a vote in September.

The inquiry has yet to produce evidence that proves the GOP’s long-standing, unproven claim that Biden benefited from his son Hunter’s overseas business dealings.

Politics Speaker McCarthy launches Biden impeachment inquiry without a House vote Bowing to GOP hard-liners’ threats to oust him as speaker, McCarthy orders an impeachment inquiry over Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings before his father was president.

The Constitution does not require the chamber to vote to launch an impeachment inquiry, legal experts told The Times. Still, Republicans have sought to portray formalizing the inquiry as a way to aid investigators.

“Short of declaring war, impeachment is the most serious act Congress can take,” Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove), said in a floor speech before the vote. “We owe it to the country to get to the bottom of these allegations. And that requires the House to objectively invoke its full investigatory powers, respect the due process rights of all involved and lay all of the facts before the American people.”

The 221-212 vote fell strictly along party lines.

Ahead of the floor vote, Rep. Jamie Raskin , the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which is leading the inquiry, decried the investigation, calling it a partisan move that will waste taxpayer dollars to appease the far right.

“After 11 months nobody can tell you what Joe Biden’s alleged crime is, where it happened, what the motive was or who the victims are,” the Maryland Democrat said at a news conference before the vote.

He added: Republicans have a “mountain of evidence, but all the evidence shows that Joe Biden is not guilty of any presidential offenses.”

House Republicans have been calling for Biden’s impeachment since Trump left office in 2021. One day after the president’s inauguration, then-freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed the first impeachment articles against Biden. She and other far-right lawmakers and GOP operatives have tried connecting the president with his son Hunter’s foreign business dealings. Though Hunter Biden is under federal indictment for unrelated crimes, House investigators have not produced evidence to charge the president with malfeasance.

It is unclear when the House inquiry will end or whether it will produce charges the lower chamber will vote on. If the House votes to impeach Biden, the Democratic-controlled Senate will hold a trial, which requires a two-thirds majority to convict. The Senate has never removed a president from office.

Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told reporters after the vote that he “would love to finish [the inquiry] as soon as possible.”

“We have people we need to depose, then we’ll issue a report,” he said, adding that the committee’s goal is not necessarily to impeach Biden but to investigate, issue a report and “pass influence-peddling legislation.”

Some Republicans in both chambers have expressed skepticism about the inquiry . So has the White House, which has been working in overdrive to bash the GOP for what administration officials have characterized as a baseless inquiry designed to appease Trump, who was twice impeached by House Democrats.

President Biden denounced the vote. “Instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be done, [House Republicans] are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt that even Republicans in Congress admit is not supported by facts,” he said in a statement.

In 2019 , the Democratic-controlled House impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstructing Congress’ impeachment inquiry into his threats to with-hold military aid from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky unless Zelensky launched an investigation of Biden, then a candidate for president. The House in 2021 again impeached Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection. (The Senate twice declined to convict.)

Politics House impeaches Trump a second time — with 10 Republicans on board Trump is the only president to be impeached twice, this time on a charge of inciting the Capitol riot — the most bipartisan impeachment ever. Now, the debate shifts to the Senate.

The Wednesday vote will probably aid Republicans in deep red districts in fending off challenges from far-right candidates by helping them prove their loyalty to Trump. The vote is also likely to aid Democratic challengers in competitive districts who are eager to win over moderates by tying GOP incumbents to the former president, who is unpopular among swing voters.

The vote could come back to haunt swing-district Republican candidates. A majority of voters in competitive districts view the investigation as baseless, according to an early December survey commissioned by Congressional Integrity Project, a Democratic-aligned nonprofit, and conducted by Public Policy Polling.

The survey found that 52% of voters saw the impeachment inquiry as designed to damage Biden politically. Most Trump voters — 85% — said the investigation was more about finding the truth. Fifty-six percent of people who declined to back either presidential candidate in 2020 characterized the inquiry as more of a serious effort to investigate important problems.

The Congressional Integrity Project recently launched a “seven-figure campaign” in California and other competitive districts targeting Republicans who backed formalizing the inquiry, according to Matthew Herdman, a spokesman for the nonprofit.

The group purchased digital ads and mobile billboards targeting vulnerable Republicans, including Reps. John Duarte of Modesto, Mike Garcia of Santa Clarita, Young Kim of Anaheim Hills, Michelle Steel of Seal Beach and David Valadao of Hanford. Their races are rated as competitive by the Cook Political Report , a nonpartisan outfit that focuses on congressional races.

On Monday, the Congressional Integrity Project paid for a mobile ad to circle outside Valadao’s Bakersfield field office. It reads: “Call [Valadao]. Tell him enough is enough.”

Digital ads going after candidates such as Garcia say that House Republicans have struggled to “pass a budget or desperately needed aid in Ukraine” and have instead focused on formalizing a “bogus impeachment inquiry into President Biden without a single shred of evidence that the president did anything wrong.”

“Mike Garcia promised to focus on real priorities, not political stunts,” one ad said .

Ben Petersen, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, defended the GOPin a statement. The vote “grants Congress necessary investigative tools to properly conduct its critical oversight role,” Petersen said. “Americans demand a government free from corruption and they are concerned Joe Biden does not meet that standard.”

As part of the inquiry into Biden family members’ business dealings, House investigators subpoenaed Hunter Biden last month to testify Wednesday morning in a private deposition. In advance of the deposition, the younger Biden’s lawyers repeatedly sought to hold the questioning in public, arguing that an open proceeding would prevent selective leaks of his remarks.

Hunter Biden defied the subpoena and instead held a news conference outside the Capitol in which he reiterated his desire for a public hearing and attacked Republicans for “distortions, manipulated evidence and lies.”

“Let me state as clearly as I can: My father was not financially involved in my business — not as a practicing lawyer, not as a board member of Burisma, not in my partnership with a Chinese private businessman, not in my investments at home nor abroad, and certainly not as an artist,” Hunter Biden told reporters as he was flanked by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Dublin) and his defense attorney, Abbe Lowell.

“In the depths of my addiction, I was extremely irresponsible with my finances. But to suggest that is grounds for an impeachment inquiry is beyond the absurd. It’s shameless. There is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business, because it did not happen.”

Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges in Delaware. In the California case, his lawyers have emphasized that their client had long ago paid his tax debts and that his mishandled financial affairs coincided with the depths of his drug and alcohol addiction.

Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, blasted Republicans for escalating the inquiry.

“They can start an impeachment inquiry; doesn’t mean they should, because the evidence isn’t there,” Gomez said in a news conference before the floor vote. “Every time they do that it nips away at the foundation of our democracy. And the public and people lose faith.”"

Lisa Dykes, 60, was found guilty of killing Marisela Botello-Valadez, 23, who went missing in Dallas after a night out in Deep Ellum. Dykes was also sentenced to 20 years for dumping Botello’s body off a country road in southern Dallas County. Her fragmented skeleton was found months later.

The jury deliberated her guilt for less than two hours and returned the sentence within an hour. Dykes will serve the two sentences concurrently, according to a spokeswoman for the Dallas County district attorney’s office. The DA’s office declined to comment further.

Dykes was emotionless as both the verdict and sentence were read aloud. After she was sentenced, her attorney Heath Harris placed his hand on her back and asked, “You all right?” Dykes nodded.

“I hope that you get what you deserve in that prison cell,” Luis Botello-Valadez, Marisela’s younger brother, told Dykes in the sole victim impact statement. “Despite you getting life in prison, me and my parents are going to have to live the rest of our lives going to family get-togethers, holidays, birthdays that my sister will no longer be a part of — all because of you.”

Ernestina Valadez, Luis and Marisela’s mother, began audibly weeping and covered her face as her husband embraced her.

Botello’s family has been in the courtroom gallery throughout the weeklong trial. Botello was described as a trusting, vibrant young woman who loved to travel. She’d booked cheap, spontaneous plane tickets to visit an old friend in Dallas. She spent most of that long weekend in October 2020 sightseeing, eating and drinking, according to testimony.

“I hope you find that you’ve been treated with a much greater amount of dignity and respect than you ever treated Marisela Botello-Valadez,” state District Judge Nancy Mulder told Dykes.

The trial relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and testimony from Charles Beltran, who prosecutors said was in a romantic and sexual relationship with Dykes. Dykes, who took the witness stand Tuesday in her own defense, denied involvement in Botello’s disappearance.

The verdict indicates the 12-person jury believed Beltran’s version of what happened Oct. 5, 2020. During the sentencing phase, jurors were asked to consider whether she killed Botello in a fit of sudden passion.

Outside the courtroom, Harris told reporters Dykes maintains her innocence. He said he has already submitted a notice of appeal in hopes she can get a new trial, adding “maybe another jury will see things differently.”

“Unfortunately for us, the jurors believed Mr. Beltran,” Harris said. “I thought we did a good job of proving that he was lying. They disagreed.”

Harris stressed he doesn’t “quarrel” with the jury’s verdict and that he believes Mulder gave them a “very, very fair trial” but said he doesn’t believe the evidence supports a murder case or a life sentence.

“I have nothing but sympathy for Marisela’s family,” Harris said. “They’ve come a long way, and I hope they feel that they got the justice that they wanted.”

Dykes, her wife, Nina Marano, and Beltran were arrested in 2021 and charged in connection with Botello’s disappearance. Murder charges against Beltran and Marano were dropped mid-trial. Each faces a charge of tampering with evidence, which carries up to 20 years in prison. Those cases are pending, according to court records.

The trio were in a physical and romantic relationship; Dykes supported Beltran financially and invested in his budding rap career, while Beltran gave Dykes companionship, according to prosecutors. When Dykes married Marano, the trio moved into a Mesquite home.

Throughout the trial, prosecutors described Dykes as an obsessive, cunning and controlling lover who was fed up with Beltran pursuing other women.

Dykes, a personal injury paralegal with a knack for negotiating, seemed to undergo a dramatic physical transformation about the time she met Beltran, who is more than two decades her junior. The mother of three adult children ditched her conservative shoulder-length highlighted hair for pixie cuts with colorful dos. She transformed from a suburban mom archetype to a punk hipster, adorning herself with tattoos and edgier clothes, according to testimony.

On the witness stand, Dykes appeared more demure. Her pink short hair captured in a Dallas County jail mugshot has grown out in streaks of gray and was tied back in a ponytail or pushed back by reading glasses during the trial. She seemed meek, and her high-pitched voice was accented with a drawl from Kentucky, where she grew up. Dykes described three failed marriages, her work ethic and “upstanding” life.

Prosecutors said this was a manicured version of Dykes.

“She’s strong. She knows what she’s doing. She’s successful,” assistant district attorney Robin Pittman said in closing arguments Wednesday. “This is not a soft-spoken, weak woman.

“She can change who she is for the circumstance. She wants to control the circumstances. … It was all about control.”

Beltran, who went by “Chuck Gorgeous” or “Chuck 50/50,” told jurors he wooed Botello on a Deep Ellum sidewalk; Botello was bar-hopping alone in the entertainment district. Beltran said they went back to the Mesquite home Oct. 5, had sex and fell asleep.

In the early hours, Beltran testified he awoke to screams of “help me, help me,” and saw Dykes straddling Botello, grasping a knife and making a stabbing motion. He said he pushed Dykes and Botello tumbled off the bed.

“I told you not to bring any more girls over here,” Beltran alleged Dykes said as she attacked Botello. “Why are you disrespecting us? You need to get your little bitch and leave now.”

In shock, Beltran said he went into the bathroom and splashed water on his face. When he went back into his bedroom, he said Dykes was standing over Botello’s lifeless body in a red-stained nightgown. He said blood oozed from Botello’s naked chest, seeping into the carpet.

“What did I do? What did I do?” Beltran recalled Dykes muttering.

He recalled telling Dykes, “You need to figure this s--- out, you told me to leave.” Beltran put on clothes and left. He got an oil change and visited a friend.

Eventually, he returned to the “spotless” Mesquite house. Red and brown streaks — remnants of Botello’s blood — were found in the carpet pad when authorities searched the home

Prosecutors said Marano and Dykes left Botello’s body in Wilmer, 2 miles away from where Dykes once lived. Prosecutors said Botello was discarded like trash. Her skull and a few bones were found in a muddy farmed and wooded field by someone laying traps for feral cats.

Botello’s family grew worried when she missed her return flight. They traced her rideshare receipts and bank activity to pinpoint her last known locations, and there was no activity on her cellphone, bank account or social media accounts.

“She completely fell off the face of the Earth,” relative Dennesly Castillo testified. Castillo and Botello’s father went to Dallas to look for her; they returned with her abandoned suitcase full of clothes. Botello left a backpack — stuffed with a Delta Air Lines napkin, snacks, a book, fake eyelashes and a tourist magnet from Seattle — in her friend’s car.

Police honed in on Beltran as a person of interest early in the case. Harris, the defense attorney, has repeatedly called Beltran an untrustworthy, habitual liar.

“The evidence in this case does not corroborate this last version [Beltran] gave,” Harris said in closing arguments. “Lie after lie after lie.”

Since Botello went missing, Beltran has told conflicting versions of what happened: that he dropped Botello off nearby or that he woke up in the Mesquite home and she was gone or that Marano was also involved in the attack.

The admission that Dykes stabbed Botello came after police insinuated that Marano, a wealthy attorney, and Dykes were going to pin her death on Beltran. Beltran told jurors he feared police would zero in on him as a suspect because of his criminal history.

After the killing, Dykes, Marano and Beltran traveled between Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida and Mexico. Marano and Dykes were arrested separately in Florida, while Beltran was taken into custody in Utah.

Dykes and Marano were released from jail on bail, removed their court-issued ankle monitors and went on the lam to a coastal town in Cambodia. Dykes said they fled to seek asylum. When confronted by Cambodian and U.S. authorities, Dykes brazenly asked, “What jurisdiction do you have here,” prosecutors said.

“She’s been manipulating people for years now, manipulating the system, running, using her knowledge of the legal system — not for good, not to help — to save her own self,” Pittman, the prosecutor, said.

Defense attorneys tried to rebuff Beltran’s testimony and offer alternative theories of what happened to Botello. Harris implied she may have overdosed on drugs. Multiple tipsters reported seeing Botello at seedy Dallas motels after her disappearance. Police spoke to a few people who said they saw her, but body-camera footage of the interviews was improperly saved and deleted.

Harris called the police work “sloppy,” “botched” and “one of the worst homicide investigations in Dallas County history.”

The former lead detective Christine Ramirez, who testified Tuesday, has been accused of mishandling and failing to share evidence with lawyers. A three-day hearing earlier this year revealed Ramirez failed to turn over hundreds of pieces of evidence until just before Marano’s initial trial date. The case exposed Dallas police’s widespread digital storage issues.

“Marisela deserved better than Chuck,” prosecutor Zack Brown told jurors. “Marisela deserved better than any of the nonsense issues about the Dallas Police Department.

“Marisela deserved better than to be a photograph in the Dallas County courthouse … because Lisa Dykes lost control.”"
24,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Taxpayer cost of impeaching Attorney General Ken Paxton tops $4.3 million,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2023/12/13/taxpayer-cost-of-impeaching-attorney-general-ken-paxton-tops-43-million/,"AUSTIN – The taxpayer cost of impeaching Ken Paxton is north of $4.3 million, documents show, breaking a symbolic barrier that likely will be used as political ammo against politicians that supported the effort to unseat the attorney general.

Invoices and receipts released to The Dallas Morning News late Wednesday show more than 24 lawyers worked to prosecute Paxton leading up to and during his two-week long impeachment trial in September. The Senate cleared Paxton of all charges.

Advertisement

Lawyers billed more than 7,800 hours of work related to Paxton’s impeachment, including his prosecution, a related lawsuit and an attorney who assisted Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick in his capacity as judge of the trial, according to documents. Taxpayers will pay for all of it.

Reached late Wednesday, co-lead counsel Dick DeGuerin defended the amount of work, noting that his and co-lead counsel Rusty Hardin’s $500-an-hour rate was far below what they typically charge. Hardin unleashed nearly the full capacity of his Houston law firm on the case, and did not bill for hundreds of hours of work conducted by his staff, according to invoices from his firm.

“Everything we did was justified and I won’t retreat from that statement ever,” DeGuerin said. “We presented strong evidence that Paxton just surrendered the power of his office in a corrupt way. It’s just that his financial supporters threatened retaliation against the Republicans that would have voted for conviction.”

The $4.3 million price tag for impeachment presents the fullest account to date of the cost of impeachment, but likely is not complete. Documents returned to The News via an open records request did not include invoices for at least one attorney involved in Paxton’s prosecution.

However, it tops the $3.3 million proposed in a whistleblower settlement that triggered the impeachment effort. Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Four top deputies in Paxton’s office sued for wrongful termination after they were fired for reporting their former boss to the FBI. Their allegations of how Paxton used the office for the benefit of friend and campaign donor Nate Paul, an Austin real estate developer under federal indictment, formed the backbone of the articles of impeachment.

After Paxton went to the Legislature this year requesting the money be included in the budget for the Office of the Attorney General, members of the House began to question what led to the whistleblowers’ firing.

Advertisement

The House General Investigating Committee secretly opened an investigation into Paxton that culminated in 20 articles of impeachment that the House approved overwhelmingly on May 27. Documents show the committee spent roughly $310,000 on the lawyers who investigated Paxton.

Advertisement

The House members who managed Paxton’s impeachment prosecution then hired DeGuerin and Hardin, legendary Houston lawyers, to lead the prosecution. Their work includes representing professional athletes, Enron, David Koresh and Tom DeLay.

Hardin used at least 20 employees of his firm and billed $3 million. DeGuerin and another attorney in his firm billed about $380,000.

“The amount of our fees are a drop in the bucket compared to the loss of money and integrity caused by the misconduct of Paxton,” Hardin said. “The jury verdict the whistleblowers will ultimately recover in their law suits will far exceed any money the House spent on the Impeachment effort.”

Advertisement

Following the verdict, Patrick called for an audit of the impeachment process, criticizing the effort. At Patrick’s request, the State Auditor’s Office recently launched an audit of the process, according to The Texas Newsroom.

Paxton, now back in office, is working to unseat several House members who voted for his impeachment.

Staff for House Rep. Andrew Murr, the Junction Republican who chaired the House committee that investigated Paxton and the managers who prosecuted the attorney general, did not respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday. Murr recently announced he is not seeking re-election.

Despite the outcome, DeGuerin said he had no regrets.

The verdict, he said, “was not a decision based on conscience or evidence. It was based on fear.”

Of the effort, Deguerin said, “It was worth it.”

This is a developing story."

Nearly all will be filled by the same people after the next election.

Of 35 incumbents seeking reelection, 16 drew no challenger in the March 5 primary. Five of them drew no opponent from the other party, either, so they’re already assured reelection before a single ballot is cast.

Three other incumbents face a contest only in the primary. Scandal-free incumbents nearly always get renominated. So they’re also likely to return to Congress in January 2025.

Once they nab the nomination, victory is all but assured because districts are drawn to heavily favor one party or the other.

In Laredo, Rep. Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, escaped a primary challenge. Progressives gunned hard for him the last two elections, pouring millions into failed efforts to push him out. He’s unlikely to struggle in November.

The only incumbent with a real race on his hands is Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district “lean Democrat,” a step up from toss-up. But Republican Mayra Flores has run aggressively for months. She won a special election and served in Congress for a few months in 2022 in a different district before losing to Gonzalez that November.

Voters will see lots of action in the next three months in a trio of North Texas districts where retirements set off stampedes for a rare open seat.

Gill moved to the district only a year ago. He jump-started the campaign with $250,000 of his own money.

Scott Armey, a former Denton County judge and now an investment adviser, also is seeking the seat.

His roots in the district go back decades: His father Dick Armey, is the former House majority leader and godfather of the tea party. He held the seat before Burgess. Scott Armey tried to succeed his father in 2002 but lost to Burgess in a primary runoff.

Armey’s focus on fiscal restraint stands in sharp contrast to Gill’s positioning as a partisan warrior.

Other candidates include Southlake Mayor John Huffman and Doug Robison, who stepped down as a state district judge to seek the seat.

Council, while fractured on the issue itself, agreed 8-7 to defer the vote, saying there was not enough community input.

Council member Adam Bazaldua, who chairs the Quality of Life Committee that passed the changes ahead of the full council vote, told The Dallas Morning News that he is irritated by what he calls, “delay tactics.”

“Their attempt here is to now rally troops and get a bunch of opposition to show up,” he said.

The development code amendments would remove the special use permit requirement for these facilities to operate in residential neighborhoods.

Council member Chad West said after a year of public meetings on the issue that he isn’t sure what more community discussion is needed. He also pointed to a constituent survey that found that 49% of respondents are unhappy or very unhappy with the availability of affordable and available child care.

Advertisement

“It’s very difficult to find quality daycare services and also longer term care services for seniors who need it,” he told The News after Wednesday’s City Council briefing. “It’s a shame that we are making it even more complicated. By adding additional requirements on top of the state.”

Much of the opposition was to delay for a larger conversation rather than substantial criticisms of the legislation, but Bazaldua doesn’t see why that wait is necessary when child care in Dallas is costly and hard to find.

“It’s unfortunate for us to have such a difficult time to pass logical and equitable policy in the city,” he said. “The more we continue to cater to nimbyism, which is what we heard as the opposition today, then we’re going to keep our city from moving forward.”

While frustrated with the wait, Bazaldua said he thinks the legislation will ultimately pass.

27,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,What do hotel guests really want in 2024? You might be surprised by the answer,https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/travel/2023/12/13/what-do-hotel-guests-really-want-in-2024-you-might-be-surprised-by-the-answer/,"Are you ready for the latest hotel gimmick? It’s giving you what you want. I know, it’s revolutionary.

But that’s the surprising discovery Eric Stone recently made when he booked a room at a Holiday Inn property in Las Vegas. It promoted daily cleaning and no resort fees — two things Stone says every hotel should have, anyway.

Advertisement

“I couldn’t believe it,” Stone says sarcastically.

Advertisement

The idea that price transparency or daily room cleaning is worth promoting shows how far the hotel industry has drifted from what should be the norm. It comes at a time when the government is fighting junk fees with a proposed rule that would effectively ban resort fees in the U.S.

And in a business with near record-high rates, guests love the simple idea that hotels would give them what they want. It’s far better than giving them what they don’t want, which is a troubling trend I identified a few weeks ago.

“Travelers have sent a clear message,” says Konrad Waliszewski, a lodging industry trendwatcher who runs a hotel reservation site. “No more accepting less for more.”

Advertisement

Result: More hotels are advertising the fact that they have no resort fees. Others are advertising “free” breakfast or daily housekeeping. That can make booking a hotel confusing, since travelers might wonder what is — and isn’t — included in the price of their room. Or what should be. (Don’t worry, I’ll have the correct answer in a minute.)

The latest come-on: No resort fees!

Resort fees are mandatory daily surcharges added to your bill for amenities such as pool towels, use of the hotel gym and “free” internet. Often, hotels don’t reveal these charges until you’re on the last screen of your reservation, by which time you’ve already made the decision to book.

Advertisement

Over the last two decades, many hotels — not just resorts — have added these fees, which range from $20 a day to, in extreme cases, over $100.

Advertisement

But now, in an effort to distinguish themselves from the crowd, some properties are advertising that they don’t have resort fees.

Alex Beene, a community coordinator from Nashville, recently booked a hotel room in California for a convention.

“I was stunned to see many hotels advertising no resort fees,” he recalls. “That’s very attractive because some hotels in places like San Diego and Los Angeles charge up to $50 extra in fees for benefits I never really use.”

Advertisement

Hotels say “no resort fees” promotions have led to higher bookings. For example, Crane’s Beach House, a boutique hotel in Delray Beach, Fla., started last to heavily advertise that it doesn’t have any resort fees.

“When we looked at our market here in Delray Beach, we noticed virtually every competitor charged a resort fee, not to mention other fees like parking or valet, internet, even additional towels,” says hotel spokeswoman Carli Brinkman. Having no fees set it apart and also offered a better guest experience, she says. And the hotel is on track to have its best year on record, thanks in part to the absence of resort fees.

“Free” breakfast for hotel guests?

Another heavily advertised amenity is “free” breakfast. And I’m putting “free” in quotes because it’s not really free if you’re paying for your room — it’s included in the price of your room. (If it were truly free, I could walk into the hotel and enjoy breakfast without paying for it, which is not the case.)

Advertisement

I’m currently living in Los Angeles, and near me, several hotels, including the Embassy Suites and Best Western, advertise “free breakfast.” In fact, several hotel chains — most of them budget hotels — include breakfast with their stays.

The concept of a hotel that offers its guests breakfast at no additional charge dates back hundreds of years. In fact, it may be one of the basic tenets of good hospitality. In the rest of the world, it would be unimaginable to not include a breakfast as part of your stay.

“Huge irony,” says Adrian Mooney, director of sales at Kilkea Castle, a resort and golf club in Ireland. “European hotels have been promoting free breakfast forever. We don’t draw huge attention to this as it is a given in Europe, but since the American clients do not know this, we make sure that it is noted and included. Travelers don’t want surprises at the end of the trip.”

The “free” breakfast trend is unlikely to stick. Instead, hotels may offer special packages that include breakfast to entice travelers to book. But apart from the discount chain hotels that currently offer “free” breakfast, this hospitality trend is on shaky ground.

Daily housekeeping included

Some hotels are also touting “free” daily cleaning — there’s that word again. But like the other advertised services, this one should never be a selling point. Guests should be able to take it for granted. This issue appears to be limited to U.S. hotels, which are struggling with higher post-pandemic labor costs and are under more pressure to turn a profit.

Stone, a retired nonprofit executive from Los Gatos, Calif., says he was mildly annoyed because the Holiday Inn in Las Vegas didn’t clean his room every day. Instead, it offered a “daily refresh” of his room.

What’s a daily refresh? According to Holiday Inn parent company IHG Hotels & Resorts, it’s a “lighter-touch housekeeping service” that removes trash and replaces towels and other amenities. Other hotel chains have similar policies.

Advertisement

Some cities are having none of it. In Los Angeles, the city council passed the Workplace Security, Workload, Wage and Retention Measures for Hotel Workers in 2022, requiring daily housekeeping at most hotels.

This fall, Hilton also bucked the trend when it started offering automatic daily housekeeping at some of its luxury and full-service properties, including Embassy Suites.

Skipping daily housekeeping is a disgusting way for hotels to save money, and guests won’t stand for it anymore when they’re paying record-high room rates. But for now, it’s an opportunity for some clever hotels to differentiate themselves from the competition — and they are.

So where’s all this headed?

Advertisement

If the government succeeds in eliminating junk fees, then hotels won’t be able to advertise “no resort fees,” because they’ll be illegal. Daily housekeeping will soon become a standard in the U.S. again, as it already is in the rest of the civilized world. But if you want breakfast included, you’ll have to travel abroad.

The most forward-looking hotels are already focusing on offering the services guests expect and telling the truth about their prices, according to hospitality consultant Steve Turk.

“This shift is in direct response to what guests want,” he says.

But until that happens, he advises paying attention to the total room rate and all the amenities that are included in your room — and especially the ones that are not included.

Elliott’s tips for getting what you want from a hotel

Resort fees and every-other-day housekeeping are still a problem for hotel guests in late 2023. Here’s how to get what you want:

Bring your own breakfast. I live in hotels, and I can tell you that even the best hotel breakfasts leave a lot to be desired. Chances are, you have a favorite breakfast cereal or fruit item. My advice? Bring it with you.

Skip hotels that charge mandatory resort fees. Don’t reward a hotel with your business if it forces you to pay a surcharge on top of your room rate. Instead, book a hotel that gives you an honest, all-in rate. If you don’t have a choice, then try to negotiate the removal of the mandatory fee before you click the “book” button. Remember, resort fees are an endangered species, and hotels that charge them know their days are numbered.

Advertisement

Sign up for daily housekeeping. Some hotels require guests to opt in to daily housekeeping. (A receptionist will ask you about it when you check in.) Always say “yes,” even if you think you won’t need it. Hotel rooms can clutter up quickly. If someone doesn’t clean your room, let the front desk know.

28,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Judge finds Farmers Branch officer not guilty in 2019 fatal shooting of man in stolen car,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2023/12/13/farmers-branch-officer-not-guilty-juan-moreno-shooting/,"A judge on Wednesday found a Farmers Branch police officer not guilty of murder in the 2019 shooting death of a 35-year-old man who was killed as he drove a stolen white pickup.

Officer Michael Dunn, 47, was indicted in 2019 by a Dallas County grand jury on a murder charge in connection with the killing of Juan “Johnny” Moreno Jr. He took the stand in his own defense on the third and final day of the trial Wednesday, testifying he feared for his life and believed Moreno wanted to kill him with the truck.

Dunn declined to comment after the verdict. His trial was before visiting Judge Mike Snipes instead of a jury. Dunn has been on administrative leave for more than four years. A conviction could have brought up to life in prison.

After Snipes read the verdict, several people near Dunn let out sighs of relief, and moments later loved ones and supporters hugged him outside the courtroom. Members of Moreno’s family, who declined to speak with reporters during the trial, leaned forward as they listened to the verdict. They later left the courthouse in silence.

One of Dunns’ attorneys, Dan Hagood, said after the verdict that prosecutors had asked for the trial to be heard by a judge instead of a jury and that the defense agreed because both sides had confidence in Snipes, a former state district judge, defense attorney and prosecutor.

Advertisement

Hagood said Dunn has been filled with stress, anxiety and worry for years, but Farmers Branch “stood 100% behind Officer Dunn.” He said Dunn might be the first officer in the U.S. who wasn’t fired after being indicted on a murder charge.

“It’s been an awful, awful ordeal for Officer Dunn,” Hagood said.

Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot said in a written statement that his team worked diligently on the case and presented all of the evidence it had.

“We will respect the judge’s decision just as we would a jury,” he said.

(Brian Elledge/The Dallas Morning News) (Brian Elledge / Staff Photographer)

A central question in the case was whether Dunn reasonably feared for his life when he fatally shot Moreno on June 12, 2019. Dunn’s attorneys argued he made a split-second decision because he believed he was in imminent danger. Prosecutors said Moreno did not pose a threat to Dunn.

Farmers Branch police Chief Kevin McCoy, who was in the courtroom Wednesday, said in a written statement after the verdict that he wanted to extend condolences to Moreno’s family. He said Dunn will need to go through an internal investigation and will remain on administrative leave until it’s concluded.

“The purpose in this and every investigation conducted by the Farmers Branch Police Department is to act with integrity and transparency in our constant effort to maintain the trust of the public we serve,” McCoy said.

Farmers Branch police surveilled Moreno for hours before the shooting as he drove a stolen white pickup. Moreno, whom Dunn and other officers had encountered in the past, pulled into a northwest Dallas shopping center and went into a dimly lit game room followed by an undercover officer. He then left and got back inside the truck.

Surveillance footage shows Dunn approach the truck in a marked police car, then exit his vehicle. Moreno makes a wide left turn to pull the truck out of a parking space. Video shows black plumes emanating from the truck’s exhaust as it revs. Dunn fires at Moreno three times as the truck, initially perpendicular to Dunn, moves in an arc around the officer and crashes into other parked vehicles.

In closing arguments, Hagood said Moreno, who was “hopped up on meth,” escalated the situation. Hagood paused and appeared to choke up as he described Dunn as a man of integrity. The evidence, he said, scientifically proved Dunn had reason to fear Moreno might have been about to hurt or kill him or others with the truck.

“We have to put ourselves in the shoes of Officer Dunn,” Hagood said.

Prosecutor Mischeka Nicholson said the case was about the actions and decisions Dunn made, not his character. She said there was no way the truck Moreno drove could have come into contact with Dunn, adding she believes the third and final shot Dunn fired is the one that killed Moreno, who was already past Dunn when the shot was fired. The defense argued Moreno was killed by the initial gunshot.

“We don’t know what was going through Johnny Moreno’s mind because he’s not here to tell us that,” Nicholson said.

Before he read his verdict, Snipes said shooting into a moving vehicle is rarely justified.

Snipes previously was lead prosecutor in the criminal case against Roy Oliver, the Balch Springs police officer sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering 15-year-old Jordan Edwards in 2017. Oliver was firing into a car driving away from him when he killed Jordan. His 2018 conviction made him the first on-duty police officer in Texas to be found guilty of murder in 45 years.

Snipes said Wednesday he doesn’t think the truck was headed straight at Dunn but that he believes the officer perceived he could be run over, a view that was backed up by the testimony of other officers present when the shooting occurred.

He said after reviewing both sides and the available videos, he couldn’t conclude prosecutors proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Dunn did not act in self-defense.

‘I was in imminent danger’

Dunn, dressed in a white shirt, light blue tie and black suit jacket, appeared calm on the witness stand. He told the judge he encountered Moreno about a week before the shooting. Moreno was arrested by a fellow officer on a charge of possession of burglary tools. That Farmers Branch officer testified that Moreno told her he wasn’t going to be caught next time — a warning, she said, she told Dunn and other officers.

A day after the arrest, Dunn said, Moreno had a stomachache and was coming down off meth, so Dunn escorted him to a medical center. Dunn said he spoke with Moreno about the dangers of addiction and told him stealing trucks wasn’t a good career. He said it was like “fatherly advice.”

Days later as police tracked Moreno in the stolen vehicle, Dunn said he volunteered to help with the arrest.

He approached Moreno, who he said looked directly at him and his expression was “very angry,” Dunn recalled. Moreno pushed a female passenger out of the truck and cranked the vehicle “hard to the left” toward Dunn, the officer testified.

Dunn said everything seemed to occur within fractions of a second. He said his back was almost to his patrol car and he took on a stance to defend himself as the truck hurtled forward. He yelled at Moreno to stop, and Moreno appeared to yell something from the driver’s seat of the truck, Dunn said.

”There was no doubt in my mind,” Dunn said. “I was in imminent danger, and so was everybody else around me.”

While Dunn insisted he was “directly in the path of Mr. Moreno,” prosecutors paused the surveillance footage around the moment he fired a third time at Moreno. At that point, Dunn appeared to be lined up with the back of the truck, and Moreno was past him in the driver’s seat.

Pressed by prosecutors on why he didn’t have on his body-worn camera, Dunn said it was “just a mistake.”

Moreno’s father watched Dunn with his head slightly cocked in the back of the courtroom. People packed in the front rows of the gallery, including Moreno’s loved ones and officers from Farmers Branch, Dallas and Carrollton.

Officers, experts testify

Experts analyzed different angles of surveillance footage frame by frame, computing the speed of the truck and the distance between the vehicle and Dunn when the shots were fired.

Dallas police Det. Cayce Shelton, who assisted the lead investigator in the case, testified he was told by his command staff to hand over the case file to prosecutors within about a week of the shooting. He said detectives worked “tirelessly” and recreated what occurred.

He said the wheels of Moreno’s truck began to straighten, turned away from Dunn. He characterized Dunn’s position as a shooting stance, repeating that Moreno was not in a position to harm Dunn.

A key witness brought by the defense was Ronald Lee Martinelli, a former officer and expert in exercise physiology and police practices. Martinelli told the judge that action is always faster than reaction. With his body processing everything at the same time, his ability to orient himself slowed, Martinelli testified, adding that Dunn made a decision in about .57 seconds.

”I didn’t see a single policy violation” related to use of force, Martinelli said.

Attorney Toby Shook, who represented Dunn along with Hagood, said after the verdict the expert testimony about how people perceive things under stress was critical.

“It’s one thing to see it on video, but you have scientific evidence of how these things happen,” Shook said. “They’re all different angles, and none of them were at the angle that Officer Dunn saw. It’s a life and death decision made in literally just a couple of seconds.”

The megachurch bought an old Dallas ISD school – Pearl C. Anderson Middle Learning Center – in 2019 in hopes to expand into South Dallas, but there has been much frustration from residents who say they were left out of the conversation.

Council member for this area of Dallas, Adam Bazaldua, proposed denying Watermark the rezoning it needs to carry out plans to build a church campus on the property at 3400 Garden Lane.

“There’s been way too much gray area,” he said in the Wednesday meeting. “There’s been way too many questions unanswered….I would say that there were several red flags that were brought up in the process.”

Watermark’s request asks to allow a portion of its property to be rezoned as a walkable mixed-use district, in order to provide “additional services,” according to the city agenda legislation. It is unclear what “services” the church intends to add.

In its rezoning proposal, Watermark said the proposed rezoning district “would allow office, medical and limited retail uses to allow for training, a medical clinic, and a possible grocery store.”

Watermark’s South Dallas campus pastor Marvin Walker told The Dallas Morning News that he did not want to comment on the rezoning process, but said the church is going to be in the neighborhood for the long haul.

“We’re just grateful to be a part of the South Dallas community and really do look forward to partnering with the community members and other local organizations for years to come,” Walker said.

While staff recommended approving the rezoning, Council disagreed.

Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Carolyn King Arnold said from the beginning she had concerns that the megachurch would come in and gentrify the neighborhood without community input.

“I’m still puzzled and troubled by the fact that we would have this blatant footstep moving into our communities in such a way that is distasteful,” she said. “As stated, you can’t come into communities with this whole imperialistic mindset, building your empire, and disrespecting the people.”

Council member Omar Narvaez said he wants to “hit the reset button,” so the community gets what it needs from Watermark.

“Actually what the vast majority of community members and black and brown neighborhoods believe is that you don’t want to get to know us and you want to shove something into our communities without making us a partner,” Narvaez said. “They don’t need saving. They need partners to bring into the communities what they need.”

Some residents told Council they feel the nondenominational church has not been honest with the community.

Todd Atkins, who represented the South Dallas Fair Park Faith Coalition, said locals have not gotten clear answers on the vision or goal of Watermark’s campus in their neighborhood.

“We remain unclear which Watermark entity we should be engaging: Watermark South Dallas LLC, Watermark CDC, Watermark Community Church,” he told the council. “This lack of a clear partner makes it difficult to determine who the decision makers are, and who has all the information regarding Watermark’s desired uses of this property.”

Michael Sneed said he was a Watermark parishioner and he loves the services, but he doesn’t think the church is ready for this rezoning or willing to work with South Dallas.

“We don’t need you to call us over to the church for a dinner. We need you to come up with a strategy to make something better, to help us get the homeless off the street, to help us do something for the kids. That’s what we need. We need a change in South,” he told the council. “Nobody in my neighborhood trusts them.”

The church was the sole bidder on the school, buying the 9-acre property for $211,111.10.

Residents called the school a “legacy” and “historic” in a January community meeting to discuss the property and its rezone. They shared that the middle school was the only option in the area for 50 years, and it served as a cornerstone of childhood memories for those who grew up in South Dallas.

Walker apologized to residents and asked for forgiveness at the community meeting, saying he wants to build trust with the locals and listen.

Some residents shared that Watermark’s presence has been a good thing for the old DISD school, where it had become a blighted property with an unkempt lawn and litter. The church has since cleaned up the property, and residents say they have offered free meals and afterschool programs for kids.

Bazaldua said in the council meeting that he encourages Watermark to go back to the community to have a conversation about the future of the property.

“I am encouraging the applicant to get back to the drawing board and to do what it takes to earn that trust,” he said. “So that ultimately, an approval is something that everyone can be excited about. That’s not the case now.”"

Ijeoma Okoro, 33, of Aubrey was among the people accused in the scheme. On Thursday, a jury found her guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the attorney’s office.

In September 2021, the attorney’s office said authorities arrested 11 people in connection with the scam, which focused on the elderly. Between 2015 and 2020, the 11 arrested took tens of thousands of dollars from victims, the U.S. attorney’s office had said. Most of the accused were arrested in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the office said, according to the attorney’s office.

Authorities described the scams as “romance schemes” in which suspects allegedly used fake names to lure victims through dating websites and mobile apps.

Investigators believe many of the people arrested in connection with the schemes were tied to a transnational organized crime syndicate, the attorney’s office had said.

“[Okoro] now faces up to 20 years in federal prison on the wire fraud conspiracy count, up to 10 years in federal prison on the money laundering conspiracy count, and an order to repay the victims the losses that she and her coconspirators caused the victims,” the attorney’s office said in a Friday news release.

Aubrey is a Denton County city about 50 miles north of downtown Dallas.

At least three others who were arrested in 2021 — Emanuel Stanley Orji, Frederick Orji and Oluwalobamise Michael Moses — have pleaded guilty to similar charges in connection with romance scams, according to online court records.

Emanuel Stanley Orji and Frederick Orji has each been sentenced to 37 months in prison and Moses was sentenced Monday to two years, records showed.

Nearly two dozen more people had been charged in a related indictment in the Eastern District of Texas, authorities had said.

Okoro’s sentencing has been scheduled for March 18, court records showed.

“I do believe there were some issues that came out at trial that might play into the sentencing,” said Trey Bunch, Okoro’s attorney."

The prominent megachurch has produced the “The Gift of Christmas” for over 25 years, and received online backlash last year after footage of the show’s flying performers went viral. This year, the show’s 100-minute production, which ran from Dec. 1-3 and 6-10, was similarly lavish, with a nearly 1,000-member cast and choir, live camels, giant bedazzled costumes and acrobatic dance numbers.

One TikTok clip of this year’s production showed airborne dancers and drummers performing to “The Greatest Show” from The Greatest Showman and has received 9.9 million TikTok views as of Wednesday. “When you’re new to Texas and didn’t realize just how hard Texas mega churches go at Christmastime,” poster Lawson Martin, whose handle is @lawsonmaee, wrote over clips of the show.

Other TikTok videos of the church’s production highlighted a dance number set to Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” and performers in angel costumes flying through the air, suspended by cables.

A Reddit post Tuesday linking to a San Antonio Express-News article on this year’s show has received around 300 comments, with some criticizing the Plano church with quotes from the Bible.

“Lot of camels getting through needle eyes these days,” one wrote, in apparent reference to a quote from Jesus that appears in several gospels, including Mark 10:25, which says, “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”

Responding to criticism of its Christmas program, Prestonwood Baptist sent a statement to San Antonio Express-News published Tuesday. “The Gift of Christmas is a ticketed Christian production, not a church service, and a long beloved Christian tradition celebrated by the many hundreds-of-thousands in our community and surrounding states who have attended for more than 25 years. Prestonwood Baptist Church is not ashamed to pull out all the stops in celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ during the Christmas season,” the statement read.

“At Prestonwood, we believe Jesus deserves our absolute best, especially during Christmas. It’s unfortunate that the perennial American tradition of the church Christmas program now draws criticism. We pray that they, too, may come to know the joy of Christmas and the love of our Savior.”

Prestonwood is one of the largest and most influential Southern Baptist churches in the United States, with a membership of nearly 50,000 across three campuses in Plano, Prosper and Lewisville. Its congregation has included a number of leaders in Texas politics, such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Rep. Matt Shaheen and Rep. Jeff Leach, both R-Plano.

Last year, a third-party investigation into sex abuse at Southern Baptist churches found church leaders suppressed reports of sexual abuse for two decades. The report said Prestonwood and its longtime lead pastor, Jack Graham, helped protect an alleged abuser from criminal charges in 1989.

The church vehemently denied the report’s characterization of the incident.

Sheila Colter, a shift supervisor at Med Center Health Environmental Services in Bowling Green, purchased Kentucky Lottery scratch-offs as presents for her employees at their annual holiday party.

She said she had ordered other items to gift the staffers but they didn’t arrive in time, so she got scratch-offs instead — a change of plans that ended up paying out big time.

“Our work Christmas party was early this year. I had ordered some items online, but they didn’t come in before the party,” Colter said. “So, I decided to get Scratch-offs instead.”

The $30 tickets she bought for the team to share won them $50 so she used the cash to buy a $50 Millionaire Club Scratch-Off.

They then doubled their money, winning $100 from that ticket. But Colter didn’t stop there.

“We kept playing as a group. There are 21 of us,” Colter said. “I would stop on the way to work, and we kept winning.”

She bought two more tickets with the $100 and one of them ended up winning the team the game’s second-place prize of $50,000, according to the Kentucky Lottery.

“We were all so excited. I was on the floor,” Colter said of their big win.

Colter and an employee Winnie Beckman went to the lottery headquarters to collect their prize. After taxes, they left with a check for $35,750, the Kentucky Lottery said in a Tuesday press release.

Each employee will take home about $1,750 from the winnings, split 21 ways.

Colter said she plans to use her portion to finish her holiday shopping.

Beckman, meanwhile, is putting the money towards care for her mother, who was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.

“I’m going to use it for my mom’s medicine,” she said. “This will help a lot. And I will never forget this.”

The store where Colter bought the winning ticket, IGA Express on US 31 West Bypass in Bowling Green, will also receive $500 from the Kentucky Lottery.

“It means a lot. This is going to help a lot of people,” Colter said."
34,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Ex-Obama advisor David Axelrod warns that Biden’s approval rating doesn’t bode well for campaign,https://nypost.com/2023/12/14/news/ex-obama-advisor-david-axelrod-warns-that-bidens-approval-rating-doesnt-bode-well-for-campaign/,"One of former President Barack Obama’s top political advisers warned Wednesday that President Biden’s record low approval rating is “very, very dark” news for his re-election campaign.

David Axelrod, Obama’s top campaign guru, referenced a recent Wall Street Journal poll on his “Hacks on Tap” podcast that shows only 37% of voters approving of the 81-year-old president’s job in the Oval Office, with 61% holding an unfavorable view of the incumbent.

The same poll has former President Donald Trump leading Biden by four points in a head-to-head matchup, and by six points with independent candidates in the mix.

“Job approval down, ratings generally down, most of the comparatives with Trump not good,” Axelrod told his co-hosts, political consultant Mike Murphy and former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. “What I worry about, you guys, from a Biden standpoint, is these are the kinds of things you get when people are starting to rationalize their votes.”

“And they just put out another photo op with the ‘Bidenomics’ sign next to him … it’s just unbelievable to me,” he added, referencing the White House’s insistence on promoting Biden’s economic agenda despite poll after poll showing Americans are dissatisfied with the president’s handling of the economy.

Two-thirds of voters said they believed the economy was poor or not good and that it had gotten worse in the last two years, according to the Wall Street Journal poll released Saturday.

On major issues including the economy, crime, inflation, border security, and Israel-Hamas, voters said they trusted Trump more than Biden.

The president received higher marks on abortion and “tone in politics.”

Axelrod noted that Biden isn’t doing “quite that bad” in private polling that he’s seen, “but it’s bad.”

Gibbs argued the Biden campaign needs to start “playing campaign in a far more concerted way” if it wants to start making up ground against Trump.

Similarly, Axelrod said he believes the Biden campaign is “way behind.”

Last month, the former Obama adviser pegged Biden’s chances of winning the 2024 presidential election at “no better” than 50-50.

“I think he has a 50-50 shot here, but no better than that, maybe a little worse,” Axelrod told New York Times Columnist Maureen Dowd."

The driver, 40-year-old Deon Smith, told Scripss New Richmond she was completing a delivery at an apartment complex along the 400 block of Westover Hills Boulevard when she was approached by an 18-year-old man and an 11-year-old boy.

Smith said she initially thought they were asking for money, “but little did I know he was pointing a gun at me asking for my keys.”

“When he told me that he was going to shoot me I was like, ‘Are you serious? You want to kill somebody at your age,’” Smith said, recalling the encounter.

The two suspects demanded Smith’s keys and fled the scene in her car.

Officers responded to the scene on a report of a robbery.

Smith’s vehicle was later found in Henrico County, crashed in a rural area and burned. Both juveniles were transferred to medical hospitals with injuries not considered life-threatening.

Police identified the 18-year-old as Jahlia Henley.

He and the 11-year-old have been charged with robbery, police said.

Maye Musk, 75, whined that it was inexplicable how the FCC determined her son’s company had “failed to demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service.”

“I am the mother of @elonmusk His goal is to make this world a better place. @POTUS wants to stop him. Have you any idea how furious I am?” Maye Musk wrote on X, one of many companies overseen by her son.

“People in other countries are proud of Elon and do not understand the US President’s motive. Please tell me how I should answer them.”

The model attached her criticism to a tweet by FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who accused his agency of joining a “growing list of federal agencies engaging in the regulatory harassment of Elon Musk.”

Carr was one of two Republican commissioners on the five-member FCC who dissented from reaffirming its 2022 decision to deny SpaceX satellite internet unit Starlink $885.5 million in rural broadband subsidies.

The FCC had rescinded the funding in August 2022 based on speed-test data after Starlink had agreed to provide high-speed internet service to 642,000 rural homes and businesses in 35 states.

He suggested that the FCC, led by Democrat-appointed chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, made the ruling based on the Biden administration’s anger toward Elon Musk.

Elon Musk has frequently clashed with the Biden administration since the president took office in 2020. The billionaire has referred to Biden as a “damp sock puppet” and accused the president of snubbing Tesla despite its leading role in the development of electric vehicles – a technology the administration supports.

The world’s richest man reiterated Carr and his mother’s claims, writing on X that the White House was “changing the rules to prevent SpaceX from competing.”

The angry tweet was not the first time Maye Musk rushed to her son’s defense in the face of adversity.

She vehemently accused the New York Times of penning a “hit piece: in May 2022 that suggested her son was “detached from apartheid’s atrocities” and “surrounded by anti-Black propaganda” while growing up in South Africa.

37,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Senate passes record-breaking $886 billion defense policy bill,https://nypost.com/2023/12/13/news/senate-passes-886-billion-defense-policy-bill/,"The Senate authorized a record $886 billion in military spending for 2024 after passing the annual National Defense Authorization Act on Wednesday.

The 3,000-page must-pass bill received strong bipartisan support in the upper chamber, clearing the Senate in a 87-13 vote.

It now heads to the House, which is expected to take it up before lawmakers head home for the holidays on Thursday.

The Democrat-controlled Senate side-stepped social issues important to conservative lawmakers, declining to include provisions limiting abortion access and restricting transgender healthcare treatment for troops and their families which were in the House version of the legislation that passed earlier this year.

A Pentagon policy that reimburses out-of-state travel for service members who receive abortions was the impetus behind Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s (R-Ala.) 10-month-long protest where he blocked all military promotions over the policy.

3 Senators didn’t include House-passed provisions restricting abortion access and transgender medical care. C-SPAN

The legislation extends Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act until April 19.

The surveillance authority, which allows for warrantless monitoring of foreigners in the United States, was set to expire at the end of December.

The bill also provides the largest raise for service members in more than two decades, boosting troop pay by 5.2% next year in an effort to increase military recruitment and retention.

3 The bill includes a 5.2% raise in basic troop pay. AP

The 2024 NDAA, which sets the Pentagon’s spending priorities for the fiscal year, also calls for $11.5 billion to pushback against China in the Indo-Pacific and $800 million in military aid for Ukraine.

“At a time of huge trouble for global security, doing the defense authorization bill is more important than ever,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the floor ahead of the vote.

“Passing the NDAA enables us to hold the line against Russia, stand firm against the Chinese Communist Party and ensure America’s defenses remain state of the art at all times.”

3 The legislation includes funding to deter China in the Indo-Pacific and money for Ukraine. AP

President Biden has asked Congress to approve an additional $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine before the end of the week.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have signaled that the 81-year-old president’s emergency funding request for the war-torn country is unlikely to pass any time soon amid GOP demands that changes to the US immigration law be included in the Ukraine-aid bill.

The NDAA bill also includes the authorizations needed to implement the trilateral AUKUS submarine-sharing agreement between the US, Australia and the United Kingdom.

The agreement was made back in 2021 and called for the transfer of three US Virginia-class attack submarines to Australia.

“It will focus the Pentagon more squarely on tackling national security challenges instead of creating new ones with partisan social policies,” Senate Minority Leader Mtch McConnell said of the legislation.

Six Republicans and six Democrats voted against passing the bill, including Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also voted against the legislation."

“F–k off, f–k off, f–k off … F–k you, Chris,” Baylen Dupree, a 21-year-old who uses her channel to raise awareness of the neurological disorder, said throughout the interview.

The typically straight-faced host of NewsNation’s “Cuomo” broke into smiles several times during the four-minute chat, but retained some sense of professionalism as he listened to Dupree — who boasts 9 million followers — spout a barrage of involuntary profanities while explaining her daily struggles with the relentless tics.

He broke down into hysterics, however, and was forced to hide his laughter behind his hands when the social media star spent several seconds experiencing heavy tics that forced her to squint her face and wave her hands as she cursed.

“Go f–k yourself, Chris! Little baby weiner, Banana up your a–! Butter your own biscuit, fat a–!” Dupree said.

3 The typically straight-faced Cuomo broke into smiles several times during the four-minute chat.

Without allowing the tics to slow her down, Dupree jumped right back into the conversation and shared how she receives comments from “evil people” who tell her that her parents “deserved to die in a car accident because I’m faking my condition.”

Cuomo fumbled to straighten back up and plastered a serious look on his face as he listened to the college freshman share how dangerous her life has become since reaching online fame.

“I’ve had to have the police out my house because people gave out my location and said they’re gonna come torch my house. It’s crazy,” Dupree said as Cuomo solemnly shook his head in disapproval.

Tourettes Syndrome affects as many as 1.4 million children and adults across the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dupree was officially diagnosed with the disorder in 2018, though she had been exhibiting signs since her childhood. Her symptoms worsened during the pandemic.

Tics can become worsened due to high-stress or -anxiety situations — such as appearing on a national news program.

In a pre-interview segment, the anchor admitted he was initially one of many who believed she was a “great comedic actor” who had been faking her disorder for attention.

He claims his opinion has since been changed and that he purposely aired the interview without censors to exhibit her “bravery.”

“She says some pretty ugly stuff unintentionally,” Cuomo said through giggling. “And I’m laughing because I get what it’s about. And that’s why I don’t care. It’s not curse words to be mean and the difference matters.”

With a stronger sense of professionalism, Dupree brushed off the 53-year-old’s repeated laughter and used her limited time to share her hopes to inspire others to not feel shame or embarrassment over their uncontrollable tics.

“I get thousands of DMS, from parents, from teachers, from girls that have been diagnosed with Tourette’s and they’ve had to be kicked out of school for attention seeking because they rip up their homework or do things like that … I’ve had parents reach out to me asking me, ‘Oh, my son’s coming home with a girlfriend and his girlfriend has Tourette Syndrome,'” Dupree said of the community she’s built around her TikTok."

Sarah Depoian, 73, said she visited Dr. Merle Berger, a former professor at Harvard Medical School and founder of Boston IVF, and was promised the sperm used at his fertility clinic would come from an anonymous donor.

Depoian’s daughter, Carolyn Bester, was born in 1981 after the successful artificial insemination.

Earlier this year, Bester took a home DNA test and learned Berger was her biological father, according to the lawsuit filed in US District Court for Massachusetts.

Adam Wolf, a lawyer representing Depoian, said Berger’s alleged misdeeds were deliberate and caused great harm.

“Some people call this horrific act medical rape, but regardless of what you call it, Dr. Berger’s heinous and intentional misconduct is unethical, unacceptable and unlawful,” Wolf told reporters Wednesday.

Berger has denied the accusations. His attorney, Ian Pinta, said Berger is a pioneer in the medical fertility field whose 50 years of practice has helped thousands of families fulfill their dreams of having a child. He retired in 2020.

“The allegations concern events from over 40 years ago, in the early days of artificial insemination,” Pinta said in a written statement. “The allegations, which have changed repeatedly in the six months since the plaintiff’s attorney first contacted Dr. Berger, have no legal or factual merit, and will be disproven in court.”

Depoian is seeking “damages in an amount sufficient to compensate her for her injuries,” according to the lawsuit.

“We fully trusted Dr. Berger. He was a medical professional. It’s hard to imagine not trusting your own doctor,” said Depoian, who lives in Maine. “We never dreamt he would abuse his position of trust and perpetrate this extreme violation. I am struggling to process it.”

Bester, now 42, said she received DNA results from Ancestry.com and 23andMe as she explored her history earlier this year.

The results didn’t reveal explicitly that Berger was her biological father, they identified a granddaughter and second cousin of his. Bester said she spoke to one of the relatives and started to connect the dots.

“To say I was shocked when I figured this out would be an extreme understatement. It feels like reality has shifted,” Bester, who lives in New Jersey, said. “My mom put her trust in Dr. Berger as a medical professional during one of the most vulnerable times in her life. He had all the power and she had none.”

Bester told WCVB she wanted her mother to pursue this case in part because she is now a mother herself.

A spokesperson for Harvard Medical School told the Associated Press Berger was academically affiliated with the medical school, but his primary place of employment was at various Harvard-affiliated hospitals which are not operated by the university.

The now-retired professor taught obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology.

Mike Bickle addressed the scandal in a vague, rambling statement Tuesday where he acknowledged “past sins” but denied “more intense sexual activities that some are suggesting.”

“I am anguished that my past sins have caused great pain for my wife and family along with the IHOPKC family, and others,” wrote Bickle, who founded the evangelical missions organization in 1999.

“I am deeply sorry that my sin put the IHOPKC leadership and community in a very painful and difficult position. I asked my family for forgiveness,” he added. “I now asked for forgiveness from the IHOPKC family and in the body of Christ.”

Leadership told members of the organization in an October meeting that Bickle was facing allegations of misconduct, though details were not revealed, the Kansas City Star reported.

Three former IHOPKC leaders said in an ensuing statement the allegations involved sexual abuse by Bickle, according to the newspaper.

The leaders said the leadership team found “these allegations of clergy sexual abuse by Mike Bickle to be credible and long-standing.”

Bickle said he was addressing the allegations 20 years after they apparently happened because he was recently confronted about them. He pleaded for members to pray for himself and his family.

“I ask that my family and friends do not defend me,” he said in his long statement. “I have confidence that the Lord will speak concerning what He sees and says about me in His timing.

A firm was hired to probe the allegations. International House of Prayer

“Please do not engage in debates on social media to defend me and please do not criticize those who are voicing their disdain for me.”

The house of prayer hired a third-party firm to probe the allegations against Bickle, leaders told congregants Sunday morning, the Kansas City Star reported.

The action was announced by IHOPKC Executive Director Stuart Greaves and its new spokesperson Eric Volz. Leaders have vowed the probe would be independent."

Ruby Chen’s 19-year-old son Itay Chen had been on active duty with the Israel Defense Forces when he was kidnapped from his post near the Gaza border on Oct. 7. Itay is among eight Americans that remain in Gaza out of a total of 138 hostages that Hamas has refused to release since its deadly attack on the Jewish state.

The IDF captive was “protecting values of the Western society, liberty, democracy” when he was abducted, his father told Fox News on Wednesday.

Ruby Chen joined “Special Report” with host Bret Baier just hours after joining 12 other family members of Americans taken hostage by Hamas for a meeting with President Biden at the White House.

The meeting marked the first time that the 81-year-old president has met with the families in person since the Hamas attack on Israel.

“They don’t have time,” Ruby Chen said of his son and the other hostages. “Each day that passes by, the probability of getting US citizens back home is not good.”

“Any meeting that I have with officials, I put this on the table to try to emphasize the fact that you’re going back to your family and to have a nice dinner – we have an empty chair.”

Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of 35-year-old Israeli-American Sagui Dekel-Chen, told Baier that information from recently freed hostages indicates that his son is still alive. While Dekel-Chen praised Biden for his efforts to free his son, he also called for “greater ones” to be made as Sagui’s time in captivity reached 67 days.

“President Biden and the administration as a whole have been amazing partners in this struggle to get all of our loved ones back,” Dekel-Chen said. “Great efforts have been made. We ask that even greater ones be invested now. These are critical moments.”

Ruby Chen similarly noted that he felt “a bit more” pressure should be applied to the international community.

“We feel that the United States, as the leader of the free world … maybe can pressure a bit more, specifically Egypt, Qatar, other players that have influence, in order to get a deal done, signed on the dotted line, to get the hostages out, which is a humanitarian crisis,” Chen said.

Chen said that he also believes the situation in Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry claims 18,608 people have died since Israel began its retaliatory strikes against the city, is also a humanitarian crisis.

“Let’s not forget the Palestinians are also hostages of the Hamas terrorist organization. The question is, how to influence Hamas to get to the negotiation table as well as the state of Israel,” he said.

Chen added that he envisions his son – a skilled card player – doing tricks in the tunnels under Gaza as he awaits his release.

“Hopefully he has a deck of cards … in custody somewhere, hopefully, passing time,” he said."

The snowmachine collided with a sled dog machine along the Denali Highway around 5:30 p.m. on Monday near the remote town of Cantwell — about 210 miles north of Anchorage, according to Alaska State Troopers.

Musher Mike Parker confirmed in a heartbreaking Facebook post on Tuesday that he was operating veteran musher Jim Lanier’s dog team when he was in a head-on collision with the snowmachine.

Three dogs were killed in the collision.

John Lennon, a 4.5-year-old male dog died on impact. Buttercup, a 7-year-old female, died on the trail; and Solo, a 3-year-old female, died in his arms in the truck as they rushed to an animal hospital in Wasilla.

KitKat, a 7-year-old female, suffered a fractured femur and other injuries and was awaiting surgery, Parker said. No other dogs and no people were injured in the crash.

Parker said he has been training for his rookie run in the legendary Iditarod race and has participated in qualifying races, including Saturday’s Alpine Creek Excursion Race, a 64-mile event that was run Saturday from Cantwell to Alpine Creek Lodge in which he placed 5th overall.

“Words cannot describe how important and meaningful these animals are to me and the Laniers,” he wrote. “From a sled dog perspective, they were all fantastic leaders that have competed in Iditarod, won the Kobuk 440, and shined in countless other races, including setting a speed record in the Hal Bartko Nome Sign 40 with me last year and helping me complete two Iditarod qualifying races.

4 Jim Lanier’s dog, “KitKat,” underwent surgery after the crash.

“As companions they were sweet, gentle and full of personality,” he continued. “They truly embodied the Alaskan spirit and will live on through their teammates and in my heart.”

The area of the crash is a popular training location for dog sled teams in the winter months. Iditarod race director Mark Nordman told local outlet KTUU. Lanier, 82, completed 16 Iditarod races between 1976 and 2013.

The driver of the snowmachine stayed behind to help after the crash, police said. State troopers said that alcohol does not appear to have been a factor. No arrests have been made or citations issued, police said.

“I hope no other musher ever has to go through the horrifying experience I did on the trail,” Parker said. “For this to happen not long after a similar incident on the Denali Highway is unthinkable.”

On Nov. 17, five-time Iditarod winner Dallas Seavey’s sled team was hit by a snowmachine, killing two dogs, according to KTUU. The snowmachiner in that incident was cited for negligent driving."
43,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Border closure has US citizens considering illegally crossing rather than take 8-hour drive,https://nypost.com/2023/12/13/news/border-closure-has-us-citizens-considering-illegally-crossing-rather-than-take-8-hour-drive/,"American citizens say they’ve been trapped in Mexico by the closure of an Arizona border overwhelmed by migrants — and are considering crossing back into the US illegally themselves rather than making dangerous eight-hour round trips.

The border crossing at Lukeville has been closed since December 4 as border patrol agents are diverted to dealing with thousands of migrants arriving illegally in the area, some of whom cut down parts of the border wall to flood into the US.

The closure means those on the Mexican side of the border have to travel through ports of entry in Nogales or San Luis Rio Colorado to the east or west, turning a journey of 30 minutes or an hour into a six-to-eight hour odyssey.

“There’s so many people that are so upset seeing all these 10,000 illegals coming in a day, and they’re coming through a wall that the cartel cut a hole in,” real estate broker Robin Miller, who lives in the beach town of Rocky Point, told The Post.

“And they’re just coming in, coming in. Yet us people with passports [who] are legal to go to the states, we can’t go.”

Others pointed out the increased journey means navigating cartel controlled territory and poorly maintained desert roads, which can be extremely dangerous.

“I’ve driven that route with my partner many times,” said restaurateur Cynthia Lowe, explaining the Nogales route takes her through the cartel-run city of Caborca.

“But to do it alone as a single woman? It’s a little sketchy.”

Lowe said she has to work until Christmas Eve but wants to see her children in Tucson for the holiday.

“I’m seriously contemplating walking through the hole in the wall and having my kids pick me up on the other side,” she said.

“I have one of two choices. I can go through the wall, like everybody else is doing, or I can go through Nogales,” she added.

Lowe runs the Ole Mole restaurant in Rocky Point, which is about an hour from the border.

She says the town’s tourism-based economy has been completely destroyed by the border closure.

She’s lost at least 80% of her business since the closure came into effect on Dec. 4, and had to lay off four employees “with tears in my eyes” within a week.

She has since been waiting tables herself, when there are even customers to wait on at all.

“Listen, when the strip clubs shut down, now that’s bad. All the t—y bars are closed,” said Lowe.

“This is the worst situation we’ve ever seen,” added Miller.

A day after the closure of the Lukeville border, a single-day record of 12,000 migrants crossed into US along the southern border.

CBP figures from October showed 52,000 people had presented themselves at border stations, while a whopping 189,000 were apprehended while attempting to cross illegally.

With no tourists around to spend their money, the vacuum of cash has already begun to ripple throughout Rocky Point’s businesses in what Miller and Lowe both called a “trickle down effect.”

“You’ve got all these local people here dependent upon tourist-driven businesses for their livelihood, and you cut that off, that’s going to affect other local businesses,” said Lowe.

“For example, let’s say you get your nails done by a local nail lady. Well, now you’re not going to get your nails done because you lost your job on the beach or in the restaurant or wherever you’re at.”

“It’s a trickle down effect. And it trickled down very, very rapidly,” she added.

Footage and photos taken by Kristen Hanes, who runs the travel blog The Wayward Home and lives in Rocky Point during the winter months, showed the town’s typically busy beaches bare of all visitors and the streets empty.

Locals have complained leaders in Mexico and the U.S. alike have left them high and dry without meaningful aid to weather the closure.

Lowe reached out to Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs’ office for help, but said she was advised to call Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who was no more unhelpful.

“They were very unsympathetic. Very cold, dry response. Basically said, ‘Well, we’ll pass your concern along. Thank you. Thank you for calling.'”

Governor Hobbs sent a letter to President Biden on December 8 asking him to use the National Guard to reopen the Lukeville crossing, but so far no actions have been taken.

Local charities, residents, and businesses have begun taking up the slack themselves — but their resources are becoming strained, too.

One restaurant that typically gives Christmas toys to its employees’ children ended up handing out cash to the parents instead to help them get by.

The town’s annual toy drive has been postponed altogether.

Even the animals of Rocky Point are struggling.

Barb’s Dog Rescue stores its dog food across the border in Arizona and depends on volunteer tourists to transporting the heavy bags to the rescue when they travel south.

Without the tourists, the rescue ran out of food within a week of the closure and was forced to shell out $4,000 for another week’s worth of food.

“I don’t understand the thinking behind this,” Lowe said of the border closure.

“Whoever made this was really idiotic. Didn’t think this one through at all.”

“You’re affecting everybody kids, women, men, children, businesses, dogs, everybody. Everybody.”"
44,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Florida mom arrested by The Grinch after she allegedly lied about thief stealing her kids’ presents,https://nypost.com/2023/12/13/news/florida-mom-arrested-by-the-grinch-after-allegedly-lying-about-stolen-gifts/,"She nearly got away with stealing Christmas.

A Florida mother of five who received donations after a burglar supposedly stole her children’s Christmas gifts was outed as a liar and taken into custody — with The Grinch dancing along to her arrest.

Shana Hudson, 39, broke the hearts of her kind neighbors when she appeared on TV weeks ago to share her story of how a burglar broke into her Lehigh Acres home and made off with her children’s gifts.

The community rallied behind the family and donated several new gifts to the children, but then a tip came in to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office accusing Hudson of fabricating the story.

The stolen gifts were eventually found hidden at a relative’s home, so the sheriff’s department decided to teach Hudson a lesson about being a Grinch, with help from the original, NBC 2 reports.

“Riiiing Riiiing… Hey Shana, Who-ville Called, they want their Grinch back,” the LCSO posted on Facebook along with a video of the humiliating arrest.

It features clips from Hudson’s original story begging the burglar to turn himself in, only for it to be cut straight to her arrest with police carrying her to the back of a van as someone dressed as The Grinch followed behind.

The green Santa danced along to a remix of ” You’re A Mean One, Mr. Grinch,” as he mocked Hudson and pointed to the department’s “Marceno Motel Courtesy Shuttle,” a decorated van that carries suspects to the Lee County Jail.

The video also revealed that the stolen gifts were hidden behind a dryer at a relative’s home in Lehigh Acres.

Sheriff Carmine Marceno, for whom the shuttle is named, condemned Hudson’s alleged fraud and touted the Christmas-themed arrest.

“This pathetic behavior is unacceptable, especially given the circumstances this holiday season,” he said in a statement. “This woman took advantage of the system and is now paying the price for her selfish choices.”

Hudson was booked at the county prison and charged with making a fraud-false report to law enforcement.

“This Grinch will have plenty of time to think twice about stealing Christmas,” the sheriff’s office said. “We think it’s safe to say, everyone in this county ‘hates, double hates, loathes’ a liar.

“We hope the motel accommodations are much better than her heart this Christmas.”

The Lee County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for additional information."
45,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Everything to know about the House’s impeachment inquiry vote on Biden,https://nypost.com/2023/12/13/news/everything-to-know-about-the-houses-impeachment-inquiry-vote-on-biden/,"House lawmakers voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry into President Biden on Wednesday, a move that Republican congressional investigators say will allow them to collect more information related to the commander in chief’s alleged involvement in his son Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings.

The vote to formally authorize the probe comes three months and a day after former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif,) ordered three GOP-led panels – the House Oversight, Judiciary and Ways and Means committees – to ramp-up evidence-gathering efforts and make the case to the American public of whether or not Biden, 81, improperly used his position as Barack Obama’s vice president to enrich himself and his family.

What is an impeachment inquiry?

An impeachment inquiry is an investigation into possible wrongdoing by a federal official, such as the president, a Cabinet member or a judge.

The evidence-gathering process can include public hearings, depositions held behind closed doors and subpoenas issued to companies, government agencies and officials for information and documents.

The Constitution grants the House of Representatives sole power to conduct the inquiry and decide whether or not to ultimately level articles of impeachment against the official being probed.

3 House lawmakers have voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry into President Biden. AP

Why are House Republicans formalizing Biden’s impeachment inquiry?

Several House Republicans have argued that by formalizing the inquiry, the chairmen of the three committees handling the investigation into Biden’s conduct will gain more power to compel interviews, obtain documents and further the case that the president improperly benefitted from his son’s overseas deals.

GOP lawmakers have already issued an array of demands to executive branch agencies and the president’s son related to the probe, but argue that the Biden administration and Hunter Biden have so far done nothing but obstruct the investigation.

Earlier this month, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer told colleagues that his panel has received just 14 out of about 82,000 pages of Biden’s vice presidential emails known to exist.

Comer also accused the president of repeatedly lying about his contacts with his relatives’ business associates, as well as about his family’s income from China, and said the White House has not complied with requests to interview an array of current and former officials.

Hunter Biden defied a House GOP subpoena requiring him to provide investigators with a private deposition on Wednesday, opting instead to hold a press conference outside the US Capitol and demand a public hearing.

The White House has challenged numerous congressional requests, arguing that the full House must “authorize an impeachment inquiry before a committee may utilize compulsory process pursuant to the impeachment power.”

Proponents of formalizing the inquiry say that Wednesday’s floor vote strengthens their legal standing against the White House and will make it easier to secure subpoenas and witness testimony related to the probe.

Does this mean Biden will be impeached?

Not necessarily, but recent history suggests that he will face impeachment.

House Democrats formalized their impeachment inquiry into former President Donald Trump weeks after launching the probe into his infamous phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Articles of impeachment against Trump were approved by the full House less than three months after the inquiry was formalized.

3 The evidence-gathering process can include public hearings, depositions held behind closed doors and subpoenas issued to companies, government agencies and officials for information and documents. AP

Democrats did not conduct an official inquiry before voting to impeach Trump a second time, in the final days of his presidency, for his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.

Former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment inquiry, stemming from sexual harassment lawsuit, was formally authorized in October of 1998 and led to articles of impeachment for obstruction of justice and perjury being approved in December of that year.

Impeachment trials are conducted in the Senate and are presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.

How long will the inquiry take?

There are no set rules on how long an impeachment inquiry can or must last.

The only real deadline is Jan. 3, 2025, when the 118th Congress ends its final legislative session."

The under-fire president was among the roughly 100 people to gather at the daily lighting ceremony, organized by the Harvard Chabad, at the campus’ Harvard Park.

Gay, who attended alongside her colleague Professor Jeff Bussgang, was spotted lighting the first candle.

Despite a slew of anti-Israel protests being held on campus of late, the lighting went ahead calmly without any interruptions.

Gay’s appearance came after the Harvard Corporation — the university’s highest governing body — announced Tuesday that she would remain leader of the prestigious school in the wake of her disastrous congressional testimony about antisemitism last week.

Some Jewish students — who say they are still experiencing a sense of unease on campus over antisemitism — told The Post Wednesday that Gay should be booted from her post if she fails to take measures to protect them.

“If she’s willing to take action to actually protect us, that’s fine. If not, she needs to go,” one student, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisals, said.

Fellow classmates, meanwhile, ripped the Ivy League institution over what they argue is a “double standard of free speech” tied to the Israel war.

“If any other minority group says they don’t feel safe, the administration would take steps to make sure they have a safe space,” one student, only identified as Olivia, told The Post.

“Now Jewish students are saying they don’t feel safe. I don’t want to be coddled, but if you’re going to protect some minority groups but not other minority groups, that’s underlying antisemitism.”

Maya Bodnick, a sophomore majoring in government, said the campus “has been very tense” ever since the Israel-Hamas war erupted following the terror group’s Oct. 7 attack.

5 Gay will keep her job after a congressional hearing in which she floundered on condemning campus antisemitism. David McGlynn

“Jewish students I know and non-Jewish students I know have felt unsafe or uncomfortable to speak their opinions,” Bodnick said.

“I really do my best to engage in conversations with people of different viewpoints, but it’s been challenging to have those discourses,” she continued.

“A lot of people are unwilling to engage in different perspectives than their own. I have a lot of friends with family in Israel, with emotional ties to the situation, and that just supercharges things.”

Just months into her leadership, Gay found herself in the middle of a firestorm last week after she and other Ivy League presidents failed to condemn calls for the genocide of Jews at their respective schools during a fiery congressional hearing.

It prompted some lawmakers and Harvard donors to quickly call for Gay to step down after her testimony sparked intense national backlash.

A total of 10 Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers were killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours, including 44-year-old Col. Itzhak Ben Basat, according to the Times of Israel.

Many of the troops were killed in Gaza City’s Shejaia district, when they were surprised by Hamas terrorists while trying to rescue another group of soldiers, according to Reuters.

It was the worst single-day loss the IDF had since October 31, when 15 troops were killed.

Hamas proudly flaunted news of the casualties, claiming they demonstrated Israel’s inability to bring Gaza to its knees.

“The longer you stay there, the greater the bill of your deaths and losses will be, and you will emerge from it carrying the tail of disappointment and loss, God willing,” the terrorist organization said.

Heavy fighting continued throughout the day in both north and southern Gaza.

Bombing runs were flown by Israeli warplanes across the length of the territory, while winter rains created wet fighting conditions for troops on the ground.

The rains also raised humanitarian alarms for the 2.3 million Gazans who have been left homeless by the fighting, hundreds of thousands of whom have resorted to living in makeshift tents.

“Our house was destroyed, our child was martyred and I remain facing it all,” said Yasmin Mhani, who was hanging soaked clothing outside the tent she and he family are living in.

Mhani, who is sharing a single blanket with her family of five, said she woke up in the night to find her seven-month-old child soaking wet.

“This is the fifth place we have had to move to, fleeing from one place to another, with nothing but a t-shirt on,” she said.

The fighting in Gaza has intensified since the late November ceasefire ended. Heavy rain has complicated the fight IDF

President Biden has said Israel’s campaign to eradicate Hamas from Gaza is beginning to erode the tide of global sympathy they held after the terror group attacked the Jewish homeland on October 7.

“They’re starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,” Biden said at a donor event on Tuesday.

Though he insisted “most of the world” still supports Israel, he said he’d advised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “don’t make the same mistakes we made in 9/11” and become embroiled in the kind of conflict the US found in Afghanistan.

Shortly after, the United Nations General Assembly passed a vote demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Just eight nations voted with the US and Israel against the resolution, which has no legal power.

Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said 18,608 people have died since Israel began its retaliatory strikes against the city. Another 50,594 have been wounded, the ministry said."

The resolution, sponsored by two lawmakers from each party, also demanded that Harvard President Claudine Gay and her MIT counterpart, Sally Kornbluth, follow the lead of Penn’s Elizabeth Magill and resign their positions.

“This is not a partisan issue but a question of moral clarity,” House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said in a statement.

“We are only just beginning to address the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has infected America’s higher education system and we will not stop until it is rooted out.”

The measure — fronted by Stefanik, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) and Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) — was approved 303-126, with 219 Republicans and 84 Democrats voting “yea.”

4 Elise Stefanik grilled the presidents of the three elite schools during a hearing last Tuesday. AP

Three Democrats — Julia Brownley and Jimmy Gomez of California as well as Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania — voted “present,” while Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the lone Republican “nay.”

Stefanik made worldwide headlines with her questioning of Gay, Kornbluth and Magill during the Dec. 5 House Education and Workforce Committee hearing, during which she asked whether calls for an “intifada” against Israel violated each university’s student code of conduct.

“We embrace a commitment to free expression – even views that are objectionable, offensive [and] hateful,” Gay responded after repeated prodding by Stefanik. “It’s when that speech crosses into conduct that violates our policies against bullying and harassment. That speech did not cross that barrier.”

Korthbluth said that MIT wanted to “ensure that we protect speech and viewpoint diversity for everyone.”

“Those who want us to shut down protest language are in effect, arguing for a speech code, but in practice, speech codes do not work.”

Magill, who stepped down Dec. 9, told Stefanik that it would be a “context-dependent decision” about whether demanding the murder of Jews constituted bullying or harassment.

“Students are scared to be Jewish on campus and these presidents’ answers before Congress reinforced their failures of leadership over the last few months,” Gottheimer said in a statement. “… As a dad, I don’t ever want any student — regardless of background — to feel scared to be who they are at school.”

Several Democrats publicly panned the resolution.

“They’re not the answers I would’ve given for one minute — they didn’t show any common sense at all, but guess who’s not showing any common sense right now? People who are about to get swept away with Elise Stefanik’s McCarthy-like crusade” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) told CNN.

“I don’t think the Congress of the United States needs to be dictating to [colleges] who should resign and who shouldn’t.”

Manhattan Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) echoed that sentiment, calling the resolution a “gross overreach” that lacked tangible steps to combat antisemitism.

“Congress should not meddle in the hiring and firing of college presidents,” he said.

4 All three presidents faced intense blowback following the hearing. AP

On Dec. 7, lawmakers announced that they were opening a formal investigation into antisemitism on campuses across the country.

Over the weekend, House Committee on Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) dangled the prospect of cutting off federal funds to campuses that fail to address the issue, telling Fox News Sunday that “we cannot tolerate taxpayer dollars going to institutions that allow for antisemitism and for calling for genocide of the Jews.”"

51,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,The Giants' Darren Waller nearly died of an overdose. Now he helps NJ kids beat addiction,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/health/2023/12/13/ny-giants-darren-waller-helps-nj-kids-fight-addiction-opioids-overdose-deaths/71883501007/,"Darren Waller's drug addiction began when he started taking pain pills from his parents' medicine cabinet when he was only 15 and a budding high school football star.

It ended six years ago when he nearly died of an overdose on a batch of opioids laced with potent fentanyl — a rock-bottom moment that began his road to recovery.

Today, Waller has rebounded. He is a star tight end for the New York Giants. He is candid about his addiction — along with the social isolation and anxiety that fed it. He has given several long, detailed interviews about his troubles to national outlets. And he speaks to young people about the choices that led to his addiction and the hard work it took to get clean.

Waller is only going to get busier on the speakers' circuit.

Under a partnership announced Wednesday with Hackensack Meridian Health, Waller will continue to discuss his own experiences with mental health, addiction and sobriety at events across New Jersey, including at places like the Carrier Clinic, which has one of the largest addiction services in the state.

He will also be featured in an advertising campaign and be the star of the network's multimedia efforts. Terms of the partnership were not publicly disclosed.

Waller said he hopes his new role will help to ""reduce the stigma attached to addiction and to reach people who currently may be where I was for many years — in a vicious cycle of using alcohol and drugs, and feeling lost and ashamed.""

Overdose deaths have exploded in NJ and nationwide

The partnership comes at a time when overdose deaths have exploded in New Jersey over the past decade, mirroring a national trend.

The 2,892 suspected drug-related deaths in 2022 were well over double the 1,223 deaths in 2012. There are more overdose deaths in New Jersey each year than fatal car crashes, suicides and homicides combined. Driving that trend is fentanyl, the powerful opioid that almost claimed Waller's life.

Story continues below photo gallery.

Although overdose hospital visits have gone down in recent years, they are still up significantly from a decade ago, with 8,754 visits in 2022 — more than double the number in 2012.

It is a situation Attorney General Matt Platkin has called an ""epidemic that has touched every corner of our country, and New Jersey wasn’t spared.""

His drug use surged in college

Waller's drug use began in high school, but it increased dramatically when he arrived at Georgia Tech in 2011.

His opioid addiction led to the use of molly, ecstasy, cocaine, weed and alcohol. He failed a few drug tests and said he cheated on a number of others. Despite his immense talent, his draft status plummeted due to his failed tests, but the Baltimore Ravens took a chance on him in the sixth round of the 2015 NFL Draft.

Waller's addiction followed him to the pros, as he told an NFL film crew in 2020. He was suspended in 2016 for four games for a failed drug test. A second failure in 2017 led to a yearlong suspension from the NFL.

While the Ravens were playing a preseason game, Waller was scoring some pills that he didn't know were laced with fentanyl, a powerful opioid that is by far the leading cause of overdose deaths in New Jersey and the U.S.

He took them seated in his car in a parking lot just a few blocks from the Ravens training facility. He was knocked unconscious for four to five hours.

Waller finally sought help and entered a rehab clinic. After his stay, he went to his parents' home in Georgia with a renewed purpose to stay clean. While working out with the hope of regaining his football career, he took a job as a grocery store clerk — a routine that helped him maintain sobriety. He also credits healthy eating, yoga, exercising and strong family bonds.

After rehab, a Pro Bowl season in Oakland

In 2018, Waller was reinstated and eventually signed with the Oakland Raiders, becoming a star offensive force, culminating in a Pro Bowl appearance in 2020.

Waller was traded from the Raiders to the Giants in March in what was considered a huge addition to the Big Blue offense. It's been an up-and-down season, though for Waller, who has been injured for part of the season.

Still, setbacks on the football field are not as devastating as the ones he endured years before. People in the mental health field believe Waller's story can help many struggling with addiction.

""Darren will reinforce the message that substance use disorder is a disease, not a character flaw, and that better days are ahead with the help of treatment and a support system,"" said Trish Toole, president of the Carrier Clinic."
52,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,'Let's dox them one by one.' Rise in doxxing during Israel-Hamas war sparks alarm,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2023/12/13/doxxing-internet-shaming-harm-people-israel-hamas-war/71824057007/,"Jannine Masoud was looking at screenshots sent to her from a student group chat at Rutgers Law School when she spotted her own name and photo.

She froze.

The captions under students' photos read:

“Your employers have a right to know you support terrorist organizations.”

“Maybe we sent [sic] this to some news outlet?”

“Let’s dox them one by one.”

The students were upset over a statement supporting Palestinians by the school’s National Lawyers Guild chapter, and they debated posting members’ personal information online. The incident deepened campus tensions and sparked a complaint to the administration.

In a volatile political era, Rutgers University is not alone in grappling with a surge in doxxing incidents. In schools, neighborhoods and workplaces, Americans are being singled out because they shared controversial opinions, joined protests or were part of certain social and political groups. Doxxing — the spreading of personal information with intent to punish, intimidate or harass — is not new, but it has been practiced with fervor amid tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.

Students and workers say doxxing has risked their reputations, jobs and safety.

“This is triggering, frightening and scary because doxxing is intended to invite harm,” Masoud said. “It is intended to invite harassment. This is not a metaphorical target on our backs. This is a group of students saying 'these students support terrorism, go harass them.'”

As doxxing unfolds in snippets that lack context and are framed to inspire rage, advocates and ethicists warn the public to use skepticism before sharing and to ask themselves: Am I doing more harm than good?

Dueling doxxing sites

Doxxing has been used to harass female games journalists and LGBTQ advocates, to expose individuals allegedly making racist remarks and to identify people believed to be violent far-right extremists. It has also been widely used to blacklist Palestinian rights activists.

As political tensions bubble over the Middle East conflict, the tactic has become more systematic. Organizations and social media groups have pored through statements, online posts and protest activity to identify and condemn speech they view as offensive.

At universities including Harvard, Columbia and Princeton, names and photos of professors and students connected to Palestinian solidarity statements were displayed on “doxxing trucks” and websites accusing them of antisemitism.

Last month, Ramapo College faced complaints after an online doxxing group slammed a professor of cinema over a cartoon she shared on Facebook. It showed a baby under a cleaver held by a hand in a shirtsleeve with Israeli and American symbols. The group urged people to contact the college president, and the college subsequently opened an investigation into the professor's posts.

Advocacy and legal groups have reported a spike in requests for help from people targeted by doxxing. Selaedin Maksut, executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations, said his most recent call came from a mother of five in Passaic County whose employer had received complaints over pro-Palestinian content she had shared online.

“It makes us feel we live in an authoritarian government,” he said. “This is America. We have the ability to speak freely. The fact that we are being silenced in this way is really scary.”

Though doxxing has been around for years, one trend is new: reverse doxxing. At least one rival site has been launched to expose people who it alleges have made hateful comments about Palestinians.

Last month, the new social media account called for people to complain about a Bloomfield lawyer and a doctor affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health. It later posted screenshots of a letter from the health care network saying the doctor had been suspended from his practice. Hackensack Meridian declined to comment or confirm.

One-star reviews

Businesses are also reeling from online harassment. In Marlboro, Heba Macksoud said she was targeted after she posted “I stand with Palestine” on a town Facebook page where many had written in support of Israel.

A local rabbi posted the name of her pharmacy and wrote on the page that he “cannot do business with a place owned by someone who posts supporting Palestinians as they rape and murder innocents.” In another post, he called her a “terrorist enabler.” Macksoud said she received about 300 angry messages and a slew of one-star reviews for her pharmacy.

She took down her post after family members also began receiving harassing comments and her niece’s carwash business was doxxed because of the relation to her, she said.

For Macksoud, who is active in the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, an interfaith group of Muslim and Jewish women, and has attended rallies against antisemitism, it has been a hurtful time. She has cautioned her daughters, who are in college, to avoid social media.

“I called them and said, ‘Chill; don’t post anything.’ I keep hearing stories. People are not getting jobs. People are putting them on lists,” she said.

“It hasn’t stopped me, two months in,” she added. “I post like crazy and go to protests. What I am worried about is the censorship and doxxing of an entire younger generation.”

'More harm than good'

The groups behind doxxing say they are exposing people who are guilty of hateful or extremist speech and should face repercussions. But even in seemingly just cases — like viral video of the hit-and-run driver at the Unite the Right white nationalist rally in 2017 — ethical questions remain, said Irina Raicu, director of the internet ethics program at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.

“The danger here,"" Raicu said, ""is that we have seen over and over misidentification and innocent people suffering in their efforts to try to bring people to justice.""

Doxxing is carried out by people who want to appeal to their side and confirm and solidify their own views, Raicu said. But they have no control over how people will respond, which historically has been through attacks and harassment.

“This trend we are seeing for people on one team to go after another adds to polarization,” she said. “Especially in this conflict, if the goal is to solve or limit conflict, then this seems to do the opposite.

“It just seems to do more harm than good in just about every situation I can think of,"" Raicu said.

The snippets of information shared on social media are intended to provoke outrage but lack nuance and context. People may be seeing “selectively edited versions of what may be the more extreme or louder views” and not a realistic view, Raicu said. Social media algorithms fuel the content that confirms our views or antagonizes us.

“Instead of really going out and talking to people and understanding how they feel and why they feel and potentially changing each other’s minds,” Raicu said, “we are entrenching ourselves further in our own views and pushing people we view as opponents farther and farther away. And that just seems like such a recipe for more anger and more conflict rather than resolving anything.”

Protection from doxxing

When the National Lawyers Guild chapter released a public statement about the doxxing threats against members, it redacted names of the students in the group chat. The statement was focused on accountability, and not on shaming or harassing individuals, Masoud said. Still, the group chose to conceal their identities.

""We didn't want to even touch upon the same things they do to us,"" Masoud said. ""We engage in substance, and we will never resort to harassment or intimidation to silence our opposition.""

Masoud called for Rutgers to take a stand against doxxing, to seek accountability for victims and to ensure that enforcement action is unbiased.

""The conspiracy to dox came out of a student group,"" she said. ""When we went to the administration, they said we could put in a complaint and there is nothing further we can do. We want to see swift action taken ... It was extremely frightening to see our peers wanted to harm us in this way.""

How to lower the risk of doxxing

There are steps the public can take to lower the risk of doxxing and to respond should it happen to them. Internet privacy and advocacy groups recommend that people do online searches of their own name, phone number, address and online social media handles to see what is publicly available.

They can delist their personal information from websites and make social media accounts private, among other steps. If the problem escalates to physical threats, people should consider extra security measures to stay safe.

53,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,What could have caused Melvin the deer to attack in Andover?,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/environment/2023/12/13/melvin-the-deer-attacks-andover-nj-why-did-it-happen/71837965007/,"If you live in a suburban or rural area of New Jersey it is likely that you have a deer experience, if not a whole bunch of them. Whether it be that they ate all of your freshly planted flowers, ran out in front of your car, or adorably hang out in your yard on a daily basis, the deer are everywhere.

White-tailed deer are common to encounter in New Jersey and, while they are cute to look at, it is important that you respect their space, for their safety and your own.

Melvin, a well-known deer from Andover Township, attacked a man hours before his wedding in November, according to NJ.com.

Kevin Van Arsdale was attacked while walking his dogs, only breaking free from the deer after two township workers who happened to be walking by were able to scare it off. Van Arsdale had minor injuries in the attack.

About two weeks later, on Nov. 22, another attack by the same deer was reported. The following day, Andover police officers located the deer near the same location, and they shot and killed it.

Van Arsdale and Andover officials could not be reached for comment after multiple attempts.

So, what could have caused the deer to become so aggressive?

Melvin was widely loved around the community, enough so that people took to social media after his death using the hashtag #JusticeforMelvin.

Many people likely fed him and showed him affection, which according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, could be causes for Melvin's aggression.

Regardless of how harmless they seem, white-tailed deer are wild animals which, according to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, do not need our help.

On feeding wild deer, the NJDEP's website says, ""People should keep in mind that deer and other wildlife are wild animals and have adapted to cope to the sometimes-harsh winter weather, including deep snow, cold temperatures and high winds.""

If people consistently feed deer, it could cause them to lose their fear of humans, eventually leading to aggression. According to the NJDEP, ""In NJ, deer are considered a 'potentially dangerous species' because of their ability to inflict serious physical harm to humans with their hooves and antlers.""

Additional potential consequences of feeding deer include:

Increasing reproductive potential

Enhancing the spread of disease and parasites

Changing the deer's behavioral patterns

Sickening and killing deer

So, while you may think you are helping your deer neighbors, it may actually be harming them. And while you may feel bad that they are out during the cold New Jersey winters, they have adapted for this and can ensure their survival on their own.

""Deer are beautiful wild animals and should be afforded the respect they deserve,"" said the NJDEP. ""Wildlife lovers are encouraged to enjoy their presence passively and allow them to live as the wild animals they are."""
54,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,All in the logistics: How Valley plans to move a hospital of patients to Paramus in a day,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/health/2023/12/13/heres-how-valley-hospital-will-move-everyone-to-paramus-site-patients-ridgewood/71752531007/,"At 6 a.m. on April 14, 2024, plastic sheets will be draped over the signs directing people to The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood and its emergency room will close after 73 years in service.

At the same moment 2 miles away in Paramus, the new Valley Hospital will open its emergency room with a team of doctors, nurses and other staff members at the ready.

An hour later, a fleet of 65 ambulances will begin transporting patients from the old site in Ridgewood to Valley’s newly constructed $868 million facility. One of the features of the new facility is that every patient will get a single room.

Story continues below photo gallery.

It will have taken two years of planning to make the move happen.

As one of the biggest and most unusual logistical challenges faced by a North Jersey hospital in recent memory, Valley plans to move an entire, fully functional medical facility into a new building without disrupting care — and most of it will done in just a few hours.

“When we first started talking about doing this move in one day, there was a lot of anxiety,” said Karteek Bhavsar, a senior vice president for Valley Health overseeing the move. “How is that possible? There is so much logistically that needs to be done.”

NorthJersey.com spoke with Valley executives in charge of the move. Here's how they're planning for the big day.

The Valley team first looked at similar one-day moves by other medical centers. They found two examples in South Jersey: Inspira Health moved patients in 2019 from a hospital in Gloucester County to a new one about 8 miles away, and Virtua Health closed its hospital in Camden County and moved everything to a new facility 5 miles away.

Get the timing right

Another key preparation was to get the timing right. Earlier this year, Valley pushed its move date from January 2024 out to April, which was met with a sigh of relief from doctors and nurses. Not only is there no need to worry about a snowstorm or ice on the roads in April, but flu, COVID, RSV and other communicable diseases will likely be winding down from their usual winter peak, so patient volume and demand for emergency services will not be as high.

“The January date that we originally had, that probably kept me up a little bit, because we know how busy we are,” said Bettyann Kempin, vice president of administration, who started her career at Valley as a nurse. “But by April, knock on wood, you’re not going to have the ERs on either campus inundated. You’re going to drop the census of the hospital, and that’s going to make the move easier.”

The move will also happen on a Sunday, when most stores are closed due to Bergen County’s blue laws. That will free up the usually traffic-snarled roads of Paramus, which has long had one of the biggest concentrations of retail space on the planet.

The start of the move will begin next month, when some of the excess supplies and equipment in Ridgewood will be sent to Paramus. But large pieces like CT scan and MRI machines will not be making the trip. Valley is turning the Ridgewood campus into a multi-pronged outpatient center where the equipment will still be needed. The new hospital in Paramus will have all new equipment.

Training at Paramus site

Also starting in January and lasting almost until moving day, hundreds of employees will be trained at the Paramus campus on everything from how to handle new medical equipment to basics such as how to get into the building and where the bathrooms are.

More:Lessons from COVID to Disney: How new Valley Hospital will be radically different

The medical teams at Ridgewood will remain together when they move to Paramus, so disruption in care will be less likely once they’re familiarized with their new surroundings, Kempin said.

In mid-February, the staff will hold a “Day In The Life” test-run at Paramus to simulate caring for patients. The goal is to identify any equipment or staff concerns two months before the move. “We’re trying to plan for every scenario, and we’d rather be over-planned than under,” Bhavsar said.

If all goes smoothly in the first few months of 2024, the next flurry of activity will come in the weeks leading up to moving day.

The state Department of Health will inspect the Paramus facility about two weeks before it opens. Non-emergency surgeries will be on hold at Ridgewood beginning a week before the move. More “high-level equipment” such as robotic surgical devices will be moved closer to April 14, Bhavsar said.

About 24 hours before the move, Ridgewood will go on “critical care diversion,” which means that ambulances transporting severely ill or injured patients will be told to go to another local hospital. At midnight, Ridgewood will go on full EMS diversion, telling all ambulances to go elsewhere.

Story continues below photo gallery.

“It doesn’t mean folks can’t still come to the ER in Ridgewood, it just means diverting a larger bulk of patients away from Ridgewood to keep the number of patients we have to move down,” Kempin said. “The ER will still be functioning on the Ridgewood campus all the way until 6 a.m., when we stop taking in new patients.”

The ER at Ridgewood closes at 6 a.m. as Paramus opens its doors for the first time, and an hour later, the migration begins.

Migrating patients in 65 ambulances

The 65 ambulances — contracted with an outside company so local ambulance squads can remain on regular duty — will move back and forth between the hospitals. The most critical patients will be moved first, with physicians on-site in Ridgewood making the call and then telling their counterparts in Paramus what to expect upon arrival. A critical care team will accompany the patient in the ambulance.

Next will come medical and surgical patients, followed by women and children. And just to make sure there are minimal snags, there will be two maintenance trucks ready in case an ambulance breaks down.

Those who are not stable enough to be moved at the time will stay at the Ridgewood campus. If a woman is in a labor “and they’re too far along, they will deliver at the Ridgewood campus,” Kempin said. “If they’re safe to move, they will be moved to the Paramus campus and deliver there.”

“We’ve seen ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ and know how complicated patients might look to people out there, but everyone can move,” she said. “It doesn’t matter how critical you are. There is a way to safely transport folks. It’s just the timing that’s important, and we’re leaving that decision to the physicians and clinical team.”

If all goes well, things should be wrapped up by early afternoon and New Jersey's newest hospital will be up and running."

Can it be fixed? | Kelly,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/mike-kelly/2023/12/13/israel-hamas-war-teaneck-nj-rift-mike-kelly-protest/71830560007/,"Editor's note: Columnist Mike Kelly has lived in Teaneck more than 40 years. He is the author of the 1995 non-fiction book about Teaneck, “COLOR LINES: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town.” He was also a consulting producer on the 4-part, MSNBC documentary in 2022 about Teaneck, “Model America.”

On a street corner in the suburban enclave of Teaneck, New Jersey, only five miles from the bright lights of New York City, two distinct and somber messages from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict recently collided.

The encounter, while brief, offers a window into the challenges for American communities who try to find common ground in a conflict nearly 6,000 miles away that has long eluded peace or even respectful dialogue.

The scene was Teaneck Road, a bustling thoroughfare in a town with a proud legacy as a safe refuge for nearly 80 nationalities, including distinct communities of Jews and Muslims, and a carefully cultivated tradition of trying to bring diverse peoples together to discuss their differences.

On this day, however, common ground seemed as elusive as that peace in the Middle East.More than 100 students from Teaneck High School had cut class to protest Israel’s invasion of the Gaza Strip and what they claimed to be Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians.

The students did not mention that Israel’s recent military action was a response to the Palestinian Hamas terror attack of Oct. 7 from the Gaza Strip that left 1,200 people dead in Israel, some 240 taken hostage and dozens of women sexually assaulted. Nor did they say anything about the Hamas attack being the deadliest single-day rampage against Jews since the Nazi Holocaust.

After first rallying at the high school football stadium — near a memorial to African-Americans slain under questionable circumstances by police across America — the students marched a half-mile to the Teaneck town hall for more speeches.

“Free, free, free Palestine,” they chanted again and again.

On a corner, near a public school named after one of Teaneck’s civil rights champions during its landmark school integration of the 1960s, a lone Jewish woman listened. After a half-minute or so, the woman shouted back: “Free the hostages.”

The students did not seem to hear the woman. Or if they did, they didn’t acknowledge her. “Free Palestine,” they kept chanting.

It was as if both sides spoke different languages, from separate communities, talking past each other and unable to comprehend the other’s point of view.

For Teaneck, which promotes itself as welcoming all manner of religions, races and ethnic groups and once had a Muslim mayor and a Jewish deputy mayor, such a scene raises questions that some say challenges the soul of the community. Long touted as a national model of inclusiveness — it was the first U.S. community to voluntarily desegregate its schools through busing in 1965 — Teaneck suddenly finds itself struggling to find the right way to address the Middle East crisis.

During several weeks of interviews, many residents, ranging from religious and political leaders to students, pointed to a suddenly thorny conundrum: How can a town which boasts of finding common ground for its 39,000 residents on all manner of local issues now find the key to respectful discussions of a faraway problem that seems elude common ground and yet affects so many residents?

Teaneck’s mayor, Michael Pagan, summed up the sentiments of many, describing the last few months as an especially “difficult and challenging time for Teaneck.”

“Our township historically has gone through numerous difficult times and we always come together,” said Pagan, the town’s first Latino mayor. “I hope that we will again. But this particular moment feels a little more strained. There are a lot of people hurting right now.”

Where is Teaneck's tradition of peaceful dialogue?

Teaneck has faced other troubling periods that tore at its well-constructed social fabric. Many point to several years in the early 1990s, when Teaneck convulsed with raucous protest marches and soul-searching debates in meetings and at dinner tables after a white police officer shot and killed an African-American teenager.

Back then, the town relied on its well-honed tradition of peaceful dialogue, as well as a variety of respected leaders ranging from sports coaches to clergy, police and business owners, to hold the town together.

Today, those strong foundations seem frayed, residents say. Many leaders from the 1990s have died or moved away. ""The Art Gardners and Manny Landaus are long gone,"" said Deputy Mayor Elie Katz, referring to Arthur Gardner, a beloved African-American high school coach, and Emanuel Landau, a widely respected Orthodox Jewish psychologist, who, as neighbors, joined forces in 1991 to prevent a confrontation between militant Jewish and Black protestors.

""There is divisiveness in Teaneck now and very few community leaders who cross different aisles,"" Katz said.

As a result some long-standing pillars of civic life in Teaneck, from the police to the school board and various churches and synagogues, find themselves under new stresses, brought on by an ancient conflict thousands of miles away.

Teaneck Police confirmed to NorthJersey.com and The Record that they are investigating a series of threats on social media against Muslim students at the local high school who led anti-Israel protests.

Police Chief Andrew McGurr declined to comment in detail, however, explaining that “we’re dealing with an active investigation and we’re also dealing with juveniles.”

Jewish students at the high school say they fear going to class and wearing a yarmulke or a Star of David necklace that might identify them as Jewish. And each Saturday, police cruisers, officers and private security guards keep watch at synagogues to prevent possible attacks.

As if that’s not worrisome enough, Teaneck officials point to other signs that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has frayed the town’s tradition of respecting diverse cultures and views.

Jews and Muslims have held several competing protest rallies on the Teaneck Municipal Green, but only with heavy police presence and with long rows of steel fencing erected to keep the groups apart. The rallies have become so common that Teaneck’s town manager, Dean Kazinci, predicts that the town will likely exceed its $650,000 budget for police overtime this year.

“Sometimes diversity is our best asset. Sometimes it can be our worst asset,” said Kazinci, who grew up in Teaneck served as a police captain before taking on the township manager’s job.

On Oct. 31 — Halloween — Kazinci, sensing that the town needed to find common ground, reached out to members of the influential Teaneck Clergy Council, asking its Christian, Jewish and Muslim members to sign a general statement condemning hate speech and calling for safety in schools.

The Christian and Jewish members of the council quickly signed. As of this week, Kazinci is still waiting for two Muslim imams to come to his office to sign. Neither imam responded to requests for comment from The Record.

Many homes in the northwest corner of Teaneck — the center of the town’s Orthodox Jewish population — display lawn signs that support Israel and call for the freedom of Hamas-held hostages. By contrast, in Teaneck’s southern and eastern neighborhoods, where three major mosques are located, an entirely opposite message echoes, with many homes displaying “Ceasefire Now” signs — a reference to Israel’s bombing of civilian neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip.

Rare is the home with signs that address both issues — and criticizes both sides.

Israeli supporters say it’s unjust to discuss the long-standing Palestinian conflict in light of the recent Hamas atrocities. Likewise, Palestinian supporters sidestep the bloodshed by Hamas. As with the protest march by Teaneck high school students, the messages pass each other like traffic in opposite directions.

On Cedar Lane, Israeli flags and photos of the Hamas hostages adorn windows in several kosher restaurants. A few blocks away, Richard Siegel, an accomplished jazz pianist and outspoken Jewish advocate of Palestinian rights who often attends pro-Palestinian protest marches, displays a green, black and red Palestinian flag.

Meanwhile, the town council, the local municipal Democratic club and the school superintendent have all struggled — in some cases, stumbled clumsily — in releasing a series of statements addressing concerns from both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.

In mid-October, a resolution by the Teaneck Township Council to condemn the Hamas attack without addressing the decades-long history of complaints by Palestinians over Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank prompted seven of 11 members to resign from the town’s Advisory Board on Community Relations.

It also touched off a loud pro-Palestinian demonstration at town hall.

When the township council revisited the issue two weeks later – on the night before Halloween -- and passed a “Peace and Unity” resolution that “values the lives of innocent Israeli and Palestinian citizens” and pledged to bring Teaneck together, the effort seemed too late. What passed for respectful dialogue in Teaneck seemed poisoned.

The former Community Relations Board chairman, Yassine Elkaryani, 38, an IT consultant from Morocco who moved to Teaneck 13 years ago, said he quit his post because he felt the town council’s initial resolution condemning only Hamas and not the Israeli occupation “deliberately divided the town.”

The second resolution, he said, failed to satisfy either side.

To pro-Israel advocates, the new resolution reeked of efforts to excuse the Hamas murders as part of a long-standing grievance against Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. To Palestinian supporters, the new resolution seemed watered down and was not strong enough.“It was clear that the town council was being tribal,” Elkaryani said in an interview. “The council is interested in window shopping as opposed to substantial community relations work.”

Nonetheless, Elkaryani said he wished that the township council never drafted a resolution that addressed any aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“The council has no business in this issue,” Elkaryani said. “Leave the Middle East in the Middle East. The moment you bring the Middle East conflict into Teaneck it’s going to be devastating. I never signed up to import the Middle East conflict here.”

Teaneck's Jews say they are worried — and afraid

Meanwhile, in interviews, many Jews said they feel suddenly vulnerable, with worrisome reports of rising antisemitism across America, especially at college campuses. Two weeks ago, three Jewish students sued New York University, claiming their civil rights had been violated by pro-Palestinian protestors who chanted anti-Israel slogans. Federal authorities are currently investigating allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia at Rutgers University and 28 other colleges and school districts. On Tuesday, Rutgers suspended the pro-Palestinian group, Students for Justice in Palestine.

Often, in interviews, Jewish residents pointed to such chants as “free Palestine from the river to the sea” — a staple of many pro-Palestinian rallies — as coded language that calls for the eradication of Israel and is, therefore, antisemitic. Few Palestinian supporters understand the theology and Biblical roots behind such claims by Israel. Or, if they do, they dismiss it.

At the same time, many Jews interviewed said say they feel betrayed by Teaneck’s progressives who they say not only failed to condemn the Hamas massacre in general but specifically the reports of brutal sexual assaults of Israeli women.

“We don’t want to close ranks and say we can only look out for ourselves, but we feel largely alone,” said a Jewish woman who asked that her name not be used because her child attends one of the Teaneck’s public schools and fears being bullied by non-Jewish students.

“Where is the mass condemnation of the women were raped and children who were then killed?” the woman added.

Muslims in Teaneck say they 'don't really feel safe'

Muslims in Teaneck echo a similar refrain about their own plight.

Hours before she led the walkout of Teaneck High School students, Amar Halak, 17, a senior whose family immigrated from Syria, received a threatening anonymous text message on her cell phone.

“From the river to the sea, you will die a horrible death and burn in hell without any virgins because you support murder, rape and the kidnapping of young children,” the message said.

It was one of 30 threatening texts that Halak said she received. She now assumes that the threats were sent after she included her cell phone number and email address on fliers announcing the walkout. But she’s not sure. And not knowing the source of the threats continues to bother her greatly, she said.

“I don’t really feel safe,” Halak said. “It’s making me real scared.”

The day after the march, as she sat in a business class at the high school, Halak said she received another anonymous text.

“Do you want to get hurt? Just wondering,” the message said.

Halak said that she was so upset that she left the class and found refuge in a school bathroom. From there, she telephoned her mother. She later notified a police officer who is assigned to the high school.

Maryam Marey, 17 and a senior, who, like Halak, is a Muslim and helped to organize the walkout, said she also received anonymous threats.

“It’s very sad to me,” Marey said. “I know these are adults on the other end of the phone. For a grown adult to take time out of the day to send me threats is pathetic. It’s so disappointing. It clear they are not shameful at all.”

Teaneck H.S. walk-out spurred pro-Israel gathering — before it happened

On the night before the student walk-out from the high school, some 400 residents — most of them Jewish — gathered on the Teaneck town green, citing fears of antisemitism and criticizing what they felt was tacit support by school officials of the students’ protest.

As if following the council’s attempt in October to condemn the Hamas attack and then call for “peace and unity,"" Teaneck School Superintendent Andre Spender issued several messages that critics cited as confusing and contradictory.

Spencer’s first statement on the march said that “some of our scholars will participate in a peaceful demonstration” and that “it is essential to recognize that our scholars have the First Amendment right to express themselves.” The message was seen by critics as supporting the march.

A day later, 13 Orthodox rabbis, in calling on Jewish residents to gather on the municipal green, issued a statement criticizing the students’ planned protest march as “an overtly antisemitic rally” that conjures up “the blood libels of the Middle Ages.”

“Will the grounds of Teaneck High School ring tomorrow with the truly genocidal chant of 'From the River to the Sea'?” the rabbis asked.

Meanwhile, in an apparent response the rabbis’ concerns, Spencer issued another statement — this time specifically noting that while the town’s school district “respects the scholars’ right to engage in a peaceful demonstration this does not connote an endorsement of walkouts or messages.”

Spencer also promised that any student who left class to participate in the protest would “receive a zero for missed classwork” and “marked with an unexcused absence.”

“Our teachers will continue to provide engaging lessons,” he added, noting that “consistent with the district’s intolerance of any type of bigotry, including antisemitism or Islamophobia, the demonstration will be peaceful.”

Like the council’s attempt a month earlier to tamp down tensions, critics derided Spencer’s message as too late and too little — certainly not strong enough and laced with language that offered no clear voice.

At the Jewish rally, numerous speakers denounced Spencer. Several called for him to stop the march or resign.

When Spencer did not block the march, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, the Democrat from Wyckoff who represents Teaneck, issued a statement condemning the students’ chants of “from the river to the sea” and chiding the superintendent for “allowing an antisemitic, anti-Israel protest during school hours.”

“Our schools should be free of hate and hate speech, and, I fear that today, Teaneck High School failed in that mission,” Gottheimer said.

Why didn't Spencer respond to requests for an interview?

Spencer did not respond to requests for an in-person or telephone interview with The Record. Instead a school official who handles public relations, asked for emailed questions.

The Record submitted questions addressing 10 topics, including the demand by critics that he resign. Spencer sent back a 249-word response, noting that Teaneck’s schools are a “place for scholarship and diverse viewpoints, all within a framework of safety for scholars, faculty and employees.”

He noted that the student protest had been monitored by school safety officials, who were in touch with police officials. He said the district does not tolerate bullying or harassment. And he added that the district is “implementing sensitivity training programs and are increasing the number of safety officers at the high school” while also “working with student groups and community organizations to provide opportunities for learning and expression in a safe and supportive environment.”

He did not say what those programs might entail. Nor did he address the calls for his resignation or concerns that his passive approach to student protests essentially allowed them the freedom to voice antisemitic sentiments.

A similar debate over the Israeli-Hamas conflict took place within Teaneck’s powerful Democratic municipal committee.

The committee first issued a statement condemning only Hamas. After much internal squabbling — and an hours-long meeting over Zoom among members on a recent evening — the committee drafted a statement that addressed Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.

Once again, the dueling statements left people angry, confused and politically worn out.“We are a close knit community. Sadly, this was a hard one,” said the Democratic Committee Chairwoman, Alexandra Soriano-Taveras.

“I think we need to take some time to focus on healing in our town and be open to honest dialogue.”

But how to do that?

'Other communities have more space'

From colleges to law firms — even to media organizations — the Israeli-Palestinian war has unearthed all manner of questions about what constitutes fairness, free expression and hate speech. If Teaneck is any mirror for the nation, solutions that lead to improved dialogue and even common ground won’t come easily.

In Teaneck, several notable attempts to find common ground have been tried in recent weeks. Two high school students -- a Muslim and a Jew -- led efforts to establish a dialogue over the Gaza crisis. Also, the town's Ethical Culture Center, long noted as a place that valued common ground, sponsored a gathering where different viewpoints were shared.

Shuli Sandler, a Teaneck psychologist, found herself counseling many residents who felt emotionally overwhelmed as they followed the news from the Middle East. On a recent evening, she hosted a call-in where residents could voice concerns.

“Because Teaneck is a community with a strong Jewish and Muslim population, I think we’re seeing the direct impact of the Middle East conflict,” Sandler said in an interview after the call-in. “Other communities have more space.”

“Is now the time to coexist and give people space or is now the time for dialogue? I don’t know if there is a correct answer,” Sandler said. “For dialogue, you have to find a place of nuance, where people can exist in a shade of gray. Unfortunately there is so much pain right now, we’re not there.”

Loretta Weinberg, 88, a longtime Teaneck resident who retired from the New Jersey state Senate in 2022, is not surprised by Teaneck’s current struggles.

""I fear the town is becoming siloed,"" Weinberg said. ""People are living in their own worlds.""

Weinberg got her start in politics nearly a half-century ago as the chairwoman of Teaneck’s Advisory Board on Community Relations. She was elected to the township council in 1990, only weeks after Teaneck Police Officer Gary Spath shot and killed 16-year-old African American, Phillip Pannell.

The shooting and its legal, political and social aftermath forced Teaneck to reassess its commitment to civil rights and egalitarianism that had its roots decades before.

In the 1930s, as many real estate contracts in New Jersey suburban downs included clauses that prohibited the sale of homes to ""non-Christians,"" Teaneck welcomed Jews. In the 1950s, the town opened its doors to African-Americans. By the 1990s, the town's Muslim population had grown substantially. In the 2000s, Teaneck could point to growing populations of Asians and Latinos.

Few American towns can boast of such diversity. Indeed, one of Teaneck's neighborhoods is now home to a Muslim school, a non-denominational Ethical Culture center, a Jewish Hasidic Chabad House and an evangelical Protestant church with a predominantly Asian congregation. Only a few years ago, that same church had been home a Syrian Christian congregation that worshipped in the ancient Aramaic language -- the same language that Jesus of Nazareth reportedly spoke.

""We are one of the few communities that can boast of having a Mikvah (a Jewish ritual bath) and a mosque,"" Weinberg said. ""We are a unique microcosm of what’s going on in the rest of the world.""

Weinberg wonders if Teaneck’s new residents really understand the town's idealistic but sometimes difficult history of diversity.

Now, Weinberg feels the town is again facing another troubling period.

“Time heals,” she said. “But it takes time.”

60,[New Jersey] https://www.nj.com/,The one Yankee who really needs Juan Soto to stick around | Klapisch,https://www.nj.com/yankees/2023/12/the-one-yankee-who-really-needs-juan-soto-to-stick-around-klapisch.html,"If there’s anything that unites the Yankees family, it’s the decree that says Juan Soto can’t be allowed to leave town. A long-term deal after 2024 is crucial for a million reasons, including Hal Steinbrenner’s credibility, Aaron Boone’s future and preserving the Yankees’ prestige within the industry. All are at stake.

Rank them in any order you like, but there’s a wildcard that’s hovering above the franchise’s endless championship drought. No one needs Soto to come through more than Aaron Judge, who’s entering his ninth year in the big leagues and still hasn’t sniffed a World Series.

Judge signed away the rest of his career to the Yankees last winter. That $360 million contract was backed by a promise from Steinbrenner to keep the Bombers from ever turning into the Red Sox or the Giants, two legacy franchises lost in no-man’s land.

Steinbrenner couldn’t keep his word in 2023, in part because Judge himself missed two months with a broken toe. But the standings have no pity for bad luck and freak injuries: the Yankees won only 82 games and continued a downward spiral that began in 2019.

If I’m Judge, I make sure to smile for the cameras and promise life will be better in 2024. But deep inside, No. 99 has to be wondering where the Yankees go from here. He didn’t sign up for mediocrity.

The trade for Soto was a symbolic triumph – but only if the new slugger doesn’t leave the Yankees in the dust next off-season. The scent of a bigger payday could be an intoxicant.

The same goes for Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who the Yankees are aggressively pursuing. Club officials are optimistic after a face-to-face meeting in Los Angeles on Monday. But like Soto, there’s no guarantee Yamamoto won’t bolt for a more cash from, say, the Dodgers or the Mets.

That’s a dreary scenario for Judge, who’ll be starting his age-32 season in a few months. He’s not old, but no longer young. Most MLB algorithms give Judge 3-4 more years of peak productivity before his decline phase begins.

FIXING THE YANKEES:

Judge doesn’t have time to wait out a Yankees rebuild. Unless Steinbrenner’s money can pull the Bombers out of their slump, Judge could turn into this generation’s Don Mattingly – a superstar, the Captain and face of the franchise in the 80s and early 90s who never made it to the World Series.

That’s why Judge needs to Soto to sign a decade-long contract. Same goes for Gerrit Cole. You can even make the argument that rookie Jasson Dominguez, a fellow Dominican, needs Soto at his side.

But Judge is first on that list, which is why I suspect he was aware of Soto’s comments during a 30-minute Zoom interview with reporters on Tuesday. The superstar was wearing a Yankees hat (smart move) and had his agent Scott Boras on screen (also wise) and otherwise answered the questions perfectly.

Correction: Soto deflected queries about his long-term status. Despite his graciousness and good manners, Soto never once said he has a soft spot for the Yankees. It left little doubt where he’ll be next November.

Not signing off on a $600 million contract in Steinbrenner’s office, not celebrating the long-term commitment with Judge. He’ll be working the market with Boras.

Don’t hate on Soto if he bolts. Free agency is his right. He’ll have earned it. And if Soto and Boras are looking for the very last dollar, they’re both in luck. Mets’ owner Steve Cohen is already printing money in his basement.

So it’ll be up to Judge and Cole and Boone and Brian Cashman to make Soto see the Yankees in a different light: not just one of 30 teams, but No. 1 in culture and legacy.

I ran that idea by Soto. I asked if there was anything his new teammates could say or do to make him fall in love with New York. Soto chuckled and said, “it’s not their job” to recruit.

But it is in Judge’s nature make newcomers feel welcome.

He did so for socially awkward players like Joey Gallo and Josh Donaldson, unpopular ones like Aaron Hicks, and less talented ones like Kyle Higashioka. Even rookies have felt the warmth from Mount Olympus.

Just before the start of the 2023 season, Anthony Volpe went to a high-end tailor in Manhattan. The newcomer needed a suit for his first Yankees road trip. Finally fitted, Volpe tried to pay the bill – but learned Judge had already picked up the tab.

“It’s just what you do,” Judge explained to the Athletic’s Brendan Kuty.

Volpe didn’t need to be won over. Judge had already bought the kid a PS5 console during spring training after learning he and Volpe shared a common interest in playing FIFA.

That’s why Judge’s friendship with Soto is inevitable. That bond may or may not sway a shark like Boras, whose job it will be to leverage as many desperate owners as possible. When it comes to free agency, emotion finishes a distant second to bare-knuckle negotiating.

And it’s very likely Soto feels that way today. Even with all the right responses about the Yankees – “excited…looking forward…just want to win” – Soto wasn’t particularly warm towards the Yankees. It’s just business, nothing personal. For now.

But give it a few months. By then Judge and Soto will be bros. If the Yankees snare Yamamoto, they could be good enough to make fans forget about 2023. They might even declare a truce with Boone. You never know.

If all goes right, Soto and Judge will become the American League’s most feared two-headed monster. The Yankees need it. And so does Judge, perhaps more than anyone else.

61,[New Jersey] https://www.nj.com/,"Time has run out to try man in 1990 sex assault of woman found dead at Shore, court rules",https://www.nj.com/cape-may-county/2023/12/time-has-run-out-to-try-man-in-1990-sex-assault-of-woman-found-dead-at-shore-court-rules.html,"Statute of limitations laws will prevent prosecutors from trying a Millville man for the sexual assault of a woman in Wildwood in 1990, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.

The decision effectively ends the case against Jerry Rosado, who authorities charged in April 2022 with sexually assaulting Susan Negersmith, a 20-year-old found dead and partially clothed behind a restaurant in May 1990.

In 2023, a state appeals court decision led to the dismissal of the charge, due to the statute of limitations, and the state’s highest court on Wednesday decided not to disturb that decision.

Negersmith was from Carmel, New York, in Putnam County, and was at the Jersey Shore with friends for the Memorial Day weekend when she went missing, authorities said.

Authorities found her body on May 27, 1990.

Neither evidence from the scene, which included scrapings from under her fingernails, nor police investigations led to anyone being charged in her assault, or death.

Negersmith’s family in told ABC News in 2015 that her death had first been classified as accidental but was later ruled a homicide after a medical examiner, who later studied autopsy photos, listed 26 points of trauma on the victim’s body. She’d also been sexually assaulted.

Lab testing in 2018 identified Rosado as a person of interest, and authorities later obtained DNA from his body. In June 2021, the DNA matched to Rosado, court decisions say. The Cape May County Prosecutor’s Office then charged Rosado in April 2022, when he was 62 years old, with sexually assaulting Negersmith.

Rosado was not charged with her death.

At the trial level, Rosado’s lawyers argued the statute of limitations at the time of the alleged crime, 1990, was five years, and the clock had run out.

The trial judge, though, denied the argument, saying the clock did not start until 2021, when investigators made a DNA match, citing a 2002 change to the sex assault statute.

Rosado’s lawyers went to the appellate level, where a panel of judges reversed the trial judge, finding the statute of limitations was five years in 1990.

The appeals decision explained how two changes to the sexual assault law since then did not impact this case.

First, in 1996, the statute of limitations for sex assault was removed, starting for cases that had not yet run out, as of May 1, 1996. In the Negersmith case, the statute of limitation for sex assault ended May 27, 1995.

And in 2002, an amendment to the sex assault law provided for a time exception for cases involving DNA or fingerprint evidence. But the amendment provided for no retroactivity, nor does other case state and federal case law.

The state Supreme Court quoted the 2023 appeals decision, which found the 2002 amendment could not reach back and “constitutionally revive” a statute of limitation that had already expired.

The high court’s decision did not even address the case in their own language, and opted to full accept the appeals decision’s language.

The Cape May County Prosecutor’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Eleazar, who requested that only his first name be published for fear of retaliation, lived in a bunker with 49 other workers, without a cooling or heating system.

The now 33-year-old described how workers often suffered illnesses that they blamed on continued exposure to nicotine in the tobacco, as well as symptoms from heat in the fields.

“One day, it hit me hard,” he recalled.

“When I got home, I couldn’t bear it anymore, and it felt like I was getting dizzy. I got sick. I spent two days without going to work. I told the supervisor, and he just told me to take a pill and stay in bed, that’s it. It was the same for everyone … they didn’t pay much attention to us.”

From 2011 to 2023, at least five agriculture, forestry and fishing workers died from heat-related causes in North Carolina, according to state Occupational Safety and Health data.

Thirty-year-old José Arturo González Mendoza may belong on that list — he died on Sept. 5, harvesting sweet potatoes at Barnes Farming & Farm Pak in Nash County. The cause of death is still undetermined, but his brother Gustavo believes José Arturo died because of harsh working conditions exacerbated by extreme heat.

The H-2A visa program has a history of controversy. Advocates say H-2A workers in North Carolina are vulnerable to abuses at each step of the visa program because employers hold so much power over them, making them afraid to speak up.

Still, some farms claim to pose a more progressive model. Advocates also hope that proposed federal regulations, if adopted, would help ameliorate the systemic issues in the program — although many expressed concerns over a lack of staffing in the enforcement agencies.

The H-2A program

González Mendoza arrived in North Carolina from Guanajuato, Mexico, to work as a seasonal farmworker 11 days prior to his death.

The day he died “was a very hot day,” Gustavo said. “His coworkers who were there said he was feeling unwell, and the supervisors told him to keep going because nothing was wrong.

“He collapsed … they took him to the bus and called an ambulance, but it was too late.”

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Barnes Farming wrote: “Each Barnes Farming team member is vital to the Company, to the community, and to the global food supply and, as a Company and a family of devoted team members, we are deeply saddened by the loss of Mr. Gonzalez Mendoza.”

In the H-2A visa program, which allows foreign agricultural workers to temporarily work in the U.S, workers rely on their employers for the visa, transportation, food and housing, in addition to their livelihood.

The H-2 visa program was established in 1952, and later split into H-2A for agricultural workers and H-2B for seasonal non-agricultural employment, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The Department of Labor (DOL) certified 372,000 farm jobs with H-2A workers in fiscal year 2022, up 17% from the previous year, according to Rural Migration News.

But the visa program has raised concerns nationally about what some advocates say is “exploitation” of workers and too-light enforcement.

Barnes Farming and the NC Growers Association

The N.C. Department of Labor is still looking into González Mendoza’s death at Barnes Farming; the department investigates all reports of work-related fatalities.

This is not the first time the farm has been embroiled in controversy over its workers. One of the oldest incidents was a 1983 Congressional oversight hearing that pointed to two labor camp operators for Barnes Farming who repeatedly violated labor laws. Migrant farmworkers sued Barnes Farming in 1986 and 2013 over unpaid or too-low wages and substandard housing conditions.

As part of the earlier statement, the Barnes Farming spokesperson wrote: “The Company takes the health and safety of each one of its team members extremely seriously and has prioritized health and safety since the Farm was started.”

Johnny Barnes, the president of Barnes Farming Corporation, is married to state Senator Lisa Barnes, R-Franklin, Nash, Vance counties.

Barnes Farming is a member of the NC Growers Association, or NC Growers, a network of farm owners across the state. NC Growers helps its members apply for H-2A workers and manages the workers’ visa applications and transportation from their hometowns in Mexico to North Carolina. Then the association jointly employs those workers with the member-farms.

González Mendoza was one of those workers.

NC Growers, founded by former N.C. state government employee Stan Eury, is the largest user of H-2A workers in the country; in 2020, it certified more than 10,000 H-2A positions. The organization also has a history of alleged labor law violations, laid out in a 2015 Buzzfeed investigation — including suits over wage theft and multiple investigations by the federal Labor Department. Another visa company founded by Eury, International Labor Management Corp., was shut down because of visa violations.

Leadership at North Carolina Growers Association did not respond to multiple requests over email and phone for comment.

According to Flor Herrera-Picasso at Casa Azul de Wilson, a Latinx advocacy nonprofit that worked with González Mendoza’s brother Gustavo, the other workers at Barnes Farming experienced intimidation after González Mendoza died.

“They got sent to different camps so that they wouldn’t organize or talk and try to figure something else out or speak up,” she said. “Who investigates this type of behavior when there’s intimidation and trying to silence people?”

Asked about these claims, a spokesperson for Barnes Farming denied any efforts to intimidate workers but didn’t address whether anyone was moved to various camps shortly after the death.

An emailed statement from Barnes Farming said: “Allegations of intimidation by Barnes Farming following the loss of Mr. Gonzalez Mendoza, along with other allegations made due to this tragic incident, are ill-founded and without any basis in fact.”

González Mendoza’s death also sparked calls for N.C. to pass a heat protection law, as laborers complained of limited breaks, inadequate access to shade and insufficient water.

The autopsy of González Mendoza remains pending and is expected to take three to six months, according to Herrera-Picasso. Because of the prolonged wait for results, Herrera-Picasso said Gustavo expressed concern that the autopsy could be tampered with and that he wouldn’t know the cause of his brother’s death before his work permit was up.

The language barrier and little communication from officials and employers can make it difficult for family members to find out what happened to loved ones who died, said the wife of Abraham Gonzalez Cervantes, 53, who passed away in August.

Juana Muñoz Guerrero, his wife, said he expressed feeling unwell but did not receive medical attention in the field where he was working in Wilson County. She said she still doesn’t know how he died.

“In the death certificate that was sent to me with the body, it says it was a possible heart attack,” Muñoz Guerrero said. “From the hospital, they told me that they will continue investigating his death. It could take six or eight months.”

Imbalanced power dynamics

Illegal recruiting fees: Regardless of what might have caused González Mendoza’s death, some farmworkers from outside the U.S. face abuses even before entering the country.

Since he started in 2014, Eleazar said it’s been difficult to find H-2A employment without having to pay illegal recruitment fees, which are sometimes charged to workers by agents who recruit them in their home countries for the H-2A program.

Jocelyn Reyes, director of Promotion, Education, and Leadership Development at Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, a nonprofit that helps Mexico-based migrant workers, said illegal recruiter fees are one of the most common forms of fraud in the H-2A process.

Some recruiters also offer nonexistent job opportunities or falsely describe the pay and working conditions, she said. Reyes said this happens because there isn’t a “structured” recruitment process for employers to get H-2A workers.

Currently, employers who want to hire H-2A workers must provide a copy of agreements with their foreign labor recruiters that “expressly prohibit unlawful fees” if requested by the certifying officer.

A recruitment chain in Mexico for H-2A workers can mean different levels of risk and costs for the workers involved, Reyes said. Because hundreds of individuals or agencies are involved, the Mexican government lacks the capacity to track each recruitment process effectively, she said.

Substandard working conditions: Once farmworkers arrive in the U.S., they may face harsh working and living conditions. One migrant farmworker, 40, works at a farm in Harnett County and wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from his employer. He said the workers’ contract entitles them to a 15-minute break each hour on exceptionally hot days.

Despite this provision and being paid hourly, he said workers experienced pressure from the farm owner if the container was not filled with tobacco leaves within a predetermined time.

A seasonal farmworker of 20 years said the boss will question what workers are doing if they take longer than normal to fill the bowl: “We cannot take more time than what is already checked for us. Once we start filling a bowl, we cannot afford to sit for about 10 minutes,” he said.

Even so, on scorching days, the workers said they took breaks collectively, although they faced threats from the farm owner to report them to the North Carolina Growers Association.

“I prefer preserving my physical well-being over dying there in the field. When it’s excessively hot, we leave, and it has happened twice,” said another farmworker, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from his employer.

Migrant workers at the farm in Harnett County also expressed concern about substandard living conditions in their trailers, including a bed bug infestation. Workers said their beds have blood stains from bed bug bites.

To cope with high temperatures in their trailers, they installed air conditioners, but each individual is required to contribute $10 to the farm owner every eight days for its use.

Going home: After the harvest season concludes, farmworkers affiliated with NC Growers said they must wait until all vacancies at other member farms for the next season’s harvest are filled before leaving the U.S., even if they already have fulfilled their contract on a particular farm.

After finishing their job at the Harnett County farm, three farmworkers said they waited for weeks without employment until early November, when they received permission to return to their home country.

If they had tried to leave before the vacancies were filled, they wouldn’t have received reimbursement for their trip home, they said.

“It’s only when the vacancies for the sweet potatoes and pine trees positions are filled that they will start giving out refunds because there is no more work to offer to other workers,” said one of the workers, who harvests tobacco; he chose to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.

Once workers do have permission to leave, the H-2A employers are supposed to reimburse them for their trips back home — yet some fail to meet this requirement. Even if workers are properly reimbursed, they may have to pay extra fees along the way.

Three farmworkers, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from their employers, said when they cross the U.S.-Mexico border on the buses contracted by the NC Growers Association, they often have to pay additional fees to cross, known as “la mordida,” or bribes.

One of the workers said those charges have gone up — a decade ago, he would pay around $20-30 at the Texas-Mexico border. By 2020, the charges escalated to between $80-100 per worker, he said.

He usually completes the first leg of his trip, from the U.S. to Monterey, Mexico, at 6 in the morning, he said. Then he reaches Michoacán, his destination, around midnight. If the workers don’t pay the bribes, the trip takes far longer, he said.

“If all the luggage were unloaded, it would add another four hours,” he said. “At the border, you might find yourself standing for approximately six to 10 hours. Therefore, we save all that time by paying.”

The money is collected by the driver, who, he assumes, then hands it over to the person overseeing their entry into Mexico.

The fees can also vary depending on certain days or hours when workers cross, one worker said.

Maria Mejia, a member of El Futuro Es Nuestro, a farmworker-led organization that pushes for better working conditions, has been advocating against these fees. She asked workers for anonymous reports of these incidents in 2019.

“We received more than 100 complaints from workers, including photos and recordings of the driver receiving money, and the driver asking a worker to help collect the money”, she said. “Unfortunately, when we tried to take it further, it didn’t go anywhere.”

A Mexican government-escorted troop accompanied some of the buses after a farmworker presented a complaint directly to the Mexican consulate. Eight bus drivers were fired that year, she said, but no lasting changes were made.

Officials, lawyers and advocates

Enforcing laws against abuses within the H-2A visa program can be difficult. Caitlin Ryland, managing attorney at the Farmworker Unit of Legal Aid of NC, said the way the H-2A program is set up creates an imbalanced power dynamic between the employers and the workers.

“You may be disincentivized from reporting something happening at work because of that power dynamic,” she said.

“In fact, if things are really bad, you’re even more disincentivized from speaking up because your employer might be barred from the program in the future and then you lose that income stream and your ability to come back every year,” she said.

Yet the state Labor Department often relies on worker complaints to enforce protections, she said.

“My understanding is that their resources seriously limit their ability to follow up on certain issues or conduct proactive investigations while the workers are here,” Ryland said.

In an emailed statement, Jennifer Haigwood, director of the Occupational Safety and Health Division at N.C. Labor Department, wrote: “The Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau (responsible for migrant housing inspections) has eight inspector positions. Our general Safety and Health Compliance bureaus (covering all general industry and construction) have approximately 100 compliance positions.”

The federal and state labor departments share the responsibility of enforcing standards for H-2A workers. According to Haigwood, the state mostly handles migrant housing inspections and complaints, as well as any workplace safety and health issue that falls under the Occupational Safety and Health Division’s jurisdiction.

Wage payment issues and other protections under H-2A rules are enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Alexis Guild, Vice President of Strategy and Programs at Farmworker Justice, said a similar issue exists at the federal level, with a limited number of U.S. Labor Department inspectors, meaning the agency must rely on worker complaints.

The federal Wage and Hour Division, in charge of investigating things like wage theft, suffers from “severe understaffing” and currently investigates fewer than 1% of farm employers per year, according to a 2023 report from the Economic Policy Institute.

According to a U.S. Labor Department spokesperson, the Wage and Hour Division has 733 investigators. The division enforces federal labor laws in 11 million workplaces for 165 million employees.

In an emailed statement, the spokesperson wrote: “Though we are a small agency, we work tirelessly to protect the rights of the nation’s workforce and engage diverse partners and stakeholders to amplify the impact of our enforcement and outreach efforts.”

When asked about protections for agricultural workers at a press conference, Gov. Roy Cooper said, “There are a lot of different rules and regulations that interact, the Department of Labor here in North Carolina, there are federal rules, there are also rules that I know that the legislature passes.

“I want to continue to work with communities across North Carolina to try to improve those conditions, both in trying to put pressure on businesses, but also getting passed things that are fair that can make sure that people are protected.”

Feds, enforcement and regulations

When workers do complain, some feel they aren’t heard.

According to Haigwood, when the state Labor Department receives complaints, compliance staff first evaluate whether each complaint warrants an investigation. For those that do, they send letters to the employers to give them a chance to respond. Staffers evaluate responses and may conduct onsite inspections if they feel the problem isn’t resolved.

Inspectors always try to interview employees, Haigwood wrote in an emailed statement.

After González Mendoza’s death, the N.C. Labor Department opened an onsite inspection at Barnes Farming, which is ongoing.

But farmworkers say inspectors do not engage with them.

“They only talk to the supervisors. With us, who really have things to discuss, well, no,” said a seasoned seasonal farmworker with 14 years of experience, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from his employer.

An employer who is found to have violated a labor law could be fined or removed from the H-2A program temporarily or permanently, depending on the severity of the violation. Still, some growers have found ways to circumvent the penalty, which is known as debarment.

Investigate Midwest, an independent, nonprofit newsroom based in Illinois, discovered six instances in which employers with the same address, owner or phone number as actively banned companies were approved for H-2A workers.

To initiate a complaint, workers affiliated with the union Farm Labor Organizing Committee, or FLOC, contact a union representative. If the union fails to resolve the matter, workers can communicate with NC Growers, if their employer is part of the association. If resolution is still not achieved, workers can file a complaint with the DOL.

FLOC members work under the terms of a contract that the union negotiated with NC Growers. But the union has come under scrutiny for its alleged lack of responsiveness to farmworkers’ complaints. Questions about its leadership have also surfaced, as revealed in an investigation by The Assembly.

Solutions

Despite the H-2A program’s issues, many see it as a mutual win for foreign workers and American employers.

Timothee Sallin is co-CEO of IMG Enterprises, which operates Cherrylake, an ornamental horticulture company in Florida. Cherrylake started using the H-2A program a decade ago, because not a lot of domestic workers wanted to do the challenging physical labor required for its crops, Sallin said.

Sallin said he sees the H-2A program as highly regulated. He has to show that he exhausted all options for American workers before hiring foreign workers, and that the workers are carrying out the labor his work order describes.

“If we were banned from the program, it could very well spell the end of our business because we wouldn’t be able to go on producing,” he said.

A majority of his workers want to come back and work for him every year, he said, which tells him that he’s providing a good working environment.

He said workers make much better wages than they might at home, along with access to health insurance and 401K plans. At Cherrylake, most workers live in a 16,000-square-foot facility on the farm that Sallin designed, which has eight three-bedroom units.

“I know from speaking with them that many of them have been able to save a lot of money and use that money to build houses back in their home country. Some of them have gone back to school. Some of them have started businesses,” he said.

Without the H-2A program, Sallin said there would be no regulation on the importation of foreign labor.

Hope for change

Advocates are hopeful that proposed federal regulations to the H-2A program, if passed, would strengthen worker protections and enforcement.

“The new rule is being specific, stating that there will be consequences for employers who are not vigilant about these charges or who may be permissive, meaning they could be punished with several years of not being granted certifications to bring in workers for another season,” Reyes said.

Guild said the proposed regulations aim to make it easier for H-2A workers to get health care and join unions, shield workers from retaliation, and tighten debarment rules to prevent banned companies from continuing to hire H-2A workers.

“These proposed regulations are very positive and will strengthen protections for workers and hopefully also strengthen effective enforcement on the DOL side to prevent abuse within the program,” she said.

However, Guild said she expects that the rules, once finalized, will be subject to litigation.

The comment period on the proposed regulations ended Nov. 14. The USDOL must review all the comments before the regulations are reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Then the final rule is published in the Federal Register with responses to the comments.

A man has been charged in connection with the fatal stabbing of well-known Detroit synagogue president Samantha Woll, 40, whose body was found outside her home Oct. 21, the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office announced Wednesday. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Michael Jackson-Bolanos, 28, of Detroit, has been charged with felony murder committed “while in perpetration or attempted perpetration of a larceny and/or a home invasion in the first degree,” Kym Worthy, the county prosecutor, said at a news conference. He was also charged with “one count of home invasion and one count of lying to a Peace Officer,” police said on social media.

Worthy said “there’s not a shred of evidence to suggest that this is a hate crime,” and that the case had been “consistently investigated” since Oct. 21. She also said there are no facts to suggest Jackson-Bolanos knew Woll.

Woll led the board of the Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue and had spent years working in Democratic politics in Detroit, including for Rep. Elissa Slotkin and on the reelection campaign of Attorney General Dana Nessel.

Medical examiners determined that she was killed by “multiple sharp force wounds with a straight edge cutting instrument,” Worthy said. She declined to comment on whether they believe the suspect acted alone or on his history with the criminal justice system.

Detroit Police Chief James E. White said it was one of the most complex cases he had been involved in and that police became aware of the suspect a few weeks ago, linked to “a number of larcenies.” They released Jackson-Bolanos after questioning but kept him on their radar until they had enough information to make an arrest, White said.

Woll’s family released a statement following the news of the charges, thanking investigators for their work and describing Woll as “a devoted, community activist, leader and bridge builder,” the Detroit Free Press reported.

In Woll’s eulogy in October, Rabbi Ariana Silverman said, “so many people think of her as someone with whom they had a particularly close or important relationship, and each of them is right.”"

A top Australian court on Thursday quashed all the convictions against a woman who spent 20 years in prison over the deaths of her four children. Kathleen Folbigg, 56, was pardoned and released from prison in June after an inquiry found there was “reasonable doubt” as to whether she was responsible for the deaths of her children, who all died before their 2nd birthdays.

Once branded by the news media as Australia’s “worst female serial killer,” Folbigg maintained her innocence throughout. Speaking outside the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Sydney on Thursday, she said prosecutors had “cherry-picked” entries in her diary to secure the 2003 conviction that found her guilty of killing her children.

“They took my words out of context and turned them against me,” she told local reporters.

The diary entries were central to the prosecution’s case, in a trial that was based largely on circumstantial evidence and the argument that four deaths within the same family could not have happened by chance.

“I knew I was short-tempered and cruel sometimes to her and she left. With a bit of help,” she wrote in one diary entry about her daughter, Sarah, that drew scrutiny during the trial.

The jury concluded that she had smothered the children, who were found, one after the other, lifeless in their cribs between 1989 and 1999: Caleb at 19 days, Patrick at eight months, Sarah at 10 months and Laura at 18 months.

Folbigg was sentenced to 40 years in prison for murder and manslaughter, a sentence that was reduced to a minimum of 25 years on appeal.

In a 2018 documentary, she said the diary entries were written “from a point of me always blaming myself” — a trait experts say is common in bereaved parents.

“I took so much of the responsibility, because that’s, as mothers, what you do,” Folbigg said in the documentary.

Doubts about her conviction grew in recent years as new science emerged.

In 2021, dozens of scientists — including two Nobel laureates — petitioned the state governor to request that Folbigg be pardoned and released. They argued that there was “significant positive evidence of natural causes of death” after finding rare genetic mutations in the DNA of Folbigg and her daughters as well as variants in her sons’ DNA that have been connected to deaths in young children.

In November, the final report of an inquiry into the case found there was an “identifiable cause” for three of the children’s deaths and that Folbigg’s relationship with her children did not support the case that she killed them.

The overturning of Folbigg’s convictions creates a path for her to seek compensation over her wrongful imprisonment. Representatives for Folbigg didn’t respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

In a statement to the Guardian newspaper, her attorney, Rhanee Rego, suggested that it could be “bigger than any substantial payment that has been made before.”

71,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,"Argentina’s president Javier Milei embraces, studies Judaism",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/14/milei-judaism-torah-religion-argentina-israel-jewish/,"Listen 6 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

But Javier Milei, Argentina’s new leader after a speedy political rise, goes far beyond that. The Argentine president, despite being raised Catholic, claims to have been a student of the Jewish Torah for the last few years. He has suggested he may convert to Judaism, a religion that does not typically seek out converts.

Advertisement

Milei’s interest in religion is not his most pressing belief. The self-proclaimed “anarcho-capitalist” president on Wednesday announced sharp spending cuts and a devaluation of Argentina’s currency, the peso, after just two days in office. But in some ways, his devotion to Judaism is a sign of his unusual personality type: that of a fervent convert.

Shortly after winning the Nov. 19 runoff election, Milei arrived in New York to pay his respects at the tomb of Menachem Mendel Schneerson — a renowned Orthodox Jewish rabbi buried in Queens. It is at least the second time he’s visited the grave in recent years. At his inauguration Sunday, Milei handed a menorah to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and referenced the Maccabean revolt against Hellenistic oppression.

Milei’s embrace of Judaism could influence Argentina’s foreign policy. Milei has already pledged to move Argentina’s Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, despite the disputed status of the latter city. At a Jewish Hanukkah festival in Buenos Aires on Tuesday, he offered unambiguous support for Israel amid the conflict in Gaza.

“We know that the forces of heaven will support Argentina and above all will support Israel at this time. Thank you very much and long live freedom, damn it,” he said.

Milei is nothing if not idiosyncratic. He has become famous for his outlandish style, including his hair (his nickname at home: “The Wig”). He proudly calls himself an “anarcho-capitalist” who has pledged shock therapy for the long-pained Argentine economy. His cuts on Tuesday are believed to be just the start: He wants to ditch the peso and adopt the U.S. dollar.

Argentina, which is home to a large Jewish community, estimated at around 250,000, has generally held friendly relations with Israel. There were significant tensions after World War II, when Argentina became a home for some escaped former Nazi officials, but relations later improved and Israel even sold arms to Argentina during its military dictatorship.

Milei’s path to support Israel comes from another direction. In an article published November in Tablet, Argentine journalist Martin Sivak wrote how accusations, made by members of the country’s political elite, that Milei was a Nazi sympathizer had stung the far-right economist. In response, Milei turned to a Jewish member of his party, Julio Goldestein, who introduced him to Shimon Axel Wahnish, the chief rabbi of ACILBA, which represents the Moroccan Jewish community of Argentina.

“They spoke at length, and then it turned into a kabbalistic meeting in which the rabbi noted that Javier would lead a liberationist movement in Argentina. Milei left the meeting excited,” Goldestein told Sivak.

This turned into a prolonged personal interest. Indeed, if Milei doesn’t convert to Judaism, he has suggested his reasons would not be political but rather religious. “If you are Jewish because your mother is Jewish, you are not obligated to comply with the precepts of Judaism. If you convert, you are obligated to,” Sivak quotes Milei as saying. “If I become president, what will I do during Shabbat? Are you going to disconnect from the country at sundown Friday to sundown Saturday? Questions like this make it incompatible.”

Remarks like these are a reminder of just how different Milei is. The Argentine leader may get lumped in with Orban, Trump or his neighbor in Brazil, former president Jair Bolsonaro, but they seem unlikely to publicly opine on the precepts of Judaism. Here is the fervor of a convert: Milei speaks about religion in a manner unlike even Benjamin Netanyahu, the right-wing leader of Israel and the son of a scholar of Jewish history.

Read the transcript of the interview that Milei conducted with the Economist in September and you will not get just the cynical chauvinism or simple machismo shown by other right-wing leaders, but something much more unusual. Here, he spoke of his embrace of Judaism in economic terms.

“If I am a liberal-libertarian, it is clear that the book of Shemot, or if you want it in English, the book of Exodus, for me is absolutely revealing: it narrates the departure from Egypt to the promised land. So for me it is an epic. Obviously, in that context, my admiration for Moses is ... let’s say ... is absolute. Why? Because he is, if you will, the first great liberator. And he and his brother Aaron confronted the Pharaoh, who was like the leader of the world’s great power at that time,” Milei said, per the transcript.

Advertisement

Judaism is just one example of the Argentine president’s unusual array of interests. In the same interview, Milei spoke of the limits of Keynesian economics, his love of British rock bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and his interest in cosplaying. He refused to confirm or deny that his dogs (five English mastiffs, all cloned and mostly named after American conservative economists) helped advise him on his policy programs.

Milei is likely to be a rare ally for Israel in Latin America, where some countries have taken diplomatic moves in protest of Israel’s military operations against Hamas in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen this week visited Buenos Aires, where Milei told him he supported “Israel’s full right to defend itself against those terrorist attacks.”

But Milei may have his contradictions. He attracted attention in Israeli media early this month not for his interest in Judaism, but for appointing Rodolfo Barra to head a Treasury prosecution office: Barra is a former Justice minister forced to resign in 1996 following revelations about his past in a violent neo-Nazi group."

Dear Amy: My son married a wonderful woman several years ago. They have a 1-year-old child. I genuinely like her side of the family and have a good relationship with her mother, “Marianne.” My issue is with Marianne’s financial irresponsibility, which is an apparent ingrained generational pattern. My son and his wife just purchased their first home. They both make enough to pay the bills — but just barely.

Her mother has a good career and makes very good money at her job. However, she has very little to show for it, with no savings or homeownership. There are many examples of her being impulsive and wasteful. The issue is her regularly needing and asking for help with her bills or unexpected expenses.

If she was less impulsive with her spending, she wouldn’t have to do this. This puts a burden on my son and his wife and creates friction. My daughter-in-law’s extended family members are in no position to help.

Advertisement

I so badly want to say something when I hear about her circumstances and how they helped with her most recent issue, but I don’t. I’d like to tell them to stop doing this, but I don’t. Is there anything I CAN do?

— Stewing in Silence

Stewing: The only thing you can — and should — do is to clearly state your own boundaries regarding finances and to outline your ability or willingness to help your son and his wife. The reason to do this is because, if your daughter-in-law’s mother siphons money away from the younger couple, they might end up coming to you for an emergency bailout.

Even if this style of money mismanagement and financial irresponsibility isn’t an ingrained generational pattern, it does become a generational problem when loans or bailouts create financial hardship for the giver, because they will then kick the problem down the road — possibly to you.

State your intentions very clearly: “I’m sorry you are in this position. This creates a lot of financial pressure for you. I hope you understand that I don’t want to be put in the position to bail you out. I am very fond of Marianne. I don’t want to be ungenerous or unkind, but I am not willing or able to help finance her life. I hope you two can protect your own financial future.”

Here’s a book you might recommend (or give) to your son and his wife: “Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk: How to Have Essential Conversations With Your Parents About Their Finances,” by Cameron Huddleston (2019, Wiley).

Dear Amy: I’ve been married for three years. Last year, my folks gave me and my husband DNA testing kits for Christmas. My husband participated in the process and has been very interested in the results. I have decided not to.

I was adopted as a newborn and was raised in a great family. I have never known anything about my biological family, and so far I am fine with that. I am mixed-race (my husband is White), and he is pushing really hard for me to learn more about my DNA heritage. It is starting to feel uncomfortable. I’d appreciate your point of view.

Confused: When it comes to your body, your DNA and your family history, my view is that you alone own the right to make decisions. These tests are marketed as swell holiday gifts, and DNA disclosures have offered up many fascinating experiences and new relationships.

However, there are myriad issues that arise with DNA collection, and for people who were adopted, these issues are multiplied manyfold. You don’t say why your husband is so keen for you to have this done (is he wondering about the racial identity of children you two might have?), but if his pushing for this is pushing you away, you two should take this issue to a professional counselor.

In my opinion, your husband is not respecting a fundamental right for you to make decisions about your own body.

Dear Amy: “Sad Grandma” was worried about how to deal with her daughter and very active 3-year-old granddaughter during a 10-day visit.

Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: My sister, her husband and their toddler moved cross-country to be closer to family. Since they’ve arrived, my retired parents have been less helpful than perhaps my sister and brother-in-law had anticipated. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Maybe this will change when their child gets older and is less of a terrible toddler, but to make up for some of this lack of help, I’ve felt compelled to step in and help with cooking and cleaning, pickup from day care, babysitting, etc., two days a week. My work is flexible, I’m interested in helping my sister and I have the time.

My husband and I are child-free by choice, and he’s not interested in spending much time around a raucous toddler — for which I don’t blame him one bit. My concern is that we may eventually resent the situation we’re in. I don’t want my sister to feel isolated after moving across the country for some help. I also don’t want my husband to feel abandoned because he really didn’t sign up for this. Any advice?

— Anxiety-Ridden Aunt

Anxiety-Ridden Aunt: Communication. That’s where you begin — and maybe stay. You don’t mention whether your husband objects or feels any resentment.

You didn’t ask about this specifically, but I hope at least someone in your family is aware — and wary — of some assumptions embedded in your question. The only guarantee in your sister’s move “to be closer to family” was less physical distance. Even if your parents made huge promises to help, there’s no system for collecting on such promises. What if parents and sis had different definitions of “help”? What if someone got sick?

Share this article Share

Any “lack of help” this family has experienced upon their arrival is actually rooted in their well-intentioned mistake for making assumptions. Anything volunteered and unpaid is nice to have; “must-haves” need Plan Bs.

Advertisement

I’m spelling this out because such assumptions and boundary-blurrings often are family traits, instead of the work of one individual member. And if you’ve carried some obligation or guilt wiring from your origin family into your marriage family, then that might create problems for you with your husband, especially if you’re just assuming all of this and not talking it through.

Look at your language: You’re doing this to “make up for” your parents and you feel “compelled.” You frame two days a week on a pursuit outside your marriage as “abandon[ment].” That is all conjured. There is no obligation or abandonment; there is only wanting or not wanting to help, plus mindfulness at home.

If you’re talking about seeing a beloved family member working super hard to hold it together, and you love her and want to ease her burden, and you’re transparent with your husband about that, then yay for you! That’s great stuff. Help away. But that’s feeling “compelled” by your own love and your own values, which is something completely different from being compelled by a presumed obligation.

Dear Miss Manners: My fiancé and I will be hosting two friends in our new home. We have one guest bedroom, and plan to set up the other person on an air mattress in our living room. Both soon-to-be-guests know the situation. One of them has been repeatedly texting us, adamantly requesting, and even trying to guilt us into saving the guest bedroom for her.

We were initially planning on giving her the room, but quite frankly, I'm so annoyed now that I'd rather give it to our other friend.

What is the proper etiquette when you’re going to be a guest at another’s home? Is it acceptable to demand a particular room?

Although she sympathizes with your plight, Miss Manners cannot help noticing that you did this to yourself.

Telling your guests that one of them will be sleeping on the floor mattress — without specifying which one — was bound to leave both feeing like contestants on a desert-island survival program.

Ideally, you would have made a defensibly objective determination from the start: “Jasper is going to have the baby with him, so we think he will need the guest room.”

Now, you will simply have to choose and ask the other to be understanding. And, as you already suspect, unfair as it may be, you will likely get less resistance to sleeping in the living room from the silent friend.

Dear Miss Manners: I frequent a gas station that has four sets of pumps (with nozzles on both sides), a convenience store/coffee shop, plenty of parking away from the pumps, and designated handicapped spaces right near the door.

I regularly observe drivers pull their cars up to the pumps, get out, go into the store, come back out, get into their cars and leave — without pumping any gas. Meanwhile, there are cars lined up waiting for a pump.

For reasons I cannot explain, this behavior really irritates me. Are we so lazy that we can’t walk the extra 30 feet from a parking space on the side of the station, instead of blocking a pump because it’s closer to the door?

Probably. Even though surely everyone knows that inconveniencing others — by tying up a resource you are not using — is obviously discourteous.

Irritating as it is, you cannot redirect it. Bad things happen when one walks into oncoming traffic.

Miss Manners can already imagine what is heading her way: People intent on justifying the behavior. “There wasn’t anyone waiting for the pumps when I went in,” they may say, or, “It’s also a parking space, and that’s what I was using it for.” “I was there first.” “I have a weak bladder and I had to get to the bathroom urgently.”

She hopes that she will not see you approaching in the other direction, this answer in hand, bent on rudely accosting the next transgressor.

75,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Russian drones rain death on Ukraine’s eastern front lines,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/russian-drones-rain-death-on-ukraines-eastern-fron/,"CHASIV YAR, Ukraine — In the early hours of a cold morning in November, a worn-out pick-up truck barrels down a potholed road in the region of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Dawn is still a couple of hours away, and a thick fog shrouds much of the surrounding countryside.

Yet, the car’s headlights remain turned off even as it swerves wildly to avoid potholes and incoming armored vehicles. It’s the new reality as the danger from Russian drones has increased in both quantity and lethality along the perilous front — being spotted here can quickly mean being dead.

While the Ukrainian army was an early proponent of drone warfare, and initially boasted both a qualitative and quantitative advantage in the nearly 22-month war, Russian forces have quickly adapted their tactics, as the Kremlin’s UAV production now far outpaces that of Ukraine.

In a recent interview with German media Deutsche Welle, Giorgi Tskhakaia, an adviser to the Ukrainian minister for digital transformation, said that Ukraine had increased domestic drone production “100-fold, in some cases 150-fold, possibly even more,” yet the country’s armed forces still remain in critically short supply.

Russian drone use, plus a more sophisticated defensive array involving trenches and redeployments, is credited with effectively blunting a highly touted Ukrainian counteroffensive this year. Ukrainian commanders reported that any significant offensive movements were instantly picked up by Russian surveillance drones.

According to Maksym Sheremet, founder and CEO of UAV manufacturer DroneSpace, Ukrainian companies are only able to produce approximately 50,000 FPV drones a month – Russian companies can churn out six times that number, at a cost of less than $1,000 per drone.

“The simple fact is that we see everything the enemy is doing and they see everything we are doing,” respected Ukrainian Commander Gen. Zaluzhny wrote in The Economist last month. The result: Ukrainian forces, who took back nearly 8,700 square miles of territory in a stunning offensive in the fall of 2022, have reclaimed just 200 square miles of land from the Russians in 2023.

Russia emboldened

Clad in bulletproof vests and helmets, the pick-up truck’s four passengers – drone operators of Ukraine‘s 28th Mechanized Brigade – are silent, occasionally glancing at their phones or taking a drag of their e-cigarettes.

This morning, they are headed towards the small town of Chasiv Yar, which has become over the past months a flashpoint of the fighting as emboldened Russian forces step up their efforts to capture the entirety of Ukraine‘s eastern Donetsk region, a region that President Vladimir Putin has already unilaterally declared is now part of Russia’s sovereign territory.

As the pick-up gets closer to the front, the rumble of artillery grows increasingly louder in the distance, each detonation followed by the orange glow of an incandescent projectile tearing through the night sky: Ukrainian air defenses are hard at work, though their target remains unseen.

After a 30-minute drive through ruined villages and barren, frozen fields, the pick-up finally comes to a halt near a snow-covered treeline, located about 500 yards away from the nearest Russian positions. Without missing a beat, the soldiers jump out of the truck and grab their gear — a relay connecting to the constellation of Starlink satellites overhead, four commercial drones and a black suitcase labeled “FPV,” adorned with hand-drawn smiley faces.

One of the men curses upon discovering the position, a rudimentary trench snaking across the treeline. The once-frozen ground has thawed and turned into a thick layer of treacherous black mud. “You start setting up the drones, I’ll find the bucket,” orders 25-year-old Andrii (by custom, Ukrainian troops on the front lines are identified only by a first name), as he removes his bulletproof vest and starts shoveling mud out of the trench.

Another soldier takes up position in the dimly-lit dugout and begins carefully strapping fragmentation shells to their drones, fastening the payload with zip ties. For the past months, Andrii’s team has been using the set-up to drop explosives on Russian armored vehicles, infantry positions and – on at least one occasion – a Soviet-built T-64 tank.

“As you can see, we now have to drive at night, under the cover of darkness, to avoid Russian drones,” says Andrii, a veteran of the war in Ukraine‘s eastern Donbas region. “They’re absolutely everywhere.”

Ubiquitous threat

Cheap, easy to maneuver and lethal, FPV drones have become a ubiquitous threat on Ukraine‘s sprawling frontline.

According to Evguenii, an officer of the 28th brigade interviewed a couple of days earlier in the center of Kramatorsk, the Russians are using FPV drones to devastating effect to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines and target troop concentrations.

“They’ve basically rendered entire portions of the front line inaccessible. I’d say that now 90% of the casualties are from FPV drones – on both sides of the front,” he observes.

The lack of air-defense systems has left Ukrainian artillery crews especially vulnerable to Russian drones.

“We simply don’t have enough air defense to cover all of the frontline, and that has seriously impeded our work,” says Andrii, a captain of Ukraine‘s 47th brigade fighting near Kupyansk, in the Kharkiv region, gesturing towards a charred portion of the treeline in which his unit has taken position.

A couple of weeks earlier, a Russian FPV drone had destroyed one of their 2S1 self-propelled howitzers, though the crew had escaped unscathed.

“Even travelling at night might not be an option for much longer,” says Bohdan, a soldier of the 10th “Edelweiss” Mountain Assault Brigade. “More and more of [the Russian drones] are now outfitted with thermal imagery cameras, or night vision.”

Near miss

Just days prior to our conversation, Bohdan and another officer only narrowly survived an encounter with a Russian FPV drone: “They spotted us as we were getting to the position, so we had to jump into a nearby basement. The pilot tried to fly the drone through the door but he missed, and it exploded about 10 meters away from us.”

As the sun finally rises on Chasiv Yar, a firefight breaks out a couple of hundred yards away from the treeline.

Automatic gunfire and the distinctive crack of outgoing mortar rounds echo all around, yet Andrii and his fellow soldiers have more pressing issues: In spite of the rain and the mud, they’ve finally managed to set up the Starlink satellite connection, and have just received the coordinates of a target.

But despite their best efforts, the drone won’t take off.

“When it’s cold, the batteries don’t last as long, and the humidity interferes with the signal,” says Andrii, as another soldier climbs out of the trench to move the antenna.

“I’ve got it,” the pilot exclaims triumphantly as the drone finally takes off and roars towards the Russian positions – before promptly crashing in a nearby field.

Cursing loudly, the dejected soldiers head back inside the dugout. They can’t afford to lose another drone to the weather, so their work for the day is over.

Now begins the long, dull wait until nighttime, when they’ll finally be able to make their way back under the cover of darkness."
76,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Russia’s military budget boost indicates Putin aims to stay in Ukraine, analysts claim",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/russias-military-budget-boost-indicates-putin-aims/,"Russia doesn’t appear to be throwing in the towel in Ukraine and is hiking its military budget to bring the war to a close.

Military spending will rise sharply in 2024 under a new budget signed into law last month by President Vladimir Putin. The measure suggests that Moscow is committed to continuing its two-year-old war against its smaller neighbor, according to an analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The just-released SIPRI report estimates that Russia‘s 2024 military budget — $140 billion — will be 29% higher than the year before. It means the Kremlin will earmark 35% of all government expenditures to military and war-related spending.

“With planned reductions in military spending in 2025-26 after a sharp increase in 2024, and with the Russian presidential election due in 2024, Putin appears to be showing his intent to bring the war to a successful conclusion within the year,” SIPRI Director Dan Smith said Wednesday.

The fighting in Ukraine appears to be at a stalemate, with little prospect of a military breakthrough for either side, Mr. Smith said.

“While Putin may be counting on the West’s support for the war fragmenting, the West is counting on the war bankrupting Putin’s regime,” he said. “Neither assumption is a sure thing, [but] neither is impossible.”

Wednesday’s SIPRI report comes the day after Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy visited Washington for meetings at the White House and Congress for more money. U.S. officials have warned that military funding for Ukraine is on the verge of running out. Some Republicans in Congress have linked further support for Ukraine to a plan to increase security at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Kremlin’s budget plan assumes that government revenues will increase by at least 22% in 2024. SIPRI researchers called that optimistic because it’s based on sizable revenues from oil, gas and other economic activities that would be vulnerable to tightening international sanctions or a deteriorating global economy.

Russia will likely increase the country’s military budget next year by slashing domestic spending for 2024. As a share of total spending, housing support will drop to 2.2% from 2.8%, with health care costs falling to 4.4% from 5.2%, SIPRI researchers said.

Russian war-related spending is not limited to guns and bombs under the new budget. It includes money for rebuilding war-damaged structures on Russian territory, SIPR analysts said.

77,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will travel to Israel,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/jake-sullivan-white-house-national-security-advise/,"National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will travel to Israel this week to speak with officials about their timetable for completing the next phase of the war against Hamas, the White House announced Wednesday.

Mr. Sullivan will visit the Jewish state on Thursday and Friday. He will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his war Cabinet and President Isaac Herzog, White House spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said.

Speaking publicly Tuesday, Mr. Sullivan said he wants to speak with Israeli officials about their post-war plan for the Gaza Strip, where the Palestinian militant group reigns.

“The subject of how they are seeing the timetable of this war will certainly be on the agenda for my meetings,” Mr. Sullivan said at a Wall Street Journal forum without saying when he planned to visit.

The trip comes as President Biden has begun to express increased concern about the death of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, even as he has expressed strong support for the Israeli war effort.

At a campaign fundraiser Wednesday, Mr. Biden said Israel has most of the world’s support, but “they’re starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place.”

Mr. Biden is scheduled to meet with family members of Americans taken hostage by Hamas during its Oct. 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed.

78,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Ambush kills 9 Israeli soldiers in Gaza City, where battles rage weeks into devastating offensive",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/ambush-kills-9-israeli-soldiers-in-gaza-where-batt/,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian militants ambushed Israeli troops in a dense Gaza City neighborhood, killing at least nine of them, media reported Wednesday, as Hamas put up stiff resistance in areas that Israel has isolated and pounded with airstrikes for over nine weeks.

The air and ground offensive has resulted in the deaths of over 18,400 Palestinians, mostly civilians, since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that triggered the war. Nearly 85% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes, and much of the territory’s north resembles a moonscape.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has repeatedly called on Israel to take greater measures to spare Palestinian civilians, even as it has blocked international calls for a cease-fire and rushed military aid to its close ally.

More than six weeks after Israeli soldiers invaded Gaza‘s north, ground troops are still locked in heavy combat with Palestinian fighters in and around Gaza City. Clashes raged overnight and into Wednesday in multiple areas, with especially heavy fighting in Shijaiyah, a dense neighborhood that was the scene of a major battle during the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas.

“It’s terrifying. We couldn’t sleep,” Mustafa Abu Taha, a Palestinian agricultural worker who lives in the neighborhood, said by phone. “The situation is getting worse and we don’t have a safe place to go.”

Army Radio said troops who were searching a cluster of buildings in Shijaiyah on Tuesday lost communication with four soldiers who had come under fire, sparking fears of a possible abduction. When the other soldiers launched a rescue operation, they were ambushed with heavy gunfire and explosives.

Among the nine dead were Col. Itzhak Ben Basat, 44, the most senior officer to have been killed in the ground operation, and Lt. Col. Tomer Grinberg, a battalion commander.

The military confirmed the deaths but did not respond to a request for further comment. Several Israeli media outlets carried similar accounts of the battle.

Heavy rainfall overnight swamped tent camps in Gaza‘s south, where Israel has told people to seek refuge, even as that region has also come under repeated aerial bombardment.

Because of the fighting and Israel’s blockade of Gaza, the health care system and humanitarian aid operations have collapsed in large parts of the territory, and aid workers have warned of starvation and the spread of disease among displaced people.

Israeli strikes overnight hit two residential buildings in the southern province of Khan Younis, where Israeli ground forces had launched a new line of attack earlier this month.

A strike on a home near the main highway between Khan Younis and the southern border town of Rafah killed two boys, aged 2 and 8, a woman in her 80s and a woman in her 30s, according to Mohammed al-Beiyouk, a relative of the deceased. Another strike killed a baby and his grandfather, according to hospital records at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.

The military rarely comments on individual strikes. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames the high toll on Hamas because it conceals fighters, tunnels and weapons in residential areas.

Biden said Tuesday that he told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel was losing international support because of its “indiscriminate bombing” and that Netanyahu should change his government, which is dominated by hard-right parties.

But the offensive is being conducted by a war Cabinet that includes two politically centrist retired generals, and has overwhelming support among Israelis from across the political spectrum.

In Israel, attention is still focused on the atrocities carried out on Oct. 7, when some 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and some 240 people were taken hostage, around half of whom remain in captivity.

There has been little media coverage or public discussion of the plight of civilians in Gaza, even as international outrage has continued to mount.

On Tuesday, the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for a humanitarian cease-fire. The nonbinding vote was symbolic, but served as a barometer of world opinion. None of the major powers joined Israel and the United States in their opposition.

Still, the U.S. has urged Israel to do more to reduce civilian casualties as the toll has continued to mount at a dizzying rate.

Over 18,400 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, whose counts from previous conflicts have tracked with Israeli and U.N. figures. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but says roughly two-thirds of the dead are women and minors.

Israel and the U.S. say any cease-fire that leaves Hamas in power would mean victory for the militant group, which has governed Gaza since 2007 and has pledged to destroy Israel. But the two allies disagree over what should happen if Hamas is defeated.

The U.S. hopes to revive the peace process, which ground to a halt more than a decade ago. It wants the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to also govern Gaza, which Hamas seized from it in 2007.

But President Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the PA, is extremely unpopular, in part because of his security cooperation with Israel, and he has ruled out any return to Gaza outside of a solution to the conflict that creates a Palestinian state.

Netanyahu’s government is firmly opposed to Palestinian statehood.

79,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,‘Misinformation’ service NewsGuard targeted in defense bill,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/inside-ring-misinformation-service-newsguard-targe/,"NEWS AND ANALYSIS:

The 2024 defense authorization bill now in its final stages on Capitol Hill contains a provision that would restrict the Pentagon from spending money on an advertising agency that relies on the self-described “counter-misinformation” group NewsGuard, a blow to the left-leaning organization that critics say unfairly targets conservative media.

The restriction in the proposed annual National Defense Authorization Act recently survived a House-Senate conference. The final bill is being taken up by both chambers this week.

The provision calls on the defense secretary to ensure all ad agencies that contract with the Defense Department do not “place advertisements in news sources based on personal or institutional political preferences or biases, or determinations of misinformation.”

The section also requires that the defense secretary and military service secretaries notify Congress whenever an ad agency employs NewsGuard, a similar British-based group called the Global Disinformation Index, or similar services.

The provision is a response by several House Republicans who have said that self-appointed anti-misinformation watchdog groups are effectively being used to target conservative media outlets.

Rep. Doug Lamborn, Colorado Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee, said the final provision was not as strong as the curbs he originally sought. But the restrictions are moving in the right direction, he added.

“It is unacceptable for the Department of Defense to contract with companies that censor news sources based on subjective criteria,” Mr. Lamborn said in a statement.

“The Department of Defense should be spending taxpayer money on our national defense — not propping up companies that mute conservative voices,” he added. “I will continue to fight these kinds of harmful policies from my position [as subcommittee chairman] in future versions of the NDAA.”

NewsGuard spokesman Matt Skibinski said the company has never contracted with the government on the placement of ads.

NewsGuard is “pleased to see that the bill’s language achieves the goal of maximizing military recruitment advertising campaigns while preserving the Pentagon’s ability to use the best tools in market, including NewsGuard’s Misinformation Fingerprints, for the important goal of combating foreign state-sponsored information operations in Russia, China, and Iran/Hamas,” he said in a statement.

Gordon Crovitz, a co-founder of NewsGuard, denied his group is left wing. “The criteria we use to assess news sources on their journalistic practices are apolitical,” he said.

Mr. Crovitz said the Pentagon work by NewsGuard is not related to rating news sites or advertising. Analysts at the group hunt for Russian, Chinese and Iranian or Hamas disinformation claims, he said.

Steve Brill, NewsGuard chief executive, is a former Wall Street Journal reporter who has since become a high-profile Democratic Party supporter and donor. Under Mr. Brill, NewsGuard has tangled with conservative news outlets in what critics said was an attempt to scare off advertisers.

In October 2020, Mr. Brill called reports about the laptop computer owned by President Biden’s son Hunter “a hoax perpetrated by the Russians.” The authenticity of the laptop has since been confirmed by both the federal government and many media outlets.

NewsGuard came under fire recently from Elon Musk, whose social media site, X, issued a warning about the news rating service in November. The company’s @Safety account stated in a post that its platform had been unfairly targeted by NewsGuard, and Mr. Musk said in a post in October that “NewsGuard should be disbanded immediately.”

The NDAA provision was first reported by Newsmax, a cable news service that has also been a target of the service.

“People like Steve Brill and groups like NewsGuard masquerade as neutral journalists but they are nothing more than Democratic Party operatives,” said Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax Media Inc.

Mr. Ruddy said both NewsGuard and Global Disinformation Index are working to defund conservative media and pose “a threat to our constitutional freedoms and an attack on free speech.”

The Washington Times reported in November that NewsGuard labeled as misinformation stories that question COVID-19 vaccine safety while receiving significant funding from a firm that represents some of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies. NewsGuard denied the funding posed a conflict of interest.

The conservative Media Research Center in December 2021 reported that research it conducted revealed NewsGuard was “biased toward left-leaning news sites, as it gives left-wing outlets better trust ratings on average than right-wing sources.”

Defense bill curbs Chinese spying on port data

The House-Senate conference report on the fiscal 2024 defense authorization bill also contains a provision that backers say is meant to prevent China from spying on ports and critical logistics data used by the American military.

The measure prohibits the Pentagon from contracting with any port or logistics platform that uses the national transportation logistics public information platform known as LOGINK, which is controlled by China‘s government. U.S. officials believe LOGINK allows the Chinese government and military to track U.S. military and commercial ships through data on supply chains used by the United States and its allies.

LOGINK is directed by the Chinese Ministry of Transportation and has been in operation since 2007. Under China‘s military-civil fusion program, all information gathered by LOGINK can be used by the People’s Liberation Army.

The restriction was added to the House version of the bill by Rep. Michelle Steel, California Republican, who warned that any use of the database could potentially be used by the Chinese government to obtain sensitive military and supply chain data.

“For 15 years, the [Chinese Communist Party] has conducted espionage campaigns on our military and supply chains to help in their mission to become the world’s strongest economic hegemony,” Ms. Steele said in a statement. “By banning the [Department of Defense] from using of the Chinese state-owned platform LOGINK, we take vital steps in protecting our national defense and global trade.”

Ms. Steele said the use of LOGLINK is a serious national security threat with far-reaching implications amid growing tensions with China.

Security concerns regarding LOGINK echo those that surfaced with Huawei Technologies and ZTE, two major Chinese telecommunications providers. Congress in 2019 banned federal agencies from using their products and services, she said.

The restriction, part of the final bill being considered by both the House and Senate this week, prohibits any use of LOGINK by the U.S. military or commercial companies at ports in the United States or abroad. The measure also calls on the federal government to work with allies to end their use of LOGINK.

State Department seeks greater U.N. role for Taiwan

The State Department said Wednesday it is seeking to expand Taiwan’s role in the United Nations and other international organizations that have limited Taipei’s activities under pressure from China.

State Department officials, along with officials at the American Institute in Taiwan, met with Taiwan’s representative group in Washington, known as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States, and the Taiwan Foreign Ministry to discuss the issue. The talks in Washington involved “expanding Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations system and in other international forums,” the department said in a statement.

“This discussion focused on near-term opportunities to support Taiwan’s expanded participation in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and other global public health bodies, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as well as Taiwan’s meaningful participation in non-UN international, regional, and multilateral organizations,” the statement said.

The talks included discussion of global challenges such as global health, aviation safety, climate change and transnational crime. Plans for jointly enhancing economic cooperation were also discussed.

“U.S. participants highlighted the world-class expertise Taiwan brings in many areas of global concern, including health, food security, aviation green fuels and bolstering women’s economic and political empowerment,” the statement said, adding in a veiled reference to Beijing: “All participants recognized the importance of working closely with like-minded partners who share our concerns regarding attempts to exclude Taiwan from the international community.”

A German Marshall Fund report in March said Beijing has launched a campaign to systematically block Taiwan from working with international organizations like the United Nations.

The report said China is using secret agreements with U.N. agencies and specialized funding to block Taiwan — despite the fact that the United Nations has not formally accepted Beijing’s policy that Taiwan is part of China.

China‘s “efforts to constrain Taiwan at the U.N. have broader implications for international governance, as it shows a prioritization of one member state’s national interests over the global community’s — as exemplified by Taiwan’s damaging exclusion from global health debates during the coronavirus pandemic,” the report said.

80,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Pope Francis says he wants to be buried in the Rome basilica, not in the Vatican",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/pope-francis-says-he-wants-to-be-buried-in-rome-ba/,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis says he wants to be buried in the Rome basilica of St. Mary Major, not in the grottoes of the Vatican like other popes, so he can be near his favorite icon of the Madonna.

Francis, who turns 87 on Sunday, also said he never thought about resigning this year despite a series of health scares. He said he has a trip confirmed to Belgium next year and visits under consideration to Polynesia and his native Argentina.

“It is true that all journeys are now rethought,” Francis told N+ of Mexican broadcaster Televisa. “If they’re close by, they can be done. If they’re farther away they are rethought. There are limits.”

It was Francis’ first interview since his latest bout of acute bronchitis, which forced the cancellation of a trip this month to Dubai to participate in the U.N. climate conference. Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, appeared in good form and said he was now recovered and feeling fine.

While the job of pope is for life, Francis reconfirmed the possibility of resignation and said he has to prepare for any possibility. “I ask the Lord to say enough, at some point, but when he wants me to,” he said.

Francis has already said if he retires, as Pope Benedict XVI did in 2013, he would want to live outside the Vatican somewhere in Rome in a residence for retired priests. Francis has long emphasized his role as bishop of Rome and has a particular devotion to an icon of the Virgin Mary on display in the St. Mary Major basilica near Rome’s main train station.

After every trip, for example, Francis goes to the basilica to pray before the Salus populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome), a Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn is holding a jeweled golden book.

“It’s my great devotion,” Francis said, adding that he had already decided he wanted to be buried nearby in the basilica. “The place is already prepared.”

Francis had two bouts of bronchitis this year and was hospitalized for nine days in June to repair an abdominal hernia and have intestinal scar tissue removed. He has been using a wheelchair and cane for over a year due to strained knee ligaments.

Many popes are buried in tombs in the grottos underneath St. Peter’s Basilica or in side chapels of the basilica itself, including all of Francis’ recent predecessors.

On travel, Francis confirmed that a trip to his native Argentina was “pending” and that the country’s new president, Javier Milei, had invited him. Francis has been dogged by questions during his entire 10-year papacy about why he hasn’t returned home, questions that have only intensified following Milei’s unexpected victory.

During the campaign, the self-described “anarcho-capitalist” called Francis an “imbecile” for defending social justice and a “representative of malignance on Earth.”

Francis, who had a long conversation with Milei after he won, seemed to have forgiven him.

“In an election campaign, things are said ‘in jest’ - they are said seriously, but they are provisional things, things that are used to create a bit of attention, but which later fall away by themselves,” Francis said. “You have to distinguish a lot between what a politician says in the election campaign and what he or she is really going to do afterwards, because then comes the moment of concrete things, of the decisions.”

Francis’ planned visit to Belgium is to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the country’s two main Catholic universities. In a statement Wednesday welcoming Francis’ confirmation of the visit, Belgium’s bishops said Francis was expected to stay a day or two, with a date still to be determined."
81,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Senate on bipartisan vote passes massive defense bill as fight awaits in House,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/senate-nears-final-passage-of-massive-defense-bill/,"The Senate on a final vote Wednesday gave strong support to a massive defense spending policy for fiscal year 2024, setting up what is likely to be a more contentious fight in the House. The final bipartisan vote was 87-13 in favor of what is considered one of the few must-pass bills every year in Congress.

The annual National Defense Authorization Act includes a 5.2% pay raise for troops, $800 million to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia, and $11.5 billion to counter Chinese threats in East Asia.

Congressional leaders hope to conclude work on the bill before the Christmas break but a number of issues are likely to spark a sharper fight in the House when it takes up the measure Thursday.

“I am pleased that the Senate has come together to once again pass a strong, bipartisan defense bill,” Seante Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed, Rhode Island Democrat, said in a statement after the vote. “This is a dangerous moment in the world, and the NDAA makes critical progress toward meeting the threats we face.”

Among its hundreds of policy provisions, the NDAA also will advance the Biden administration’s nuclear submarine agreement with Britain and Australia, a deal seen as another check on China’s rising power in the region.

“Our bill should signal to China, Russia, and others that we will not accept a world where America does not have the best fighting force,” said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker,the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “While I would have preferred to send [President Biden] t a substantially larger proposed investment in our industrial base, he now should approve the monumental investments Congress intends to make in our servicemembers, warships, submarines, aircraft and technology.”

82,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Many top Russian athletes faced minimal drug testing in 2023 ahead of next year’s Paris Olympics,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/russian-athletes-faced-minimal-drug-testing-in-202/,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — Two of Russia‘s top swimmers have been drug tested by their country’s anti-doping agency only twice apiece in 2023, part of a larger trend in the country that adds an extra layer of uncertainty to the IOC’s decision to allow some Russian athletes to compete next year at the Paris Olympics.

The Russian Anti-Doping Agency lists on its website the number of tests it gives to individual athletes, in following a best practice it had long been urged to adapt. It has administered some 10,500 tests in 2023 - a number the IOC highlighted in a memorandum signed by key members of the Olympic movement at a summit last week that “emphasized that doping controls in Russia continue.”

Among those tests, only two each were given to defending 100 and 200-meter backstroke champion Evgeniy Rylov and 50-meter backstroke world-record holder Kliment Kolesnikov.

Another medal contender, Evgeniia Chikunova, has been tested three times by the agency. A pair of Russian silver medalists in fencing, Pavel Sukhov and Nikita Glazkov, have received only one test each in 2023. Five gymnasts who led the Russians to gold medals in the men’s and women’s team competitions have, combined, been tested nine times.

All these athletes still have to qualify for the Paris Games, and a big part of that will include determining whether their sports - and the IOC - will allow them to compete.

Rylov, for instance, has said he would not sign a declaration stating he does not support the war in Ukraine, which is a requirement set by the IOC for athletes to compete. Gymnasts are in limbo due to differing postures taken by international and European governing organizations in that sport.

America’s anti-doping chief, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart, worries about a level playing field in Paris.

“Things are not as they are being portrayed - to say that Russian athletes have been held to the same standards as other athletes is a slap in the face to clean athletes,” Tygart said.

Some of America’s top athletes - such as Noah Lyles (7), Sha’Carri Richardson (6), Ryan Murphy (9) and Katie Ledecky (9) - have been tested double or triple the number of times as their potential Russian competitors. Simone Biles has been tested four times in 2023, which is more than any of Russia‘s top gymnasts.

Thorough testing of athletes by their national anti-doping agencies, especially at times when they are not competing, is considered a cornerstone of an effective anti-doping system. At least three to five tests is the minimum standard to ensure effectiveness of an “athlete biological passport” - an advanced data set that tracks athletes’ blood samples over time to detect doping.

An email sent by The Associated Press to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency’s communications department asking for comment was not immediately returned.

The rigor of Russia‘s testing during a period in which its anti-doping agency has been deemed noncompliant with World Anti-Doping Agency rules has been a troubling issue in the near decade since Russia‘s state-sponsored scheme to dope athletes for the Sochi Olympics in 2014 was revealed.

Those questions persisted in the months heading into the Tokyo Olympics, when testing numbers decreased sharply across the globe because of restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among the statistics shared by the IOC last week was that the International Testing Agency, which tests athletes from various countries in several sports, conducted “well over” 400 out-of-competition tests on Russians in 2023 - a number that would augment the 10,500 conducted by the country’s own agency.

But based on an analysis by USADA, the ITA tests have limited reach in any country. USADA recently concluded that tests done by international bodies only covered about 11% of U.S. athletes on its Olympic team, while the other 89% were subject only to testing done by the agency itself.

An analysis produced by USADA that was obtained by AP and discussed at recent meetings involving U.S. Olympic leaders showed that around 76% of 360 Russian summer athletes ranked in the top 10 in their sports since 2021 had been given two or fewer tests this year.

U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee chairman Gene Sykes, who signed off on the IOC memorandum, said once Russian athletes eligible for the Olympics are identified “then there needs to be a lot of work done to make the entire system confident that the athletes are fully compliant.”

WADA said it continues to monitor Russia‘s anti-doping agency and is working with both the ITA and authorities from the individual sports to try to ensure Russian athletes are tested appropriately.

“WADA remains skeptical and wary when it comes to Russia,” WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald said. “We must remain vigilant and ensure that no stone is left unturned when it comes to verifying that all the proper testing has taken place in advance of Paris.”"
83,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Tesla pumps the brakes on self-driving, recalls its vehicles",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/tesla-pumps-brake-self-driving-recalls-its-vehicle/,"To limit the use of its “full self-driving” technology, Tesla has recalled almost all of its 2 million cars in the U.S.

According to a Tuesday letter by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Tesla has agreed to issue a recall on its Models 3, S, X and Y. The agency said the recall is intended to limit harm caused by the company’s “autosteer” technology.

“In certain circumstances when Autosteer is engaged, and the driver does not maintain responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to intervene as necessary or fails to recognize when Autosteer is canceled or not engaged, there may be an increased risk of a crash,” the letter reads.

As part of the recall, Tesla will launch an update for its cars and will mail notification letters to Tesla owners by February.

The letter comes after an NHTSA investigation that found nearly 1,000 crashes where autopilot was allegedly used. The agency found that Tesla’s comments about the features are a far cry from how the autopilot technology works in practice.

Despite the Tesla owner manual saying the tech should be used only on “highways and limited access roads by a fully attentive driver,” several federal and independent investigations have discovered crashes where the tech shouldn’t have been used at all.

Tesla’s recall this week is not its first relating to self-driving cars. Also this year, Tesla recalled over 350,000 vehicles after discovering that some cars in autopilot would intentionally violate traffic laws.

Indeed, the reputation of self-driving technology has taken serious hits this year. Cruise, General Motors’ self-driving brand of automated taxis, was shuttered after a series of high-profile collisions caused California to revoke the company’s license to operate. GM has since announced serious cuts to the project’s 2024 budget.

84,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Reporting for duty: K-pop superstars BTS send a message with military service,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/reporting-for-duty-k-pop-superstars-bts-send-messa/,"SEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean Army has admitted two new recruits: Pvt. Jeon Jung-kook, 26, and Pvt. Park Ji-min, 28.

Better known around the world simply as “Jung Kook” and “Jimin,” the two are the last members of supergroup BTS to be inducted for 18 months of compulsory training. That means that the entire seven-man supergroup is now doing national service.

The recruitment of what is arguably the world’s most popular band, starting with the oldest member, Kim Seok-jin, better known as Jin, who entered boot camp last December, is not without controversy.

Fans grumble that the young men should be allowed to skip military service for a greater national good: their continued promotion of the South Korean image to their millions of K-pop fans worldwide.

The band has been compared to The Beatles and has addressed the U.N. General Assembly. The Bank of Korea has estimated the spillover effects of merchandise sales and tourism from BTS’ popularity add a hefty $5 billion annually to the national economy.

But at a time when the army is facing a plunge in inductees, and a Korean American rapper who fled his military service obligation has just won a yearslong court case to be allowed to return to Korea, not everyone agrees the men should have gotten a pass.

The equality issue

Evasion of military service by the rich, powerful and connected has long strained South Korea’s social fiber. Analysts say declining to exempt the members of BTS sends a message not just of duty and patriotism, but of social inclusion.

“These days, the [government of President Yoon Suk Yeol] is all about justice and equality,” said Jee Hong-ki, a retired lieutenant colonel in the South Korean army.

Controversially, world-class South Korean athletes and classical musicians can earn exemptions from military service, but pop stars — however successful — have no official escape route.

Excusing BTS members from military service would “create all sorts of fields for exemption,” Mr. Jee continued.

David Tizzard, who teaches Korea Studies at Seoul Women’s University and has studied youth opinion in the country, agrees.

“A primary value for Korean people is fairness — while [the notoriously stressful college entrance exam] might suck, it sucks for rich and poor equally,” he said.

While he admitted that an argument exists for exempting the mega-successful band from service, he suggested that a bigger principle is at work.

“Some soft power does not penetrate deeply, but these are real values that improve Korea’s reputation” more than pop hits, he said. “It shows it is capable of applying the rule of law to all citizens, equally.”

Rapper’s plight

The willingness of BTS members to do their duty puts the case of Yoo Seung-jun, also known as Steve Yoo, into sharper perspective.

The rapper, now 47, had a successful career in South Korea in the late 1990s. However, despite saying publicly that he would serve, the singer, famed for his physical fitness, avoided his obligation by taking out U.S. citizenship in 2002.

That prompted South Korean courts to bar him from reentering the country. Many of his hits were pulled from the airwaves.

Mr. Yoo – who has long since passed the military service age of 38 — has filmed a video in which he pleads to be allowed to return to Korea, and filed legal appeals.

In November, courts confirmed that he should be allowed to return on the grounds that he has passed the age of service. The Ministry of Justice and the Military Manpower Administration are reportedly discussing “follow-up measures.”

“Many of the public considered he was not doing his duty but wanted his rights, and that was not fair,” said Mr. Ji. “Now it is two decades past and he has paid a price for what he did, so maybe sentiment has eased.”

The case is still pending.

Filling the ranks

The conscript-manned South Korean Army needs every man — women are not mandated to serve, but can volunteer — it can get its hands on. The country, in the midst of a demographic plunge, is facing a recruitment crisis.

According to the Korea Institute of Defense Analysis, the armed forces, currently fielding 480,000 personnel, have fallen below the 500,000-man level for the first time since the Korean War.

That makes it less than half the size of the 1.1 million-strong North Korean military, much of which is massed just north of the Demilitarized Zone. Moreover, the South Korean armed forces will fall below the 400,000 mark by 2038, the KIDA report found.

But military service is not popular, and the South Korean Army has not always enjoyed a positive reputation. Newspapers once regularly reported on cases of bullying, hazing, sexual abuse and sometimes fatal training accidents in the ranks.

Things are better now, but the middle-class troops of today, with access to mobile phones and abuse hotlines, lack the hardiness of their predecessors. Many commanders have been forced to tone down training to avoid potentially career-damaging complaints from angry parents, leading to readiness fears from retired military officers.

All of which makes the willingness of the BTS 7 to serve a big deal here.

“I think the military is a place where men should definitely go,” Pvt. Jeon said in a widely reported social media post Friday. He and bandmate Pvt. Park, released images on social media of their pre-boot camp buzz cuts.

The band’s management company has urged the group’s sometimes zealous legion of fans — known, coincidentally, as “The ARMY” — not to visit their bases in hopes of grabbing a glimpse of their idols.

The ARMY should be pleased to learn that the army does not mean the end of BTS.

Elvis Presley’s management team famously kept their man in the spotlight while he did his military service. Other K-pop stars, including Psy and G-Dragon, have emerged from service to resume successful careers.

When it comes to BTS, a plan is apparently in place to build on the group’s catalog of hits.

“We have prepared so much that you can look forward to it,” Pvt. Jeon said on social media just prior to his induction.

The trend was first noticed at the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of its neighbor in February 2022 and the situation has not improved, British officials said this week.

Military night-vision goggles are often featured high on the lists of equipment Russian soldiers in Ukraine request from friends and supporters, analysts said.

“Ukrainian forces have often been equipped with night vision devices from international partners,” U.K. defense officials said on X.

Some Russian officials have acknowledged that Kyiv leads in night-vision capabilities because of its technical support from NATO and other allies.

“Yes, everything is clear as day. Imported equipment has excellent night optics,” Russian military reporter and blogger Alexander Sladkov wrote on his Telegram social media page. “They can drive, conduct observation, take aim, and control the accuracy of the fire. That’s why the enemy chooses night.”

A lack of adequate night-vision gear in the Russian army may involve more than merely a temporary shortage of equipment. In their latest assessment of the battlefield in Ukraine, British intelligence officials this week noted that Russian military training rarely emphasizes night exercises.

Instead, the training typically builds towards large, set-piece daylight events in order to “impress visiting senior officers,” U.K. defense intelligence officials said.

86,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,New sanctions from the U.S. and Britain target Hamas officials who help manage its financial network,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/new-sanctions-from-us-and-britain-target-hamas-off/,"WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday announced new war-related of sanctions against Hamas, targeting eight officials and representatives who help manage the militant group’s financial network.

The penalties, coordinated with Britain, are the Treasury Department’s latest response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas against Israel. The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent those designated from doing business with Americans.

The list included individuals based in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon and Turkey. Among them was Ismail Barhum, who the Treasury Department said in a statement was a member of the Gaza Strip Political Bureau and has worked with Hamas Finance Minister Zaher Jabarin, also under sanction, to aggregate money from global fundraising into the organization’s finance accounts.

Brian Nelson, the Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said Hamas exploits “seemingly permissive jurisdictions to direct fundraising campaigns for the group’s benefit and funneling those illicit proceeds to support its military activities in Gaza.”

He said the U.S. and its allies are focused on “leveraging our collective tools and authorities to degrade Hamas’s ability to fund additional attacks and further destabilize the region.”

Earlier sanctions on Nov. 14 named Hamas leaders and financiers, on Oct. 27, targeted sources of support and financing, and on Oct. 18, designated operatives and financial facilitators.

U.S. officials said the new sanctions were coordinated with the Britain’s finance ministry and showed an allied commitment aimed at “dismantling networks that support Hamas funding streams as part of our continuous effort to prevent and deter its terrorist activity,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement."
87,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Thai police seize a record haul of 50 million methamphetamine tablets near border with Myanmar,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/thai-police-seize-record-50-million-methamphetamin/,"BANGKOK — Thai police have seized what is being called a record haul of methamphetamine tablets in the western province of Kanchanaburi, close to the Myanmar border.

Officers found an estimated 50 million tablets hidden in sacks in a six-wheeler truck they stopped at a joint police-military checkpoint on Tuesday. The occupants of the truck – a man and a woman – were arrested.

The quantity of methamphetamine tablets seized is a record for Thailand, Jeremy Douglas, the Southeast Asia regional representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said Wednesday. The region’s biggest known seizure took place in neighboring Laos in October 2021, when a consignment of 55 million pills was discovered.

“We’ve not seen major cases here in Kanchanaburi for a couple of years, and never anything like this,” Douglas said. “But it’s also not a surprise given the extreme supply being produced by militias and traffickers in northern Myanmar.”

Myanmar has historically been the region’s main drug production area in part because of lax security measures in border areas where minority ethnic groups have long been fighting for greater autonomy. Some of the powerful ethnic armed groups there have been heavily involved in narcotics production for decades.

A 2021 military takeover in Myanmar that unseated the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi triggered armed resistance nationwide, further destabilizing the country.

The U.N. drug agency’s June 2023 report on synthetic drugs in East and Southeast Asia warned that the huge trade in methamphetamine and other illegal drugs shows no signs of slowing down.

Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who is also interior minister, told reporters that illegal drugs used to be smuggled into Thailand’s northern and northeastern provinces, but had moved to western provinces such as Kanchanaburi because of more intense surveillance and security along the old routes, a point the U.N. agency had also made earlier this year.

Anutin said increased combat between Myanmar’s military and its foes among the country’s pro-democracy movement and ethnic minority armed groups also increased the smugglers’ risks along their old routes."
88,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Turkish soccer matches to resume on Dec. 19 after suspension caused by attack on referee,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/turkey-soccer-matches-to-resume-on-dec-19-after-su/,"ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish soccer league matches, suspended after a referee was attacked by the president of a top-flight club, will resume on Dec. 19, the head of the Turkish Football Federation said Wednesday.

Mehmet Buyukeksi also told reporters that the federation’s disciplinary board would announce on Thursday the punitive measures to be imposed on MKE Ankaragucu and its president, Faruk Koca, who has since been arrested.

Koca punched referee Halil Umut Meler in the face on the field after the final whistle of a 1-1 draw in a Super Lig home game against Caykur Rizespor on Monday. The referee, who fell to the ground, was also kicked in a melee as fans invaded the playing surface after Rizespor scored a last-minute equalizer.

The attack led to the suspension of all league games in Turkey, which has been selected to co-host the 2032 European Championship with Italy.

“All league games will restart on Tuesday, Dec. 19,” Buyukeksi announced after a federation meeting, adding that “zero tolerance” would be shown toward attacks on referees.

“What happened during the Ankaragucu-Rizespor match is completely unacceptable,” he said. “We will not allow attacks or disproportionate pressure on our referees, who are an important part of the game.”

Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc announced on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that the government was considering tightening laws designed to prevent violence in sports.

“We will re-evaluate the penal provisions (of the law for the) Prevention of Violence and Disorder in Sports, in terms of (increasing) deterrence,” Tunc wrote. “We will all work together to turn the green (soccer) fields into areas for friendship and brotherhood.”

Earlier on Wednesday, Meler was discharged from hospital after being treated for a fracture near his eye.

He walked out of Ankara’s Acibadem Hospital and raised his hand to salute the assembled media before entering a vehicle. The state-run Anadolu Agency said Meler would travel to his home in Izmir, western Turkey, escorted by police for protection.

The hospital’s chief physician Mehmet Yorubulut told reporters that the referee’s morale was high.

“He has no problems other than the swelling in his eye,” Yorubulut said, adding that the fracture would heal in time.

Buyukeksi dismissed reports that Meler was considering quitting, saying the referee was expected to officiate at the 2024 European Championship in Germany.

“Halil Umut Meler is a highly respected referee by both UEFA and FIFA,” Buyukeksi said. “We expect him to take part in Euro 2024.”

Koca and two other people have been placed under pre-trial detention, facing charges of causing injury to a public official.

Koca is reported to have told prosecutors during questioning that he merely slapped Meler, accusing the referee of “wrongful decisions” and provocative actions.

He later announced his resignation.

“I apologize to the Turkish referee and sports community, to the Turkish people and especially to Mr. Meler and his family for the attitude I displayed toward Halil Umut Meler,” he said in a statement read by his lawyer late Tuesday.

Media reports cited Meler as telling prosecutors that the club president shouted “I will kill you” during the attack and also threatened to “finish off” all the match officials on the field.

Violence in soccer is commonplace in Turkey despite efforts to clamp down on it, although direct attacks on top-level referees are rare.

89,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Poland’s new Prime Minister Donald Tusk takes office, ending 8 years of conservative rule",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/donald-tusk-polands-new-prime-minister-takes-offic/,"WARSAW, Poland — The new Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his Cabinet members took office Wednesday after they were sworn in by the president, marking the end of eight tumultuous years of rule by a national conservative party, Law and Justice.

The swearing-in ceremony of the pro-European Union government, the final step in a transition of power, took place in the presidential palace in Warsaw. Tusk was returning to the job after a nine-year spell in opposition.

Leaders and senior officials from around the world, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said were looking forward to working with Tusk‘s team. Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz used Polish to amplify his congratulatory message to “dear Donald Tusk.”

“Donald Tusk wants Poland to be again in the heart of the EU and that’s where her place is,” he said. “I am happy that together, arm in arm with Poland develop the EU and Polish-German relations.”

The countries’ ties were strained under the previous government that exploited the painful World War II history.

The change of government follows a national election on Oct. 15 which was won by a group of parties that ran on separate tickets vowing to work together under Tusk‘s leadership to restore democratic norms eroded by Law and Justice and mend relations with foreign allies that were also strained.

Tusk’s government won a vote of confidence in parliament on Tuesday evening after an inaugural speech in which he vowed to demand that the West keep up its support for Ukraine. The confidence vote was delayed when a far-right lawmaker used a fire extinguisher to put out the candles of a menorah during a Hanukkah celebration dedicated to Poland‘s Jewish lawmakers of the 1920s and 1930s. Tusk and other leaders sharply condemned the antisemitic provocation.

In his policy speech Tuesday, Tusk called on Poland’s fractious political class to unite, saying the nation cannot afford divisions while Russia is waging a war of aggression across the border, a conflict many fear could spread if Moscow prevails.

President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the previous administration, swore in the government after having delayed the power transition as long as he could.

Their disagreements found expression during the ceremony. Duda said that despite the obvious differences he will cooperate on matters key to Poland‘s security and the people’s well-being, but stressed that he believes that most things are in perfect shape.

Tusk, whose government was born out of dissatisfaction of majority of voters, said he greeted Duda’s declaration “with great joy,” but also emphatically quoted the words of his oath that vow respect for Poland‘s constitution and other laws. Duda’s critics accuse him of bending the constitution, even disregarding it in some cases, as he backed Law and Justice policies.

Later Wednesday, Tusk traveled to Brussels for an EU summit and leaders’ talks with the six countries from the Western Balkans that hope to join the EU. He was to met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday.

The leader of the centrist Civic Platform party who was prime minister from 2007-2014, Tusk faces challenges that include restoring democratic standards in Poland and working for the release of European Union funding that was frozen due to democratic backsliding by his predecessors - which he promised to achieve quickly.

He also promised to work with European partners to address irregular migration, an issue of growing concern in Poland after thousands of people, many from the Middle East, tried to cross into the EU from Belarus across Poland‘s eastern border.

The 67-year-old Tusk has vowed to restore foreign ties strained by the Law and Justice-led government, which bickered even with allies such as Germany and Ukraine and was at odds with the EU over legal changes that eroded the independence of the judicial branch.

Tusk’s Cabinet includes a former foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, taking up that role again. Adam Bodnar, a respected human rights lawyer and former ombudsman, was tapped as justice minister.

Tusk named Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, an experienced politician and agrarian party leader, as his defense minister. For Kosiniak-Kamysz, 42, Poland‘s security is safeguarded by its membership in NATO and the EU. In the face of war across Poland‘s border, he has vowed to focus on strengthening the defense potential of the armed forces.

The new culture minister is Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, a former interior minister under Tusk and the great grandson of “Quo Vadis” author Henryk Sienkiewicz, a winner of the Nobel prize for literature. His first task will be to free state media from political control that the previous government exerted, using it as its mouthpiece."
90,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,A Russian missile attack on Kyiv injures more than 50 people as Ukraine pleads for more Western help,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/russian-missile-attack-on-kyiv-injures-writethru-8/,"KYIV, Ukraine — A barrage of Russian missiles targeted Kyiv on Wednesday, wounding at least 53 people, officials said, as the Ukrainian president sought more military support in Europe after a trip to Washington secured no new pledges.

A series of loud explosions rocked Kyiv at 3 a.m. as the city’s air defenses were activated for the second time this week. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 10 ballistic missiles toward the capital and all were intercepted by air defenses.

The attack on the capital underscored the continuing threat to Ukraine from the Kremlin’s missile arsenal in the 21-month war. Russia has in recent months been stockpiling its air-launched cruise missiles from its heavy bomber fleet, according to a recent assessment by the U.K. Ministry of Defense.

That may herald another heavy winter bombardment of Ukraine’s power grid. Moscow last year targeted energy infrastructure in an effort to deny Ukrainians heat, light and running water and break their fighting spirit.

As winter sets in and hinders troop movements, allowing little change along the front line, long-range air bombardment plays a growing role in the war.

Ukraine has dwindling supplies of air defense munitions and other ammunition. That prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Washington on Tuesday in an effort to persuade lawmakers to approve President Joe Biden’s request for $61.4 billion for Ukraine. His trip accomplished no breakthrough.

Zelenskyy said on Telegram on Wednesday that he and Biden agreed to work on increasing the number of air defense systems in Ukraine. “The terrorist state has just demonstrated how crucial this decision is,” Zelenskyy said, referring to the overnight strikes.

Zelenskyy on Wednesday met in Oslo with Nordic leaders who feel keenly the potential threat from nearby Russia and are among Kyiv‘s staunchest supporters.

“Russia is eager to exploit divisions,” the senior leaders from Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden said in a joint statement in English. “We must continue to stand united against Russia’s illegal and immoral war.”

They vowed “comprehensive assistance” for Ukraine. “Now is not the time to tire,” the Nordic leaders said, amid signs of war fatigue among Kyiv‘s foreign supporters.

“We are in a critical phase where Europe must continue to show its support,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement. She said her government will unveil a Ukraine support package of almost 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) later this week.

Norway announced it will give additional air defenses to Ukraine, taking them from its own stocks to ensure speedy delivery.

Separately, Latvia and Ukraine announced an agreement on the production of drones, which have become a key aspect of the war. They said they will aim to “enhance Ukraine’s technological superiority” in drone use.

Debris from intercepted missiles fell in Kyiv‘s eastern Dniprovskyi district, injuring dozens of people, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Kitschko said on Telegram. Twenty people, including two children, were hospitalized, and 33 people received medical treatment on the spot.

An apartment building, a private house and several cars caught fire, while the windows of a children’s hospital were shattered, Klitschko said. Falling rocket debris also damaged the water supply system in the district.

It wasn’t immediately clear what type of missile was used in the Kyiv attack.

“It is difficult to imagine the consequences of these attacks if we don’t have air protection,” Ukraine’s Minister of Economy, Yulia Svyrydenko, said on X, formerly Twitter. “Each attack emphasizes the urgent need for more protection, as Russia shows no intention of stopping.”

In other parts of Ukraine, 10 Russian drones were shot down, most of them in the Odesa region, the Ukrainian air force said.

Wednesday’s attack came as Zelenskyy visited Washington, where he made an impassioned plea to Congress to approve additional aid to fight Russia’s invasion.

Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff who was traveling with the president, said the interception of the missiles fired at Kyiv showed how Western support is helping Ukraine resist the Russian aggression.

“The effectiveness of Western weaponry in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers is beyond doubt,” Yermak wrote on Telegram.

91,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Wartime Palestinian poll shows surge in Hamas support, close to 90% want U.S.-backed Abbas to resign",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/wartime-palestinian-poll-shows-surge-in-hamas-supp/,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — A wartime opinion poll among Palestinians published Wednesday shows a rise in support for Hamas, even in the devastated Gaza Strip, and an overwhelming rejection of Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas, with nearly 90% saying he must resign.

The findings by a Palestinian pollster signal more difficulties ahead for the Biden administration’s postwar vision for Gaza and raise questions about Israel‘s stated goal of ending Hamas‘ military and governing capabilities.

Washington has called for the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, currently led by Abbas, to eventually assume control of Gaza and run both territories as a precursor to statehood. U.S. officials have said the PA must be revitalized, without letting on whether this would mean leadership changes.

The PA administers pockets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has governed Gaza until a takeover by Hamas militants in 2007. The Palestinians have not held elections since 2006 when Hamas won a parliamentary majority.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads the most right-wing government in Israel‘s history, has soundly rejected any role for the PA in Gaza and insists Israel must retain open-ended security control there. Arab allies of the U.S. have said they’ll only get involved in post-war reconstruction if there’s a credible push toward a two-state solution, which is unlikely under Netanyahu’s government, dominated by opponents of Palestinian statehood.

With survey results indicating a further erosion of the PA’s legitimacy, at a time when there’s no apparent path toward restarting credible negotiations on Palestinian statehood, the default for postwar Gaza is an open-ended Israeli occupation, said pollster Khalil Shikaki.

“Israel is stuck in Gaza,” Shikaki told The Associated Press ahead of the publication of the survey’s results by his Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, or PSR. “Maybe the next (Israeli) government will decide that Netanyahu is not right in putting all these conditions, and they might decide to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza. But the default for the future, for Israel and Gaza, is that Israel is in full reoccupation of Gaza.”

The survey was conducted among 1,231 people in the West Bank and Gaza from Nov. 22-Dec. 2, with an error margin of 4 percentage points. In Gaza, poll workers conducted interviews during a weeklong cease-fire that ended Dec. 1. Shikaki, who runs regular polls, said the error margin was one percentage point higher than usual because of war-related mass displacement.

The survey provided insights about Palestinian views of the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other Gaza militants on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians. Israel‘s subsequent war on Hamas has killed more than 18,400 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, in a sustained bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, now in its third month.

Despite the devastation, 57% of respondents in Gaza and 82% in the West Bank believe Hamas was correct in launching the attack, the poll indicated. A large majority believed Hamas‘ claims that it acted to defend a major Islamic shrine in Jerusalem against Jewish extremists and win the release of Palestinian prisoners. Only 10% said they believed Hamas has committed war crimes, with a large majority saying they did not see videos showing the militants committing atrocities.

The videos, along with extensive eyewitness testimony and reporting by The Associated Press and others, show that hundreds of civilians, including women and children, were abducted or gunned down inside their own homes. There have also been accounts of widespread sexual violence.

But while Israeli media coverage has focused intensely on the attack in the weeks since, Palestinian media has been fixated on the war in Gaza and the suffering of civilians there.

Shikaki noted that Gaza residents are more critical of Hamas than those in the West Bank, that support for Hamas typically spikes during periods of armed conflict before leveling out, and that even now, most Palestinians do not back the militant group.

He said the most popular politician remains Marwan Barghouti, a prominent figure in Abbas‘ Fatah movement who is serving multiple life terms in an Israeli prison for his alleged role in several deadly attacks during the second Palestinian uprising two decades ago. In a two-way presidential race, Ismail Haniyeh, the exiled political leader of Hamas, would trounce Abbas while in a three-way race, Barghouti would be ahead just slightly, Shikaki said.

Overall, 88% want Abbas to resign, up by 10 percentage points from three months ago. In the West Bank, 92% called for the resignation of the octogenarian who has presided over an administration widely seen as corrupt, autocratic and ineffective.

At the same time, 44% in the West Bank said they supported Hamas, up from just 12% in September. In Gaza, the militants enjoyed 42% support, up from 38% three months ago.

Shikaki said support for the PA declined further, with nearly 60% now saying it should be dissolved. In the West Bank, Abbas‘ continued security coordination with Israel‘s military against Hamas, his bitter political rival, is widely unpopular.

Netanyahu has attacked Abbas for years, alleging he was enabling anti-Israeli incitement in the West Bank, while at the same time permitting regular Qatari support payments to Gaza that strengthened Hamas. Critics of Netanyahu‘s overall approach say it was aimed at preventing negotiations on Palestinian statehood.

The poll also signaled widespread frustration with the international community, particularly the United States, key European countries and even the United Nations, which has pushed for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.

“The level of anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism is huge among Palestinians because of the positions they have taken regarding international humanitarian law and what is happening in Gaza,” Shikaki said."
92,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Kishida says he regrets a ruling party funds scandal and will work on partial changes to his Cabinet,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/fumio-kishida-i-regret-ruling-party-funds-scandal-/,"TOKYO — Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday announced plans to replace some of his Cabinet ministers to address public criticism and distrust over his governing party’s widening slush funds scandal that has shaken his grip on power.

The scandal mostly involves the Liberal Democratic Party’s largest and most powerful faction formerly led by assassinated ex-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Its key members, including those in top Cabinet and party posts, were suspected of systematically failing to report several hundred million yen (several million dollars) in funds in possible violation of campaign and election laws, media reports say. The money is alleged to have gone into unmonitored slush funds.

The scandal and a purge of Abe’s faction, which was key to Kishida’s own future, could stir a power struggle within the party ahead of a key leadership vote in September, even though Kishida doesn’t have to call a parliamentary election nearly two more years. The grip on power of the LDP, which has almost continually ruled postwar Japan, is seen unchanged as long as the opposition remains fractured.

Kishida, at a news conference Wednesday marking the end of this year’s parliamentary session, said he regretted that the party fundraising scandal has deepened political distrust and that he is determined to tackle it with “a sense of crisis.”

“It is my responsibility to lead the LDP reform in order to regain the public trust,” he said.

Kishida refused to disclose details, but the key changes involve four ministers from the Abe faction - Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, Economy and Industry Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, Agriculture Minister Ichiro Miyashita and Internal Affairs Minister Junji Suzuki - as well as a few serving key party posts. Former Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, who belongs to Kishida‘s faction, is expected to replace Matsuno, Kyodo News agency reported.

Earlier Wednesday, Kishida faced a no-confidence motion submitted by opposition groups led by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. It was voted down because of the LDP dominance in both houses of parliament.

“The LDP has no self-cleansing ability,” CDPJ leader Kenta Izumi said. “It is questionable if they can choose anyone who is not involved in slush funds.” Japanese Communist Party leader Kazuo Shii called the scandal “a bottomless, serious problem.”

Kishida has acknowledged that authorities are investigating the scandal following a criminal complaint. He said those who have faced the accounting questions must examine their records and explain to the public, but gave no timeline.

Approval ratings for his Cabinet have continued to fall. Most recently, one released by NHK national television said his support ratings fell to 23%, lowest since the governing party returned to power in 2012, after a three-year rule by Democratic Party of Japan.

Matsuno allegedly diverted more than 10 million yen ($68,700) over the past five years from money he raised from faction fundraising events to a slush fund, while Nishimura allegedly kept 1 million yen ($6,870), according to media reports.

Collecting proceeds from party events and paying kickbacks to lawmakers are not illegal if recorded appropriately under the political funds law. Violations could result in penalty of up to five years in prison, but prosecution is difficult as it requires proof of a specific instruction to an accountant to not report the money transfer."
93,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Military trials can resume for 103 supporters of Imran Khan, Pakistan court says",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/military-trials-can-resume-for-103-supporters-of-i/,"ISLAMABAD — Pakistan‘s top court on Wednesday allowed military courts to resume the trials of more than 100 supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan on charges of attacking military installations during violent demonstrations that broke out following Khan‘s arrest in May.

The latest order by the Supreme Court came less than two months after five judges on the same court stopped the trial of 103 civilians who were arrested as part of a crackdown on Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.

The violence subsided only after Khan was released on orders of Pakistan’s Supreme Court.

Khan, 71, is currently serving three sentences at a high-security prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. He was removed as prime minister in April 2022 following a vote of no confidence in Parliament.

Though Khan is also accused of inciting people to violence, he is not facing military trial.

According to the prosecution, Khan was indicted by a special court on charges of revealing official secrets on Wednesday, but his lawyer Salman Safdar told reporters that his indictment was delayed after the court adjourned the case until Thursday.

It was not immediately clear what caused confusion among Khan‘s lawyers, as the prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi told reporters that Khan entered a not guilty plea when charges were read out during the court hearing at Adiyala prison.

The case is related to Khan’s speech at a rally after his ouster in 2022, when he held up a confidential diplomatic letter, claiming it was proof that his ouster was a U.S. conspiracy, allegedly executed by the military and the government in Pakistan. Washington and Pakistani officials have denied the claim.

The document - dubbed Cipher - was apparently diplomatic correspondence between the Pakistani ambassador to Washington and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad."
94,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Violence called a ‘cancer’ threatening soccer’s survival,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/attacks-on-referees-could-kill-soccer-fifa-officia/,"MANCHESTER, England — Attacked on the field by the president of a top Turkish soccer team, referee Halil Umut Meler desperately tried to cover his head to shield himself from the kicks of angry fans.

Monday’s shocking scene at the end of a Turkish league game was an example of the violence and abuse directed toward officials that, it was claimed on Wednesday, have included incidents as extreme as car bombs.

“It’s a responsibility for all those who love the ‘beautiful game’ to take action and do something. Before it’s too late, before this cancer will kill football,” Pierluigi Collina, chairman of FIFA’s Referees Committee, said Wednesday.

Meler was hospitalized after being punched by MKE Ankaragucu president Faruk Koca at the end of a 1-1 draw with Caykur Rizespor. He fell to the ground and was also kicked in a melee when fans invaded the pitch after Rizespor scored a last-minute equalizer. Meler was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday.

Koca and two other people have been placed under pre-trial detention, facing charges of causing injury to a public official. The Turkish Football Federation suspended all league games in response.

“A referee cannot be beaten because of a decision they took, even if it’s wrong. His or her car cannot be bombed or set on fire because of a penalty kick,” Collina said in a statement that did not provide examples. “Unfortunately this is not an exaggeration, as car bombs and cars being set on fire is something that has happened in some countries, and not so rarely.”

In recent times there have been a number of high profile incidents involving attacks or threats made toward officials in soccer.

In Brazil, the president of fourth-division club Sergipe was suspended after he came onto the pitch and punched a referee in March. Last month, an official with Brazilian club Corinthians tried to break into the VAR room after one of the team’s players was sent off.

English referee Anthony Taylor and his family had to be escorted away by security at an airport in Hungary after Roma fans targeted him and threw a chair in his direction after the Europa League final in May.

More extreme incidents include the gun-toting owner of Greek team PAOK Thessaloniki marching onto the field following a disputed goal in 2018. And a weekend soccer player was sentenced to at least eight years in prison in 2015 in the United States for a punch that killed a referee.

Soccer has for a long time been concerned about how abuse at the top of the sport can lead to rising incidents at amateur and youth level.

“The image of Halil Umut lying on the ground, with his hands protecting his head while he was kicked by his assaulters, as well as the image of the bruise under his eye, are horrific,” Collina said. “But even more horrific is to know that there are thousands of referees around the world who are verbally and physically abused at lower levels of the game across the world, without being reported by media.”

A referees’ charity in England has warned incidents like the one in Turkey could soon be repeated in the Premier League.

“The desensitization of ref abuse has been left to fester for far too long and an incident like this, live on TV, is just around the corner in top-flight football in the UK unless we have a huge change in attitude and culture towards match officials at all levels of the game,” said Martin Cassidy, chief executive of Ref Support UK. “Referees all over the world have, for far too long, been viewed as fair game no matter what age the referee is. Referees are an endangered species due to abuse, threats and assaults.”

Despite those fears, the body that runs referees and officials in England, said Wednesday that there had been a “significant decrease” in unacceptable behavior this season compared to the same point last season.

The Professional Game Match Officials (PGMOL) has clamped down on what it describes as conduct on the field and on the sidelines at all levels of pro soccer in England.

As a result it said there had been a 37% decrease in charges for surrounding match officials, dropping from 19 to 12. According to its figures there has also been 43% decrease in charges for mass confrontations (61 to 35) and a 10% reduction of charges for “technical area misconduct” (70 to 63).

“A culture change won’t happen overnight and it is early days, but we are moving in the right direction and our officials are successfully delivering on our part of the collective football effort to reset behaviors, protect the reputation and promote the positive image of the game for the next generations,” PGMOL chief Howard Webb said.

There has been an 88% increase in cautions for acts of dissent from players, which is likely a result of the PGMOL’s clampdown. Numbers went up from 966 to 1,813 cautions.

“This shows that our new approach is making an impact at the top of the pyramid, and we need to maintain this and ensure that these positive changes are carried through to the whole game,” FA chief executive Mark Bullingham said."
95,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,What is in Youngkin’s child care plan?,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-13/child-care-subsidy-program-youngkin-early-education-900m-usd,"Last week, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced plans to invest close to $900 million in early childhood education across the next biennium — which he said would represent a new annual state investment of $180 million annually. It was an early peek at his upcoming budget proposal, which he will formally present to state lawmakers later this month.

The Child Care Subsidy Program is slated to receive the largest investment. Theprogram will be hardest hit by the loss of federal pandemic-era relief funds that are slated to run out next summer; without additional investments, the Virginia Department of Education estimatesover 30,000 children in the program would lose care.

The governor’s plan would keep expanded eligibility for the program at 85% state median income, following what started as atemporary expansion during the pandemic.

However, low-income families participating in the program would pay more for child care under the governor’s proposal. This would represent a major change, as copays for families with incomes at or below the 100% federal poverty level ($30,000 for a family of four) were eliminated earlier this year.

“In order to stretch the program as far as we could, we felt it appropriate for all families to pay something,” Youngkin told VPM News following the announcement. “And it was sized to federal guidelines to make sure that of course it wasn't going to be too much. Some — albeit modest — copay is in each of the income brackets.”

According to the Joint Legislative Audit & Review Commission, families in the CCSP arecurrently paying about 2% of their annual income on child care; under Youngkin’s proposal families in the lowest income bracket would instead pay up to 7% according to VDOE — which is the federal limit. VDOE has not yet released specific figures showing exactly how copays would change, however – and they don’t plan to until after July 1, 2024, according to a spokesperson from the department.

Former Virginia Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, who sponsored the 2021 legislation to expand CCSP eligibility to middle-income families, is concerned about charging low-income parents higher subsidies.

“If there's too many fees added … we essentially could be reversing the progress and shutting out children and families who are the ones that need to benefit and have already benefited the most from these early learning opportunities,” Filler-Corn said.

Filler-Corn’s 2021 legislation also temporarily expanded CCSP eligibility to families with parents looking for work. However, a recent JLARC report stated that “the program allows these individuals to take up a subsidy slot indefinitely,” and that “some local department staff believe the absence of a time limit has resulted in some parents saying they are looking for work but not doing so in earnest (or at all), which reduces slots available for parents working or participating in a training or education program.”

According to the VDOE, families will now have to either be working, in school or job training or be actively looking for work and find work within 90 days to qualify – and if they lose a job, they have 90 days to find a new one.

“By expanding the requirements that parents work in order to participate in this plan … we're focusing our considerable investment on parents who are working to keep all of those balls in the air as they juggle them,” Youngkin said.

He pointed out that nationally, 46% of mothers who remain unemployed having left the workforce in 2021left due to child care issues.

“This is about families, this is about moms,” Youngkin said. “Virginians shouldn't have to worry about getting their children the care they need when they're at work. And unfortunately, so many do.”

Youngkin’s plan will also create a $25 million fund for capital investments to help create “hubs” in child care deserts and fund a total of 3,000 additional child care slots. He pointed to a recentcollaboration in Southwest Virginia as an example.

“We believe this model is one that can be replicated across the Commonwealth to those areas that need it most,” Youngkin said.

The proposal will also ensure unused funds earmarked for the Virginia Preschool Initiative, another early childhood program, are spent on early childhood education instead of reverting back to the general fund.

Karin Bowles, vice president of strategy with the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, said reasons why the VPI funds might go unused vary — but sometimes has to do with classroom space not being available, since the program is primarily delivered through school divisions. Other times, she said, localities have a hard time coming up with the required local match.

“We believe that funds that are designated and appropriated for early childhood purposes should stay in the early childhood space,” Bowles said. “Those unused funds could go a long way."
96,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Virginia officials announce a major deal to bring Capitals and Wizards to Potomac Yard,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-13/virginia-officials-announce-a-major-deal-to-bring-capitals-and-wizards-to-potomac-yard,"Read the original story on WAMU/DCist's website.

This is a developing story and will be updated.

Monumental Sports and Entertainment and Virginia officials gathered at a press conference Wednesday morning to announce a deal that to move the Washington Wizards and Capitals from D.C.’s Capital One Arena to a new complex to be built in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was joined by Monumental owner Ted Leonsis and state and local lawmakers at the event, held near the Potomac Yard Metro station, the site of the planned development.

The mood at the press conference was reminiscent of a team’s locker room after a big win–celebratory, joyful, and filled with backslapping.

The deal is a big win for Virginia and a major blow to the District, which was in negotiations to keep the teams downtown.

Details released ahead of the press conference describe a $2 billion public-private partnership for a massive 9-million-square-foot sports and entertainment district on 70 acres in the Potomac Yard neighborhood of Alexandria. Plans include a concert venue, retail, restaurants, a Monumental Sports Network media studio, a Wizards practice facility, and an “industry-leading” arena for both the Wizards and Capitals.

The goal is to break ground on the development and have the teams playing in the new venue by 2028. They would remain at Capital One arena for the next four seasons.

The deal was apparently in the works for months. Gov. Youngkin said at the press conference he first discussed with Leonsis the possibility of a sports and entertainment complex coming to Alexandria “years ago,” and recalled his own experience on the court in describing how this deal came together.

“Now, I spent most of my time on the basketball court and not in the ice rink,” Youngkin said. “And I found that the heart of any team is one thing, and that will always remain the same. Teamwork, working together.”

Any final deal will require approval by the Virginia General Assembly and the Alexandria City Council. Some lawmakers have said they want to see details before supporting the plan, but the development would be a significant victory for Virginia and will likely secure bipartisan support.

The announcement comes just days after Virginia lawmakers, including soon-to-depart state Sen. Majority Leader Dick Saslaw (D–Fairfax) and state Sen. George Barker (D–Alexandria), approved a development proposal for Potomac Yard to include a sports arena, hotel, convention center, an underground parking garage, and $200 million in transportation improvements, built on land controlled by real estate developer JBG Smith.

Exact details of the deal are still being unveiled, including what financial incentives Virginia and Alexandria are offering Monumental. On Wednesday morning, Virginia Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings said in a press release that “all project investments backed by the Commonwealth and the City will be paid back in full by incremental project revenues; there is no upfront investment by the Commonwealth and no existing taxes or tax increases are a part of this financing plan.”

Some lawmakers expressed opposition to public financing for a sports complex. On Tuesday night, Del. Marcus Simon (D–Fairfax) tweeted that he had been told the deal wouldn’t use state money and would not impact Virginia or Alexandria’s debt capacity, and that it would need to be a “true win-win” to earn his support.

The proposal lawmakers voted for on Monday initially was couched as a first step towards attracting the teams to move to Alexandria, but it turned out to be one huge leap.

It’s clear a deal was already well underway because less than 48 hours later, the Wizards and Capitals appear poised to leave the D.C. arena they called home for 26 years and move to the Commonwealth.

It was also just last month the Washington Post first reported that Monumental Sports was asking D.C. for $600 million to renovate Capital One Arena in Chinatown. Negotiations were reportedly underway between Mayor Muriel Bowser and Monumental to keep the teams in the District, and a number of D.C. councilmembers characterized it as vital to the economic health of the city.

On Tuesday night, Bowser and the D.C. Council made clear they were not ready to be counted out just yet, unveiling joint legislation offering Monumental Sports a $500 million financing deal for a “complete renovation” of the downtown arena. Mayor Bowser and D.C. lawmakers will hold a press conference Wednesday morning to respond to the news, but in a press release on Tuesday Bowser made a final pitch:

“This proposal represents our best and final offer and is the next step in partnering with Monumental Sports to breathe new life and vibrancy into the neighborhood and to keep the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals where they belong – in Washington, D.C.”

D.C.'s Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto, who represents the neighborhood around Capital One Arena, also weighed in, saying she fully supports the proposal.

“It’s imperative that our D.C. teams stay right here at home in Washington D.C.,” she wrote in a statement. “We will keep fighting.”

Across DC government, we stand united to keep our Monumental Sports teams and Capital One Arena in the District. We will keep fighting.

Monumental Sports still owns Capital One Arena and would not completely abandon the venue if the two pro sports teams move. They announced their commitment to “updating” the arena and returning the WNBA’s Washington Mystics downtown. The 2019 WNBA champions moved from the arena to their current home, the Entertainment & Sports Arena in Congress Heights, in 2018. (That venue would remain open as the home of the G League’s Capital City Go-Go.)

Monumental says they plan to renovate Capital One Arena into a slightly smaller, more “flexible” arena, with a seating capacity of 10,000 to 20,000 people. It would continue to host concerts, shows, college basketball, and other events.

“The Monumental team would be able to secure more family shows and accommodate annual bookings and mini-residencies that require long-term planning, which is currently not possible with the seasonal changes from the NBA and NHL’s game schedules,” Monumental Sports said in a press release.

The loss of the two pro sports teams would be a serious setback for Mayor Bowser, who had put the renovation of Capital One Arena at the center of plans to revitalize a struggling downtown. Her office declined to comment on the developments beyond the joint legislation press release Tuesday night. It’s also unknown what if any, financial deal the District would be prepared to offer Monumental to update Capital One Arena if the teams leave.

The Virginia “mini-city” development would become the hub for Monumental Sports, offering the chance to house practice facilities, team offices, and other amenities in one location near the new Potomac Yard Metro stop.

In recent years, Monumental has expanded into the buildings surrounding the downtown arena, including a new esports venue and a state-of-the-art production studio. But the plan is to expand further to include more production studios, practice facilities, and company headquarters. With that, there’s a need for more space.

“Our business needs have changed dramatically since our current arena opened in 1997. We are a multi-faceted sports and entertainment enterprise with teams, venues, and media networks,” Lenosis writes in the press release. “And, with this public-private partnership with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the City of Alexandria, and JBG SMITH, we anticipate an even more dynamic future.”

Officials are expecting to provide more details at the Wednesday press conference, including agreement details, cost, other financial aspects, and what comes next. After today’s announcement, lawmakers in both Richmond and Alexandria will need to approve portions of the deal, including development plans and financial incentives, such as tax breaks and financing.

97,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Australian court tosses woman's 2-decade-old convictions in deaths of her 4 children,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-14/australian-court-tosses-womans-2-decade-old-convictions-in-deaths-of-her-4-children,"CANBERRA, Australia — An Australian appeals court on Thursday overturned all convictions against a woman 20 years after a jury found her guilty of killing her four children.

Kathleen Folbigg already was pardoned at the New South Wales state government's direction and released from prison in June based on new scientific evidence that her four children may have died from natural causes as she had insisted.

The pardon was seen as the quickest way of getting the 56-year-old out of prison before an inquiry into the new evidence recommended the New South Wales Court of Appeals consider quashing her convictions.

Applause filled the courtroom and Folbigg wept after Chief Justice Andrew Bell overturned three convictions of murder and one of manslaughter.

""While the verdicts at trial were reasonably open on the evidence available, there is now reasonable doubt as to Ms. Folbigg's guilt,"" Bell said.

""It is appropriate Ms. Folbigg's convictions ... be quashed,"" Bell said.

Outside court, Folbigg thanked her supporters, lawyers and scientists for clearing her name.

""For almost a quarter of a century, I faced disbelief and hostility. I suffered abuse in all its forms. I hoped and prayed that one day I would be able to stand here with my name cleared,"" Folbigg said.

""I am grateful that updated science and genetics have given me answers of how my children died,"" she said tearfully.

But she said evidence that was available at the time of her trial that her children had died of natural causes was either ignored or dismissed.

""The system preferred to blame me rather than accept that sometimes children can and do die suddenly, unexpectedly and heartbreakingly,"" Folbigg said.

Her lawyer, Rhanee Rego, said their legal team would now demand ""substantial"" compensation from the state government for the years spent in prison. Folbigg had been labeled in the media as Australia's worst female serial killer.

The inquiry that recommended Folbigg's pardon and acquittal was prompted by a petition signed in 2021 by 90 scientists, medical practitioners and related professionals that argued that significant new evidence showed the children likely died of natural causes.

Her first child, Caleb, was born in 1989 and died 19 days later in what a jury determined to be the lesser crime of manslaughter. Her second child, Patrick, was 8 months old when he died in 1991. Two years later, Sarah died at 10 months. In 1999, Folbigg's fourth child, Laura, died at 19 months.

Prosecutors argued she smothered them. She was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Evidence was discovered in 2018 that both daughters carried a rare CALM2 genetic variant that could have caused their sudden deaths.

Experts also testified that myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, was also a possible cause of Laura's death.

There was also expert evidence that Patrick's sudden death was possibly caused by an underlying neurogenetic disorder.

The scientific explanations for the three siblings' deaths undermined the prosecutors' case that the tragedies established a pattern of behavior that pointed to Caleb's probable manslaughter.

100,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,A new documentary examines the 'Star Wars Holiday Special' and asks: Why?,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-13/a-new-documentary-examines-the-star-wars-holiday-special-and-asks-why,"SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

A long time ago - November 1978, to be exact - instead of episodes of ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Wonder Woman,"" CBS aired a holiday special that was, well, totally out of this world.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL"")

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: ""The Star Wars Holiday Special.""

DETROW: That's right. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all appeared in their roles as Luke, Han Solo and Leia. But there were guest stars, too. People like Bea Arthur were there. There was singing and dancing. There were skits. George Lucas had authorized ""The Star Wars Holiday Special,"" but as you could possibly tell from that description, he hated it. It never aired again, and instead it became a beloved bootleg passed around from fan to fan. Now, a documentary called ""A Disturbance In The Force"" looks back at the special, talking to some of the famous fans who love it and the people who made it. And it asked the key questions, why, how did this ever happen, and others. Linda Holmes of NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour joins us now to cover this strange territory. Welcome, Linda.

LINDA HOLMES, BYLINE: Thank you so much for having me. This is very exciting. I know you are a ""Star Wars"" guy.

DETROW: I am. And I can still remember, like, the first time I came across clips of this in, like, the GeoCities-era internet, and just thinking, like...

HOLMES: Yep.

DETROW: ...What is going on? Like, what is this? How did this special become so legendary?

HOLMES: Well, in the documentary, there are a bunch of guys who are ""Star Wars"" people like Patton Oswalt and Weird Al Yankovic and other kind of famous nerds. And they talk about how the fact that they never released this on any kind of home video officially made it feel sort of forbidden.

DETROW: Yeah.

HOLMES: So having a copy of it or even really knowing about it was a currency among fans. But I do think that also, it would not be as famous as it is if it were not as weird as it is.

DETROW: And for those who have not had the delight of watching clips of this, how would you quantify the weirdness of this...

(LAUGHTER)

DETROW: ...Of this special?

HOLMES: I would say, on a scale of one to 10, the weirdness is at least a 12 or 13.

DETROW: Yeah.

HOLMES: The story in the special, to the degree there is one, is about Chewbacca trying to get back to his home planet to celebrate something called Life Day with his family. And they basically just hang a bunch of skits on that frame. So, for example, Chewbacca's wife tries to follow along as a TV chef who's sort of a Julia Child type with forearms - makes bantha surprise.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL"")

HARVEY KORMAN: (As Chef Gormaanda) Now, today I'm going to be using the tenderest cut of the bantha, the loin. The loin is very tasty and serves four nicely. But, of course, if your family has a hearty appetite, I would suggest then that old popular holiday favorite, the bantha rump.

HOLMES: The chef is played by Harvey Korman, and it's just - it's entirely comedic, but it's just kind of goofy. But I would have to say, I have to defend as the weirdest part Chewbacca's father, whose name is Itchy, putting on a virtual reality helmet and watching a kind of sensual presentation by Diahann Carroll, who, they explain in the documentary, replaced the original choice, who was Cher. There is no other way to say it. It seems like Diahann Carroll is trying to turn Itchy on. And you're not going to believe me, so I do have tape.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL"")

DIAHANN CARROLL: (As Mermeia Holographic) Oh, yes. I can feel my creation. I'm getting your message. Are you getting mine?

DETROW: Oh, my God, I forgot. I forgot about this particular detail.

HOLMES: (Laughter).

DETROW: Like, yeah (laughter).

HOLMES: It's quite odd.

DETROW: (Laughter).

HOLMES: It's quite odd.

DETROW: I mean, like, the people who made ""Star Wars"" had some high-quality, you know, ideas, but then this happened. Like, who was like, you know what? This is going well. I like this script.

HOLMES: Well, what they say in the documentary is that ""Star Wars"" had come out in 1977 and been this enormous hit. But now it was 1978, and there was some concern at Lucasfilm and elsewhere that people would forget all about it before the next movie came out, because this was kind of before Star Wars was what Star Wars is now.

DETROW: Right.

HOLMES: So who knows if they're going to care by the time the second movie comes out? They also saw an opportunity to sell toys to kids at holiday time, because now you're, you know, a year and a half after the movie, you remind everybody how much they liked these characters.

DETROW: Still, though, how did it get so goofy?

HOLMES: Well, one of my favorite parts of the documentary is there's a rundown of what variety specials looked like in the 1970s in general, and the fact that at the time, this wasn't all that unusual a format. In fact, Star Wars had had a segment on Donny and Marie - of course, was Donny and Marie Osmond the world's most wholesome brother and sister, who had their own show. And that segment on their show is a lot stranger than the holiday special.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""DONNY & MARIE"")

UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (As Stormtroopers, singing) We're Darth Vader's Raiders, and we can't believe the things that you do. You're all right.

DETROW: (Laughter).

HOLMES: Yeah. So there were a lot of specials and variety shows just getting kind of thrown out there. So the people who produced this special kind of came from that world, from the variety special world. And they say that George Lucas mostly tapped out and didn't participate very much in putting it together. So it's really a variety show thing and not a ""Star Wars"" thing.

DETROW: And he learned a very important lesson and then didn't let anybody else contribute to the prequels. And he over-learned that lesson (laughter).

HOLMES: I mean, I assume it's one of the steps on his path to being - to, you know, controlling the franchise the way he did for such a long time.

DETROW: Yeah, but that gets to the broader second and third life of this thing, is that it happened and then George Lucas just disowned it, right? There's no other way to put it.

HOLMES: Right, right. And I think, like, if he hadn't done that, it might not have become as big as it is. It kind of developed this what doesn't George Lucas want you to see quality. Is it out there in the wilds of the internet? Of course, yes, but just like those VHS tapes, those are bootlegs. So in a world where it seems like everybody releases everything, anything that seems a little bit like somebody doesn't want you to see it has a special charm.

DETROW: Yeah. I mean, you, you are a critic. Do you think ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"" is worth trying to track down and watch for yourself if you haven't seen it?

HOLMES: You know, I personally tried. I did. But a lot of it is just really boring. At the beginning, Chewy's family is just Wookiee-ing around their treehouse, and they're just doing the Wookiee noise that I'm not going to try to do.

DETROW: I just want people listening to know that the script here has a note in brackets - the Wookiee-ing around is at about 55:30 (laughter).

101,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,"Andre Braugher was a pioneer in playing smart, driven, flawed Black characters",https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-13/andre-braugher-was-a-pioneer-in-playing-smart-driven-flawed-black-characters,"Updated December 13, 2023 at 5:31 PM ET

It is a serious shame that there does not seem to be an official streaming homefor episodes of NBC's groundbreaking police drama, Homicide: Life on the Street.

Because that makes it less likely that a wide swath of younger TV fans have seen one of Andre Braugher's signature roles – as Baltimore homicide Det. Frank Pembleton.

Braugher died Tuesday at the surprising age of 61. But I remember how compelling he was back in 1993, in Homicide's pilot episode, when Braugher took command of the screen in a way I had rarely seen before.

A new kind of cop hero

Pembleton was the homicide department's star detective — smart, forceful, passionate and driven.

He was also a Black man well aware of how his loner arrogance and talent for closing cases might anger his white co-workers. Which I — as a Black man trying to make his way doing good, challenging work in the wild, white-dominated world of journalism — really loved.

Eric Lieboeitz / NBCU Photo Bank / NBCU Photo Bank Clark Johnson as Det. Meldrick Lewis and Andre Braugher as Det. Frank Pembleton.

His debut as Pembleton was a bracing announcement of a new, captivating talent on the scene. This was a cop who figured out most murders quickly, and then relentlessly pursued the killers, often getting them to admit their guilt through electric confrontations in the squad's interrogation room, known as ""The Box."" Pembelton brashly told Kyle Secor's rookie detective Tim Bayliss that his job in that room was to be a salesman – getting the customer to buy a product, through a guilty confession, that he had no reason to want.

Braugher's charisma and smarts turned Pembleton into a breakout star in a cast that had better-known performers like Yaphet Kotto, Ned Beatty and Richard Belzer. He was also a bit of an antihero – unlikeable, with a willingness to obliterate the rules to close cases.

Here was a talented Black actor who played characters so smart, you could practically see their brains at work in some scenes, providing a new template for a different kind of acting and a different kind of hero. And while a storyline on Homicide which featured Pembelton surviving and recovering from a stroke gave Braugher even more challenging material to play, I also wondered at the time if that turn signaled the show was running out of special things to do with such a singular character.

Turning steely authority to comedy

Trained at Juilliard and adept at stage work, Braugher had a steely authority that undergirded most of his roles, especially as a star physician on the medical drama Gideon's Crossing in 2000 and the leader of a heist crew on FX's 2006 series Thief – both short-lived dramas that nevertheless showcased his commanding presence.

Eventually, Braugher managed another evolution that surprised this fan, revealing his chops as a comedy stylist with roles as a floundering, everyman car salesman on 2009's Men of a Certain Age and in the role many younger TV fans know and love, as Capt. Ray Holt on NBC's police comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

I visited the show's set with a gang of TV critics back in 2014, interviewing Braugher in the space painstakingly decked out as Holt's office. The set designers had outdone themselves, with fake photos of the character in an Afro and moustache meant to look like images from his early days on the force and a special, framed photo of Holt's beloved corgi, Cheddar.

Eric Deggans / NPR / NPR Braugher on the set of Brooklyn Nine-Nine in 2014.

Back then, Braugher seemed modest and a little nonplussed by how much critics liked the show and loved Holt. He was careful not to take too much credit for the show's comedy, though it was obvious that, as the show progressed, writers were more comfortable putting absurd and hilarious lines in the mouth of a stoic character tailor-made for deadpan humor.

As a longtime fan, I was just glad to see a performer I had always admired back to playing a character worthy of his smarts and talent. It was thrilling and wonderful to see a new generation of viewers discover what I had learned 30 years ago – that Andre Braugher had a unique ability to bring smarts and soul to every character he played.

Applications for the Guaranteed Income Program in Prince George’s County are now live.

""This $800 would be tremendous help for me and my family,"" said District Heights resident Phyllis Wright.

She just put in her application for the county’s pilot income program.

""We are really struggling,"" she told FOX 5 Wednesday.

District 7 Council Member Krystal Oriadha, and county leaders including County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, passed a bill that will give people $800 a month for two years to help them cover basic needs, and improve financial stability throughout Prince George's.

""Have you been to the grocery store lately? $800 can go a long way with food, gas … The gas prices are high,"" 62-year-old Wright explained.

To qualify, you must be a young adult coming out of the foster care system, a formerly incarcerated person who was recently released, or an adult 60 and older making $50,000 or less.

Featured article

""There are so many seniors I’ve talked to who are struggling to get meals and pay property taxes,"" Councilmember Oriadha said.

For 24 months, the program will dish out $4 million to 175 county residents, and you don’t have to pay it back or report how you choose to spend the money.

""We trust you, and we trust you to do what you need with these funds,"" Oriadha added.

For adults 60 and older, to be considered you must live in a specific area in the county.

""So, really a focus inside the beltway cause the goal is to look at communities that have been impacted by lack of access to healthy eating, access to health care, and prioritizing those seniors,"" Oriadha explained.

""I pray that I will be one of those seniors that are chosen,"" Wright said.

Applications close on January 1, 2024.

The crash was reported around 10:15 a.m. Wednesday along the inner loop of Interstate 495 near Georgia Avenue in Montgomery County.

Deadly work zone hit-and-run crash leaves 1 dead on DC beltway

Maryland State Police have identified the victim as Eric Lewis, 57, of Washington, D.C. Emergency medical service personnel from Montgomery County pronounced him dead at the scene.

According to the preliminary investigation, Lewis was a crew member of a mobile tree trimming company working on the shoulder of I-495 when he was struck by a vehicle traveling eastbound on I-495 into the work zone.

The driver did not remain at the scene. Investigators from the Maryland State Police Crash Team are leading the investigation.

They believe the suspect was driving a Freightliner truck hauling a flatbed with a forklift. Detectives think the suspect's vehicle is missing the right front headlight assembly.

The crash investigation blocked two lanes of the highway and snarled traffic Wednesday morning.

According to the Montgomery County Police Department, the victim was walking to her car in the 7700 block of Woodmont Ave. just before 1 a.m. Tuesday when she was tackled from behind and brought down to the ground by two suspects.

The suspects then demanded her car keys, cash, credit cards, and iPhone, and she complied.

""When it happened, I didn’t do the reaction I should have done, which is throw my bag at them and run away,"" the woman told FOX 5. ""I did struggle with them quite a bit. I was yelling out ‘help, help’ although to be honest, part of that was because I didn’t want them to throw me in the car and take me to an ATM or something like that.""

The victim told FOX 5 that the suspects then drove away in her 2012 Honda Fit. After she reported the incident to the police, a lookout was placed for the vehicle.

Officers later found the Honda Fit at the intersection of Georgia Ave. and Seminary Rd.

A traffic stop was conducted, and three suspects were taken into custody.

Police say 18-year-old Joseph Frank De-La-Paz, a 16-year-old, and a 15-year-old have all been charged with carjacking, assault and robbery.

De-La-Paz was transported to the Montgomery County Central Processing Unit.

The 16-year-old was charged as an adult, and transported to the Montgomery County Central Processing Unit. At the time of this arrest, the 16-year-old had an active arrest warrant for a carjacking that he allegedly committed on Wednesday, Nov. 8 in Rockville.

The 15-year-old was transported to a juvenile detention center. That teen has also been charged with an armed carjacking that occurred on Tuesday, Nov. 7 in Wheaton."

Wes Moore said Wednesday that he believes a new lease agreement with the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards is ""imminent,"" as an end-of-the-year deadline approaches.

Moore spoke to reporters after a meeting of the state’s Board of Public Works, which would need to approve a final deal. The governor spoke about the negotiations after his administration announced Friday that it would address concerns expressed by the state Senate president about a proposed agreement.

""We’ve been working all throughout the weekend and the week with all the partners, and we feel very confident that a deal is imminent,"" said Moore, who chairs the three-member board.

It was the board’s last scheduled meeting this year, though Moore emphasized that it was the last regularly scheduled meeting, suggesting another one could be called to approve a new lease before the end of the year.

""We have to do, and we’re going to do, the best deal for the taxpayers,"" Moore said. ""We’re going to make sure that this is a long-term deal. We’re not doing a one-year, we’re not doing a short-term deal. We are going to make sure that we are being good stewards of taxpayer dollars, and we have to make sure we’re creating winners, not just on the field but also winners off the field.""

The Orioles’ lease at Camden Yards expires at the end of the year. In September, the team dramatically announced a new 30-year deal to stay at the ballpark — a message to that effect appeared on the scoreboard in the middle of a game the night the team clinched the AL East.

107,[Maryland] https://www.fox5dc.com/tag/us/md,Maryland Department of Education's new 'Report Card' shows mixed results for state's public schools,https://www.fox5dc.com/news/maryland-department-of-education-report-card-shows-fewer-five-star-schools-in-the-state,"The Maryland Department of Education released its school report cards Wednesday.

Each public school in the state got a grade. The overall results show a mixed bag but the state made it clear that this year was a tough one to assess.

The department stresses that they changed some components of the way they’re evaluating schools.

For instance, a brand new 8th grade studies evaluation was part of the formula, as well as an academic growth indicator for elementary and middle schools.

A key factor that was a bigger part of the equation this year was absenteeism in schools — something districts are still dealing with after the pandemic.

Given all that, the number of five-star schools has decreased in the state but the number of four-star schools remained flat, and three-star schools jumped significantly.

Chandra Haislet is the Assistant State Superintendent of Assessments and Accountability for the Department of Education. She stresses every school is different but given some of the changes, she says this is a new baseline — especially post-pandemic.

""With every report card release, that is a comprehensive look at where a school is in that space, that year, it’s always important to look at this is our data for this year, what do we need to do to improve and move the work of the school forward and really work on improving those schools,"" Haislet said.

FOX 5 spoke with Evelyn Chung, speaking as a Montgomery County parent and education advocate.

She says she supports the state’s transparency with these grades but stresses it needs to come with additional funding and resources to districts for things like tutoring, substitute teachers and the best educational materials for students.

""Using some of these external standards is going to help. Again though, the concern is when you start to incorporate it and it punishes the students. That’s a problem because, obviously, if your literacy rates are 50% in the 8th grade, they’re going into high school already behind,"" Chung said.

""So the question is what happened from K-8? So that’s where I’d like to see a little more, harder substantive funding and pushing for better curriculum funding and staffing,"" she continued.

There is some good news too.

The state says English test scores are back to pre-pandemic levels but math does still lag behind. They also say the absenteeism issue is a problem but getting better state-wide."

It's a deal that's stalled for now, causing frustration for fans and concern for one outspoken Baltimore city leader.

At Pickles Pub, in the shadow of Camden Yards, drinks are pouring at the bar and there's talk at the tables.

""The Orioles belong to us. They are us,"" said one woman with gusto.

Bird fans speaking out on the Orioles and the organization's looming lease.

""I think people are like, really, what's going on? Everyone's like why isn't this done and so, I'm just personally hoping that it happens soon and everyone can just move on,"" said Kurtis Donnelly who became an O's fan after moving to Baltimore 15 years ago.

""It's very important to the city. it's very important to us. It's very important to the livelihood of people around here, so, we want it,"" said R.J. Hurley, the bartender and an O's fan.

In Annapolis Wednesday, Moore presided over the state's Board of Public Works, which would need to approve a final deal. After the meeting, Moore expressed his belief that an agreement would be reached.

Baltimore City Councilman Isaac ""Yitzy"" Schleifer, who represents District 5, is among city leaders watching and waiting.

""I'd like to see a deal done but one that is good for the citizens,"" said Schleifer.

In a tweet this week, Schleifer said he's excited to see the next evolution of Ravens stadium. But he called out the stalled negotiations involving the Orioles.

""Look, I trust the governor and I think the governor is acting in good faith in the negotiations. But I simply don't trust the Angelos (family has) been negotiating in good faith. They have not been good owners of the local sports team and they haven't been good partners in the city,"" said Schleifer.

The Orioles' lease at Camden Yards expires December 31, 2023.

Late last week, the governor put the brakes on a new deal after Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson, whose district includes the stadium, raised concerns about some of the conditions--namely a 99-year development rights agreement that would allow the Orioles to develop areas surrounding the ballpark.

Ferguson released a statement Friday, saying: ""Fundamentally, I believe that the long-term lease for the use of the ballpark should not be conditioned on whether or not a private owner receives a 99-year ground lease to develop land owned by Maryland taxpayers.""

""I agree 100 percent with Sen. Ferguson. We have not seen the Angelos family invest in the Orioles, why should we trust them to invest in the area around the stadium? That just doesn't make any sense to me,"" said Schleifer.

The governor emphasized Wednesday that it was the board's last regularly scheduled meeting, suggesting a special meeting would have to be called to approve a new lease before the end of the year."

""It's only about 2% of the population but those who use it for recreation is 30-40%,"" said a county bike planner.

Police arrested Charles Anderson, 17 years old at the time, as the shooter, and then 18-year-old Donyell Morris.

Anderson had previous run-ins with law enforcement as a juvenile, including an armed robbery when he was 17.

Last Friday, Anderson was sentenced for killing Foster and her friend Julien Rosaly.

Fox45 spoke with Helena and Rob Foster, Brittany's parents after the sentencing.

“He walked over to my daughter who was on her knees, crying, and executed her, putting bullets in her head. That’s what happened,"" said Rob Foster.

“Why, why did they have to do it? They had her pocketbook,"" said Helena Foster.



Although Brittany's murder happened before the current juvenile laws took effect, a violent juvenile offender was released back on the street.

“When he was 17 years old, he was arrested for armed robbery assault gun charges when he was 17 and then a couple of days later the judge, Judge Bloomquist, let him out on a hundred-thousand-dollar unsecured bond, without any conditions. Six months later, he robbed, and murdered my daughter,"" said Helena Foster.



Now these parents, still dealing with the grief, are calling out the current juvenile laws and those behind them.

At Anderson's sentencing, his attorney claimed Anderson did not know what he was doing at the time, because his brain was not fully developed.

114,[Maryland] https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local,"State's Attorneys Bates, Braveboy team up on 2024 legislative priorities targeting juvenile crime: 'How can you have rehabilitation without accountability?'",https://foxbaltimore.com/newsletter-daily/states-attorneys-bates-braveboy-team-up-on-2024-legislative-priorities-targeting-juvenile-crime-how-can-you-have-rehabilitation-without-accountability,"With less than one month before the next legislative session, all eyes have been on lawmakers to see what will happen within the juvenile justice system after months of criticism from police, prosecutors, and parents about the current laws. Now, prosecutors from two of the most populated jurisdictions are teaming up to push for legislative proposals they say will help curb the violence.

Baltimore City State’s Attorney Ivan Bates and Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy sat down for an exclusive interview with FOX45 News to go over the legislative package, which according to them, stems from listening to their constituents about their concerns.

“We’ve had the opportunity to really talk and share and say, what can we do – united -- to hopefully fix the problems we’re suffering, together,” Bates said.

“We have the most at stake in this upcoming session. Between Baltimore City and Prince George’s County, we make up the lion’s share – not all -- of juvenile offenders, as well as adult offenders,” Braveboy added.

We look like the majority of the people we prosecute, and we look like the majority of the victims in our respective jurisdictions in many ways we are fighting for our families, Braveboy continued. We understand the issues facing people in our community and we want to have real, meaningful solutions that will make our communities safer.

Currently, juveniles 13 years old and younger cannot face charges for non-violent misdemeanor offenses. However, Bates and Braveboy are suggesting – and urging – lawmakers to make tweaks to the law to ensure kids who carry, transport, or have a gun on them, along with using a car without permission; the two prosecutors said car theft and carjackings are different crimes that have different requirements.

Bates said the Department of Juvenile Services gets a case first, and in many instances, the prosecutors aren’t involved in the process until later.

“Right now, if it deals with a misdemeanor, wear and carry and transport of a handgun, or second-degree assault, those cases automatically go to DJS. We want to change that,” Bates added. “If we aren’t involved in the case from the beginning we can’t prove the case.”

“The ultimate goal is not to lock everyone up forever; the ultimate goal is rehabilitation,” Braveboy said. “But how can you have rehabilitation without accountability? That’s what we are looking for.”

Amending the length of probation for young people appears to be one of the hallmark pieces of the legislative agenda. Many lawmakers, including several from the House Judiciary Committee – which has held three hearings this fall about juvenile crime – have argued the length of probation isn’t long enough to ensure young people are completing programs assigned to them from DJS.

Current law caps probation to six months for certain misdemeanors and two years for violent felonies. Under the Bates and Braveboy proposal, those probation limits would increase to 18 months and four years, respectively.

ALSO READ |

Currently, juveniles can be required to participate in a DJS-authorized program in an attempt to rehabilitate them after a crime is committed. However, Braveboy said the waiting period for those programs can sometimes be almost as long – if not longer – than the probation sentence itself.



“That’s a problem, and it’s a very big problem because there are not enough resources available through the Department of Juvenile Services,” Braveboy said. “I think we have to support and work with DJS; they are the experts on children here in the state of Maryland.”

Braveboy also said there needs to be “an honest dialogue” with DJS and when pressed on what that meant, she said right now the dialogue isn’t always open.

“We don’t know in real-time when children are violating their probation,” she said.

When kids do violate probation, another legislative priority centers around notification. Bates and Braveboy both said the courts need to know as quickly as possible when a child violates their probation. When someone is on home monitoring, there’s a difference between a GPS monitor and a non-GPS ankle monitor, according to Bates.

Ensuring every juvenile is on a GPS monitor is something Bates said could help with tracking when violations occur.

“We have to make sure that DJS immediately gives real-time explanation [for the violation],” Bates said.

Once they have been violated, we would like to have a judge – a judicial magistrate – make the determination whether to bring them in and talk to them, and if they’ve violated and the court feels hey – we must detain them to get their attention, that’s the court’s prerogative, Bates added.

When it comes to other legislative proposals, the Juvenile Interrogation Act remains another point of frustration for some. Under the law, an attorney must give permission to law enforcement to question the juvenile in question. Bates said law enforcement is required to call a hotline that he said is staffed by public defenders. However, he wants to see the law require attorneys to be present during the meeting and questioning.

“The attorney who is physically there will listen to the information, listen to the evidence, and have the dialogue with the child and that child’s parents and do what’s best for the child,” Bates said.

“I think this really does put parents in a strong position to make decisions on behalf of their children,” added Braveboy.

The prosecution pair also plans to push for changes in the state’s organized crime legislation to broaden the authority of a state’s attorney’s office to allow for indictments of individuals who helped plan or benefit from a crime but may not be present at the time of the crime itself; streamlining the victim compensation fund process and expediting payments; and repeal the five-year cap on a sentencing modification.

Ultimately, any legislation will require some support from Democrats – who control both chambers in the Statehouse – and Gov. Wes Moore. Democrats and Moore have yet to propose their own juvenile crime plan.

“I think so. I think that many of the topics are near and dear to the lawmakers, as they should be, because they are near and dear to many of their constituents,” Braveboy said when asked if she felt there was the political appetite and support to act on the proposals.

“At the end of the day, we serve the people, and this isn’t just what we want, this is what the people have told us they want,” Bates added.

The next session is scheduled to begin on Jan. 10, 2024.

U.S. District Judge George L. Russell, III sentenced 55-year-old Samuel Charles Hardeman, of Easton, to 18 years in federal prison, followed by lifetime supervised release, for attempted coercion and enticement of a minor to engage in illicit sexual activity. Hardeman had a previous federal conviction in a 2002 case in the Northern District of Georgia for use of a computer to entice a child to engage in sexual activity, for which he was sentenced to 174 months in prison. Judge Russell ordered that, upon his release from prison, Hardeman must continue to register as a sex offender in the places where he resides, where he is an employee, and where he is a student, under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA”).



The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, Erek Barron; Acting Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office; and Talbot County Sheriff Joseph Gamble.

According to his guilty plea, from December 11, 2022, through December 26, 2022, Hardeman engaged in conversations with an undercover law enforcement officer (UC) who purported to have a 10-year-old daughter. During the conversations, Hardeman expressed how he wanted to have sex with the 10-year-old, sent a video containing child pornography to the UC, and made plans to drive to New York, where the UC purportedly lived, to have sex with the 10-year-old. Hardeman communicated with the UC by phone, including a video call, text, and using encrypted messaging platforms. All of this occurred while Hardeman was on the sex offender registration for a previous federal sex offense conviction. During a call on December 26, 2022, Hardeman expressed hesitation about traveling to New York to visit the UC and her daughter. The UC did not hear from Hardeman after that time.

ALSO READ |

On March 14, 2023, a federal search warrant was executed at Hardeman’s residence and several electronic devices were seized. A forensic examination of one of the phones revealed the encrypted messaging account which Hardeman used to communicate with the UC, a text message thread between Hardeman and the UC, photos sent to Hardeman by the UC at Hardeman’s request, the photos and videos that Hardeman sent to the UC, and dozens of images and videos depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Forensic examinations of several other devices and Hardeman’s Cloud storage account recovered additional images of child sex abuse material, including bestiality.

This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by the United States Attorney’s Offices and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children, and to identify and rescue victims.

Last month, the Brewers Hill Neighbors Association sent a letter to their local representative, expressing concerns and calls for change.

“Safety is a concern, I think, for everyone. It’s a concern for me and my family,” said Brewers Hill Neighbors President Brant Fisher, “It’s been challenging over the last year because a lot of people just don’t have that comfort level.”

Claiming young offenders are putting residents on edge and at risk, in a letter sent to Delegate Luke Clippinger, the association wrote, “We are deeply troubled by the surge in juvenile crime, specifically an increase in homicides, non-fatal shootings, armed carjackings, and car thefts within our district and across Baltimore.”

The letter went on to demand tangible changes to the juvenile justice system, including:

The charging process for juveniles

Amendments to probation periods for cases involving illegal firearms and felony offenses

Revisions around competency commitments

Increased transparency around the juvenile home monitoring system

Changes to restrictions on police interrogation of juveniles.

“We want to have that accountability piece,” said Fisher.

The letter echoes calls and concerns also being shared by police and prosecutors.

“There’s nothing the law will allow us to do to hold them accountable. They are doing whatever they want,” says Baltimore City State’s Attorney Ivan Bates.

“They come in, we can’t detain them, they are back in the community the next day,” said Montgomery County State’s Attorney John McCarthy.

“The hope with this letter and just having these conversations, is the next session in January that we can come up with solutions to write the ship and get proper laws in place,” said Fisher.

Fisher and Clippinger plan to sit down for a meeting in the coming weeks. FOX45 also asked Clippinger what new legislation he’ll be proposing to help curb juvenile crime. He said legislation is still being drafted despite the start of next year’s session now less than a month away.

“I received the letter from the Brewers Hill Neighborhood Association and I will be speaking with them prior to the start of the legislative session about these important issues. Further, I have held three briefings in the House Judiciary Committee in September, November, and December related to juvenile justice issues. I’m also part of a town hall meeting on December 18 where State’s Attorney Bates, Police Commissioner Worley, and Secretary of Juvenile Services Vincent Schraldi will be in attendance to discuss juvenile justice. I’ll continue to speak to my constituents and stakeholders as legislation is being drafted for introduction after the start of the legislative session on January 10,” said Clippinger in a statement to FOX45."

Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown applauded the Maryland Board of Public Works’ approval of compensation for Grant Jones.

“Mr. Jones’ compensation award will help him address some of the consequences of his wrongful conviction and incarceration. But it cannot restore the years that were unjustly taken away from him. This case underscores the ongoing need for reform within the criminal justice system,” said Attorney General Brown.

Jones will receive $346,913.25 from the Board of Public Works and $89,100.00 from the Department of Housing and Community Development for housing accommodations.

In 1993, Jones was wrongfully accused and convicted of attempted rape and unjustly imprisoned for four years.

This compensation comes at a crucial time as Jones battles failing health, exacerbated by the unjust incarceration that he endured.

The reinvestigation of Jones’ case resulted from the review of another case involving Walter Lomax Act exoneree, David Veney.

While the Wicomico County States Attorney’s Office was reinvestigating Veney’s case, it uncovered striking parallels between the two. Nearly identical accusations were lodged by the same accuser.

After a thorough reexamination of Jones’ case, the Wicomico County SAO determined that Jones, like Veney, was innocent of the crimes of which he’d been convicted.

As a result, the Circuit Court for Wicomico County granted the Wicomico County SAO’s Motion to Vacate Jones' case, and the charges against him were dismissed in August 2023.

On September 8, 2023, Jones sought compensation under the Walter Lomax Act, a 2021 law that establishes a fair and straightforward path for Marylanders who have been proven innocent of a crime to seek compensation from the State.

Judge Kathleen Chapman issued a Final Decision on December 1, 2023, declaring that Jones had been proven innocent, by clear and convincing evidence, of the crime of which he was convicted, and awarded Jones compensation and state-issued benefits.

Also, Jones will receive education and training relevant to life skills, job and vocational training, or financial literacy through the Department of Labor, health and dental benefits from the Department of Health, a State identification card through the Motor Vehicle Administration, and enrollment and payment of tuition and fees for attending a public higher education institution through the Maryland Higher Education Commission.

The controversy began last week when Jones introduced a slew of last-minute amendments to a bill designed to strengthen the IG's ability to weed out waste, fraud, and abuse.

The long-awaited legislation was the culmination of almost a yearlong study from a Blue Ribbon Commission tasked with filing a report on IG best practices. The final report was 100 pages long and cost taxpayers $100,000. However, many of the amendments proposed by Jones, just before the bill was up for a vote, would undermine the commission’s recommendations.

At the center of Tuesday’s debate -- where did the amendments originate?

In a previous interview with FOX45, Jones claimed other council members and ‘stakeholders’ helped him form the amendments, but he refused to reveal who exactly he was referring to.

“You mentioned other county council members helped you propose this. I would like those other county council members to speak up now!” demanded one Baltimore County resident.

“I would like to know who on the council you’re referring to,” said another.

“It was indicated that councilmembers helped you form the amendments, and I know that I can say clearly that I was not one of those members,” Councilman Izzy Patoka said directly to Jones, “I don’t know if you wanted to clarify on that?”

“Well, I was very clear with what I said, and I appreciate you telling me what I know, but I think I'm very capable of knowing what I know, and I thank you very much, and I stand by my statement,” Jones replied.

When asked by a FOX45 reporter why Jones was refusing to be transparent about where the amendments came from, he said, “Well, because that’s a private conversation.”

A private conversation about public legislation that’s strongly backed by Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski, the majority of the County Council, and several local and national organizations, including, the Randallstown NAACP, , the Association of Inspectors General, and Common Cause Maryland.

“The administration supports the bills as introduced, and I urge the council to resist any amendments that are not aligned with the recommendations of the Commission,” said Baltimore County’s Deputy Director of Government Affairs.

If passed, the amendments would block the IG’s power to freely subpoena documents from private contractors, citizens, or companies doing business with the county, allow any county employee involved in an IG investigation to request reimbursement for attorney fees, and create an advisory board that would review and insert recommendations on all IG reports before they’re published.

“An oversight committee is a blatant tactic to thwart and stifle the oversight ability to expose wrongdoing by upper-level management,” said another Baltimore County resident.

“My advisory board has never reviewed any of my investigations ever,” said Baltimore City Inspector General Isabel Cumming, “They have no idea what investigations my office is doing. That is a pillar of independence, and that is why 85% of Inspector Generals in the United States of America do not have advisory boards.”

Jones proceeded to question whether or not Cumming’s advisory board has authority over her budget. She responded, “Right now, I think we’re recommending $2.6 million, I think Ms. Madigan only has about $600,000 and you are a bigger jurisdiction.”

During the hours of public comment, just two people spoke out in favor of the amendments. One said he was a resident who was the subject of an IG investigation in a different jurisdiction, “I was fortunate that an outside agency stepped in to kill the investigation and clear my name,” he said.

Newly appointed Baltimore County FOP President Dave Rose was the only other supporter, “When it comes to getting into people’s personal lives or records, why should it be any different than us,” he said, “And for the record, this is the first time I’ve spoken to Councilman Jones, we’ve had no conversation about this at all!”

Meanwhile, Baltimore County Inspector General Kelly Madigan continued to condemn any and all amendments, claiming they would compromise the integrity of her office. An office designed to protect and investigate how your tax dollars are being spent, without interference and free from politics.

Once the meeting concluded, a FOX45 reporter questioned Jones on his intentions behind the amendments. “On several occasions you expressed concern for the best interest of county employees, is that what this is all about?” questioned a FOX45 reporter.

“Yes, absolutely,” Jones replied.

“As an public official is it your job to serve to best interest of county employees or is it your job to serve the best interest of the taxpayers that you represent?” the reporter responded.

“It’s my job to get it right since many of the employees are taxpayers,” said Jones.

It’s important to note that Jones has previously been the subject of two IG investigations. In one report, Madigan claims Jones inappropriately used his government email to solicit reelection donations. In the other, she cited Jones for misusing public dollars to repave a private road, benefiting a Townson business owner and one of Jones’ political donors.

“These amendments would protect you, should you be the subject of another investigation?” questioned a FOX45 reporter.

“The bottom line is it’s not about me. The bottom line, as an elected official, I’m sort of like an open book. It’s not about me or the, or, it’s, it’s about checks and balances and fair play. That’s what it’s about,” said Jones.

Council is scheduled to vote on the amendments next Monday."
