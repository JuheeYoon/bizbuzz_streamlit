The United States is taking a series of actions today, on International Anti-Corruption Day, to promote accountability for those who engage in corruption around the world. President Biden has signed a presidential proclamation to expand the State Department’s visa restriction authorities so those who engage in corruption and their family members can be subject to visa restrictions, strengthening our ability to deny safe haven to those who enable public corruption. Pursuant to current law, I am designating over 30 individuals, including current and former foreign officials and immediate family members, as generally ineligible for entry to the United States due to their involvement in significant corruption.

These actions are complemented and reinforced by the Department of the Treasury’s designations under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program of two former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan government officials, and 44 associated entities, for involvement in transnational corruption. Collectively these actions reinforce our comprehensive effort to promote accountability for corrupt actors and deter future corruption.

Today’s actions target corrupt actors around the world who have misused their public office for personal gain. Through a variety of tools to promote accountability, the United States has designated more than 200 individuals and entities for acts related to corruption in 2023. The United States will continue to coordinate with allies and partners and use all available tools to address corruption in all its forms and promote accountability for malign actors."

The United States stands with those seeking to safeguard democracy and rule of law in Guatemala and ensure that the will of the Guatemalan people is respected. Under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, we are taking steps to impose visa restrictions on nearly 300 Guatemalan nationals, including over 100 members of the Guatemalan congress, as well as private sector representatives and their family members for undermining democracy and the rule of law. The United States will continue to take steps to impose such restrictions on any individuals who undermine Guatemala’s democracy.

The United States strongly condemns ongoing anti-democratic actions by Guatemala’s Public Ministry and other malign actors who undermine Guatemala’s rule of law. Most recently, the Public Ministry’s announcement of arrest warrants for electoral workers and party representatives, its request to remove the immunity of President-elect Arévalo, and its attempts to annul electoral results constitute evidence of its clear intent to delegitimize Guatemala’s free and fair elections and prevent the peaceful transition of power. These actions are plainly inconsistent with the Inter American Democratic Charter.

These brazen measures follow a long list of other anti-democratic actions including: the lifting of immunity of electoral magistrates, the political targeting of opposition members, the intimidation of peaceful protestors, raids on storage facilities housing election result records, and the opening of ballot boxes."

1:32 p.m. EST

MR MILLER: All right. Happy Monday, everyone. Don’t have anything to start with, so Matt.

QUESTION: Yeah. Well, so after the events of – I’m sorry, let me turn my recorder on. After the events of Friday – particularly the veto at the Security Council, the Secretary’s meeting with the Arab and Islamic foreign ministers, and then the emergency determination on the tank munitions to Israel – I’m just wondering: Are you guys aware of how isolated you are?

MR MILLER: So, I would answer that by saying every time we engage with one of our partners in the region and our partners around the world what the Secretary hears is the indispensability of American leadership, both in helping to resolve this conflict and bring an end to it that guarantees the destruction of Hamas and in planning for the days and weeks and months and years to come.

Now, that doesn’t mean that we have agreements with everyone in the region about the best way forward. Obviously, we don’t. There are a number of countries that have called for a ceasefire. We’ve made clear that while we support humanitarian pauses, we think a ceasefire that would allow the leadership of Hamas that plotted and planned October 7th to continue to carry on in Gaza and plan future attacks is one that’s unacceptable. While we have disagreements, ultimately that American leadership is critical both in this conflict and to broader issues in the region.

QUESTION: And you think that you’re demonstrating American leadership now?

MR MILLER: Absolutely. And —

QUESTION: And that’s the last —

MR MILLER: And that does not mean that we are going to agree with every country —

QUESTION: Well, any.

MR MILLER: — about everything.

QUESTION: How about every? How about any country?

MR MILLER: So, I —

QUESTION: You don’t agree with any country.

MR MILLER: That is – this is not at all —

QUESTION: Except for maybe Israel.

MR MILLER: That is not at all – we don’t agree with Israel on everything related to this conflict.

QUESTION: But – no, but —

MR MILLER: But no, I —

QUESTION: But what happened on – what happened on Friday and Saturday and over the weekend, you have one country that stands with what you’ve —

MR MILLER: So, I think if you’ve looked at the results of our diplomacy over the past few months, you cannot take any one piece of data – be it a UN Security Council vote or anything else, and say that that represents the sum and total of our diplomacy, because it doesn’t. There are other things that we have done in working with the G7, with partners in the region, that we’ll continue to work on.

QUESTION: So, the bottom line is you are not concerned that you’re – that it appears the rest of the world, with the exception of Israel —

MR MILLER: I would say —

QUESTION: — is angry at you and is not – is unhappy with the position that the administration has taken, and that that is American leadership?

MR MILLER: I would say that —

QUESTION: Correct?

MR MILLER: — this conflict has posed a number of obstacles for Israel, for countries in the region, for the United States, for the entire global community. And so, we are trying to resolve this conflict – as I said, ultimately with a result that protects civilian lives to the maximum extent possible, that ensures that Hamas cannot rearm and refit and launch the attacks of October 7th again. We’re trying to work on how to achieve a lasting, secure peace for the Palestinian people and the Israeli people and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and we are engaged every day from the President and the Secretary on down.

And I will say that, even when we have policy disagreements – including sometimes very serious policy disagreements – every country that we engage with says they want to see America engaged. They want to see America engaged both in helping to manage this conflict and helping to prevent the conflict from spreading, and helping to plan for post-conflict governance in Gaza and beyond.

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: So, I – the – I know that’s a long way of answering. The point I’m trying to make is you can’t take a disagreement at the Security Council or a disagreement over pieces of policy and I think impute broader trends from that, other than to say that of course this conflict is posing challenges for every country in the world – is posing very serious challenges, of course, to the Government of Israel and posing very severe difficulties to the Palestinian people. That’s I think the first-order question.

For the United States, we’re going to continue to try and stay involved, because we think it’s in the interests of the – Israel, the Palestinian people, broader regional security, and of course the security of the United States.

QUESTION: Okay, last one. You’re very fond of saying – you and every previous administration I’ve covered are very fond of saying in terms of numerous conflicts, almost every conflict around the world, that there is no military solution to this. And yet your actions over the course of the last five days suggest that you think that there is or that the only solution to this conflict is military. Is that an accurate reading?

MR MILLER: No, I don’t think that’s an accurate – because I don’t —

QUESTION: So, you don’t think there’s a military solution?

MR MILLER: Let me just – no, let me answer it this way. I don’t think it’s an accurate reading because I think there would be other conflicts where we say there are potential military solutions. We think the —

QUESTION: Which ones would those be?

MR MILLER: We think the Ukrainian military repelling Russian forces from their borders would be a military solution to that conflict.

QUESTION: Right. Well, no, yeah, but that you’ve always talked about diplomacy at the end.

MR MILLER: Of course. And there will have to be diplomacy at the end. But as an immediate —

QUESTION: Diplomacy at the end with Hamas, between Israel and Hamas?

MR MILLER: I was talking about the first conflict.

QUESTION: Okay. Well —

MR MILLER: With respect to this conflict, we think there can be a military solution to taking out the leadership of Hamas that planned and carried out the attacks of October 7th, in taking out the militants who crossed into Israel and carried out those attacks. Ultimately, there is not a military solution to the broader issues between the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. That is something that cannot be solved militarily. It has to be something that is solved eventually, in our judgment, with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

QUESTION: Okay. Thanks.

MR MILLER: Humeyra, go ahead.

QUESTION: Hi Matt, I have a couple of things. So, the – this administration, earlier this year, unveiled an overhauled arms export policy with increased emphasis on human rights. Let me read this – your policy back to you. Quote, “no arms transfer will be authorized where the United States assesses that it is more likely than not that the arms to be transferred will be used by the recipient to commit, facilitate recipients’ commission of, or to aggravate risks that the recipient will commit: genocide; crimes against humanity; grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, including attacks intentionally directed against civilian objects or civilians protected as such; or other serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law,” end quote.

So just want to understand, given the flow of weapons transfers to Israel, is it the U.S. assessment that its weapons provided to Israel are not being used in any of the situations that I’ve just read out loud and are described in this policy?

MR MILLER: So, I will say that our expectation of every country to whom we provide military assistance – weapons and other assistance – is that they use that assistance in full compliance with international humanitarian law and the laws of war, and Israel is no exception.

QUESTION: Right. But at the moment, you just told me your expectation. However, there has been some results on the ground that we have seen. So what is the U.S. assessment on the results that it has seen so far on the ground?

MR MILLER: So let me take that in a couple ways. One, with respect to any specific – you know I get asked sometimes about a specific strike or a specific use of an arm – I’m not able to offer an assessment here from this podium. I often don’t have all the available information.

With respect to the overall use of arms, we have not made any specific determination of the type that you laid out in the intro to the question, but we have said we think there are more things that Israel can do to minimize civilian harm. The Secretary talked about some of those this weekend. We think there needs to be more predictability in the south for when humanitarian pauses can take place. There needs to be more predictability in terms of the corridors that humanitarian – that civilians could use to get themselves out of harm’s way and designated time periods when those are protected. There needs to be more predictability in those same corridors so aid can come in.

And with respect to the use of the weapons we provide and with respect to the use of weapons that we don’t provide but that Israel uses on its own, we have been clear in all of our conversations with them that they need to comply with international humanitarian law and the laws of war. We have been quite clear with that at the highest possible levels of this government and that – and we’ll continue to do so.

QUESTION: Right. And just a couple more things. Sorry. Are you – could you say that U.S. has a full understanding of where exactly the weapons and the ammunition that it has sent to Israel are being used, like locations and specific offenses, specific fighting, and all of that?

MR MILLER: I just can’t —

QUESTION: That you are keeping track of it?

MR MILLER: I can’t – I would refer you the Pentagon for a more specific assessment. I can’t do so from here.

QUESTION: Right. And the final thing is like the Secretary talked about the gap, and you’re referring to his comments. Yesterday he, sort of, laid out like more pauses and specific humanitarian corridors for people to – assistance – for assistance to find its way. But right now, we’re basically looking at a bit of a, like, societal breakdown inside Gaza in Khan Yunis, where even if the – even if there is an increase in the number of aid trucks going in, it’s simply not going to the people. Have you – has this administration had conversations with the Israelis over the weekend on this specific challenge, and what assurances have they given you?

MR MILLER: Yes. We have had specific conversations with them. Our special envoy on the ground, David Satterfield, has had in-person meetings with the Israeli Government about these very issues over the weekend. We had them at the highest levels of this department to make very clear that more needs to be done to get humanitarian access in.

We have seen – so as you know, just to give it some context, we saw expanded levels of humanitarian access during the pause. Part of that was that the Government of Israel was allowing more humanitarian access to get in through the Rafah crossing. Part of that was because there was a pause it was much more easy – it was much easier for the enablers, the deliverers of humanitarian access, to move it around Gaza.

Since the resumption of combat operations in the south, we have seen the Israeli Government decide to let more humanitarian assistance in, which is good – something we support, something that we have urged them to do and have been gratified that they have done. And there has been – the problem is now getting that humanitarian access not just through Rafah but then delivered to the people that – who need it. And that goes with what I was laying out at the beginning, which is there needs to more predictability in terms of when there are pauses, where there are pauses, so civilians can get to safe areas, and so the humanitarian access can be delivered.

And I will say, we are laser-focused on that and have had ongoing, sometime nearly hourly, conversations with the Government of Israel, as well as, I should say, with United Nations agencies about how exactly to implement that.

Jen.

QUESTION: Matt, can I follow up? You and the Secretary have laid out these additional steps you’d like to see Israel take. But have you given them any ultimatum to actually take those steps? Will there be any punitive measures if they continue to refuse to do so?

MR MILLER: So, I am never going to speculate about what steps we might take in public. I will say that if you look at the totality of the Secretary’s engagements with the Government of Israel, on his first trip to the region – went to Israel, went around the region, came back and said to the Government of Israel, we need you to open Rafah gate to allow humanitarian access in. And as you may recall, there was a big negotiation over that. And ultimately, we got humanitarian access in.

On his second trip to the region, he came and said, we need to see humanitarian pauses, and was very clear with the Government of Israel that that’s what we wanted to see. You might remember that the Government of Israel rejected it out of hand publicly; a few days later, started to implement daily humanitarian pauses of I think six hours or so. We eventually saw those expanded to other pauses.

We are continuing to engage with them now on things we want to see. Last week, we were engaging them to get more fuel in, so you could run desalinization plants – so people get water, so humanitarian access could be delivered. I think as you know, initially there was a reluctance to allow a certain amount of fuel in. That level of fuel has gone up.

So the approach that we have taken, of conducting intense diplomacy and in some times having some very direct, candid conversations with them about what our expectations are and what we want to see done has delivered results. Does that mean there’s not more to be done? Of course not. There is very much more to be – that can be done, and we will continue to engage with – in these conversations with them.

QUESTION: But Matt, I mean, international humanitarian groups, these ministers he met with on Friday are saying there’s not time for this incremental approach, there’s not time for this to take weeks and weeks to play out. So, are you putting additional pressure on them to say, like, this needs to be done in the coming days, the coming hours, as the situation on the ground has completely collapsed?

MR MILLER: We do not want to see it take weeks. We share those concerns about the situation on the ground, which is very, very difficult; extremely difficult for civilians right now in Gaza to access the food, the water, the medicine they need. It’s tough to move around in the middle of a conflict. So, we’re going to continue to have these conversations with the Government of Israel.

But – I haven’t said it yet in this briefing, I haven’t been asked yet in this briefing – I do want to reiterate that this is only a challenge because Hamas continues to embed itself inside the civilian population in southern Gaza, in Khan Yunis, in the very places where we are trying to get humanitarian assistance into civilians. The reason it is so difficult to do all this is that Hamas will not vacate its tunnels; Hamas will not stop hiding behind civilians; Hamas will not lay down its arms.

So, we always need to remember that the situation that Israel is operating in is really unprecedented in trying to conduct urban warfare in this very dense environment where you have an opponent who just carried out a brutal terrorist attack and is committed to carrying out more terrorist attacks, and continues to hide behind civilian – the civilian population.

Now, that in no way lessens Israel’s responsibility, and it in no way lessens our commitment to be very clear with Israel about what their responsibility is. But I do think we have to remember that that’s what makes this thing so difficult from the beginning.

QUESTION: I have one more on Israel, and one on a separate topic. But photos emerged – I don’t think you’ve been asked about this at the podium – photos emerged last week of Israeli forces detaining, blindfolding, and having stripped down men in Gaza. Does the State Department have any comment on this? Do you think it’s appropriate for such images to be taken? Do you agree with the Israeli assessment that these were Hamas fighters, given there are people who are saying these are normal civilians, family members?

MR MILLER: So those images were – we found those images deeply disturbing, and we are seeking more information, both about the nature of the images and of course why they’re public in the first place.

QUESTION: Have you gotten any responses from the Israeli Government?

MR MILLER: We are seeking more information. I don’t have a response at this point.

QUESTION: And can I ask on a separate topic?

MR MILLER: Yeah, of course.

QUESTION: Alexei Navalny’s team says he has been missing for several days; they have no idea where he is. Does State have any information on his whereabouts or what’s going on there?

MR MILLER: We do not have any information about his whereabouts. We are deeply concerned for Mr. Navalny’s well-being, after his lawyers have stated that they have not been able to contact him for almost a week now, and after he did not appear at his scheduled court appearance today. We have communicated to the Russian Government that they are responsible for what happens to Mr. Navalny, while he is in their custody, and they will be held accountable by the international community. We have repeatedly joined Mr. Navalny’s family, his colleagues, supporters around the world in calling for his immediate release without conditions and for the Russian Government to end its continued repression of independent voices in Russia who are subject to relentless harassment and intimidation for exercising their human rights. And we’ll continue to follow the cases of everyone in Russia who has been illegally detained.

QUESTION: Sorry, a quick clarification: You’ve communicated that message to Russia, since the news of him going missing?

MR MILLER: We have. We have.

QUESTION: And at what level was that communicated?

MR MILLER: I don’t have a specific readout.

QUESTION: Can I follow up on Jennifer’s —

MR MILLER: I will come – Said —

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: I’m going to call on – I’ll come – I will —

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: You know every day – every day I come to you. So, go ahead.

QUESTION: I know you do.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt. I wanted to ask a slightly different version of what Humeyra has been asking about, and to specify that this is without regard to internal deliberations, specific attacks, any formal determinations the U.S. may have made: Is the U.S. collecting any information about whether war crimes have been committed in Gaza by either side?

MR MILLER: So, we are monitoring everything that happens in this conflict. We are engaged in conversations with the Israeli Government. And I don’t have anything further to say about our internal activities at the State Department.

QUESTION: “Monitoring.” I mean, I know it’s a flawed comparison, but in the case of Ukraine and Russia, the U.S. was collecting information through open source and intelligence sources, and sharing those actively with allies and other organizations. So, is a similar sort of activity underway?

MR MILLER: I don’t think you can compare them, because as you say, it is a very different environment, it’s a very different place on the ground. But I will say that we’re – not only are we monitoring, but we are in close contact, in close communication with the Israeli Government. There are a number of times where we have sought information about specific actions that they have taken. I’ve talked about that – about some of those from this podium; for example – or I shouldn’t say I did; the Secretary mentioned last week the fact the strike that killed a Reuters journalist in Lebanon, the Secretary said that we have communicated our interest in finding out what happened to the Israeli Government, and they’ve said that they are investigating it. We think that’s appropriate, and we’ll continue to have those very direct conversations.

QUESTION: Okay. Specifically on the question of war crimes, I mean, the U.S. believes, I assume, that there needs to be accountability, if it is determined that war crimes are committed, again, by either side.

MR MILLER: Of course.

QUESTION: And is the U.S. interested in being a participant and arbiter of this? Or if not, is there another country or body the U.S. is interested —

MR MILLER: I just don’t want to address a hypothetical.

QUESTION: All right. I have others that I’ll hope you come back to me.

MR MILLER: Okay. I’ll come back. Said, go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you. I just want to follow up very quickly on the issue raised by Jennifer on the picture of the men stripped down, and so on. You agree with the spokesman for the Israeli Government who said this is the Middle East, and it gets a bit warm. That’s why they —

MR MILLER: So, I haven’t seen that —

QUESTION: You haven’t. Okay.

MR MILLER: Hold up. I haven’t seen that comment. So, I don’t want to comment in specific because I – but I would say that is certainly not a sentiment that we would agree with. We always have been clear with Israel about the necessary (inaudible) of acting in full compliance with international humanitarian law. And that does require that it protects civilians and treat detained individuals humanely and with dignity.

QUESTION: All right. I have a couple more questions. The Saudi foreign minister suggested that the Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki was basically given a gag order that he could not speak in Washington. Could you clarify this?

MR MILLER: No, that’s not accurate. So, I will say – this gets a little complicated because it goes back to a law from —

QUESTION: Right. Right.

MR MILLER: — 30 years ago at this point. So, I think the first claim that was made publicly was that we had imposed a visa restriction —

QUESTION: Right.

MR MILLER: — that prohibits him from speaking. That is not accurate. There is no statute in – or there’s no provision in U.S. law that allows the imposition of such a visa restriction, and we have imposed no such visa restriction. There is a provision in U.S. law going back to 1987 —

QUESTION: Right.

MR MILLER: — the Anti-Terrorism Act, that prohibits the expenditure of PLO funds inside the United States. There have been waivers issued for that law in the past. Congress has changed the requirements for the Secretary to issue one of those – to issue those waivers, such that they cannot be met under current law. But in no way – I would say those – the provisions of that law all relate to the expenditure of funds. So, they in no way limit anyone’s ability to speak.

QUESTION: Okay. Just a couple of more questions. You said that the stated goals – Israel’s stated goals, which you agree with, which is to end Hamas, defeat Hamas, change the regime in Gaza – however that – whatever that means and so on, and free the hostages. Now, it has been 65 days. We have not seen any Hamas leaders brought out, or killed, or named as such and so on. So, you expect this thing to go for another 65 days?

MR MILLER: I do not have —

QUESTION: Before they achieve their goals?

MR MILLER: I do not have an expectation for how long this will go. That’s for – to the Israeli Government to speak to. They have killed, and have been quite public about the fact —

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: — that they have killed a number of Hamas fighters.

QUESTION: Okay. So, I mean, looking at the situation, this could go on for – conceivably, conceivably another 65 days?

MR MILLER: No, Said, I just said —

QUESTION: Okay. All right. Okay.

MR MILLER: — I wouldn’t want to speculate on the outcome, so I don’t think you can follow that up by adding speculation to what I’ve said.

QUESTION: All right. Now, there was – yeah, okay. Now, you also said that you want to see a resolution for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict where there is a two-state solution and so on – all that stuff that the U.S. has always been stating all along for 30 years at least, and so on. Now, today – today – the Israeli prime minister spoke to the defense and foreign relations committees in the Knesset, and he said two things. He said, no Palestinian state, no to Palestinian state. Under any circumstances, no Palestinian Authority in Gaza. No Hamas, and so on.

So do you have any comment on what the prime minister of Israel, who obviously wields a great deal of power – he’s destroying the Palestinians to smithereens. Do you have any comment on what he said?

MR MILLER: So, I think I said earlier in this briefing that we don’t agree with Israel on everything.

QUESTION: Right.

MR MILLER: And, certainly, this would be an example. The Secretary has been quite clear on what our goal is for post-conflict governance. The President has been quite clear that we want to see the Palestinian Authority reunite – reuniting the West Bank and Gaza, making clear we don’t want to see any Israeli occupation, making clear we don’t want to see a reduction of Gazan territory. So, we have laid out the principles that the United States stands by, and we will continue to engage – not just with the Government of Israel, but with our other partners in the region about how to make those – turn those principles into reality.

QUESTION: So why not say this is the Palestinian state that we recognize? It is – its borders are this, it is this, this, and so on; its characteristics are such and such. Why not do that?

MR MILLER: Because we think ultimately this is best resolved by diplomacy and negotiations, which is what we’re pursuing.

QUESTION: All right.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt. Would you say that under U.S. law that any individuals or entity or government that provide financial support to a terrorist organization is vulnerable to – or liable, rather, to prosecution by the U.S. Government?

MR MILLER: I don’t think I’m going to start speaking to any prosecutions by the U.S. Government from this podium – that’s a matter for the Justice Department – let alone hypothetical ones.

QUESTION: Yeah, but you know for a fact that anybody who gives material support to a terrorist organization, you report them —

MR MILLER: I —

QUESTION: — you will accuse them of supporting this terrorist organization.

MR MILLER: I know the status of U.S. law about material support for terrorism, but when it comes to speaking about who might get prosecuted, who might get not, you understand that’s not something —

QUESTION: Sure.

MR MILLER: — that the State Department does.

QUESTION: Okay. I’m just asking you a question because I’m sure you saw the Times report that the Israeli intelligence, with the approval of Netanyahu, has carried suitcases full of cash to Hamas, and the purpose was declared, and this is quotes, that basically this is the only way to prevent a two-state solution if we can only prop up the extremist Hamas in Gaza. So, in this case, won’t the Israeli Government will – be liable for prosecution because they given financial aid to a terrorist organization that you list on your own State Department website as a terrorist organization?

MR MILLER: Again, I am not going to speak to prosecutions from this podium. It’s not something we do at the State Department, and it’s not something we speak to. The Justice Department is quite clear about they’re the only ones inside the government that speak to prosecutions.

QUESTION: Okay. You saw the UN report that Gaza – half of Gazans actually are facing starvation. Apart from Hamas, which you blame normally, who else is bearing responsibility for half of the population that actually can be starving?

MR MILLER: So, I – what I think is that everyone involved in this conflict needs to do more to allow humanitarian assistance to get in and allow the people in Gaza to be able to move around to get access to humanitarian assistance. Of course, there is – Israeli Government plays a role in that, partners in the region play a role in that, the UN agencies play a role in that, and the United States is actively working with all of them to try to increase the amount of humanitarian assistance that gets in for those civilians who desperately need it.

QUESTION: Okay. And finally, you described these images as disturbing, and you said you’re seeking more information from the Israelis on this. But actually, by definition, according to the Geneva Convention, if an army – which in this case these videos were released by the Israeli army filming a civilian population – we know some of them are civilians because some of our colleagues, including journalists, were among them – you take pictures of them and you put them publicly, that’s already a violation of the Geneva Convention and how you treat prisoners of war. So, why do you need to seek more information when you can actually condemn this —

MR MILLER: Because as I said —

QUESTION: — as a violation of international law?

MR MILLER: Because all we’ve seen are the images, and as I’ve said, we’re seeking more information about both the status of those individuals, the status – the circumstances in those videos and how, ultimately, they become – became public, which is very relevant to the very question you asked.

Michel, go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you. I have a couple of questions, if you don’t mind. Did the U.S. first warn the Iraqi prime minister, al-Sudani, of harsh consequences if Iraq does not act to stop the attacks on American and American facilities in Iraq?

MR MILLER: So what I will say is that we have had conversations with the Iraqi Government, and that includes the Secretary, who traveled to Iraq several weeks ago to meet in person with Prime Minister Sudani, and then had a phone conversation with him a little over a week ago to make – to speak about a number of things, but one of the things he made very clear in that conversation is the same thing our ambassador has made clear and same thing others in the U.S. Government have made clear: that U.S. forces are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi Government. They are there conducting an antiterrorism mission that benefits the Iraqi people. And we, of course, expect the Iraqi Government to do more to hold accountable the Iranian-backed militias who first were launching strikes against U.S. military installations and U.S. military personnel; and that as recently as last week were launching strikes against our embassy.

So, we very much do expect the Iraqi Government to do more, and as we have always said, we will take whatever actions we need to as the United States to defend U.S. personnel, defend U.S. interests.

QUESTION: And second, on Lebanon, Israeli defense minister has said today that Israel is open to the possibility of reaching an agreement with Hizballah if it includes a safe zone on the border and guarantees. Do you have any comment on that? Will the U.S. mediate between Israel and Lebanon to reach such agreement?

MR MILLER: So, I’m not going to comment specifically on that report or on that proposal, but I will say that one of our goals from the beginning of this conflict has been to prevent it from widening, and that of course includes from widening – northern Israel into Lebanon. We have had conversations about that with the Israeli Government and encouraged – and said that we very much do not want to see the conflict from widening – for – that we do not want to see the conflict widen and have had conversations with other partners in the region, and we would support – I won’t say anything, but we would support steps that would achieve that goal.

QUESTION: And are you aware of any ultimatum that the Israeli Government issued to Lebanon or to the Lebanese Government?

MR MILLER: No, I’m not.

QUESTION: Thanks.

QUESTION: Matt.

MR MILLER: Go ahead.

QUESTION: Yeah, thank you, Matt. In light of a recent Jerusalem Post report about a UN agency, UNRWA, school teacher in Gaza holding a hostage captive in an UNRWA school, as well as teachers at UNRWA schools in Gaza praising the attacks on social media with ties between Hamas terrorists and the agency schools, is President Biden now willing to defund this terrorist UN organization, UNRWA? And I have a follow-up.

MR MILLER: So, I would just say, with respect to that first report, we saw that report. We sought information from UNRWA about it. I would add that to our knowledge that report has never been verified. Certainly, if that were the case, we would expect accountability for the individual involved, but I do want to speak about UNRWA specifically. UNRWA is providing lifesaving work for Palestinians right now under very difficult circumstances. We’ve seen – I think it’s more than a hundred UNRWA staff killed during this conflict while they are out trying to get food and water and medicine to the Palestinian people. The work that they are doing is essential. It is saving lives. The United States continues to be the largest donor to – of humanitarian access to the Palestinian people. We continue to support UNRWA for the work that it’s doing, and we’ll continue to do it because they are, I will say – as I said a moment ago – actually, they’re on the front lines, UNRWA staff, putting their lives at risk to get food, water, medicine to children, to babies, to civilians. So, we absolutely support the work that they’re doing.

QUESTION: Okay. In light of that Jerusalem Post report of 100 Hamas terrorists confirmed to have graduated from UNRWA schools, what level of terrorist involvement with UNRWA will it take to motivate President Biden to condemn the UNRWA terrorist organization?

MR MILLER: So we always condemn terrorism, and I think that’s pretty clear just based on what you hear me say from this podium every day, and what you’ve heard me say about Hamas since October 7th, but I do want to reiterate what I said about the lifesaving work that UNRWA is doing and how important it is that that work not just continue but it be expanded. We would welcome other countries increasing their levels of support to UNRWA, because we really do think the work they are doing is essential.

Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead, Janne.

QUESTION: Thank you. I have two questions. First question: Kurt Campbell, the nominee for the deputy secretary of state, said at the Congressional confirmation hearing that he has a skeptical stance on North Korea coming to diplomatic table to give up its nuclear weapons. Then what are the other alternatives for the United States denuclearize North Korea?

MR MILLER: I don’t want to speak to hypotheticals. I will say that we will continue to encourage diplomacy with North Korea. That has been our policy all along, but I think it’s safe to say that his skepticism is well-founded given that we have seen North Korea refuse to accept our offer to pursue diplomatic alternatives since the beginning of this administration. And beyond that, I wouldn’t want to speculate about much.

QUESTION: As long as North Korea is providing arms and ammunition to Russia, do you think South Korea should continue to provide artillery shells to support to Ukraine?

MR MILLER: I just don’t have any comment on that. I’ll let South Korea speak to its own decisions.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you.

QUESTION: Thanks. I appreciate it. Just if you have any reaction to the Washington Post report that Israel used white phosphorous on civilians in southern Lebanon.

And then a second question: You mentioned in your – earlier in the press conference that Secretary Blinken referenced the killing of Issam Abdallah, and yet just Friday – or Saturday, was it – you fast-tracked 13,000 of the same shells that killed him. So, is there, like, an incongruity to what the department is doing and saying?

MR MILLER: Let me speak to the first question first, which is that we are concerned by the reports of the use of white phosphorous. Obviously, there is a legitimate military use for white phosphorous, but that does not include using them on civilians. It means that if you use them, you have to do everything you can to minimize civilian harm. Anytime that we provide items like white phosphorous or really anything to another military, we do it with the expectation that it will be used for legitimate purposes and in full keeping with international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict. So we’re looking into this and looking for additional information.

And then with respect to your first question, you heard the Secretary speak to this yesterday. If any of you were up early on a Sunday, or early-ish, you would’ve heard him speak to this and make clear that, look, Israel is engaged in a very difficult military campaign against a terrorist organization that says it wants to repeat the attacks of October 7th. He decided that on this – on – with respect to this sale, this was a munition that they needed on an urgent basis, and so it necessitated an emergency authorization to provide those munitions. But that does not in any way lessen their obligation to act in full compliance with international humanitarian law.

And by the way, that goes for not just the munitions we provide them, but that the munitions that they procure from other countries or that the munitions that they manufacture themselves – they are – we expect them, and they should expect themselves to comply with humanitarian law with respect to any weapon that they use.

QUESTION: Matt, just on the white phosphorous and —

MR MILLER: Yeah.

QUESTION: I mean, this report today is not the first of its kind to allege that Israel has used white phosphorous in this conflict. They go back to, like, I think October 13th. You’ve never expressed concern about them before, which suggests to me that you didn’t believe them. Why now all of a sudden are you saying you’re concerned by this report?

MR MILLER: So, the difference with respect to this report is that the reporting, the story in the Post – and again, it’s a report; it’s why we’re seeking more information – purported that it was used, if not against a civilian target, had significant impact on civilian targets. So that’s the – that’s —

QUESTION: Okay. So, you don’t – and you – so in —

MR MILLER: That’s the reason for —

QUESTION: Back in October, in the first week of this war, when there were allegations that – from Amnesty and others that white phosphorous had been used by Israel in Gaza —

MR MILLER: So —

QUESTION: That you have no problem with because?

MR MILLER: So white – there are legitimate military uses for white phosphorus. So —

QUESTION: Are you – are you saying that there was no —

MR MILLER: So —

QUESTION: — that there was no civilian impact when these were used allegedly in Gaza?

MR MILLER: I’m – no. I’m saying the specific – the specific reporting that we saw in The Washington Post is something that we were concerned about.

QUESTION: How about specific reporting that you saw back on October 13th?

MR MILLER: So, I would – if you want to refresh my memory about what that specific reporting is, I will be —

QUESTION: I will send it to you.

MR MILLER: I would be glad to look at it.

QUESTION: I’ll send it to you.

MR MILLER: But it was the —

QUESTION: I looked it up because I was surprised that John Kirby said the exact same thing as you.

MR MILLER: It was the specific details in this story that we found concerning, and why we’re seeking more information about it.

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: Go ahead, Humeyra. Yeah.

QUESTION: Can I ask a clarification on what you said about Issam? Because I just checked Secretary Blinken’s comments from Thursday. He says it’s my understanding that the Israelis are carrying out an investigation. But I think you said that United States Government has actually sought information about the incident after our story has come out. Is that right?

MR MILLER: We engaged in a conversation with the Israeli Government, and they told us that it’s under investigation. Correct.

QUESTION: Right. Thank you.

MR MILLER: Go ahead.

QUESTION: Different topic. There’s some reporting today that some federal agencies are mobilizing to protect against cyber threats, particularly from the PRC, targeting or having a potential impact on the 2024 elections. Was this brought up at all in the bilaterals in San Francisco?

MR MILLER: So, I’m not going to speak to everything that’s brought up in bilaterals, but you may recall there have been other reports of Chinese cyber activity previously this year – around the time that the Secretary was engaging in meetings with his counterpart Wang Yi. And as we said at the time, we – Chinese cyber activities are something that we typically raise in our meetings with them and have done so for some time.

QUESTION: Can I – just directly related to that?

MR MILLER: Yes, go ahead.

QUESTION: Just because in recent reporting about Chinese military cyber actors embedding in some critical U.S. infrastructure, it was noted in that report that President Biden, in his bilateral with President Xi, did not raise that topic. So, just specifically on that issue, has Secretary Blinken in his recent interactions raised what is now known to be a significant Chinese presence in some critical U.S. infrastructure?

MR MILLER: I just don’t want to give a specific readout about what are private diplomatic conversations, but this is an issue that we have raised on a number of occasions with the Chinese Government. We have long been concerned about their cyber espionage and other intrusive cyber techniques.

QUESTION: Can I go back for an update —

MR MILLER: Yeah. Yeah.

QUESTION: — on aid coming in and Americans coming out? Can you just give us, since it’s been a few days, the latest figure of Americans who have gotten out of Gaza and those still waiting to leave?

MR MILLER: Sure. The number of Americans – and again, it’s American citizens, legal permanent residents, and their family members. I know you know that, so it’s just for the – I can see you shaking the head, but I always have to give the qualifier just so it’s clear what I’m talking about.

Over 1,200 who have made it out now, and there are somewhere around 900 who are remaining.

QUESTION: And to circle back on those reports of a potential American casualty, somebody who was waiting to leave Gaza, have you clarified —

MR MILLER: We still have not been able to confirm it. It’s something we’re trying to do. I had a follow-up conversation with someone today, trying to get more information and confirmed that no, we have not been able to track down any further details or confirm that in fact there’s an American citizen who died in Gaza.

QUESTION: Have you enlisted the Israelis in helping verify that —

MR MILLER: We have tried – I don’t want to speak to specific methods, but we have tried a number of different avenues to try to confirm whether this person indeed died. The safety and security of any American citizen anywhere in the world is our first priority. It’s our utmost concern. We’re actively trying to confirm information and just haven’t been able to do so as of yet.

QUESTION: Okay, and —

QUESTION: Can I just go back – oh, I’m sorry.

MR MILLER: Humeyra.

QUESTION: No, I just want to go back to this white phosphorus thing because I pulled it up. All right, this is the – I’m just going to read you the first sentences. “Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Programme gathered compelling evidence documenting the use of white phosphorus artillery shells by the Israeli army in densely populated civilian areas in Gaza.” But that didn’t bother you.

MR MILLER: Again – again, I don’t —

QUESTION: You weren’t concerned –

MR MILLER: No, let me —

QUESTION: You didn’t express concern then about that. This was —

MR MILLER: I don’t know those —

QUESTION: I’ll send it to you.

MR MILLER: I know, but I don’t know the specifics of whether people were evacuated from those areas before they were used. I don’t know any of the specific —

QUESTION: Does it – does it matter?

MR MILLER: Certainly —

QUESTION: This was October 13th. If people were evacuated —

MR MILLER: Certainly it would matter if people – if people – if people – let me just say if people had moved out of an area and you were only – there were only military targets, of course it would – it would matter. I would say, Matt – but let me just say anytime that we saw white phosphorus being used in a way that would – that would harm civilians, of course it is something that we would be concerned about, which is why, when we saw the reports in The Post, we said that it’s something we found concerning and are seeking more information about.

QUESTION: Well, I’m just curious as to why you didn’t find it concerning the first time it was reported.

MR MILLER: So, October 13th, I think I was on a trip to the Middle East, not standing here at —

QUESTION: And I was too. So, you —

MR MILLER: Not standing here at this podium taking questions.

QUESTION: Well, okay —

MR MILLER: Had you – had I been here and you asked me questions, maybe I would have said then.

QUESTION: Sorry, can I ask —

MR MILLER: Yes, go ahead.

QUESTION: — a clarification on your clarification, because engaged —

MR MILLER: A clarification of my clarification.

QUESTION: Yeah, because “engaged in conversations” is like diplo-speak, and it’s just – when you – when the U.S. Government, when you guys saw the Reuters investigation about the killing of Issam Abdallah by an Israeli – by Israeli tank fire, did you ask the question to the Israelis? Like, what is “engaged in conversations” —

MR MILLER: I’m not – I am not going to get into those private diplomatic conversations. But we saw the report. We wanted to have more information about it. We engaged with the Israeli Government, as we do quite regularly with these types of reports; and were told it was under investigation.

QUESTION: But was the question about targeting of journalists, or was it whether they were the same shells that are provided by the U.S.? Like what was the —

MR MILLER: I’m not going to speak to this specific engagement, but we regularly engage with them about the importance of engaging in international humanitarian law, the importance of doing everything they can to minimize civilian harm, and that of course includes journalists.

QUESTION: And did they give you a timeframe on when their investigation about Issam —

MR MILLER: I’m just not – that is a question —

QUESTION: — and all of the other journalists that were wounded would be completed?

MR MILLER: That is a question for them to answer; it pertains to their investigation.

QUESTION: Afghanistan?

MR MILLER: Go ahead.

QUESTION: Matt, thank you. Mark Stone from Sky News. Can I just return to the images of the Palestinians stripped and in the back of vehicles and seemingly handing in weapons? Why not just condemn the images now? Why wait for an investigation, as you’ve asked for?

MR MILLER: As I said, we found them deeply disturbing. I just don’t have any additional comment on it.

QUESTION: But I can follow up? Is there any circumstance in which those sorts of images would be acceptable?

MR MILLER: Again, we found them disturbing. I don’t want to discuss other potential circumstances. We have found them disturbing. We’ve asked them to clarify the circumstances of these detentions, and we’re going to look to them to provide those details.

QUESTION: And how long will you wait before —

MR MILLER: I’m just —

QUESTION: Can I ask —

MR MILLER: Again, that is – how long it will take is a question for them. We have pressed them for details about these circumstances. We expect them to provide them.

QUESTION: Okay. Because the reason I ask is because, on many different moments over the course of the past however many weeks it has been, we’ve heard the American administration say “we’ve asked for –“ “we’re concerned,” and “we’ve asked for clarification.” “We’ve asked for more detail.” And yet the moments keep coming. And I wonder – is it actually the case that you are, behind the scenes, actually not that worried about Israel’s tactics, its military tactics on the ground?

MR MILLER: So —

QUESTION: Or —

MR MILLER: Let me just —

QUESTION: Or have you lost all leverage with a close ally?

MR MILLER: So, I appreciate the “gotcha” nature of the question.

QUESTION: It genuinely —

MR MILLER: Let me – no, no. Let me just —

QUESTION: Matt, genuinely, it’s not. It’s not – I’m not —

MR MILLER: Sure. Genuinely —

QUESTION: No, no. I want to be clear.

MR MILLER: No, no, genuinely, it is. But that’s okay. It’s fair. I take —

QUESTION: No, no. It’s not okay. I’m not – it’s not a “gotcha” moment. It’s a genuine question.

MR MILLER: If you stop, I’ll answer the question.

QUESTION: Sure.

MR MILLER: I answer questions of all types. I will say that you should take our words at face value. When we’re say – we’re concerned about something, it’s because we’re concerned. And when we say that we have direct, candid, sometimes quite difficult conversations with the Israeli Government, it’s because we do.

And I will go back to something that I said in – earlier in this briefing. When you look at the totality of our engagement with the Israeli Government over the course of this conflict, there have been a number of times when we went to them and said, “This is an action we need you to take.” And the action – the reaction from them has been, “Oh, it’s something that we can’t do. It will be very difficult.” You’ve seen them come out publicly and reject it. And we work on it behind the scenes, and we deliver results. We’ve done that with respect to pauses; we’ve done that respect to humanitarian assistance. You’ve seen us do that just in the past week with respect to fuel. You’ve seen it – us do it with deconfliction zones in the south, to ensure that there are places where civilians can be that are deconfliction sites, so they are not struck by the Israeli military.

So, we mean very much what we say. We follow up with the Israeli Government. Sometimes things don’t move as quickly as the public would want. They don’t move as quickly as we want. But we engage with them on these tough conversations because we care very much about getting this right. We care about protecting civilians. We care about getting access – them access to the care that they need. And so, we will continue to engage with the Israeli Government at all levels, on all of these issues.

QUESTION: So lastly, if I could just —

MR MILLER: I’m just – that’s a lot.

QUESTION: Okay.

MR MILLER: Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you very much – thank you very much, Matt. I want to dedicate this question to my father, a journalist who started The Frontier Post 40 years ago from Peshawar who passed away two days ago. Both the questions are dedicated to him. Number one question: Is Pakistan and Afghanistan – relations have – are going down. Imran Khan even wrote a special letter about it from jail the other day, where he said that the relationship are going very down and the way Pakistan is kicking out Afghan is very disrespectful. And my father personally played a very positive role in bringing peace during the civil war days in Afghanistan. Just is the U.S. at all concerned about the relationship going bad?

MR MILLER: So, first of all, let me just start by offering my condolences to you. I obviously didn’t know your father, but he sounds like an incredible man, and I’m sure it’s very tough for you and your entire family to lose him. So, my thoughts are certainly with you at this time.

With respect to relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, obviously we support diplomatic resolution to all of the various issues between those two countries. It’s something that we have been engaged on. We’ve detailed the substance of some of those specific engagements over the past few weeks, and we will continue to do so.

QUESTION: Just one more – one more question about him.

MR MILLER: One more.

QUESTION: One more question, just about his journalism. So, the investigative journalism was something introduced in Pakistan by him in the mid ’80s. And one of the stories that he has regularly been writing about – and I know the State Department does not take any position between political parties; you have said that many times to me, especially regarding cipher. But regarding condemnation, the U.S. does not support corrupt and criminal leaders around the world. That’s a clear fact.

In Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, three-time prime minister – The Frontier Post had published stories about him taking money from Usama bin Ladin to disrupt Benazir government. The story was not condemned. Taking state lands – story was not condemned or challenged in any court. Sending money internationally, basically financial money laundering thing – story was never challenged. At least condemn that, okay, the U.S. had no role in Imran Khan removal, but at least say something about that a Panama Paper convict has come back to Pakistan. American – Pakistani Americans are upset at Biden for being silent about it. They feel like you have brought this old corrupt criminal leader back into Pakistan, and are – he’s coming back to – so at least condemn the corrupt politicians.

MR MILLER: So, I will just say with respect to that, especially the last part of your question: The United States does not play any role in choosing the leaders of Pakistan. We engage with the leadership shown by – or the leadership decided by the Pakistani people, and we will continue to engage with the Government of Pakistan on all these issues.

Go ahead, and then we’ll wrap for the day.

QUESTION: Thank you so much; thank you.

MR MILLER: Yeah, go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you, Matt. Two questions about Afghanistan. Taliban is still didn’t bring any change on their claim regarding Afghan women. And President Biden last week, he was concerned about the terrorist activity like Daesh and other terrorists. Any comment about that? And, also recently, there is a report published that former Afghan house speakers under President Ghani’s government has been listed through by the U.S. Treasury. And like him, there is so many people that they are involved in corruption in Afghanistan, as Mr. Afridi raised this issue two, three years ago, and he keep asking me. Is there a – U.S. has a plan to blacklisted other corrupt people in Afghanistan and follow —

MR MILLER: So, we have to – we have taken action to designate former members of the Afghan parliament and their immediate family members, which renders them generally ineligible to enter into the United States. Because of their involvement in significant corruption, The Treasury Department has also designated these individuals under the Magnitsky sanctions program for their extensive role in transnational corruption. Treasury designated a network of 44 companies connected to them for their role.

So, I will say that we will continue to take action to combat corruption both in Afghanistan and around the world. And with respect to the first question you asked, of course we continue to be very concerned about the treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan. We continue to be very concerned about the potential for terrorist activities in Afghanistan. We’ve made clear that we maintain the capability to conduct over the horizon anti-terrorism activities. And of course, we expect the Taliban to prevent Afghanistan from being a haven for terrorism, as it has been in the past.

And with that, we’ll wrap.

QUESTION: Just a final (inaudible) Ukraine?

MR MILLER: With that, we’ll wrap for today. Thanks, everyone."

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – More than 160 local community leaders and Camp Zama personnel came together for U.S. Army Garrison Japan’s holiday reception here Friday evening.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of USAG Japan, and the rest of the command team greeted guests as they arrived inside the Camp Zama Community Club ballroom for the annual event.

“There is nothing better than to be able to meet together face-to-face and to share in one another’s friendships,” he later told the crowd. “And truly, that is one of my deepest hopes is that we can all build friendships and have a wonderful partnership.”

Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members as well as local government and academic officials joined Soldiers, Army civilians and family members for the festive occasion.

The reception, which had a dinner, group photos with Santa Claus and music by the U.S. Army Japan band, highlighted the many connections between the installation and its surrounding community.

Throughout the evening, a photo slideshow and several poster boards in the ballroom displayed various community engagement activities in which USAG Japan personnel participated with their Japanese counterparts.

Those events included office calls, cleanups, local festivals, professional military engagements and open-post events, such as the Bon Odori and Independence Day celebrations that drew tens of thousands of people to Camp Zama.

“These partnerships and these friendships mean so very much and are an important representation of our deep Japan-America alliance, which is even more important now than ever,” Hunter said.

The colonel also encouraged the attendees to reflect on the year and to continue to build on past efforts to make the alliance even stronger.

“I look forward to this new year and all the friendships and the good memories that we will make,” he said, “and I wish you all a Happy New Year in 2024.”

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Nearly 50 U.S. and Japanese high school students participated together in an event here meant to foster communication and promote the exchange of ideas among the two communities.

Known as the Student Educational Exchange and Dialogue, or SEED, the event brought together students from Zama Middle High School those from the neighboring cities of Zama and Sagamihara Dec. 2 and 3 at the ZMHS campus.

Sonya Gates, community superintendent for the DoDEA Pacific East District, said SEED is a cultural exchange meant to enhance the development of the U.S. and Japanese students in a variety of ways.

“I hope [this event allows] the students to have a lot of fun, make some friends they can cherish, and gain a better sense of understanding and appreciation for each other’s cultures and beliefs,” Gates said.

The host students at ZMHS provided their Japanese guests with a tour of their campus. Elsewhere during the two-day event, the students formed teams for games and activities such as collaborating to create a mascot character.

Logan Jackson, a junior at ZMHS and a first-time participant in SEED, said the team-building activities with their Japanese guests taught him a lot about the differences and similarities between their two cultures and led to him forming friendships with them. He recommended students who have never participated to join the event next year.

“It was a great way to interact with the Japanese students and get involved a little bit more in their culture,” Jackson said. “I hope we can have [this] event at a Japanese school sometime.”

Asaki Noda, a second-year high school student from Sagamihara City, had so much fun at the event last year that she jumped at the chance to participate again. This year she said she learned the importance of being proactive with her ideas and input when doing a group project.

“By interacting with others my age, I got to know more about the American students’ way of thinking and learn things I didn’t know before,” Noda said. “I felt like I was able to expand my worldview through my participation in this program.”

Feedback like that from Noda and other students reinforced that the SEED event met its intent, said Natasha Anderson, assistant principal at ZMHS. Most of the students expressed their hope to learn more about Japanese culture, and that their guests would likewise gain a better understanding of the academic and social life of American teens.

“[The students] want to basically show that they can work all together regardless of their nationality, which speaks volumes,” Anderson said. “This is an opportunity for students of different cultures to interact socially and understand [those] differences and similarities while building communication and team-building skills.”"

VICENZA, Italy – Command Sgt. Maj. Jonathan Dyon looked back on his time with U.S. Army Garrison Italy on Dec. 7, following a ceremony where he relinquished responsibility.

Dozens of community members gathered at the event, held in the gym at Caserma Ederle, to bid Dyon farewell. Dyon was among the leaders who helped the community through COVID-19. During an interview with The Garrison Outlook Dyon pondered on how far things have come since the pandemic.

“Coming out of Covid, it was just really great to see all the things that (the pandemic) forced us to do in the virtual space to enhance our services that we provide for this community,” Dyon said.

PANZER-KASERNE, Germany - The 21st Theater Sustainment Command conducted the Unit Safety Officer Course at Panzer Kaserne for the first time this past November 14-16, 2023, allowing 16 Team 21 USOs to meet all regulatory requirements without having to spend time and expense traveling to receive instruction. In the past, the command has had to send students to the 7th Army Training Command in Vilseck to ensure compliance.

In accordance with AR 385-10, the Unit Safety Officer is a spokesperson who cooperates with leaders and supervisors at all levels within the organization to assist the commander in executing the Army Safety and Occupational Health Program.

“Safety is our top priority, and its essential that we reinforce its significance throughout the formation process,” said Stefanie Diaz, command tactical safety manager, 21st TSC. ""The USOC [Unit Safety Officer Course] training plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. As a part of our commitment to safety, we must acknowledge that each one of us, from the highest levels of leadership down to the newest team members, has a role to play.”

The primary objective of the Unit Safety Officer and the Army Safety Program is to effectively accomplish the mission while avoiding losses that negatively impact readiness. USOs advise the commander and participate in the planning, preparation, execution, and after-action reviews of missions. This ensures that hazards are identified, assessed, and controls are placed and addressed by the commander.

“From a Leader’s perspective, it’s imperative that we lead by example,” said Col. Ernest Lane, chief of staff, 21st TSC. “By completing this training and actively promoting its value, we demonstrate our unwavering dedication to safety and the importance of each one of us as a member of Team 21.”

Lane added that safety is not only a leader’s responsibility, but a shared responsibility for all members.

In fiscal year 2023, the 21st TSC Safety Office invested in certifying a member of its team to be able to instruct the USO course locally or travel to remote locations to complete required training for all 21st TSC and subordinate command members to meet regulatory requirements.

With the addition of a safety officer certified to conduct the USOC training, the 21st TSC and all subordinate units can receive the training without the constraints of having to send students to Vilseck in order to meet mission requirements."

SETUBAL, Portugal - The 21st Theater Sustainment Command supported the first-ever U.S. Army operation at the Port of Setubal, Portugal on December 7, 2023. The port operation was a collaboration between the 21st TSC, 598th Transportation Brigade (Surface Deployment and Distribution Command), U.S. Mission to Portugal, and the Portuguese military and port authority.

“The strategic importance behind getting this port in Portugal is, it is the furthest west that we’ve ever operated coming in or out of Europe,” said Col. Robert Kellam, commander, 598th Transportation Brigade. “We were able to effectively connect the furthest point in eastern Estonia to the furthest west port in Portugal and connect all the transportation nodes from here to there. So strategically, this is a momentous occasion for the 21st TSC and I think for EUCOM [United States European Command] as well.”

The mission was a year-long project and a “proof of concept” that enhances the capabilities of the 21st TSC, United States Army Europe and Africa, and Army Sustainment as a whole, across the European Theater.

“We have a long-standing relationship in many areas, the military-to-military relationship being one of the most important,” said Doug Koneff, deputy chief of mission, U.S. Mission to Portugal. “We want to continue working together, as we have been for a long time, to improve our interoperability and improve our capabilities, and this exercise that’s going on right now is such a great example of that.”

The United States and Portugal have a long-standing partnership rooted in shared history. Both countries were a part of the 12 founding signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and have continued to build upon that partnership.

“We have a very strong defense cooperation relationship that spans decades and decades, so exercises like this go very far to really prove what we already knew,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Jennifer Whetstone, Defense Attaché, U.S. Mission to Portugal. “We already know that we have a strong relationship, but we are continually striving to improve our interoperability and strengthen the alliance as a whole.”

The mission validated the port through the redeployment of equipment belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team “Bastogne”, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). Approximately 500 pieces of equipment were craned onto the vessel Ocean Grand to be shipped back to their home station of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

“We initially moved all of our equipment into Poland with the help of the 21st TSC and then eventually on to Estonia, and now we’re standing in Portugal, having moved our equipment from Estonia to Portugal,” said Maj. Christopher Cummings, executive officer, 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). “So, it's a lot of long, difficult, and complex movements and is a fairly historic opportunity for us to test out a new port, similar to what our brigade has done on its first return to Europe since World War II.”

With the success of the initial mission, the intent is to continue to build and strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and Portugal.

“Honestly, it's like we’ve done this many, many times,” said Kellam. “The coordination and relationships that we’ve established here, I think is going to be lasting and it’s been really amazing and very impressive.”

SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Soldiers from 2nd Cavalry Regiment, with support from other U.S. units and the host nation’s military, achieved rapid deployment to the training area and conducted live-fire scenarios with Stryker armored vehicles Dec. 1-10, 2023, at Krivolak Training Area, North Macedonia.

The Army of the Republic of North Macedonia hosted Brave Partner, while U.S. Army Europe and Africa led the “short notice action planning” exercise to reinforce military readiness and interoperability in a realistic training environment and to ensure U.S. forces are ready to respond quickly to support stability in the Balkans.

“The most important thing is the demonstration of the relationship between the United States and North Macedonia,” said Angela Aggeler, U.S. Ambassador to North Macedonia. “Exercises like this one, bringing in beautiful equipment like this — state of the art — really demonstrates to both of our countries, and frankly to the world and our NATO allies, how strong this relationship is, and we are there to support each other.”

The ambassador visited KTA, meeting with the Minister of Defense of the Republic of North Macedonia, Slavjanka Petrovska, and general officers from both nations’ armies to observe Brave Partner live-fire training on Dec. 7.

However, before live-fire training could take place, 2nd Squadron had to successfully complete expeditionary deployment training. Maj. Luke King, the 2nd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment operations officer, explained how important it was to exercise the processes of getting the soldiers and equipment to the mission, and then to set the conditions for day and night squad live-fire.

“Exercising those systems and validating those processes to make sure that we can deliver combat-ready troops to the training area, or to whatever mission we have, that was the first part,” said King. “They’ve gone through squad blank iterations and then squad live-fire iterations both day and night. And the goodness there is that it gives Soldiers confidence in their weapons systems.”

He explained that the exercise gave company and squad leaders the ability to synchronize fire and maneuver with all their available weapons systems. He then explained the Stryker’s advantages, to include weapons systems that can be mounted to the vehicle.

The Stryker has several configurations, including an infantry carrier vehicle with a mounted remotely controlled weapons station capable of mounting a .50 caliber machine gun or a MK19 grenade launcher. They can fire 120 mm mortars from the back of the vehicle instead of setting up mortars from the ground, which King explained is a unique and awesome capability. Soldiers can fire those weapons and search and traverse from inside the vehicle with a screen that provides imagery.

“Then, the Dragoon has the 30 mm cannon, which we all love, and then a 7.62 coax as well, so you’re not just limited to that one weapons system,” said King. “Also, all fired from inside the vehicle, protecting the gunner.”

In addition to weapons used with the Strykers, each squad had a variety of weapons they fired while dismounted from their vehicles, including the M240 machine gun and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. They used their designated marksman to provide precision fire from a distance with the M110 A1 rifle, and they provided indirect fire with the M320 grenade launchers.

King said that 2CR gained in readiness and lethality due to Brave Partner. They’d conducted expeditionary deployments two previous times within the last several months, so they were confident and quick moving into North Macedonia.

""I can’t emphasize enough how awesome of a training area Krivolak is,” said King. “It was just powerful to feel the full might of every headquarters at echelons above us all the way up to USAREUR-AF align the stars for us to get here so quickly. Whatever we asked for, we got. And we got it in a very rapid fashion, and it’s exactly what we wanted. So, it built a lot of our confidence.”

Sgt. Joshua Briggs, a 2CR infantryman and squad leader, adamantly agreed with King’s praise of KTA and the diverse terrain.

“The terrain out here is very difficult to traverse,” said Briggs. “It’s hilly and rocky. It allows for more intense and realistic training, like where these soldiers might operate in the future.”

Briggs said wet and muddy conditions give Soldiers a chance to train while it’s more difficult to keep steady footing, or to avoid the weapons’ exposure to the elements. The training value is higher because they can still effectively prepare and solve objectives in such conditions, simulating actual combat.

Another 2CR soldier, Pfc. Alexander Dudzenski, said Brave Partner was his first live-fire exercise. He enjoyed training despite the harsh environment and weather, learning something new with every range iteration and seeing the host nation soldiers build a working relationship with U.S. Soldiers.

“I never thought in my life that I’d be able to come and see these countries,” said Dudzenski. “I think it’s cooler to do it somewhere I’ve never been before, and seeing people from different militaries watching us, I find fascinating.”

Briggs agreed, saying it’s always a privilege to work with NATO partners, especially when it’s the first time for him in a country, where his squad can share new ideas to refine and improve their craft.

“Host nation soldiers have been extremely polite and helpful,” Briggs said. “They’ll ask us questions. It allows us to explain our profession as well as our craft and take pride in our work and see how other people see it.”

King agreed that 2CR learned much from working with the host nation.

“The Army of the Republic of North Macedonia has been very accommodating,” said King. “Understanding how they conduct training and telling them how we conduct our own training in preparation for their army to receive their Strykers has been very useful because we also learn from them. Some of the questions they ask force us to be a bit more introspective. We’re not only helping them, but we’re helping ourselves too.”"

GRAFENWOEHR, Germany – U.S. soldiers and NATO partners participated in the European Best Medic Competition (EBMC) here Dec. 4 to 8, 2023.

The European Best Medic Competition tests competencies, skills, and readiness of European theater medics so they can respond more effectively and efficiently, and the highest winners of U.S. forces are selected to represent the European region at the Army Best Medic Competition in Fort Liberty, North Carolina.

EBMC featured multiple exercises such as: Tactical Combat Casualty Care, Polish Marksmanship Badge, night land navigation, 18-mile Norwegian Ruck March and stress shoot. Each exercise simulated a combat environment, both physically and mentally preparing competitors to react and perform in stressful surroundings.

EBMC exercises consisted of not only medical tasks but also basic soldier capabilities, like returning fire, securing casualties and providing tactical field care. A mystery event is practiced annually to keep competitors on their toes. This year the mystery event was a K9 casualty dog event, where competitors had to provide tactical field care to a TacMed Simulation Canine Medical Trainer within a time limit.

“The candidates did an 18-mile ruck march that led into a stress shoot, wearing them down and seeing if they were still able to complete their range qualification,” said U.S. Army Sgt. Jacob Rodriguez, assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade. “They’re cold, they're tired, and they're hungry then immediately come over here and then do a range qualification. It's just more of a mental game at that point, keeping them pushing forward.”

Competitors worked individually and as teams to test their capabilities and readiness to complete tasks.

EBMC allowed the competitors to learn and train on different skill sets that will significantly improve them on individual and team-based tasks, crucial qualities for military medics working in dynamic and high-pressure situations.

“The challenge does not stop here, today or even with the Army Best Medic Competition. As you return to your home station and back to your soldiers and train them to sustain lethality during Large Scale Combat Operation,” said Sgt. Maj. Christinean Johnson with the Army Medical Center of Excellence. “Think about what you endured, the challenges you faced and the mental toughness that it took to execute your tasks in that environment. Build the training and sustainment that produces the best medic for the team.”

U.S. soldiers were participating in the competition alongside NATO partners, promoting interoperability and readiness that is crucial for multinational military operations. Recognizing and learning the differences in medical practices among different nations' combat medics can enhance the overall capabilities of the combined forces.

“With the other NATO forces, they bring a different expertise because we have people that are like combat medics with 10 years of experience and a surgeon, he gave a different insight and input to the medics,” said Spc. George Rivera, assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division. “I think it's really good, and it brings the morale up, communicating with the other soldiers.”

The EBMC prepared army medics and served as a crucible for promoting collaboration, interoperability, and continuous improvement within the military medical community, highlighting the importance of readiness and having highly capable medical personnel to support the world's most potent and lethal army.

“The world's most powerful and lethal army must have the world's best medical instrument of power supporting them and that medical instrument of power is army medicine,” said Brig. Gen. Roger Giraud, assigned to the Medical Readiness Command, Europe."

ARLINGTON, Va. - The 2023 National Guard Bureau Innovation Challenge showcased the inventive prowess of Guard members nationwide Dec. 7 at the Herbert R. Temple Jr. Army National Guard Readiness Center. Among the concepts featured: a virtual reality application by the Arkansas National Guard, a South Carolina Army National Guard initiative for robotic automation of personnel data, and a Michigan National Guard medical system revolutionizing casualty care in austere environments.

“This is an opportunity for you to show us how we can become a better organization,” said Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, who hosted the event. “As I looked through the topics that each of you are presenting today, many of them are unique to the Guard but can also have applicability to the entire Joint Force.”

Ultimately, the Arizona Army National Guard clinched top honors at the competition with its pioneering idea — an exportable live-fire range.

“We’re pleasantly surprised and very honored,” said Army Lt. Col. Loong Lee, the state training officer for the Arizona National Guard’s Joint Force Headquarters.

The team bested the three other finalists — all with solutions that support one of Hokanson’s key priorities: modernization, which the 2022 National Defense Strategy stresses as crucial in building “enduring advantages across the defense ecosystem” and sharpening “the Joint Force’s technological edge.”

The competitors submitted their proposals at the state level, followed by elimination rounds conducted in four regions and then semifinal rounds. The finalists created visual products showcasing their ideas, followed by a presentation to Hokanson and three other senior leader judges.

The competitors were chosen based on their ability to identify a challenge, develop a unique solution and explain the overarching benefit, said Keith E. Buchholz, the NGB’s programs and resources comptroller, who coordinated and organized this year’s challenge.

“By virtue of the fact you are here today as finalists, you have already shown your initiative to seek answers to the questions of how we will do things better, faster, cheaper in the Guard,” Buchholz said.

For Lee, the training officer for the Arizona Guard, this meant identifying challenges in meeting live-fire and training requirements while complying with environmental and safety regulations.

That kind of training at major installations hundreds of miles away from a home station, he said, also “results in loss of time, increased costs, and potential unresolvable conflicts for resources against other units.”

“A solution to these problems is increased utilization of short-range training ammunition as well as a combination of battery-powered simulation devices and training scenarios” that follow Army guidance, said Lee in his team’s presentation.

This provided the means to produce what amounted to a mobile range.

“Through these tools, we can create an exportable maneuver live-fire range that can be safely established in existing training areas that are traditionally too restrictive for standard ammunition,” Lee said.

While minimal transportation can cut costs, the “time savings” could propel units forward, said John Ralph, an Army budget analyst for the Arizona Army Guard’s operations and training directorate.

“In a Guard environment, where you typically get one weekend a month and two weeks to train, every minute is precious,” he said. “And we can give back that time to those commanders to let them get after [the mission].”

Many Guard members who hold relevant civilian jobs helped bring the team's proposal to fruition, said Sgt. 1st Class John McCrory, a transportation management coordinator with an Arizona Guard training center.

“With one of my technicians, if he was just brought up as a Soldier in the active-duty Army, I don’t think he would have the civilian experience with electronics” needed to “adapt to whatever situation we were in,” said McCrory, who also headed the team’s “proof of concept” efforts for the proposal.

Ralph said Soldiers and Airmen should always consider themselves part of the innovation ecosystem and always push ideas — however big or small they may be.

“Don’t be afraid to say something if you see something that needs to be done better because we can always do anything better,” he said.

The National Guard Bureau will further explore each team’s presentation to determine the feasibility of advancing ideas from concept to reality, according to senior leaders. The factors they will consider include funding, scope and impact on the Guard force.

Hokanson closed out the event by emphasizing innovation is imperative and that more competition is on the horizon.

“The four teams that got here did remarkable work, and we were fascinated by the level of innovation going on in our organization,” he said. “And that just inspires us just to continue to do this.”

The NGB plans to conduct innovation competitions biannually through December 2025. Guard members are encouraged to work with their designated innovation lead specialist, typically positioned at a state’s headquarters element, to advance their ideas.

WIESBADEN, Germany – More than 100 students from DoDEA high schools across Europe gathered in Wiesbaden for the annual STEMposium event where they were grouped into teams to develop projects and solutions to real-world scenarios based on climate change and impacts to population centers.

“Students representing our 21 DoDEA Europe high schools are presented with a different real-world scenario in which they are required to formulate actionable solutions in order to be successful,” said DoDEA Europe Student Activities Coordinator Rob Smith about the event. “Our students are getting hands-on, real-world experience dealing with cutting edge tools, technologies, and techniques that can lead to success later in life.”

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District was one of a handful of organizations that supported the STEMposium, participating in career fair and providing mentoring and answered questions of students as they worked on their projects.

In a first for the annual STEMposium, this year’s event incorporated a STEM-focused career fair where representatives from different organizations, including Europe District and several others.

“It was great talking to the students during the career fair,” said Europe District Engineering Branch Chief Nathan Fox. “They were all very engaging and curious about the range of jobs available for engineers and in other STEM fields.”

As part of the event, the students were broken into teams and assigned different areas of expertise including biotechnology, civil engineering, data engineering, environmental engineering, robotics and using CAD programs for 3D printing.

“STEMinar” sessions were scheduled for each of these areas where students worked through their projects with real-world subject matter experts that could answer questions and mentor the students.

“I worked with the students focused on environmental engineering tasks in their groups; they were a bright group of young people who asked a lot of good questions,” said Europe District Environmental Branch Northern Section Chief Patricia Jackson. “They were tasked with providing clean drinking water following a disaster scenario, so we talked about water filtration methods, specifically those that would be climate-neutral. Some solutions we covered were lagoons with plants for filtration, as these filtering plants also absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. We also covered ways to minimize pump power usage, such as through gravity filtration when possible.”

Smith noted that the annual event was again a success and that it is part of DoDEA Europe’s dedication to providing unique and impactful opportunities for the children of DoD personnel stationed overseas.

“This event represents DoDEA's unwavering commitment to providing educational experiences that are not just on par, but often exceed what's available stateside,” Smith said. “It's an immersive journey into the world of STEM, where students engage in hands-on activities, gaining a deeper understanding of science and its real-world applications. More than just an academic exercise, STEMposium is a launchpad for future careers in STEM, nurturing essential skills like critical thinking and teamwork.”"

KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany – Adrienne Miller lives a pretty normal life. She has a home she shares with her husband of 37 years in a small town not far from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, and the Logistics Data Analysis Center where she works. And she has a 33-year-old son who is a school principal and lives close by. Everything is pretty normal for her. Except one. She’s currently deployed to Europe.

Miller is an Army Expeditionary Civilian Workforce deployer assigned to Army Field Support Battalion-Mannheim. The battalion is in the process of redesignating to Army Field Support Battalion-Poland and taking command of the new Long Term Equipment Storage and Maintenance-Complex in Powidz, Poland, and Miller is the battalion’s human resource specialist and acting adjutant.

And if that wasn’t enough, during her 11-month tour as an AECW deployer that ends in February, Miller also worked at the 405th Army Field Support Brigade headquarters in the Installation Logistics Directorate helping to establish and standup the newly activated Logistics Readiness Center Poland.

“I arrived at the 405th AFSB in March, working the ‘Pivot to Poland’ project and assisting LRC Poland Director Chanteen Violette and the ILD director with standing up LRC Poland,” said Miller. “The ILD team was wonderful – very welcoming and willing to share their experiences, and it was a great opportunity to work with Chanteen on staffing before the LRC officially activated.”

And now Miller is doing something similar with AFSBn-Mannheim as it assumes its new mission and redesignates to AFSBn-Poland.

“The AECW program has given me so many opportunities to grow and develop personally and professionally,” said Miller, who has been working in the human resources field with the Army for over 11 years as a civilian, plus 4.5 years more as a personnel specialist and active duty Soldier.

“I think the AECW program gives people the opportunity to add so many different things to their tool bags, whatever their chosen field might be,” said Miller, who has seen AECW personnel be assigned to her battalion as supply specialists, quality assurance specialists, HR specialists and more.

In her specific field, Miller said there are many HR requirements overseas that aren’t part of her duties stateside – things like overseas extensions, relocation incentives and the overseas recruitment process.

“A lot of this stuff is new to me,” said Miller, who also worked as a logistics management specialist for eight years. “To have this opportunity and to be a part of a new battalion moving into a new region is really exciting.”

Miller, who has a master’s degree from Texas A&M in science and business administration, became an Army civilian employee in 2004 as part of Army Materiel Command’s Fellows Program. She’s done a lot in her nearly 20 years of civilian service and learned much. She said people should treat AECW as an opportunity.

“I think some people might be afraid to volunteer for AECW, but it's a wonderful opportunity and the AECW staff are really there to support you,” Miller said. “Any question you have – no matter how major or minor – they want to help. They want to make sure that not only are you a benefit to the organization you're supporting, but also you're receiving something in return.”

The AECW program has deployment opportunities in a temporary duty status for six, nine, or 11 months available for Army civilians worldwide, to include many with the 405th AFSB in Europe. The program offers overseas assignments at a variety of locations with no change to an employee's permanent grade or position of record. The grade level listed for an AECW position is suggested, and employees can be plus or minus one grade interval from what is listed.

Army civilians who are interested in applying for the AECW program may submit a resume, recent SF-50, DD214 (if former military) and a signed request for deployment form found here. They should submit these documents through their supervisory chain and human resources department. For more information, contact the AECW program office by email.

The 405th AFSB is assigned to U.S. Army Sustainment Command and under the operational control of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The brigade is headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany, and provides materiel enterprise support to U.S. Forces throughout Europe and Africa – providing theater sustainment logistics; synchronizing acquisition, logistics and technology; and leveraging AMC’s materiel enterprise to support joint forces.

ILLESHEIM, Germany (December 7, 2023) – In late October, U.S. Army Garrison (USAG) Ansbach welcomed the 601st Aviation Support Battalion, 1st Infantry Division Combat Aviation Brigade (601st ASB) for their nine-month rotation from Fort Riley, Kansas at Storck Barracks.

Members of the “Hellions” Battalion and the ""Demon"" Brigade arrived in Illesheim, ready to assume their duties as the newest rotational unit at the kaserne in Middle Franconia. Just prior to the Transfer of Authority from the 603rd Aviation Support Battalion, the troops assembled at the Bunch Fitness Center for multiple in-processing briefings and gained valuable guidance for their deployment in Germany.

“The welcome brief for the new Regionally Aligned Forces (RAF) stationed at Storck Barracks builds a mutual trust and understanding for all Soldiers to understand how each garrison agency supports the individual Soldier, NCO, Officer and Battalion during their deployment,” said Marcell Wright, Storck Site Operations Lead. “This also allows the Soldier to build relationships with garrison agencies and partners while also building confidence knowing that they will be supported while performing their assigned tasks.”

During the in-processing briefs, more than 20 garrison facilities and support organizations introduced their services and briefed the audience on how they will support the troops during their stay in Germany.

“The RAF welcome briefs presented to our Soldiers was a great introduction to the USAG Ansbach area,” stated Lt. Col. Andrew Eggers, commander of the 601st ASB.

The 601st ASB Soldiers also had the opportunity to address more specific questions or needs directly to the subject matter experts after the briefing at the individual welcome tables. Among the garrison attendees were representatives from the garrison's Anti-Terrorism and Operations Security teams, the Army Substance Abuse Program, Army Community Service, the Education Center, the Directorate of Public Works and other garrison support organizations like the USO and Department of Defense Community Bank.

During this brief the Military Personnel Division (MPD) also discussed important tips and tricks for the abundant travel opportunities throughout Europe, including an important reminder regarding crossing borders.

“Remember, a valid tourist passport is required for all leisure travel outside of Germany,” the chief of MPD, Gary Beatty, enthusiastically informed the Soldiers. Beatty also pointed out that “orders and CAC Cards only allow the Soldiers to be in Germany, but it is not sufficient to explain to Border Control or Police their presence in another country.”

While the Ansbach-based team had previous opportunities to welcome the “Big Red One” to Storck Barracks during their rotations in the past, these briefings are crucial for each new RAF unit rotation. As available services may change or expand over time. the individual needs of the Soldiers are also constantly evolving and changing.

“The event equipped our Soldiers with the tools and resources necessary to reduce many of the stressors that come with a deployment and allow us to continue building a strong relationship between the Rotational Aviation Forces and the wonderful community around us,” added Lt. Col. Eggers.

For Angelita Dizon, informing members of the United States Army Garrison-Italy community about voting overseas isn't just a job—it's a passion.

The 64-year-old—now the Assistant Manager of the Central Processing Facility (CPF) on Caserma Ederle—grew up in Cavite, Philippines, where citizens had limited constitutional rights. She felt intense pride when she voted for the first time in the U.S. presidential election in 1980.

""I've seen people jailed for wanting to raise their voice,"" Dizon recalled from her country of origin. ""I am so grateful for this nation.""

Amongst her many job duties, Dizon assists active-duty service members and civilians in performing their civic duty of voting while stationed abroad. The CPF offers a class every Thursday to brief community newcomers on each step, from registering with their state of residence to casting their vote.

""You can vote anywhere in the world as long as you have access to the internet,"" said Analisa Wilder, The SETAF Programs and Policy Specialist and Voting Assistance Officer. Wilder stresses the importance of beginning the overseas voting process as early as possible, given that it can take up to 45 days before ballots abroad are received and processed.

""It's not something that comes around very often, so if we can get the word out for those outside of their home state areas, I think that's super important,"" stated Callie Carmichael, an Ederle-based Mechanical Engineer registering to vote in South Carolina.

For service members and civilians alike, voting begins with registering and updating information at www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter. Once registered, ballots can be sent securely by mail or email.

JOINT MULTINATIONAL READINESS CENTER, Germany – A military police Soldier with 527th Military Police Co. at U.S. Army Garrison Bavaria - Hohenfels, traveled Nov. 12 to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, to participate in the gaming finals of the USO + NFL Salute to Service Showdown.

Salute to Service is the NFL’s year-round effort to honor, empower and connect with the U.S.’s service members, veterans and families.

It is the first year NFL allowed the Department of Defense outside the continental U.S. to participate, and Spc. Trevor Bethke’s gaming skills earned him the trip stateside.

Every November the USO and the NFL celebrate military service, and each year service members get the chance to participate in the video game tournament through the USO to get the chance to win two tickets and paid travel to the Super Bowl.

Out of 275 service members across the world, Bethke was one of eight finalists to travel to the Cowboy’s football stadium for the finals. This was the first time Bethke competed in this event.

“I did have to practice a lot,” he said. “I was constantly playing some of the best players in the world after work – also playing my battle buddies.”

Bethke is the first service member to represent OCONUS in the USO + NFL Salute to Service Madden Tournament. Before, participants had to be in the U.S. This year, USO flew Bethke from Hohenfels, Germany, to the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington where he played EA Sports™ Madden NFL 23, an American football video game, in a tournament in front of thousands of people.

While Bethke did not take home the tournament prize, he was the winning champion for Europe, the Middle East and Africa across all service branches.

“Events like this help Soldiers because it gives them something to look forward to,” said Bethke. “Working overseas for three years is hard on Soldiers’ lives, and for the USO to give this opportunity to Soldiers is amazing.”

Bethke had been stationed in Germany for almost three years and had not seen his parents in over two years. For the event, they drove all the way from South Sioux City, Nebraska, to watch him compete. The USO also connected him with his brother, who is currently deployed to Kuwait.

“Being able to go home and seeing my family after two years of not seeing them was amazing,” said Bethke. “It felt amazing to see my family. They look great, and it takes a weight off my shoulders to see them doing good.”"

BAUMHOLDER, Germany – The Baumholder Military community hosted its annual Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony at the Rheinlander Community Center on Dec. 6 to usher in the holiday spirit.

Over 400 guests congregated at the celebration, enjoying music, Kinderpunch, hotdogs, and engaging conversations.

Bundled up in fur-lined coats, gloves, and scarves, both German and American visitors, including Baumholder District Mayor Bernd Alsfasser, listened attentively to Col. Reid Furman, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz.

""I cannot imagine a better way to begin the holiday season than coming together with friends and families to uphold this tradition,"" remarked Furman.

The event commenced with the traditional invocation given by Chaplain Lt. Col. Todd Cheney.

Following Furman's speech, Mayor Alsfasser expressed his belief that perhaps the most profound wish of all is for ‘peace’.

""If there was one especially positive thing about this year, it was realizing that together, we can endure these times. That's why my Christmas wish is for us—Germans and Americans—to carry this resilience into the new year. Let's strengthen everything that unites us,"" he emphasized.

Subsequently, Brig. Gen. Karen Monday-Gresham, Deputy Commanding General of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command, conveyed holiday greetings on behalf of the 21st TSC.

The 1st graders of Baumholder Smith Elementary School delivered a magnificent singing performance, including three Christmas songs performed in both German and English.

The Master of Ceremonies then invited the choir and the audience to welcome Santa Claus. Amidst the ""Here Comes Santa"" tune, the siren of a fire truck sounded, captivating the audience, especially the children, who recognized the blue lights of the big red fire engine with Santa Claus seated in the truck.

After making their way through the crowd, Santa Claus and Furman, accompanied by three students from Smith Elementary School, led the countdown and flipped the electrical switch. The grand Christmas tree, adorned with lights and a star, shimmered in all its splendor!0

The USO provided hot dogs and beverages outside the Rheinlander Center, while inside, children had the chance to engage in Christmas crafts and take photos with Santa Claus.

As Santa departed, his voice echoed, saying, “A Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”

U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz serves, supports, and secures the total force community enabling power projection for the European Theater."

FRANKFORT, Ky. — There are many leadership schools that service members can attend but few are more challenging than the U.S. Army Ranger School. There, perfection is the standard, and nothing less is accepted.

This criterion was set upon Kentucky Army National Guard 2nd Lt. Dustin McKie-Miller when he decided to go to Ranger School. He aced every challenge on his first attempt and finished the course in 62 days, the shortest time possible for training, crediting both luck and skill.

A Ranger is a part of the Army’s premier infantry force. They specialize in conducting raids and infiltration missions deep inside enemy territory. To become a Ranger is no easy task. One must undergo grueling training to ensure they have the mental toughness, physical fitness, moral character and motivation to endure the challenges they may face in combat.

“At graduation, we’re told that only somewhere between 10 and 20% of Ranger students complete the course straight through,” he said. “The vast majority of those who complete the training have recycled at least one phase at some point.”

McKie-Miller decided to go to the training after several of the friends he had made from across the Army commissioned and began their military careers as infantry officers.

“I got to watch them go through the Infantry Basic Officer Leader Course, then to Ranger School, get their tab, and then see everything that they brought to their organization because of the Ranger program,” said McKie-Miller. “I had the idea in my mind of, ‘OK, well that's what the standard looks like.’”

McKie-Miller's goals fell into place. All he needed was a clear path to seize an opportunity.

“For National Guard Soldiers, there is an additional requirement of completing the two-week long, Ranger Training Assessment Course run by the Warrior Training Center at Fort Moore prior to attending Ranger School,” he said. “I was fortunate that the Guard had a slot available for me to attend RTAC immediately following IBOLC graduation.”

For McKie-Miller, the biggest challenge he faced with Ranger School was the mental hurdle of starting the course.

“I think my greatest challenge was just overcoming the reputation of Ranger School beforehand, of all the horror stories I heard about how I’m not going to eat, I’m not going to sleep, and I truly don’t know when it will end,” said McKie-Miller. “I imagined that it would be a 62-day field training exercise — or, at least hopefully only 62 days — across impossible terrain, and I’d just be broken down to the core throughout it. And, although in the end there is some truth to those stories, the hardest part for me was simply getting out of the car on Day Zero.”

After that, he said, “My mindset shifted to, ’I'm here now, and I'm going to give everything I have for as long as it takes. And so is everyone alongside me.’”

McKie-Miller said Ranger School isn’t looking for perfect genetic specimens, just that you do things correctly.

“What the Ranger instructors expect are 49 perfect pushups, 59 perfect sit-ups, not a second over 40 minutes on the run, and to cap it off, six perfect chin-ups,"" he said. ""They're not looking for someone to go out and do 100 pushups, they just want 49 to standard. When the Ranger instructor counts your 49th, 59th and 6th they tell you to stand up and move to the next station because you've met the standard. But they demand that to perfection.”

McKie-Miller enlisted in the Kentucky Guard in 2018 as a motor transport operator while he was still a student at the University of Kentucky and was assigned to the 2123rd Transportation Company, 75th Troop Command. After a year with the 2123rd, he was encouraged to attend Officer Candidate School in Greenville, earning his commission in 2020. He is now a platoon leader with Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 149th Infantry Regiment out of Middlesboro.

He lives in Clarksville, Tennessee, where he works as a software architect with General Electric Aerospace.

His advice for Soldiers eyeing Ranger School: “It is a difficult course, it does challenge you, and at times it does push you to your limit,"" he said. “But at the end of the day, it's very much achievable.”

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White delighted UFC fans in uniform during a meet and greet event Nov. 30 at the Fort Cavazos Main Exchange here.

White was in the Central Texas area for the UFC Lightweight bout Dec. 2 at Moody Center in Austin, Texas, and stopped by Fort Cavazos to visit with Soldiers before he made his way south.

The crew from Fort Cavazos’ Great Big Podcast sat down with White to talk about his steadfast dedication to the armed forces and his philosophy on life and success.

White began with a declaration of his support for the military that would echo throughout the remainder of the podcast.

“I’m a huge military and law enforcement guy so anytime that I can ever do anything, no matter what it is, I’m all in,” he expressed. “The level of respect that I have for military personnel, it’s unexplainable. I’ll probably say it 30 times during this podcast, I love the military. I have so much respect for people who defend this country.”

When asked how it felt to be at Fort Cavazos, White replied, “To meet the people who actually are here, doing it and willing to defend our country, there’s no place that I would rather be than here today meeting them and shaking their hands.

“These are the people that are the real heroes and the real superheroes,” he continued. “When you are willing to dedicate a massive portion of your life, and sometimes your entire life, to protecting others and protecting your country, it’s one of the things that I respect the most in a human being.”

White recounted the early days of trying to establish the UFC and the mantra that inspired him then and still pushes him to achieve great things today.

“People thought it was crazy, what I wanted to do. The idea of going head-to-head with boxing. Boxing was massive and was sort of cemented in over a hundred years of history in the United States, and when you say that you want to start what I wanted to start and do what I wanted to do, it seemed impossible and could never be done. Nothing is impossible and everything can be done,” he declared.

“People out there who have an idea and it seems too big and it seems too crazy and other people think you’re nuts, none of that’s true,” he continued. “Anything is possible and anything can be done.”

White talked about his work with the Fisher House and his immense respect for the organization and its efforts to support the military.

“We’re huge supporters and I don’t know if anybody’s done more than the Fisher family for the military,” he said.

Before wrapping up the podcast, White reiterated his support for service members.

“I would literally do anything,” he asserted. “I met a couple of guys here today and I gave them my cell phone number already, I’ve been here 10 minutes … you know if you ever need anything from me or the UFC, whether it’s fundraising, people showing up to bases or any type of support that we could possibly give, I’m your guy, I’m all in.”

Spc. David Briseno, 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment, was one of a group of Soldiers who met White and took photos with him before the meet and greet.

Briseno recounted memories of watching UFC bouts on television with his father and seeing White ringside. He said he never imagined meeting him and described the encounter as, “truly a once in a lifetime experience for me.”

“These big people in Hollywood, they care about guys and girls like us,” he said. “That truly makes us feel special and makes us really want to keep working and doing our best to protect this country.”

Spc. Falecia Long, 1st Bn., 9th Cav. Regt., agreed.

“It makes you feel special,” she expressed. “I think it’s cool that he supports everything that we do. There’s a lot of people that support the military, but it was nice to have someone that’s super big to be like, ‘You guys are doing great stuff.’ It made me feel important.”

Dressed in a black t-shirt with green letters that read “ARMY,” White’s appreciation of the armed forces and his humble and friendly demeanor were on full display as he posed for photos and laughed and talked with Fort Cavazos leadership, Soldiers, Main Exchange staff and VIP guests before greeting throngs of fans awaiting his entrance.

“I was just outside and there’s a line probably a hundred yards long of Soldiers in uniform, out of uniform, waiting patiently to come see him,” said Col. Kevin Brown, command engineer, Army and Air Force Exchange Service.

Brown explained that White’s visit embodied AAFES’ long-standing slogan.

“AAFES, we go where you go, and this is one time he came where we are,” he said. “For Mr. White to come here and meet our Soldiers and family members in our main store, is awesome.”

Brown added that the event was a great way to usher in the holidays for Soldiers and their families.

“This is a really good morale boost for the beginning of the holiday season,” he conveyed. “They have something here to kind of break up the monotony, to give them something to look forward to and have fun.”"

WASHINGTON — The Army is reviewing the records of all officers who were commissioned through the active-duty option of the Green to Gold Program for possible time-in-service miscalculations.

The records review follows a U.S. Army Cadet Command Inspector General notice in September stating some Soldiers may not have known the period they spent as cadets did not count toward their time in service for retirement.

""It's my business to take care of Soldiers, and I don't want to rush to the wrong conclusion,” said Brig. Gen. Hope C. Rampy, director, Military Personnel Management Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff. ""I want to go through a deliberate process and confirm what's in their file. I want to come up with options that best takes care of that Soldier and their families.""

Federal law, Title 10 section 2106, prohibits the Army from counting a Soldier’s time in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps toward time in service.

The Army is currently going through each officer’s record to verify if any miscalculation took place. The time to complete the review is to be determined.

During this process, the Army will see if there is anything in a Soldier’s record that shows if they were aware the time in the Senior ROTC program did not count toward retirement.

Current cadets signed a notification this fall letting them know that time in the Green to Gold Active-Duty Option program does not count toward their years in service IAW law.

""It's not about trying to find fault with the Soldier, it's about trying to find an opportunity if we have the chance to correct their record with little or minimal impact,” Rampy said. “We have to have proof.”

Once the review is complete, the Army will identify solutions for each group of affected Soldiers.

For retired/separated service members, Rampy says the Army is looking at options with the least amount of impact including “no potentially remedial action.”

Solutions for active-duty Soldiers will depend on the scope of the problem, Rampy said. The Army Board of Corrections for Military Records can provide individual relief or class relief depending on the findings of the review process.

The Army will reach out to Soldiers as soon as their record review is complete and notify them before any changes are made.

“It doesn’t matter if it was just one individual [affected by a potential miscalculation], the Army is profoundly committed to taking care of Soldiers,” Rampy said. “Some people have dedicated their entire adult life to this business, and it's personal. And I think it's extremely important that they know we, the Army, are committed to taking care of them and their family.”

28,"YEAR IN REVIEW: Army makes a difference at home, worldwide",https://www.army.mil/article/272233/year_in_review_army_makes_a_difference_at_home_worldwide,"WASHINGTON ­­— In 2023, the Army expanded the scale of training both domestically and abroad. The service continued to support humanitarian missions, both within the U.S. and overseas, while maintaining partnerships through agreements like the National Guard State Partnership Program.

The exercises strengthened the Army’s ability to fight alongside allies and partner nations across the globe, as the service looks to increase interoperability among partner nations while building the Army of 2030.

The Best Squad Competition, which finished in October, challenged Soldiers to be all they could be focusing on teamwork and pushing each other to their limits.

Stateside Exercises

BEST SQUAD COMPETITION: This year the service provided more incentives to Soldiers competing for the title of U.S. Army Best Squad. Participants had the opportunity to earn special skills badges for different military occupational specialties. Soldiers could earn the Expert Soldier Badge, the Expert Infantry Badge or the Expert Medical Field Badge.

The 75th Ranger Regiment team from U.S. Army Special Operations Command won first place during the competition followed by a squad from Army Medical Command in second place. Soldiers tested their mettle on 20,000 acres of land at Fort Stewart, Georgia. Soldiers competed in ruck marches and land navigation exercises there, while operating on limited amounts of sleep.

NORTHERN STRIKE: The Army Reserve’s large-scale, deployment exercise added a new element this year: in-theater medical training. Participants simulated a medical evacuation flight during the Midwest-based training exercise from a site in Michigan to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, for additional treatment.

The Michigan National Guard has hosted the exercise since 2012 and expanded Northern Strike into a joint, multinational program based at the National All-Domain Warfighting Center at Camp Grayling, Michigan. More than 7,000 participants from across the U.S. and four nations took part in the annual exercise, where participants simulated joint integrated fires, command and control, and sustainment.

The training, which takes place across Michigan’s lower peninsula, including the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center in Alpena County, the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, and Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport in Iosco County.

Disaster Response

The National Guard deployed 134 troops to support the relief and response efforts following the devastating wind-driven wildfires in Hawaii in August. The Guard provided two CH-47 Chinook helicopters to aid search and recovery efforts, primarily over the island of Maui. National Guard Soldiers supported Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and local law enforcement as liaisons.

In a single day, Guard members dropped about 10,000 gallons of water during a five-hour period. Cartographers and geographers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers used geographic information systems to provide relevant data to help government organizations develop and execute relief plans.

In August and September, about 5,000 members of the Florida National Guard and others activated to assist with disaster response efforts during Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall on Florida’s west coast.

Making a Difference Worldwide

NATIONAL GUARD STATE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM: In 2023, the international program that aligns guard units with foreign partners celebrated three decades of cooperation and providing aid. The Army celebrated the program’s 30th anniversary in July at the National Harbor in Fort Washington, Maryland.

An already established partnership between U.S. forces and Ukraine helped aid the eventual Ukrainian war effort against Russia. Ukraine has held a partnership with the California National Guard since 1993, with Guard members training Ukrainian forces in capabilities such as firing FIM-92 Stingers, a mobile defense platform, and the FGM-148 Javelin, a portable shoulder-launched anti-tank system.

U.S. forces have also influenced Ukrainians on the battlefield, adopting a tactical model inspired by the Army’s non-commissioned officer corps.

U.S. European Command sought to establish a contact team in the Baltic region. The partnership program started with seven former Soviet nations and now includes more than 88 partnerships with more than 100 partner nations across all corners of the world

The program encourages personal ties at the state level among partner nations. Not only does the program support defense security, but also societal relationships that span into other areas of government and economy.

EXERCISE JUSTIFIED ACCORD: The Kenya-based multi-national exercise helped U.S. forces provide humanitarian assistance, engage in peacekeeping missions and crisis response.

Led by U.S. Army Task Force Africa, more than 20 countries participated in Justified Accord, the largest exercise in East Africa. Last February, Soldiers learned to perform humanitarian missions and took part in a multinational, live-fire training event. Planners also incorporated cyber-related simulations for the first time.

OPERATION TALISMAN SABRE: During this multinational, large scale exercise, U.S. and Australian forces sought to build a more persistent, secure network among the “Five Eyes” alliance of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

The new network will be synchronized across the partner nations’ systems and save setup times by having network availability already in place. The network will help raise readiness levels and bring the service closer to the Army of 2030.

The development of the new network showcased one of the methods by which the Army and host Australia improved its network capabilities and interoperability among nations during Talisman Sabre. During the annual exercise, Hawaii and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, U.S. forces learned to operate in enemy and austere environments with challenging constraints and longer distances in the Indo Pacific.

The series of experiments, in accordance with the Army’s Data Strategy, allowed the U.S. and its allies to continually test network capabilities in a dozen different exercises.

JOINT EMERGENCY EXERCISE 23: Members of Special Forces and other experts from across the force trained Army physicians and medical personnel in realistic combat casualty care scenarios during Joint Emergency Exercise. During the exercises, Soldiers learned to integrate medical care into combat operations during simulated scenarios.

Hosted by the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, at Fort Cavazos, Texas, the exercise helped increase combat readiness and joint interoperability for more than 2,000 participants from the Army, Air Force, National Guard and Army Reserve. Service members representing 60 combat career specialties took part in the exercises.

U.S. ARMY EUROPE AND AFRICA EXERCISES: U.S. Army Europe and Africa command provides combat-ready, land forces ready to defend the region.

EXERCISE SABER JUNCTION: During this annual exercise in September, the Army, NATO and allied forces gathered in Germany to learn to operate as one.

Exercises centered around the Joint Multinational Readiness Center near Hohenfels, Germany, where 4,000 participants from 16 countries widened the scale of operations and learned to overcome linguistics, logistics and communications challenges. Soldiers also simulated using different weapons and systems and the treatment and evacuation of injured troops.

U.S. Soldiers and their NATO counterparts spent time learning how each other operates on the battlefield and the nuances in their strategies.

USAREUR-AF, comprised of about 41,000 troops on two continents, takes part in 18 major exercises including U.S. Africa Command’s largest multinational exercise, African Lion. This year, African Lion 23 took place across Ghana, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia in May and June 2023. The exercise included combined arms live fires, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear response training and three humanitarian assistance events.

In coordination with U.S. Army Futures Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa hosted Arctic Forge, a series of cold-weather exercises based in Scandinavia.

During Arctic Forge 23 last February, Soldiers from the 11th Airborne Division, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, the 10th Mountain Division in Fort Drum, New York, and the Virginia Army National Guard trained with the Finnish military.

U.S. Soldiers also took part in Defense Exercise North, where they drew from the Finnish troops’ frigid weather experience. The Soldiers operated in three feet of snow under subzero temperatures and learned how to operate in arctic conditions, including techniques used on skis to traverse across challenging terrain.

Allied Spirit began in 2011 and has grown from six nations in 2015 to 21 NATO countries and allies in 2023. Unlike other training center exercises, Allied Spirit features an allied unit comprised of partner nations as the primary training audience instead of a U.S. brigade combat team.

From strengthening ties with allied partners to saving lives during humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, the Army made a difference in forging relationships across the globe, and allowing Soldiers to be all that they can be.

29,YEAR IN REVIEW: Building the Army of 2030,https://www.army.mil/article/272235/year_in_review_building_the_army_of_2030,"WASHINGTON ­— The Army continued to deliver the most advanced weapons systems and equipment into the hands of Soldiers in 2023.

The service broke new ground in shipping the first Directed Energy, Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense or DE M-SHORAD prototype systems to Soldiers and the Army also received the latest model of the Integrated Visual Augmentation Systems, or IVAS.

After the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System reached full-rate production status in April, the service followed that feat by demonstrating the first successful launch of a Tomahawk missile from its prototype Mid-Range Capability system.

Finally, the Army honored the service of two Soldiers from two major campaigns in naming its newest infantry assault vehicle. The upgrades bring the Army closer to building the Army of 2030 by investing in its top priority, its people and its Soldiers.

DE M-SHORAD system: In September, the successful delivery of the Directed Energy, MSHORAD system to the newly-reactivated Delta Battery of 4th Battalion, 60th Air Defense Artillery Regiment at Fort Sill, made Delta Battery the first tactical, directed-energy capable unit.

The laser weapons system will not only be a deterrent against enemy forces but can counter against relevant threats with air defense protection. The service classified the DE M-SHORAD system as an urgent acquisition program that provides commanders with greater freedom to maneuver.

Members of the battery underwent extensive training in the fall of 2022 to prepare to operate the prototype. Soldiers simulated an attack using a vehicle with the same weight and power of the prototype.

IVAS: The Army reached a new milestone in July when Soldiers received 20 of the latest model of IVAS, the 1.2 variant. The system features an all-weather headset and next-generation, situational awareness tools with a mixed reality display. IVAS provides Soldiers with high resolution simulations, giving Soldiers enhanced capabilities in both in day and night conditions.

The development of the IVAS will result in fielding several years ahead of standard acquisition programs.

Using augmented reality, the headset enhances a Soldier’s ability to navigate in hostile environments. When dismounting, the IVAS’s low-light sensors help the user identify targets and surrounding vehicles.

The IVAS system also has a built-in Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer, which teaches Soldiers to use the headset to solve objective-based dilemmas and battle scenarios.

Tribute to veterans: The Army announced that it named its newest combat vehicle, the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle, after Medal of Honor recipient Robert Booker, a World War II veteran, and Staff Sgt. Stevon Booker, a Distinguished Service Cross recipient from Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The service announced it awarded the $257.6 million production contract to Michigan-based General Dynamics Land Systems in July. Designers built the armored vehicle to be highly maneuverable and mobile, resembling a light tank.

Army leaders commemorated the renaming during a ceremony at the National Museum of the United States Army in June as part of the service’s 248th birthday celebration. In addition, the Army selected Alabama’s Anniston Army Depot as the repair depot for the vehicle.

Mid-Range firepower: The Army fired intermediate range, subsonic Tomahawk missiles from a prototype system at an undisclosed location on June 27.

Soldiers from the 1st Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington carried out the test with assistance from the Navy. The test marks an important step to strengthening the Army’s top modernization priority: long-range precision fires. The MRC system will support the joint, multi-domain mission.

Soldiers contributed to the testing and development of the MRC, according to the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.

Major milestone: The Army announced in April that its Integrated Battle Command System, or IBCS, had reached full rate production.

The Army Acquisition Support Center describes the IBCS as a fire control and operational center, providing accurate targeting and a wider battlespace. Using sensors and effectors in one command and control system, IBCS lets Soldiers see the battlefield more effectively.

IBCS will replace older command and control systems which in turn will improve coordinated engagements and positive control of sensors and weapons.

Network testing with NATO allies: Soldiers in Hohenfels, Germany tested the Army’s Integrated Tactical Network during Exercise Dragoon Ready 23. The ITN provides voice and data communication capabilities to units in the field.

About 2,500 U.S. Soldiers in field artillery, fire control, operations, and signal support systems participated, along with troops from NATO allies Italy and the United Kingdom. The Soldiers simulated operating in austere environments while learning unified land operations with partner nations.

30,YEAR IN REVIEW: Army’s quality of life changes place people first,https://www.army.mil/article/272178/year_in_review_armys_quality_of_life_changes_place_people_first,"Courtesy photos, collage by Christopher Hurd (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — People remain the Army’s number one priority and the service implemented various quality of life changes throughout 2023 to help service members and their families.

These efforts included enhancing career opportunities for spouses, child care access, family housing, and mental health support.

Spouse Employment

The Army worked on several plans to increase employment for the 431,000 spouses across all three components. The service expanded its noncompetitive hiring authority with the DOD Military Spouse Employment Partnership, connecting spouses to 610 employers. So far, more than 258,000 spouses have been hired.

The Army continues to work with the Defense State Liaison Office as they work with states on implementing the recently passed Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act.

This legislation is designed to assist spouses in transferring occupation licenses between states more effortlessly.

The Army has streamlined the process for spousal reimbursement for license and certification cost up to $1,000 during a permanent change of station move.

Family member employment has been difficult in Italy, and on 30 August 2023, the U.S. and Italy came to an agreement that allows U.S. dependents with a mission visa stationed there to telework to jobs with U.S. employers, which was not an option for spouses previously.

“Army spouses play an important role in Soldier and family readiness and Soldier retention,” said Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth. “Leveraging both Army and DOD programs, and partnerships with other federal and non-governmental organizations, we remain committed to improving spouse employment and career opportunities.”

Streamlined Moving Process

This September, the Department of Defense began phase one of transitioning to a single contracting company, Houston-based company HomeSafe Alliance, LLC, for the pickup and delivery of household goods in the continental U.S.

Phase two will include overseas moves and is scheduled to begin September 2024. Army leadership said the change is expected to bring greater efficiencies and accountability for service members and their families.

“This is an opportunity to raise the standard for our families, attract quality capacity to the program, and introduce a level of accountability absent today,” said Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost, commander, U.S. Transportation Command. “Once implemented, this contract will positively impact thousands of service members, civilian employees and their families each year.”

Child Care

The Army tackled child care costs and availability as well. The service built six new child development centers and has at least five more on the way.

The Army also increased staff at the CDCs by raising entry-level salaries and offering staff retention bonuses as well as child care discounts. More than 70% of its total CDC workforce is now staffed.

In August, the Army announced a new child care pilot program that grants Army Reserve Soldiers and their families access to a childcare matching service and in some areas offering free childcare during battle assembly weekends. The program works with local government support and is being piloted in West Liberty, Iowa, and Clay County, Missouri.

“The Army recognizes the impact that child care has on the lives of our Soldiers and their families,” said Lt. Gen. Kevin Vereen, deputy chief of staff for installations (G-9). “Through increased initiatives to identify and secure accessible and affordable child care options, we enable our military parents to fulfill their responsibilities without sacrificing the well-being of their children.”

The DOD announced the creation of the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account, a financial benefit for eligible service members that allows them to place as much as $5,000 pre-taxed dollars from their paycheck into the account for dependent care services.

Active-component Soldiers, along with Active Guard Reserve Soldiers on Title 10 orders, are eligible. The benefit is scheduled to be available Jan. 1, 2024. Those interested can sign up for the account during the annual Federal Benefits Open Season, which runs now through mid-December.

Parental Leave

To support parents and caregivers, the Army refined its parental leave guidance in January. The new guidance increased paid parental leave from 21 days for non-birth parents to 12 weeks of paid paternal leave for birth parents, non-birth parents and Soldiers adopting a child or accepting a child for long-term foster care.

The expanded policy allows for greater flexibility for Soldiers and their families. It authorizes Soldiers to delay parental leave to attend military education, to take regular leave in between parental leave, and to take leave in increments.

Soldiers can request parental leave through the Integrated Personnel and Pay System–Army and the Department of the Army Form 31.

Economic Stability

Soldiers received positive news with Basic Allowance for Housing rates increasing an average of 12.1% this year. Service members in 291 of 300 military housing areas received an increase.

For low-income military families, a new Basic Needs Allowance became available this year. The supplemental allowance is for active-duty service members with dependents whose household income falls below federal poverty guidelines for their duty location. The new program promotes economic security for Soldiers and their families facing financial challenges.

Additionally, the Army increased retention bonuses this year, giving more money to Soldiers in critical military occupational specialties. The service met its retention goal for the fourth year in a row.

Housing

The Army remains committed to improving its infrastructure; and, in 2023, made significant investments in housing.

Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth pledged to invest $1.5 billion in Army-owned housing and another $3.1 billion in privatized housing. Through the Army’s financial investment plan, the service awarded 45 barracks projects in fiscal year 2023 totaling $1.07 billion.

Barracks projects will continue to see an increased emphasis, said Jordan Matthews, Army Material Command facilities division chief. “These investments directly affect the quality of life of Soldiers and families on Army installations and reflect our commitment to people – the Army’s top priority.”

Army leadership is working to provide 100% sustainment funding for barracks and to spend more on renovation and construction.

Health

As part of the Army’s ongoing efforts to eliminate the stigma associated with seeking mental health support, the Army approved its Brandon Act policy in September.

The new directive allows Soldiers to confidentially seek help through their leaders in the rank of staff sergeant and above, and charges leadership to connect Soldiers with resources quickly.

Soldiers are not required to provide a reason or basis to request a referral. The policy applies to Soldiers in the regular Army, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve who are on active duty for over 30 days.

Guidance for Army National Guard and Army Reserve Soldiers not on active duty is under development.

For Soldiers’ physical health, the Army rolled out its new Body Composition Program in June to assess a Soldier’s body fat more accurately. The policy replaces the older two-measurement test with a one-site tape test across the belly button.

And in March the Army released a directive exempting all Soldiers scoring 540 points or more on the Army Combat Fitness Test from the body fat assessment, regardless of their height and weight. Soldiers must score 80 points or more in each event.

WASHINGTON — In 2023 the service pushed forward with several initiatives to help Americans discover their passions, pursue their purpose, and build lifelong communities while serving.

Brand Relaunch

The Army returned to its classic slogan of “Be All You Can Be” with a brand relaunch in March. The campaign is designed to spotlight the countless opportunities the service offers.

""At a time when political, economic and social factors are changing how young Americans view the world, the new Army brand illustrates how service in the Army is grounded in passion and purpose,"" said Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth. ""Serving our nation is a calling and one that is fundamentally hopeful. We want a new generation of Americans to see the Army as a pathway to the lives and careers they want to achieve.""

The brand transformation was a multiyear process designed to reflect today’s Army while addressing the needs of a new generation. The brand’s new look and feel consists of a re-engineered five-point star logo coupled with the return of the popular tagline, which was initially used from 1980-2001.

Future Soldier Preparatory Course Anniversary

The Army celebrated the first anniversary of the Future Preparatory Course in August. The pilot program helped more than 8,800 eligible Americans overcome academic and physical fitness barriers to service.

The FSPC has an academic track and a fitness track, both three weeks long. The academic portion focuses on helping students improve their Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery scores while the fitness track educates students on the five Holistic Health and Fitness readiness domains.

Both tracks of the course had a 95% graduation rate in the first year of the program, with academic students increasing their ASVAB scores by an average of 18.5 points and fitness students losing an average of 1.7% body fat per week.

“The [course] is where desire meets investment, and every day these young men and women show that when provided the right resources and training, they are able to perform and meet or exceed the standards expected of every Soldier,” said Brig. Gen. Jason E. Kelly, the Fort Jackson commanding general.

Graduates of the academic track who increase their score to a higher classification category can re-negotiate their enlistment contracts and may qualify for a different military occupational specialty or additional incentives.

This year, the Army gave out more than $15.5 million to program graduates.

The course initially started at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, but expanded to Fort Moore, Georgia in January.

All-Volunteer Force 50th Anniversary

On July 1, the Army and the nation celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the all-volunteer force. The move was made by President Richard Nixon’s administration in 1973 to fill the U.S. military ranks with Americans who chose to serve rather than with draftees.

Over the next five decades, the Army continued to evolve from its draft days. Enlistments went from two years to varying lengths depending on a Soldier’s career path.

The Army now offers more complex education and training for more than 200 jobs in science, cybersecurity, combat forces, aviation, medicine, law and more.

Innovations to training have been added to set Soldiers up for success, including Holistic Health and Fitness as well as new approaches to mental, sleep, physical and spiritual readiness.

“Our Soldiers, from the newest E-1 to the most experienced generals come from all over the country, from many different backgrounds, from multiple demographics, races and ethnicities,” Wormuth said. “At the end of the day, what unites us is our shared Army values. That and our collective mission to fight and win the nation’s wars.”

75th Integration, Desegregation Anniversaries

It was a year of anniversary celebrations, as the Army marked the 75th anniversary of the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act in June and the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9981 in July.

The integration act allowed women to become permanent, full-time members of the Army. According to retired Maj. Gen Gina Farrisee, the first female commanding general of the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, the Army provides a way for every person to achieve their full potential.

“The Army is an amazing opportunity,” Farrisee said. “For those looking for a challenge and wanting to make a difference, it is certainly the place to do that. There is no doubt in my mind that the military makes you a better person.”

Just a month later in 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981, ending racial segregation in the armed forces.

“Ending racial discrimination in the military made our Army immeasurably stronger and moved our country closer to fulfilling its founding promise,” Wormuth said. “We should be proud of the progress the Army has made in ensuring that every Soldier, regardless of race, can pursue the unlimited opportunities that military service offers.”

Recruiting Reform

Facing a challenging recruiting environment, the Army announced the transformation of its recruiting enterprise in October.

“The competition for talented Americans is fierce, and it is fundamentally different than it was 50 or even 20 years ago,” Wormuth said. “Understanding that reality is key to designing new practices that will make us a more attractive and compelling career choice for young Americans.”

The sweeping changes include expanding the recruiting focus to a larger portion of the available population, creating a specialized talent acquisition workforce, improving the measurement and evaluation of recruiting policy decisions, and aligning the Army recruiting structure.

First, the Army will expand its focus beyond recent high school graduates. Army leadership set a goal of at least a third of the service’s newest recruits to have more than a high school degree by 2028, compared to 20% today.

Second, the service plans to create two new military occupational specialties for an enlisted talent acquisition specialist and a warrant officer to ensure the best recruiting subject matter expertise and leadership. A more specialized officer workforce remains under consideration.

Third, the Army will create an evidence-based learning capability at Army headquarters that will incorporate data collection and program evaluation design into policy planning and implementation.

Finally, Army leadership plans to consolidate marketing and recruiting into a three-star command that reports directly to them with the new commander’s time in position changing from two to four years.

“The fact is that even though it remains a challenge to attract new recruits, we are exceeding our retention goals every year,” Wormuth said. “That means that people who are in the Army by and large love their jobs. And that’s a message we want all young Americans to hear – that the United States Army is truly a place where you can be all that you can be.”

WASHINGTON — Before kickoff at Saturday’s Army-Navy football game, seven cadets and seven midshipmen will walk to midfield to be traded back to their home academies.

The annual ceremony is part of the Service Academy Exchange Program where students from each of the four service academies are exchanged to spend the fall semester at an academy other than their own.

The program has roots dating back to 1945, when the U.S. Military Academy cadets and Naval Academy midshipmen participated in a weeklong exchange program. The program expanded to a semester long in 1975. Second Class cadets from West Point participate in the exchange but go through a competitive selection process.

Cadet Mitch Walker, who was born in Annapolis, Maryland, said being selected and attending the Naval Academy for a semester has been invaluable.

“It’s extremely important to have a better understanding of our fellow services and their mission sets, tools and capabilities,” he said. “It allows us to hit the ground running quicker in the future in joint operations.”

Cadet Beau Briggs echoed this sentiment. “I’ve been told by many mentors in my life that I’ll be serving in joint operations more than you think,” he said. “I wanted to meet people I’ll likely run into at some point in my career, have those connections, make new friends, experience more culture, learn about other services.”

“It’s becoming more and more important to have programs where the joint forces work together,” said Cadet Ida McLaughlin, from Bethesda, Maryland. “As our focus shifts to peer adversaries, joint operations will become critical to the operational capabilities of our forces. Understanding the capabilities each player has and how they complement each other is crucial to any team. Each branch has a specialized mission, and we have a fighting force that is the most lethal on the planet.”

Some of the cadets felt a call to service and are following a family tradition.

Walker, from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, had an uncle who served in the Marines in Desert Storm, a grandfather in the Air Force during Vietnam, a great-grandfather in the Army infantry and a great-grandfather in the Army Air Corps in World War II.

“Service has always been a priority of mine and my family” Walker said. “I was raised to respect those who have sacrificed on my behalf so naturally I wanted to fulfill that obligation and calling as well. I want to be on the ground in the fight up front as an infantry officer.”

Briggs, from Charlotte, North Carolina, had a grandfather who served in the Navy.

“Being here at the Naval Academy, I earned a better understanding of his service,” he said. “I decided to join the military because service has always been a big part of my life in whatever capacity that may come in. Service to our nation is the highest form of service there is. The military was always on my mind. I landed on the Army because I liked the mission more than the other branches.”

Walker highly recommends the service academies to anyone considering attending.

“Going to a service academy is an experience that can’t be bought,” he said. “It’s truly a million-dollar education. You can’t match the experiences, the people you’ll meet or the friendships you’ll build anywhere else in the country. Going through life every day with more than 4,000 other people committed to defending the nation and its freedoms motivates me to be a better version of myself every single day.

“I would encourage anyone looking to join the Army or applying to any of the Service Academies to do your research and put the effort in before you go to be successful,” Walker said. “Be prepared to be out of your comfort zone but the sooner you discover the opportunities available to you, the more you’ll get out of your experience.”

“The Army provides a multitude of opportunities for Soldiers,” McLaughlin said. “Be aware of the programs in place to support you and take advantage of them. Broaden your horizons. Seek out opportunities to experience new things and learn from experts in fields that are different from yours.”

She plays Division-1A Rugby for West Point, studies mechanical engineering and hopes to commission as an aviation officer.

Prior to the start of the Army-Navy game, the cadets will be exchanged at midfield and allowed to cheer on their teams from friendly areas in the West Point seating areas.

“It’s Army-Navy week so tensions are high right now. Everyone’s very skeptical of everyone else,” Briggs said. “I’m looking over my shoulder constantly. I can’t wait to go out to that midfield line, do our exchange and run back to my student section. Go Army, beat Navy.”

“I’m absolutely excited to rejoin my classmates,” McLaughlin said. “The anticipation for this game has been building throughout this semester, and the exchange will be the culminating event for us. With the rivalry, we’re much more similar than different and united in our willingness to place duty, honor and country first.”

“Although the Army-Navy rivalry is strong and apparent in the attitudes of both academies and their sports teams, at the end of the day, we’re all on the same team,” Walker said. “We’re best friends and partners 364 days out of the year until one Saturday afternoon in December as we watch our teams duke it out on the gridiron.

“I’m super excited to see my company and cheer the Army team to victory,” Walker said. “Go Army, beat Navy!”"

JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska — For the 68th year, the Alaska National Guard's Operation Santa Claus is bringing the magic of the season to the remote communities of Fort Yukon, Golovin, Koyuk and Tuluksak.

Teaming up with the Salvation Army, the Guard will deliver gifts and tidings of good cheer to approximately 560 children.

Jenny Ragland, a service extension and disaster services director with the Salvation Army, said the organization collects the gifts and the Guard provides logistical support.

“So, when we show up in a community with Santa, there is a gift with every child's name that we share with them,"" she said. ""... Operation Santa wouldn't happen without the partnership between the Salvation Army and the Alaska National Guard.”

Gifts earmarked for the western Alaska communities were palletized by National Guardsmen at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson before their journey to Bethel or Nome. The Alaska Air National Guard's C-17 Globemaster III and the Alaska Army National Guard's C-12 Huron fixed-wing aircraft facilitated the transport.

Upon reaching the hub locations of Bethel and Nome, Santa, Mrs. Claus and their helper elves continued their journey to Tuluksak on November 14 via Army Guard UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters loaded with all the gifts.

Hanna Alexie, a kindergarten teacher in Tuluksak, said her students looked out the classroom window eagerly awaiting the arrival of Santa and Mrs. Claus.

""The students were very excited for this day, and today they were very anxious waiting,” she said. “They didn't want to take off their coats too, waiting in our classroom. They couldn't wait for you guys.""

Jerry Hawk, a community member, expressed gratitude for the rare gathering. He emphasized the significance of bringing the community together to celebrate the holiday.

""The best part was bringing my grandkids over here with everybody, with the community,” said Hawk. ""The peace of joy, the peace of God is within us.

""I'd like to thank everybody that came over, the [National Guard], Santa Claus, and all the presents, and all the people that came here,” said Hawk. “I'd like to wish everybody a Merry Christmas. Thank you.”

The Inupiat Eskimo village of Golovin welcomed Santa, Mrs. Claus and festive volunteers to the Martin L. Olson School gymnasium in Golovin, Alaska, for Operation Santa Claus, Nov. 30, 2023.

Two weeks later, the jolly bunch continued the heartwarming journey to Golovin on November 30, where local cheerleaders led chants and performed choreographed routines while welcoming the festive visitors.

Donna Katchatag, tribal coordinator, said, the community ""prepared desserts, cookies, lemonade, and all the decorating was the help of the kids also.""

Katchatag was a young student the last time Operation Santa Claus visited.

“I don’t have any memories besides him leaving, and I was wondering, why is Santa leaving in a helicopter?” said Katchatag.

It is an Operation Santa Claus tradition that the festivities kick off with everyone singing “Jingle Bells.” Students were then called one by one to meet and take a photo with Santa and receive personalized gifts and candy canes.

In the interior, gifts destined for Fort Yukon were loaded onto the Black Hawk at Ladd Army Airfield on Fort Wainwright, ensuring a direct and efficient delivery December 1.

The program visits the community of Koyuk over the first two weeks of December, promising more holiday magic for these remote areas.

KINDERHOOK, N.Y. - New York Army National Guard Maj. Gen. Michel Natali commemorated the 241st birthday of former President Martin Van Buren Dec. 5 by laying a wreath from the White House at the eighth president’s grave.

The presentation of the wreath from President Joseph Biden marked the climax of a ceremony that featured wreath presentations from local officials, volunteer groups and the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site.

The New York Army National Guard also provided a color guard and honor cordon for the ceremony, along with a bugler to sound taps and a military chaplain to open and close the ceremony.

New York Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Alison Ogden, a member of Joint Force Headquarters who participated in the honor cordon, said she was proud to participate in the ceremony for the second time.

”It is good for the military to be part of local events like this one,” Ogden said.

Natali, the assistant adjutant, Army, for the New York National Guard, praised Van Buren, who served from 1836-1840, for his efforts to keep the United States from going to war with Great Britain over border disputes in Maine and Americans’ support for a rebellion in Canada. Van Buren also refused to support the annexation of Texas as a state to avoid war with Mexico, Natali noted.

Since 1967, the current occupant of the White House has sent wreaths to be presented at the gravesites of former presidents on their birthdays, Natali said.

The ceremony at the Kinderhook Reformed Cemetery, hosted by Kinderhook Mayor Michael Abrams, included remarks by Megan O’Malley, the superintendent of the Martin Van Buren Historic Site, and a presentation by children from Ichabod Crane Primary School.

Natali said it was important to hold events like this to tie the legacy of the past to the present.

Jane Miller, the president of the Friends of Lindenwald, a volunteer group that supports the National Historic Site, said she appreciated the National Guard participating in the annual tradition in Kinderhook.

“We need to remember that our nation was shaped by people like Martin Van Buren,” Miller said.

He was the son of a Dutch tavern owner who worked and studied hard to become a lawyer and important political leader, she said.

Van Buren was the first president born as an American citizen rather than a subject of the King of England. He was also the only president not to have spoken English as his first language, having grown up speaking Dutch, and the first president from New York.

Before running for president in 1836, Van Buren, a lawyer, served as a New York state senator, attorney general, and governor of New York. He was secretary of state for President Andrew Jackson and vice president during Jackson's second term.

Shortly after taking office in 1837, an economic downturn known as the Panic of 1837 hit. Businesses closed, people lost their jobs, and the agricultural economy took a hit.

Van Buren ran for re-election in 1840 but was defeated by William Henry Harrison. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1844 but lost to James K. Polk.

In 1848, he was the unsuccessful presidential candidate of the Free-Soil Party, a group opposing an extension of slavery. That defeat marked the end of his political career.

Van Buren, known as Old Kinderhook because of his hometown, supposedly gave the English language the term OK. During his run for office, OK clubs were organized to support him. He also initialed papers with the letters OK to indicate he approved.

Van Buren died in 1862 during the Civil War.

The New York Army and Air National Guard headquarters traditionally conduct the wreath presentations at the grave of former President Chester A. Arthur in Menands and Van Buren in Kinderhook. The New York Air National Guard's 107th Airlift Wing in Niagara Falls honors former President Millard Fillmore.

KINDERHOOK, N.Y. -- New York Army National Guard Maj. Gen. Michel Natali commemorated the 241st birthday of President Martin Van Buren on Tuesday, December 5, by laying a wreath from the White House at the eighth president's grave in Kinderhook.

Van Buren also refused to support the annexation of Texas as a state, in order to avoid war with Mexico, Natali noted.

Since 1967, the current occupant of the White House has sent wreaths to be presented at the gravesites of former presidents on their birthdays, Natali said.

The ceremony at the Kinderhook Reformed Cemetery, hosted by Kinderhook Mayor Michael Abrams, included remarks by Megan O’Malley, the superintendent of the Martin Van Buren Historic Site, and a presentation by children from Ichabod Crane Primary School.

Van Buren, O’Malley said, was happy being at home in Kinderhook, where he was born and grew up and lived most of his, she said. He would have appreciated a home grown ceremony like the one she was speaking at, she said.

The elementary school students gave a presentation about Martin Van Buren’s life and sang happy birthday to the president.

“It was excellent to have the kids here,” Natali said.

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – As two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters approached to rescue his battle buddies, then-Sgt. 1st Class Rick Dean was impressed by how closely they circled above before landing together in a tight space.

Dean had only set up the landing zone for one helicopter, not aware that a pair of them would arrive to medically evacuate two of his friends from a dangerous area near Baghdad.

But then they both touched down without hesitation.

“I was unbelievably amazed at the proficiency and skill level of the two crews that landed there,” he recalled, saying he found out later they often respond in pairs. “It was awe-inspiring.”

The incident later convinced Dean to pay it forward. He decided to switch careers from artilleryman to helicopter pilot, a role where he went on to provide similar support for many other military members.

On Friday, U.S. Army Aviation Battalion–Japan honored Dean’s 26-year career as he flew an Army helicopter for the final time. After he landed it at Camp Zama’s Kastner Airfield, his helicopter was sprayed with water and well-wishers doused him in champagne as part of an aviation tradition that dates back to World War II.

Over the course of his service, Dean, now a chief warrant officer 4, had logged 1,900 flight hours in 14 countries, including combat zones. And for the most part, those hours flew right on by.

“Now that you’re at the end, you’re like, ‘Wow, where did the time go?’” he said. “It went pretty fast.”

Medevac pilot

As a child, Dean dreamed of being in the Army and to follow in the footsteps of his grandfathers who had both served in WWII.

In 1997, he signed up for artillery and then completed additional training as a paratrooper. While stationed in Alaska, he remembered the invigorating experience of jumping out of planes in the winter.

After a deployment to Afghanistan a few years later, Dean returned to combat in 2006 and his tour was extended for the Iraq War troop surge.

Dean, who was a squad leader responsible for several young men, said the sight of helicopters would bring him a sense of relief as they kept an eye on them from above.

Once, while his unit conducted a patrol, Dean said an AH-64 Apache helicopter pilot warned them that a stretch along the dirt path ahead of them had been disturbed, possibly hiding a roadside bomb. The pilot then safely guided the Soldiers around it.

“Just to see the helicopters fly overhead,” he said, “it was something that gave you a lot of confidence to know that somebody’s up there watching over everything.”

As fighting intensified during the deployment, Dean said many Soldiers would still require a medical evacuation, including his battle buddies.

Dean and his unit were on a patrol when one of their vehicles hit an anti-tank mine, causing it to flip over. Two of the Soldiers inside the vehicle were badly wounded but would survive after being quickly flown by helicopter to a medical facility.

Despite his fear of heights, Dean said he aspired to be a pilot after that so he could be there for other Soldiers if needed.

Following flight school, Dean was initially assigned to an aviation unit at Fort Riley, Kansas, that mainly transported dignitaries. But he said he fought to get transferred to a “dust-off” medevac unit and served two more combat tours, where he assisted in numerous lifesaving missions.

“Having been on the ground where we needed medevac, I knew how important it was when I was flying it,” he said. “It’s an incredibly important mission.”

Big presence

Standing at 6 feet, 3 inches tall, the burly-sized Dean is easily recognizable wherever he goes.

His contributions have also been significant for the aviation battalion here, which conducts general support operations across the U.S. Army Pacific region.

“He is probably one of the most genuinely honest and outgoing people that I’ve ever met,” said Chief Warrant Officer 4 Jake Schmidt, the battalion aviation standardization pilot and senior warrant officer.

“He just has that presence that more or less attracts people to him, especially here in Japan where he is quite bigger than everybody else,” he said, smiling. “Naturally, people like to gravitate toward him.”

Dean, 46, who is an avid hiker, has climbed Mount Fuji seven times in the past three years, and many of those trips he organized to help friends and co-workers scale Japan’s tallest mountain.

As an aviation mission survivability officer, Dean has also trained tactics to crew members on how to safely fly Black Hawks against different threats.

“He is the subject-matter expert when it comes to that and guides us through all that training,” Schmidt said.

While in the cockpit, Dean had the opportunity to support earthquake disaster relief exercises and assault training with Japan Ground Self-Defense Force units.

Schmidt, who was in the same class of Warrant Officer Candidate School as Dean in 2008, said it was great to see a familiar face when he arrived at the battalion a year ago.

“He is going to be missed for sure around here,” Schmidt said. “He does so much stuff for us.”

And during those stressful times, Dean could always be counted on to help lighten the mood thanks to his contagious laugh, Schmidt said.

“To have that relationship with other people that you work with,” he said, “it just goes a long way to making your job more enjoyable.”

Next chapter

Before he officially retires, Dean plans to participate in the Career Skills Program, which allows Soldiers transitioning out of the Army to learn a new trade and improve their civilian employment options.

Like the job change he previously made in the Army, from combat arms to aviation, his next career move will also veer in a new direction.

Dean said he will return to his home state of New Hampshire to do an apprenticeship to learn how to be a blacksmith, a hobby of his that he started in high school.

While it will be his first foray into trying the profession full time, his motive to pursue it remains the same — to help others.

Once fully certified, he hopes to instruct lessons on blacksmithing at retreats that support former military members dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“I would like teach them another trade or something else they can try out,” he said.

Life after the Army will be bittersweet for Dean. While he jokingly said he looks forward to no more slideshow briefings, he will miss the camaraderie with his teammates.

“I will definitely stay in touch with as many as I can,” he said. “That’s the hardest part about leaving is not having them around.”

But his departure from the Army will also open the door to a new adventure in his lifelong journey.

“I don’t look at it as an ending,” he said, “but more as ‘on to the next chapter.’”

37,European Best Medic Kicksoff,https://www.army.mil/article/272196/european_best_medic_kicksoff,"GRAFENWOEHR, Germany – U.S. Soldiers and NATO partners participate in the European Best Medic Competition (EBMC) here Dec. 4 to 8, 2023.

This scenario-driven event is designed to evaluate the competencies, skills, and readiness of European theater medics; the top medics selected during the EBMC will go on to represent their unit at the Army Best Medic Competition.

The EBMC, featuring 30 teams, each composed of two personnel, will navigate through 12 meticulously crafted events, including a mystery challenge designed to keep participants on their toes. These tests challenge the teams on an array of critical individual and team tasks essential for effective combat operations. Participants will be subjected to events that simulate real-life combat conditions, demanding physical and mental fortitude in austere environments.

“I think the best medic competition for us increases our Soldier readiness by having many well-rounded events,” said Spc. Megan Muzquiz, with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. “It’s really cool to be getting put through all the physicality and mental challenges we don't typically get a lot of hands on.”

The EBMC highlights the adaptability and resilience of Army Medics, showcasing the best of Army medicine. The competition emphasizes testing the participants' ability to provide Tactical Combat Casualty Care under extreme conditions.

Despite the added challenge of cold conditions, participants expressed enthusiasm.

“The cold adds an extra challenge, but it's been super fun,” said Muzquiz. “I am most excited for the water rescue event that we’re going to be conducting. We’re going to be jumping through a lake and saving a casualty, as well as providing CPR.”

EBMC being a multinational event means that competitors from across Europe get together and share their own experiences from the medical field.

“One of the great things about being part of these events is that we get to come together with soldiers from all over that we don't normally get to interact with,” said Staff Sgt. Stephanie Hardin, with public health activity. “Whether that's U.S. Soldiers, soldiers that are here, international soldiers come together and go through these experiences together and then share our own experiences as well, just a lot of really good networking and learning.”

“This event promotes interoperability by allowing us to work alongside NATO partners. It's an interesting opportunity to not only be doing these events and challenges alongside them, but to also compete in something that they’re more specialized in,” added Muzquiz.

The European Best Medic Competition is a pivotal event in the journey of European theater medics. Beyond being a platform for showcasing individual and team excellence, it serves as the crucible for selecting representatives for the Army Best Medic Competition. As medics converge at the Grafenwoehr Training Area, they are vying for the title of Best European Medic and contributing to their collective strength and readiness.

These events are not just about winning but about personal and professional growth.

“What’s really important is just to encourage everyone to go out and do these types of events. Any soldier competition like this is awesome training,” said Hardin. “Ultimately, everybody walks away gaining something because it's training, it’s building connections.”"

VICENZA, Italy — A close friend told her there was no way she could do it. She would not make it in the Army, and there was even less chance of her becoming a sniper.

Four years later, she is still defying the odds.

“My nickname growing up was ‘Sniper,’” said U.S. Army Sgt. Maciel Hay, a cavalry scout with 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment (1-91 CAV), 173rd Airborne Brigade.

Not only did she make it through basic training while qualifying as an expert with the M4 assault rifle, she quickly followed that up by graduating from airborne school. Now she is truly living up to her childhood nickname as the first active duty female U.S. Army sniper.

“I grew up shooting, mostly rifles and handguns, on my family’s ranches in Rocklin, California and Medford, Oregon,” said Hay. “But the nickname came from the fact that I could find things really fast, similar to how a sniper does target detection.”

Hay says that shooting came naturally to her, but she credits her uncle Cy with teaching her the basics. However, the inspiration to become an Army sniper came later while attending Sierra College near her hometown.

“A close friend of mine told me I’d never make it in the Army, and there’s no way I could become a sniper,” Hay laughed. “Needless to say, that person is no longer part of my life. But now that I look back at it, I really do appreciate the motivation.”

In contrast, Hay points to her positive experience in the Army, underscored by the support she has received from leaders and peers throughout her training. From the early days of basic training, where her sharpshooting skills caught the attention of leadership, to her drill sergeant encouraging her to pursue sniper school, Hay found herself surrounded by individuals who recognized her potential.

“Even though I only shot sharpshooter at first, then eventually expert later on in basic training, my drill sergeant encouraged me to pursue the goal of sniper school,” said Hay.

In the world of military marksmanship, individual weapons qualification is a crucial milestone. With their M4 or M16 assault rifle, Soldiers must shoot at least 23 out of 40 targets to earn the status of ""marksman."" Achieving sharpshooter status requires hitting at least 30 targets, whereas experts must shoot a minimum of 36. Hay's progression from sharpshooter to expert reflects not just her skill but also her dedication to mastering the art of marksmanship.

After basic and advanced individual training as a cavalry scout, Hay’s leadership at the 1-91 CAV continued to see her potential.

“Sgt. Hay is just an incredible non-commissioned officer that comes to work every day with the intention of making not only her team better, but also the entire organization,” said Hay’s platoon sergeant, Sgt. 1st Class Antwon Jones, 1-91 CAV.

As Jones alludes, Hay’s journey to sniper school took a team effort.

Jones shared that from slotting her into a sniper section to ensuring she was prepared ahead of time, multiple leaders supported Hay’s decision to pursue sniper school.

“One example that comes to mind is our new Behavioral Health Provider, Capt. Lee,” said Jones. “He wasn’t even in-processed with the unit at that point, but he made time on a Saturday to meet with Sgt. Hay for a screening needed for her submission packet.”

Soldiers attending sniper school undergo a rigorous selection process. Typically, candidates are experienced infantrymen who have demonstrated exceptional marksmanship skills. They must meet specific physical and mental requirements, as the demanding nature of sniper operations requires a high level of fitness, discipline and concentration.

In preparing for sniper school, Hay was tasked with making a ghillie suit, which is a type of camouflage clothing typically worn by snipers. Even this endeavor was a group effort.

“It took many hours, multiple people and tons of sewing to create an acceptable ghillie suit,” said Hay.

Once at school, the ghillie suit came in handy, as marksmanship was not the only focal point for sniper candidates during the five-week course.

While emphasis is placed on developing exceptional marksmanship skills with various sniper rifles, including bolt-action and semi-automatic systems, sniper candidates are tested in the art of stalking and concealment, observation and intelligence gathering, survival skills and land navigation, as well as urban sniper operations where snipers perform their craft in densely populated areas.

“The rapid target engagement and intelligence reporting were two of the toughest areas for me,” said Hay. “I also struggled with the very last test where we had to engage long distance targets while sitting on our rucksacks. That position threw off my balance.”

Hay shared that the instructors were very passionate about their craft and provided many hours of assistance to her class of sniper candidates, including guidance on the rucksack position.

“They told me to tighten my tripod’s sling, fitting it closer to my body,” said Hay. “That made all the difference.”

Upon successful completion of the training, Hay and the other graduates received certification as U.S. Army Snipers. This qualification signifies that the soldier has met the high standards set by the school and is capable of carrying out sniper duties in a variety of operational environments.

Hay’s family was able to travel from California to visit her at Fort Moore (formerly Fort Benning), Georgia, for the sniper school graduation. It was the first time they were able to see her in uniform.

“Due to COVID travel restrictions, they weren’t able to make it to my basic training or advanced individual training a few years ago,” said Hay. “Then, I went straight to Germany to join my unit. So it was really nice to see them and I’m grateful for their support.”

From her childhood day’s nicknamed “Sniper,” to graduating as the first female active duty Army sniper, Hay’s full-circle journey is one of commitment and determination, and she is not done yet.

Her next assignment takes her to Anchorage, Alaska, with the 1st Squadron (Airborne), 40th Cavalry Regiment. She says becoming a jumpmaster is her next goal, and everyone keeps telling her to attend Ranger School.

“It great to hear stories about paratroopers doing great things,” said Jones, “But especially when it’s a female defying the odds and proving women are just as capable to do anything when they have the motivation and drive to win.”

NÜRNBERG, Germany – Brig. Gen. Steven P. Carpenter, Commanding General of 7th Army Training Command (7ATC), went to the Nürnberg Town Hall to sign a partnership agreement with Marcus König, Lord Mayor of Nürnberg, in Nürnberg, Germany, Dec. 1, 2023. The partnership agreement is a formal declaration of the unity and commitment to teamwork shared by members of the U.S. Army stationed in Bavaria and the people and leadership of the city of Nürnberg.

“It is an honor to represent 7ATC and the 50,000 Soldiers, civilians and family members that call Bavaria home,” said Carpenter, “as we cement our relationship through the signing of an official partnership.”

The agreement promises that “both partners will foster the expansion of human, cultural, tourist, sports and educational relations. To include a large number of citizens into this partnership, lasting contacts between families and especially between young people will be promoted.”

In addition to the strong relationships built between members of both communities over the years since 7ATC’s establishment in Bavaria, the city of Nürnberg has remained one of 7ATC’s most important strategic partners with close ties to many U.S. Army offices, such as the legal office, Army airfield, Joint Multinational Training Group – Ukraine, and many more.

“The signing of an official partnership between the city of Nürnberg and 7ATC is a symbol of this relationship,” said Carpenter. “A cornerstone of the friendship between the United States Army and Germany.”

“I am very thankful that we have our American friends very close by in Grafenwöhr who actually support us,” said König.

“We're excited for the strengthening partnership between the American Army and your historic and beautiful city,” said Carpenter. “We truly are stronger together. Train to win. As we say, it is better in Bavaria.”"

FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. — Screaming Eagle Division Soldiers here just completed training and testing the Army’s 6.8mm family of Next Generation Squad Weapon-Rifle (NGSW-R), NGSW-Automatic Rifle (AR) and the NGSW-Fire Control (FC) systems.

Troops of Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and members of 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, undertook New Equipment Training on the NGSW.

""The New Equipment Training gave the Soldiers a good base before coming out and using the NGSWs,” said Infantryman Sgt. Jack Scott, a team leader in Alpha Company.

Their training covered the similarities and differences between the new weapons and the legacy 5.56mm M4A1 Carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon systems, focusing on enhanced lethality.

“We did a lot of training with both static and maneuver ranges, so the product of Soldier you get now, during the live fire, is high quality due to all of that training,” added Scott.

Once complete with new equipment training, Soldiers tested the NGSW in a Limited User Test, or LUT, in a crawl-walk-run method to ensure all operational data is collected on the weapon, as well as user integration with the new equipment.

Alpha Company and 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment initially conducted static qualification and variable distance ranges with legacy weapon systems and NGSW, to compare performance of both and give Soldiers repetitions and familiarity with the NGSW.

Alpha Company 1st Sgt. Justin Babb appreciated the benefits of participating in an operational test and the opportunity for his junior Soldier’s feedback to contribute and impact Army modernization.

“The candid feedback that the Soldiers and NCOs provided during focus groups and surveys will provide the Army with perspective from the lowest level of user that will actually use the system,” said Babb.

Major differences between the legacy M4, M249 systems and the NGSWs were immediately noticeable by the Soldiers.

Spec. Maximiliano Arguindegui, an automatic rifleman with 1/75th Ranger Regiment, said, ""Overall, I feel faster with the M249, but I prefer the NGSW-AR because it makes me more lethal.""

Scott added, ""Stopping power with the 6.8 round is a big improvement compared to the M4 and M249 and having the ability to use with or without the suppressor is a huge feature for the support by fire element.""

Leaders of Alpha Company also said participating in a test with the Operational Test Command enabled them to get after their internal readiness.

Alpha Company Commander, Capt. Jordan Mares, said, “Being a part of the NGSW test absolutely supported our company readiness. The LUT gave us opportunities to hone our craft, practice lessons learned with feedback from subject-matter experts, and the ability to conduct a lot of repetitions to practice small unit tactics.""

Staff Sgt. Ivan Alvarez, a Squad Leader with Alpha Company, was initially skeptical of the NGSW.

""When we first started the LUT, I was very against the NGSW-R,” he said. “I'm used to the M4 — it's lighter — I'm used to the recoil, the engagements, everything the M4 has to offer. But, as we went through the LUT with the NGSW-R, I can see the capabilities that it brings to an infantryman, especially at a longer distance.""

Alvarez also said testing the new weapons gave his squad added training opportunities.

""We got after a lot of training that we would normally have to wait months to set up and accomplish,” he said. “We were able to get more marksmanship time, more range time, and were able to train under various environmental conditions.""

Another squad leader with the Rangers provided his observations on the training benefit while participating in an operational test.

“We were able to get reps in on a new weapon system as well as our legacy equipment,” said Sgt. Joseph Martin. “We were able to train on many basic things that we want to train on every year, but condensed to get more repetitions, as well as live fire iterations for our younger, inexperienced Soldiers.”

SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — When he returned from a tour in Iraq as the commander of the Oregon National Guard’s 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team in 2009, then-Army Col. Daniel Hokanson saw how the unit’s 3,500 personnel returned to their communities.

“We brought the fabric of America to the war because there are no active-duty bases in Oregon, they came from every corner of the state,” said Hokanson, the Guard Bureau chief. “They were teachers, police officers, firemen … and they deployed. Then they came back to their community, and they showed, look, you can do this. You can serve and you can go back and reintegrate into your communities.”

At the 2023 Reagan National Defense Forum — an annual gathering of national security and defense leaders — Hokanson spoke about recruiting and readiness and listened to remarks from key leaders.

During his keynote address, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III painted the backdrop of the current global environment as “challenging,” citing “the major conflicts facing our fellow democracies, Israel and Ukraine; bullying and coercion from an increasingly assertive China; and a worldwide battle between democracy and autocracy.”

“And let me be blunt about our mission,” Austin said. “The U.S. military is here to win our country’s wars — and to win them decisively. We will always try to deter conflict. But if we have to defend our country, we will fight — and we will win.”

On the recruiting front, the DoD is in competition with corporate America for the same talent pool, especially in high-tech areas like cyber defense and space. This issue was heightened in the wake of the pandemic. Employers have been offering incentives once unique to the military, including education benefits and healthcare packages.

In the 2023 Reagan National Defense Forum survey — a public opinion poll — about half of the respondents would encourage a friend or family member to join the military for reasons of patriotism, service and honor. More than 20% responded that a key point to discourage service is that it’s too dangerous and not worth the risks.

Hokanson joined U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Under Secretary of the Army Gabriel O. Camarillo, and Karl Rove to discuss these issues on the “Celebrating and Encouraging Service: How to Boost Recruitment and Ensure Readiness” panel.

Camarillo acknowledged recruiting as a long-term challenge for the Army. The service announced a major overhaul of its recruiting operations in October.

“This is the biggest transformation since the all-volunteer force was established in 1975,” Camarillo said of Army recruiting, citing increased prospecting and marketing and a revamped recruiting workforce to closer resemble Fortune 500 companies.

Hokanson sees recruiting as a tactical matter with strategic implications.

The Guard is 20% of the joint force funded at 4% of the defense budget. With about 430,000 members, it is the second largest military organization after the Army. There are eight full Army divisions and 90 Air wings within the Guard.

Hokanson emphasized that the National Guard exists to fight and win America’s wars as the Army and Air Force combat reserve. He noted that many Guardsmen either joined or renewed their commitment to serve after 9/11, with an expectation to deploy or mobilize overseas.

He said Guardsmen bring “a treasure trove” of experience and expertise.

The Air National Guard won big in September’s Air Force William Tell fighter competition. The Vermont Guard’s 158th Wing earned the title of top F-35 Wing, along with other individual awards.

Four Army National Guard sniper teams emerged as the best contenders in the 2023 International Sniper Competition, and all finished in the top 10, with the Guard taking first place.

The Guard is also at the forefront of future warfighting domains. The Army Guard has more than 1,095 Soldiers working in cyber units. There are more than 11,500 Airmen assigned to Air Force cyber specialty codes in the Air Guard.

In September, Hokanson presented a joint Guard cyber team with the 2022 SANS NetWars Department of Defense Services Cup, marking the third consecutive year the Guard team has won the cybersecurity competition.

“These Soldiers and Airmen embody the best of the Guard: experts in their civilian jobs who use their skills to serve their states and nation,” he said.

This warfighting posture enables the Guard to perform the most visible of its missions.

“Because we’re manned, trained and equipped to do arguably the most difficult task there is,” Hokanson said, “you can ask us to do almost anything within the local communities, and we will be there immediately to respond.

“We provide Guardsmen the opportunity to respond to their communities in times of need.”

Other panelists echoed the appeal of serving in the Guard.

“Because the [Guard] mission is right in front of you,” Cramer said, “you’re helping your neighbors during a flood or rescuing people in a snowstorm. And I think that does resonate.”

The CNGB spoke of the value and flexibility the Guard offers its members to serve as part-time Citizen-Soldiers or -Airmen.

“Many of our Guardsmen are college students because they can go to school and serve at the same time,” Hokanson said. “Another great advantage is if you’re from Des Moines, Iowa, or Medford, Oregon, and your family’s there and you want to live there, we offer you the opportunity to do all that.”

Still, Hokanson said the Guard is focused on connecting with the groups that have little or no association with the military.

He encourages Guardsmen to tell the story of the Guard, which includes almost 7.5 million personnel days supporting combatant commands at home and around the world. Last year, more than 8,500 people were rescued from disasters, and four countries were added to the 100-nation Department of Defense National Guard State Partnership Program.

A Pentagon data point says that 78% of those who entered military service had an immediate family member, friend or relative in the military.

“The difficult thing is, if you’ve not had contact with somebody in the military, and if you get your perception of the military from what you see on the news or the stuff that grabs headlines, you could have potentially a negative view of it,” Hokanson said.

“But those that actually know servicemembers realize there are great advantages and incredible opportunities,” he said.

The Guard has seen steady improvement in recruiting new members since the disruption of the pandemic, while retention is at historically high levels. Hokanson summarized some of his key initiatives to continue these trends.

“No-cost healthcare for our Guardsmen, the same incentive pay as active-component Soldiers and Airmen and duty status reform,” he said. “And our whole goal is for every Guardsman to have two retirements: their National Guard and civilian retirement.""

We want to show the value of serving our country and the long-term payback for you and your family,” he said.

LATHAM, New York – The New York Army National Guard’s 53rd Troop Command welcomed back a commander during a unit change of command ceremony held Sunday, Dec. 3, 2023, at the National Guard state headquarters.

Brig. Gen. Jack James, who commanded the 53rd Troop Command from 2019 to 2021, took over from Brig. Gen. Joseph Biehler, who replaced James in command in 2021. James had been serving as a deputy division commander for the 42nd Infantry Division.

Biehler has been selected to take command of the 42nd Infantry Division in the coming year.

Biehler, a veteran of deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait, said all credit for his success as a commander of the 53rd belong to the Soldiers of the unit.

“Truth be told, this was an excellent unit when I took command two years ago, and it remains an excellent unit today,” Biehler said. “The leaders and Soldiers made this job incredibly easy for me.”

James is an Army aviator who led the command from 2019-2021 and prior to that, led the 42nd Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade.

According to Maj. Gen. Ray Shields, the adjutant general for New York, who presided over the ceremony, James accepted the assignment without hesitation.

“I’m sure you never expected to be coming back to command the 53rd again,” Shields said to James. “When faced with finding a replacement for Biehler as the commanding general, only one name came to mind – Jack James.”

“I can’t thank you enough for accepting command of the 53rd for a second time so readily, and I know your leadership will ensure success of the 53rd and the New York Army National Guard,” Shields said.

James said that he was anxious to get to work alongside the Soldiers of the 53rd Troop Command again.

“I am grateful for this opportunity to continue to serve our New York National Guard and our fellow Soldiers in this position of responsibility,” James said.

“What an incredible honor – to command American Soldiers. I will not let you down,” James added.

Biehler is expected to take command of the 42nd Infantry Division headquarters in the new year as the unit prepares for mobilization and deployment in 2025 to the Middle East.

“Your experience makes you the ideal person for the role as the next division commander,” Shields said to Biehler. “You are the right leader for this upcoming deployment. It is a big job ahead, but we know that you’re up to it.”

Biehler, a Finance Director for L3 Harris Technologies in Rochester in his civilian career, told the formation of Soldiers that his leadership role with the unit was meaningful to him.

“It has been an honor to lead the 53rd Troop Command,” Biehler said. “There is no comparison in the civilian world than being a commander in an Army unit,” he said."

APPLETON, Wis. - One hundred and five years after the horrific battle that caused his wounds, a Wisconsin National Guard veteran received his Purple Heart medal at a ceremony Nov. 11 at Outagamie County Courthouse.

Pvt. George C. Arts, a member of Company I, 127th Infantry Regiment, was wounded Aug. 4, 1918 during the Second Battle of the Marne. The 32nd Division, composed of Wisconsin National Guard and Michigan National Guard Soldiers, had just arrived from the trenches of Alsace, Germany, to be part of the assault on the heavily fortified town of Fismes.

The 32nd began its advance Aug. 2, 1918, and gained 15 kilometers in two days of fierce fighting. The 127th moved on the town of Fismes on Aug, 4, capturing the town despite suffering horrific losses.

“In those eight days, some of the best German divisions put up a terrific fight to stem the advance,” Lt. Col. Byron Beveridge wrote in his historical sketch of the Wisconsin National Guard.

Capt. Paul Schmidt, commander of Company C of the 127th Infantry, wrote that the Germans spared no effort to make Fismes impregnable.

“Huge stores of ammunition and engines of destruction were located here,” Schmidt said, “and preparations made to withstand the most formidable attack.”

During the bloody fighting that day, Gen. Pairron de Mondesir, commander of the 38th French Corps, observed the American troops in combat against the Germans. When he learned that the 32nd Division had taken all the German strong positions to the north of the Ourcq and had dug in and were holding their ground, he exclaimed, “Oui, Oui, les soldats terrible, tres bien, tres bien!” In English, that translates to “Yes, yes, terrible soldiers, very good, very good!”

The meaning of Mondesir’s use of the word “terrible” is “terrifying” or “formidable,” and his appraisal of the 32nd Division resulted in an official citation giving the division the nom de guerre of Les Terribles. The 32nd Division was the only American division to receive a nickname from an allied nation during the war.

Arts was one of thousands of Division Soldiers wounded in the assault by machine gun fire and gas artillery shells, suffering a fractured left knee and a bullet wound to his right hip. He was hospitalized in Europe for six months. In March 1919, he arrived at Fort Dodge, Iowa, for additional medical treatment. In August 1920, Arts was honorably discharged at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, with a medical rating of poor.

The U.S. military did not issue Purple Hearts at this time for battlefield injuries, but Arts was authorized to wear the American Expeditionary Force wound chevron to indicate he was wounded in combat. After the Purple Heart was reinstated in 1932, wounded veterans of any U.S. military campaign could apply for this award. However, Arts continued to suffer from complications of his wounds and died on Dec. 10, 1928, at the age of 35.

“If George received the wound chevron and sustained such injuries, why did he not receive the Purple Heart?” Kim Craddock of the Fox Valley Veterans Council asked during the Nov. 11 ceremony.

U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher’s office became involved, and after contacting the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, was able to confirm Arts’ eligibility for the Purple Heart medal in less than three weeks.

“Congressman Gallagher and I and the rest of our staff could not be more happy to collaborate and serve in this instance,” said staff member Kerry Niemceke. “The result is a fitting reminder to all in our community of the sacrifice of our veterans and to the sacrifice of the family members who wish to remember them.”

Mike Muthig, Arts’ grandson, said the approval process likely was aided because the family had kept his documents. He said there was always a strong family connection with his grandfather.

“I have always known my middle name was from him, and I've always felt a connection even though I never met him,” Muthig said. “When my mother passed, the name George Cornelius Arts was the last words she spoke on this Earth. And she never knew her father either, because he passed when she was only 17 months old.

“I promised my mother that people would remember the name George Arts,” Muthig continued. “To me the presentation of the award of the Purple Heart to the family was both the fulfilling of a promise and the completion after 105 years of appropriate recognition of extraordinary sacrifice.”

Command Sgt. Maj. Ryan Johnson, the current senior enlisted leader of the 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry Regiment, presented the medal to Muthig at the ceremony. Johnson is also a Purple Heart recipient for wounds suffered during his deployment to Iraq in 2004-05.

“We felt it was fitting, with me being a recipient,” Johnson explained, “as well as being the current command sergeant major for the 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry, which was the battalion Pvt. Arts fought with.”

The Fox Valley Veterans Council also presented the family with a replica of Arts’ wound chevron.

MACAPA, Brazil — Forty-four Soldiers from the New York National Guard, working alongside active-duty Army and Brazilian Army Soldiers, recently concluded three weeks of training in Northern Brazil from Nov. 1 to 16, 2023.

Exercise Southern Vanguard 24 brought Soldiers from the 258th Field Artillery Battalion, 466th Medical Company, Area Support, the 133rd Composite Support Company, the 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment and 138th Public Affairs Detachment to the cities of Belem, Macapa and Oiapoque.

The New York National Guard Soldiers learned how to survive in the Brazilian jungle and participated in and supported tactical operations and training while providing medical support to Soldiers during the exercise.

New York Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Isabel Smith, director of joint staff for the New York National Guard, explained that this training operation helped prepare both countries for rapid deployment and improved readiness in response to crisis or contingency.

“Exercising together allows our armies to increase interoperability and demonstrates a shared commitment,” Smith said.

New York has worked alongside Brazil through the National Guard’s State Partnership Program since 2019, executing bilateral military and civilian engagements in order to increase partner capacity and capability, Smith said.

The New York Guardsmen trained alongside Soldiers from U.S. Army South, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), the 7th Special Forces Group and the 1st Security Forces Assistance Brigade, as well as over 1,000 Brazilian army personnel assigned to Brazil’s 52nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Brigade.

New York Army National Guard Maj. Shelly Respecki, commander of the 466th, said she believed that the opportunity to learn about the jungle from the Brazilian Army was an invaluable experience from a medical perspective.

The unit provided medical support and supply throughout the exercise and treated a variety of injuries such as heat-related illnesses, environmental threats and emergency trauma, Respecki said.

“The course allows our Soldiers to understand what threats and risks are involved with training in the jungle,” said Respecki. “We’ll be better able to treat the participants knowing what they’re going through and how to survive in the jungle if needed to potentially sit on a patient.”

While they learned to operate in a new environment, they found a sense of familiarity in some of their missions as well, the Soldiers said.

Guardsmen from the 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment integrated with the 23rd Jungle Infantry Brigade’s staff section for the duration of the exercise to support operations.

The public affairs Soldiers from the 138th supported media relations in conjunction with Army South counterparts, according to Capt. Stephanie Fernadez, the detachment commander.

The four artillerymen from the 258th Field Artillery, spent a lot of time with Brazilian gunners, according to Capt. Anthony Migliore, the assistant battalion fire support officer for the 258th’s B. Battery.

“I spent most of my time at the gun-line yesterday and it was just like being back at A Battery or B Battery with the 258th,"" Migliore said.

He provided fires planning support for a scenario involving attacks on enemy objectives, during the exercise, Migliore said.

Spc. Myeonghyeon Chang, a water treatment specialist from the 133rd, said she got a lot of experience working in her specialty during the exercise.

“It’s been a really great experience for me, especially since this is my first time being in a Latin American country,” she said.

Chang said she and others from the 133rd provided pure water for both Brazilian and American exercise participants. They also got the change to cross-trained on the 7th Special Forces Group’s water purification equipment.

Ultimately, Southern Vanguard provided Soldiers with more than just training, as they returned to New York having formed new relationships and fresh perspectives, and also got a chance to experience Brazilian culture, the Soldiers said.

“I had a lot of opportunities to learn about their culture, language and how the Brazilian Army works and operates. The food was definitely great too,” Chang said."

JOINT FORCES TRAINING CENTER CAMP SHELBY, Miss. – The 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, conducted annual training between July 23 and Aug. 4, 2023, and participated in Titan Warrior 23.

Titan Warrior 23 is an Army Reserve, multinational, multifunctional, military police exercise with a detention operations focus. The 290th Military Police Brigade, 200th Military Police Command hosted the exercise. Approximately 900 Soldiers participated this year.

The battalion’s training included mobilization and deployment exercises that took the unit from Joint Base San Antonio, Texas, to Camp Shelby, Miss.

Upon arrival at Titan Warrior, Soldiers conducted interrogations and debriefings at a newly established expeditionary Joint Interrogation Debriefing Center. The battalion staff also rehearsed interfaces required to operate alongside military police units conducting detention operations missions.

The 304th and 160th Military Police Battalions, 290th Military Police Brigade, 200th Military Police Command operated Camp Bobcat, a simulated theater detention facility, while other units established detainee holding areas. There military intelligence Soldiers supported screening, questioning and interrogations of role players. Rehearsing shared custody and control of detainees is a critical skill.

Soldiers and officers from the 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion, 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command, participated in simulated interrogation operations and worked alongside the 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation) within the Joint Interrogation Debriefing Center.

U.S. Army Capt. Victoria Martin, assigned to the 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion, said that the training was well-planned and enhanced their comprehension of interrogation operations. “The training reinforced our understanding of JIDC operations and brought our home station training into perspective,” said Martin.

The training provided context to military intelligence task training previously conducted at home-station. Interrogators divided into shifts, which added realism. Contracted role players received intensive and detailed instruction that provided necessary cues during interrogations. Each session ended after Soldiers received feedback from role players and observer controller-trainers.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), through its Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) initiative, contributed an artificial intelligence surveillance system to oversee and manage detainees during Titan Warrior 23. This collaboration offered valuable insight into the integration of artificial intelligence within current detainee operations and intelligence doctrine.

URSA cameras and sensors mounted to robots, patrolled the camp exterior and monitored role player interactions. Military intelligence Soldiers and the military police were then able to glean valuable information regarding interpersonal associations inside of a detention facility. This cutting-edge AI solution supports possible modernization priorities within multiple fields.

Military intelligence Soldiers also received opportunities to train alongside soldiers from Canada and Belgium. The multinational contingent participated in detention facility operations.

U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Tenay Benes, battalion commander of the 338th Military Intelligence Battalion, said, ""The opportunity to test our screening, interrogation, debriefing, and interviewing tactics with our military police partners has proven to be invaluable. As a result of this exercise, we have discovered opportunities for increased collaboration and better coordination.” Benes elaborated, “We've also had a lot of Army fun here - riding helicopters, working with detainees, and playing with robots!""

The 338th Military Intelligence Battalion (Interrogation) is a deployable interrogation battalion assigned to the Military Intelligence Readiness Command’s Interrogation Group. The unit is headquartered in San Antonio Texas."

MARIETTA, Ga. - More than 80 Soldiers of the Georgia National Guard’s 201st Regional Support Group Forward returned home Dec. 1 after a nearly year-long deployment to Europe. Soldiers and family members were reunited during a welcome home ceremony at the Clay National Guard Center in Marietta.

“You represent the very best of our nation,” said Maj. Gen. Dwayne Wilson, commander of the Georgia Army National Guard. “All of you have performed in an exceptional manner over the last 10 months.”

During their deployment, the Soldiers of the 201st RSG supported base operations for more than 60,000 personnel at multiple stations throughout Europe. Their mobilization was part of a rotation of U.S. military forces that conduct multinational training and operations with allies to build regional security.

“You had a very challenging mission and a very unique mission, providing support to nine forward operating sites across four countries … delivering unparalleled support to U.S. and NATO forces,” said Wilson. “Our forces in Europe are more capable because of you, and our world is safer because of you.”

The 201st RSG comprises a diverse group of units with specialty response missions, supporting overseas combat and domestic emergency response operations.

The 201st RSG has deployed units and personnel multiple times since its 2004 organization. Soldiers of the 201st mobilized to Afghanistan from 2011-2012 and 2013-2014. In 2018, Soldiers of the 201st mobilized to Iraq, serving as base operating support integrator for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve. Subordinate units of the 201st RSG have also supported operations in Korea and Egypt.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, more than 30,000 Citizen-Soldiers and Citizen-Airmen of the Georgia National Guard have deployed to support overseas missions.

During the week, the command teams from both USAG-Italy and SETAF-AF spoke to course participants about the importance of being a leader in the U.S. Army, and provide advice and tips on leadership they learned throughout their years in command positions. Soldiers were given guidance about how to better prepare and develop as leaders at the company level.

“One of the main benefits I think that the leaders will walk away from is the collaboration and networking,” says 1st Sgt. James Barton, SETAF-AF, “All the leaders in this course have vast amounts of knowledge and through discussions we can all walk away from those lessons learned.”

Topics for the course included how to establish and maintain a positive command climate, maintain good order and discipline within Soldiers, health promotion and family programs. Subject matter experts from Army programs briefed course participants on the facilities and programs available to them and their Soldiers.

KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany – Thanksgiving Day marks the beginning of the Holiday Season for many of us, presenting multiple occasions to indulge in exquisite meals and enjoy plenty of extra relaxing time.

As the new year approaches, conversations about ""new year's resolutions"" commonly revolve around fitness goals, leading many individuals to consider gym memberships. This surge typically results in a significant increase in gym memberships during the initial months of the year, often leading to overcrowding as people strive to improve their fitness, shed weight, or embark on a healthier lifestyle journey.

Recently, the U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz announced 24/7 access for most of its fitness centers, expanding availability to all employees within the footprint. This initiative ensures that the facilities will remain open and available at all times, regardless of holidays, weekends, or the time of day, providing greater flexibility and convenience to individuals seeking to prioritize their health and wellness.

“Providing 24/7 access benefits the Army as a whole because it supports readiness and enhances service delivery without mounting costs,” said Daniel Washington, fitness, athletics, and aquatics chief.

The first Physical Fitness Centers (PFC) to start offering 24/7 access were the Landstuhl Fitness Center and the Mountaineer Gym in Baumholder in June 2019, added Washington.

Of the seven Army fitness centers within the USAG Rheinland-Pfalz’s footprint, three more now offer unstaffed PFC access: Rhine Ordnance Barracks, Kleber Kaserne, and Sembach.

Washington said that, since 2019, almost 14,000 passes have been processed.

“Our night owls and shift workers are the ones who benefit the most from being able to access the gyms after hours,” he said.

While some people prefer to work out in the evenings or early mornings to avoid large crowds during the busier daytime or afternoon hours, others have work schedules that make it virtually impossible for them to work out during traditional gym hours.

Police officers, firefighters, medical professionals, and retail employees represent a few of the occupations that frequently operate on rotating shift schedules. Because of time constraints (before or after their shift) some might try to rush through a workout, increasing their risk of getting injured. Having 24/7 PFC access provides them with a safe environment to relieve the stress from their jobs while accommodating their own lifestyle.

Kirk Lambiotte, information technology specialist for the 102d Signal Battalion, 2d Signal Brigade in Baumholder, said that having a gym that offers extended hours gives him and his wife the opportunity to spend some quality time together.

“We love to work out together, but with both of us having day shifts and working at different locations, we never get the chance to do that during regular gym hours,” said Lambiotte. “Now we have the option to exercise together either in the evening or on weekends, and that is great!”

All current authorized patrons over the age of 18 (or 17 if Active Duty) can be granted access to PFCs during unstaffed hours. Personnel need to register their Common Access Card (CAC)/ ID card through the front office of the fitness center of choice, and then sign a Statement of Understanding, Release of Liability, Assumption of Risk Form, and receive a brief orientation on safety policies and procedures. Violation of the signed agreement could result in the loss of 24/7 access privileges and subject the patron to further discipline.

Younger patrons (12 and older) can also use the facilities as long as they are always accompanied by their parents and after receiving the safety orientation. Because the PFC does not provide supervision or assistance on using the facilities and equipment after normal hours, patrons are expected to conduct themselves responsibly and to assess potential risks before engaging in any activity that could cause personal injury.

“To date, the feedback we received from patrons concerning 24/7 access has been mostly positive,” said Washington. “They love it!”

He highlighted that the primary challenge lies in ensuring the smooth operation of the necessary automation systems.

“I must applaud our IT team; they have been on it!” Washington said. “Ensuring the smooth functioning of automation systems require careful attention and proactive management. We have been lucky to have a well-trained team dedicated to making sure our patrons are taken care of.”"

BAUMHOLDER, Germany — The 16th Sustainment Brigade ""Knight's Brigade"" held a Change of Responsibility ceremony at the Hall of Champions, Smith Barracks on Nov. 27. Soldiers, families, friends, partners, and host nation partners bid farewell to Command Sgt. Maj. Amador Aguillen Jr., and welcomed Command Sgt. Maj. Jason P. Towns.

Aguillen served as the Knight's Brigade senior enlisted advisor from Nov. 10, 2021 to Nov. 27, 2023. During his tenure, the brigade units under his command supported exercises such as Operation Allies Welcome, Atlantic Resolve and Defender Europe 22 and 23. Through his leadership, the brigade traveled approximately seven million miles, executed 10,000 missions throughout the European footprint, conducted the Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration for more than 16,000 personnel and 7,000 pieces of equipment, and fostered interoperability with allies and partners.

Command Sgt. Maj. Jason P. Towns, previously served as Battalion Command Sgt. Maj. for 2-410 Brigade Support Battalion, 177th Armored Brigade located at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. Towns has also served as Battalion Command Sgt. Maj. for the 3d Special Forces Group Support Battalion.

In keeping with military traditions, the passing of the colors was conducted during the ceremony. The passing of the colors represents not only the unit's lineage and honor but also the Soldiers' loyalty and unity.

The custodian of the colors during the ceremony was Sgt. Maj. Tatika Williams, operations Sgt. Maj., 16th SB. Williams passed the colors to Aguillen, signifying her last act of allegiance to the outgoing senior enlisted advisor. Aguillen passed the colors to Col. Alexander, commander, 16th SB, signifying the return of the responsibility that was entrusted upon him. Alexander then passed the colors to Towns, demonstrating his confidence in his ability to handle command responsibility. Towns passed the colors back to Williams, completing the traditional passing of the unit colors to demonstrate his first act as the 16th Sustainment Brigade senior enlisted advisor.

Although Aguillen's time with the 16th Sustainment Brigade has come to an end, he knows he will never forget his time served and those he served with.

Alexander, the host during the ceremony, spoke a few parting words to Aguillen.

""Everywhere you go, your reputation will precede you,” said Alexander. “The Officers and Soldiers of the organization will stive to emulate you, because no matter where you serve, you make units and people better.""

When talking about his time as Knight's Brigade senior enlisted advisor and what it meant to him to serve the brigade, Aguillen quoted Matthew Kelly- “The people we surround ourselves with either raise or lower our standards. They either help us to become the best version of ourselves or encourage us to become lesser versions of ourselves.”

""This is what this brigade has done,” said Aguillen. “They challenged me to be the best professional version of myself and I thank you.”"

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – The first-ever Okinawa Care for Caregivers Symposium was recently held at Torii Station to better inform those who help others of the self-care resources available to them.

The symposium, which the 10th Support Group’s unit ministry team hosted, focused on providing self-care tools to Army, Navy and Air Force religious support teams, while allowing them to collaborate with various enablers on Okinawa and discuss ideas on how to stay resilient.

“This joint and interoperability effort enhances readiness by equipping our UMTs and enablers to connect our Soldiers to the valuable resources in the community,” said Chaplain (Maj.) Neal Muasa, the lead organizer.

About 25 individuals participated in the event, including Col. J.P. Smith, command chaplain for U.S. Army Japan, and Lt. Col. Damon Saxton, chaplain for U.S. Army Garrison Japan.

Smith said a similar event may be held at Camp Zama in the future to ensure its community of enablers can come together.

“We always take care of Soldiers, and we always take care of families, but what do we do to take care of ourselves?” he said. “If we’re not taking care of ourselves, we’re going to be in a position where we’re burned out, we’re tired and we’re not able to give Soldiers our best.”

In the recent event, which took place Oct. 24 through 27, Saxton conducted training and led an interbranch, multidiscipline panel discussion on self-care for helping professionals.

Saxton, who previously served in a special operations unit, said the topic was very close to him, as caregivers can sometimes endure trauma vicariously when they see or hear the effects of it.

“I had heard some really tough things and had a couple of guys that had taken their own lives because of some of the experiences that they had,” he said. “And it was really hard, and I had to seek help from another caregiver to kind of get me back in the fight.”

By sharing his own story, Saxton hoped to convince others to seek assistance when needed.

“I wanted to make sure that everybody there, as they experience these challenging situations that we do in the field of caregiving, that they take care of themselves and each other,” he said.

Saxton said he appreciated how the UMTs on Okinawa brought everyone together for the event, which also had a kayaking physical training session led by the 1st Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group chaplain and a devotional by the 78th Signal Battalion chaplain.

The symposium concluded with remarks by the 10th SG commander, followed by a visit to the historic Hacksaw Ridge during a tour of Battle of Okinawa sites.

“These are all different units, but they all take care of each other,” Saxton said. “I think every time that we get the opportunity to work together, to see each other’s strengths, [being able] to build those relationships is absolutely key.”

Throughout the event, Smith said UMTs shared best practices for self-care and interacted with each other and with military and family life counselors, behavioral health specialists and other enablers in the area.

“We were able to basically learn from one another,” he said. “If you’re operating in isolation, you’re only understanding one perspective. We were able to hear from multiple perspectives, so when we walk away, we walk away with new tools on how to better care for ourselves.”

One of the lessons learned that was discussed was using a journal to take time to intentionally reflect on one’s work being accomplished.

“As long as we know that we are being value-added and we’re making a difference, it kind of keeps you energized,” Smith said. “But you’ve got to reflect on that, because otherwise we’re just on the go. We have to slow it down every now and then and process through the difference that it is actually making.”

Smith also suggested having breaks throughout the workday to reduce stress. He said he may take three to four short breaks, in addition to a lunch break, to walk around, breathe and relax.

“It’s all about staying sharp,” he said. “You’d be surprised at how well you will end up being when you do certain things like that [and] put certain mechanisms in place for yourself to where you stay sharp.”

SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Soldiers with the 509th Strategic Signal Battalion, 2nd Theater Signal Brigade were the first in history to facilitate en route mission command outside of the U.S. while in-flight with Stryker vehicles as a tactical command post aboard a military aircraft, which kicked off the U.S. Army Europe and Africa exercise, Brave Partner, Dec. 1 at Skopje International Airport.

Brave Partner is a “short notice action planning exercise” that aims to enhance regional partnerships and increase U.S. force readiness and interoperability in a realistic, multinational training environment, including roughly 180 U.S. Soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment with support from 30 service members from the Army of the Republic of North Macedonia, Dec. 1-10, 2023 at Skopje International Airport and Krivolak Training Area, North Macedonia.

“I find it exceptionally phenomenal to have the opportunity to field equipment and work with partner units as well as partner nations,” said Capt. Shenelle Stallings, 509th SSB Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment commander. “The cohesion and the trust we’re building with one another — because I’m from the 509th, and we’re providing comms for 2CR, and we’re in North Macedonia — so all those pieces coming together and seeing how these things work makes it all the more worthwhile.”

Stallings said her team is making history by validating en route mission command that’s first-of-its-kind on a strategic network, and they’re setting a foundation and building it from the ground up in their area of operation. They achieved excellent signal speeds that exceeded their expectations with minimal latency. They faced snow and heavy clouds, which had the potential to degrade signal transmissions. She explained that taxiing and takeoff were the most important parts of the test while transitioning between equipment from ground to air, and that was also successful.

“I was on a video chat the entire time, and it was crystal clear,” said Stallings. “We use the Voyager 8 and the KAFMA antenna that allows us to reach back to our strategic network in Italy, and then we’re also able to come here with our Starlink and transition to that seamlessly.”

One of Stallings’ Soldiers, Cpl. Deandra Winston, is an expert on communications equipment and prefers the Voyager 8 transit case to bulkier equipment she’s used in the past. She explained that tactical signal equipment is becoming increasingly innovative and mobile. Being able to connect users without waiting for equipment to be set up on ground is key.

“It will create an ease of understanding between troops that are coming and going and a faster understanding of the mission that needs to be executed,” said Winston. “New technology comes out every day, and it’s best to not be scared to try new tech. Everything takes time, and I understand that, but it’s time to get rid of the old and use the new.”

As part of USAREUR-AF’s Tactical Mission Data Platform, 2CR’s Stryker vehicles were a command post aboard a C-17 aircraft, demonstrating innovation and speed in exchanging information between commanders en route in the sky and warfighters on the battlefield.

As this initial event for Brave Partner took place, the charter plane carrying a majority of the 2CR Soldiers was also arriving at Skopje International Airport.

Army of the Republic of North Macedonia Sgt. Maj. Igor Petrovski, airport liaison officer, was on-site and coordinated the C-17’s arrival as well as the charter plane’s arrival that carried most Soldiers who arrived for Brave Partner. He has a wealth of experience facilitating flights for NATO partners, including C-17s, C-130s and charter flights for the U.S.

The Republic of North Macedonia has a partnership with the Vermont National Guard, and Petrovski explained that his country’s military hosts international exercises with NATO countries, including the U.S. Army and especially the Vermont National Guard.

“We are brothers in arms with the Vermont National Guard,” said Petrovski. “The partnership is leveled up year by year.”

Army of the Republic of North Macedonia Lt. Col. Vladimir Cvetkovski, chief of the Host Nation Support Coordination Center, explained that North Macedonia is new to NATO with three years of membership, but they’ve taken many steps to maintain standards, and they are committed to training with the U.S. as well as keeping good relations with all of NATO.

“The U.S. is our strategic partner,” said Cvetkovski. “We have very good support from the U.S.”

A majority of Brave Partner is scheduled to involve live-fire ranges for 2CR Soldiers to train with Stryker armored fighting vehicles. Cvetkovski explained that Krivolak Training Area has the best terrain and facilities for that type of training. He said the training area accommodates a variety of military vehicles, aircraft and munitions.

“We have a very good training area here,” said Cvetkovski. “KTA is in the top 3 of all training areas in all of Europe.”"

STUTTGART, Germany - U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Steven Basham, U.S. European Command deputy commander, hosted Arnold Kammel, secretary general of the Austrian Ministry of Defense, and his staff at the command’s headquarters Nov. 30.

The meeting, aimed at identifying areas for future military cooperation, builds on a broadening relationship after Austria and the Vermont National Guard formalized their partnership under the State Partnership Program in 2022.

“Today’s meeting was another important step toward strengthening our relationship with a longstanding partner in Austria,” said Basham. “Our strategic partnership with Austria already includes cooperation for military mobility, information exchanges and military-to-military engagements through the State Partnership Program. We look forward to furthering our mutual commitment to realize a shared vision for European security.”

The two nations’ military-to-military engagement has steadily increased since the SPP partnership, including an air exchange in June in which the Vermont Air National Guard flew F-35s alongside Austrian Eurofighter Typhoons at Hinterstoisser Air Base near Zeltweg, Austria.

“Relations with the USA are of particular importance to Austria. The deepening of the strategic partnership with the USA, anchored in the Austrian government program and the growing State Partnership Program, underline this fact,” said Kammel. “As one of the key players in global security and defense policy, the USA is also relevant for Austria in other areas. Today’s talks mark a further point in the strengthening of joint cooperation.”

Cooperation between the United States and Austria has also included participation in the European Union’s Permanent Structured Cooperation program, enabling the movement of military personnel and assets within EU borders. That intra-European movement is pivotal to the U.S. ability to conduct military exercises and operations.

The State Partnership Program pairs National Guard units with allied and partner militaries to facilitate cooperation across all aspects of international civil-military affairs. The program has been successfully building relations for 30 years and now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe.

WASHINGTON — For the second straight year, first lady Jill Biden welcomed National Guardsmen, spouses and children to the White House to discuss their challenges and how best to support them.

The first lady heard stories of the pride and resilience children show in the face of frequent calls for their Guard parents to serve their nation, state and community.

“Our National Guardsmen and women have to be ready to go on support missions at a moment’s notice,” she told them. “And that means that their kids — all of you — know what it’s like to have your mom or your dad missing at the dinner table every time they’re called to duty.

“And you do it with humility and honor,” she said. “I want you to know that my husband, President Biden, and I are so grateful and so proud of all of you. We know it isn’t easy.”

Since 9/11, more than 1 million Guardsmen have deployed in support of operations around the globe. Because the National Guard is the combat reserve of the Army and Air Force, its members are trained and equipped to help with first-response efforts at home during a crisis.

Today, the Guard stands at more than 430,000 members strong. As the second largest military organization in the Department of Defense, its mission, motto and promise to America is to be Always Ready, Always There.

The National Guard is in about 2,800 communities — almost every ZIP code. Most Guardsmen serve part-time and balance their service with civilian careers and family responsibilities.

Kelly Hokanson, the National Guard senior spouse and mother of three service members, told the group that growing up as a military child is a sacrifice and a gift. Kelly’s husband, Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, is the 29th chief of the National Guard Bureau.

Gen. Hokanson has served in duty stations across the United States and deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.

“It’s a sacrifice of time with your family — a sacrifice every member of our community shares,” Kelly Hokanson said. “But it’s also a gift. A gift of compassion, service and unfathomable strength and resilience.”

Caleb Greico, 14, a New Jersey native, attended the event with his parents and sister, Penelope. He introduced Jill Biden to the group, a responsibility he relished.

“Thank you for inviting me and my family to the White House,” Caleb told her. “We are very honored to be here with you.

“It’s not just my family, but everyone here has a family member that has been contributing to this country.”

Caleb’s mom, Army Spc. Laura Greico, a signal support systems specialist assigned to Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 113th Infantry Regiment, 44th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, New Jersey National Guard, is preparing to deploy with her unit.

Caleb asked other children for advice on how to cope with a parent being gone for an extended time. Staying active and connected in community circles were common themes from those whose parents have deployed or been away for long durations.

“Focus on the stuff you enjoy and work on yourself,” said Aiden Buckner, 14, from New Mexico.

Aiden’s dad, Air Force Capt. Thomas Buckner, is the deputy commander of the New Mexico Guard’s 150th Civil Engineering Squadron.

“Try your best to work and focus on your goals,” Aiden said.

Eight-year-old Marina Munyabuhoro immigrated to America from a refugee camp in East Africa with her parents when she was 11 months old. Her father, Airman 1st Class Theogene Munyabuhoro, joined the New Hampshire National Guard and became an American citizen.

Marina told the first lady she wants to serve in the military “to honor my father’s legacy and to be a symbol of hope … and a good example to other immigrant kids.

And to protect and defend this blessed country.”

The president and first lady are familiar with National Guard service: their son, the late Army Maj. Beau Biden, served in the Delaware Guard, leaving behind his children to deploy on a tour in Iraq. It’s part of why Jill Biden helped establish Joining Forces to support service members, veterans and those they hold most dear.

She encouraged the children in attendance to share with their teachers, coaches and influential people in their lives that their parents serve.

“As a teacher, I ask my class, ‘Is anybody here militarily connected and what are your connections?’” she said. “That helps me to understand that they might be going through a rough patch or might be absent for a day.”

Guard leaders and families — more than 200 representing 36 states and territories — attended the event, which included a holiday presentation and the first lady’s unveiling of the 2023 White House “Magic, Wonder & Joy” holiday theme and decorations.

“We are grateful for everyone’s support of our National Guard families and especially of the children who are central to so many of our members’ lives and service,” Gen. Hokanson said. “We could not do what we do without the support of our families.”

VICENZA, Italy - In an effort to strengthen partnership and promote stability across the African continent, U.S. Army Reserve Civil Affairs Soldiers have embarked on a series of nine-month rotations, deploying in support of U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), to execute vital missions.

Civil Affairs Soldiers, often referred to as the ""bridge builders"" of the U.S. Army, play a crucial role in facilitating communication and cooperation between military forces and local communities. Their missions span a wide range of activities, from humanitarian assistance to civil-military projects. These skilled individuals serve as liaisons between the SETAF-AF and African partners, ultimately fostering goodwill and mutual understanding.

“We are a collection of Soldiers from across America, brought together to do this very important mission,” said Capt. Cody Miller, officer-in-charge of the SETAF-AF forward-deployed Civil-Military Operations Center. “Our companies are broken up into several small, 4-6 Soldier teams deployed throughout the continent of Africa. These teams interface directly with the civilian populations with the goal of strengthening partnerships.”

SETAF-AF provides U.S. Africa Command and U.S. Army Europe & Africa a dedicated headquarters to synchronize Army activities in Africa and scalable crisis response options throughout Africa and Europe. A key component to their success is to employ the experience and versatility of Army Reserve and Army National Guard units to execute missions across the African continent.

During their deployments, the civil affairs Soldiers assigned to SETAF-AF are actively engaged in African communities. They collaborate with local authorities, non-governmental organizations, and international partners to address critical issues. Such projects may include improving healthcare infrastructure, supporting educational initiatives, or aiding in disaster relief efforts. By doing so, they not only provide immediate relief, but also help communities become more self-sufficient and resilient in the long term.

""Africa is a continent of incredible diversity, and every country’s mission set is a unique challenge. I've seen firsthand how our work benefits African partners. It's about mutual respect and understanding, and when we can help a community achieve its goals, it's an incredible feeling,"" said Capt. Dominique Mosbly, SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Team 21 chief.

The majority of the U.S. Army’s civil affairs capability exists within the Army Reserve. These Soldiers serve part-time, typically one weekend a month and two-weeks a year. When not in an Army uniform, they work as police officers, business professionals, medical providers and school teachers, among many other professions. The SETAF-AF civil affairs teams harness these civilian expertise and skill sets to execute the mission.

""We employ a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach in our efforts to increase the region's security and stability. We integrate multiple host nation, US, and international partners into our work, which includes countering violent extremist organizations and helping build host nation institutional capacity,” said Maj. Jacqueline Li, Bravo Company Commander for the SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Battalion.

“As Army Reservists, the SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Soldiers bring a wealth of knowledge and experience from their civilian backgrounds that greatly assists them in their missions. This deployment is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and the Soldiers of Bravo Company are honored to be working with our West African partners,"" added Li.

Lt. Col. James A. Favuzzi, SETAF-AF Civil Affairs Battalion commander, provides guidance and oversight to the many civil affairs teams operating in Africa. For Favuzzi, the importance of these missions cannot be understated.

""Our Soldiers play a pivotal role in the effective execution of SETAF-AF activities. Their interaction with African partners, as well as the information they provide on civilian populations on the continent significantly contributes to our African strategy,” Favuzzi said.

SETAF-AF civil affairs Soldiers conduct multiple missions on the African continent each year, executing numerous civil-military events in support of the SETAF-AF mission to build capacity and strengthen relationships with African partners.

56,Spiritual empowerment: sisters-in-arms help Native American Soldier overcome tragedy,https://www.army.mil/article/272045/spiritual_empowerment_sisters_in_arms_help_native_american_soldier_overcome_tragedy,"Keshon Smith, right, a member of the Native American Women Warriors and Army veteran carries the U.S. flag while Carrie Lewis, also an NAWW member and a Marine Corps veteran, holds the POW-MIA flag during the National American Indian Heritage Month observance at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, on Nov. 13, 2019.



Smith survived an improvised explosive device attack during a deployment to Iraq in November 2004 and battled post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury throughout her career.



She said joining the Native American Women Warriors organization helped her gain the strength to seek medical help. She is now the NAWW president.



The NAWW are an all-female group of Native American veterans who started as a color guard but have since grown and branched out as advocates for Native American women veterans in areas such as health, education and employment. The members make appearances at various events around the country, serving as motivational and keynote speakers, performing tribal dances, and fulfilling the role of color guard representing all branches of the U.S. military.

As she lay inside the windowless barracks, the explosion that killed one of her closest friends haunted Keshon Barton.

She​ struggled with simple things; walking to the motor pool, working on vehicles, sleeping at night.

Keshon’s thoughts drifted to her life on the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation in Nevada. The private first class imagined seeing her close-knit Paiute community once again; and her family riding horses on the ​dry​, rocky Nevada grasslands.

For the second half of a yearlong deployment to Iraq, her unit had moved to the remote Camp Speicher, 100 miles north of Baghdad. There, the Soldier’s platoon provided support for​ supply runs in and out of the airfield. They'd escort workers onto the camp and provide security.

On Nov. 16, 2004, as​ Keshon’s vehicle convoy crossed northern Iraq, hidden enemy forces attacked her vehicle in an improvised explosive roadside attack.

Keshon survived, but a​​ part of her did not. ​

​She spent the last four months of the deployment coping with survivor’s guilt over the loss of her fallen friend and post-traumatic stress disorder.

A month after the attack, reality hit the ​private first class again. She learned that her​ best friend, a female Soldier, had been hit by an IED attack, leaving shrapnel in her friend’s leg and ​​injuring her foot. When​​ Keshon heard her friend’s call sign on the radio, she immediately rushed to the perimeter gate to meet her friend’s vehicle.

She couldn’t bear to lose another friend.

Keshon still struggled to process the loss that shattered the innocence of a private entering her first brush with war.

“[PTSD] was just eating me alive,” said Keshon, now a retired sergeant first class and president of the Native American Women Warriors. “It was probably the hardest thing I had to face in the military.”

She remained by the Soldier’s bedside until the day the Army flew her back to the states.​ ​Her symptoms, however, became so unbearable that her commander moved her to the unit’s command post and then assigned her to perimeter security.

​​￼​There, the Soldier reflected on the rocky, dry desert land that reminded her of her tribal homelands. The forward operating base sat in a part of Iraq far from a large city or civilization. It took her away from the terrible unknown she had grown to fear.

The thought brought Keshon comfort.

One with the Earth

​​​Growing up on the reservation in northern Nevada, her people’s faith fostered her love of natural things -- things connected to the earth; the crops on her family’s farm, the cows and dogs, the rolling desert hills. Keshon learned what Native Americans call the “circle of life,;” which depicts the continuous cycle of life and death and the paths of the sun and moon.

​​​Born to a Paiute-Shoshone mother and Irish American father, Keshon had lived on the reservation for most of her life until her Army enlistment in 2003. Her aunts and extended family’s houses all sat within walking distance from her parents’ home. She grew up going to radios and riding calves.

Before that 2003 deployment, Keshon returned to​​ the Nevada reservation to spend time with family.​

​A tribal chief performed a ceremonial blessing before she left on her journey to the Middle East.

“You’re never alone,” ​Keshon recalled the chief saying. “This is our Mother Earth.”

​​​The Northern Paiutes, known as ranchers, traditionally lived in the Great Basin in eastern California, western Nevada, and southeast Oregon.

Keshon said she kept the ways of her people close to her heart as she embarked on a year-long deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. She brought a medicine pouch that she wore around her neck for protection.

Now retired Sgt. 1st Class Keshon Smith battled post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury during her 20-year Army career. She finally found healing when the Soldier joined the Native American Women Warriors organization which provides a place where Native women who served in the armed forces can meet and support one another.

Changed forever

That November in 2004, ,​Keshon’s convoy embarked on a solitary desert road under a clear November sky.

That day began like any other with​ Keshon and Ricky carried on their usual morning banter. The Soldiers met in Schofield Barracks, an Army installation settled on the northern side of Oahu, Hawaii. ​

​Ricky a 21-year-old Hispanic-American from the Los Angeles area, impressed his fellow Soldiers with his artistic wizardry with his penciled designs of Aztec and Mexican culture.

​Keshon and Ricky bonded over their love of movies and Maroon 5 music. An ​outgoing Soldier, he’d welcome anyone to play cards and dominos in his barracks room.

​​The Soldiers’ armored truck had reached the final leg of their destination that morning as they cruised along the remote path. They didn’t see any structure or building as they made their way through the northern Iraqi desert.

​​Smith didn’t hear the projectile coming.

“The last thing I remember was talking to​ Ricky,” she said. “And then all of a sudden, everything was black. I felt like I was in a dream.”

An IED blasted Keshon’s truck, forming a crater in the center of the vehicle.

​​Her vehicle disappeared into a plume of dark smoke. ​The second gun truck, manned by Keshon’s boyfriend Charles, drive through the cloud to reach the survivors.

​​Keshon woke covered in blood and pinned to her seat. She couldn’t hear anything except the loud ringing in her ears.

The impact of the blast bended the truck’s cabin. She struggled to regain her bearings to make sense of what happened. “Get out of the truck!” she heard a fellow Soldier say through the smoke.

Keshon could barely decipher the chaos around her.

But she heard the muffled sounds of more rounds and the faint screams of fellow Soldiers. As he grabbed her rifle, the enemy continued to attack her platoon, but she couldn’t see where the enemy fired from.

She briefly remembers seeing ​Charles checking on her. ​

​Charles later said he quickly realized that the blood that covered his girlfriend wasn’t hers.

​Then they saw Ricky.

They found him in the back of the truck and immediately knew.

The impact of the blast killed him instantly. But Keshon and her fellow Soldiers did not have time to process their friend’s death, as the enemy continued to attack.

After the survivors climbed into one of the functioning vehicles, she rushed to the next truck on her convoy to a Soldier who suffered an injury to his face.​

​ Keshon fumbled through her first aid kid to stop the bleeding. She continued to wrap the Soldier’s wounds while applying pressure.

​With the enemy continuing to attack, Keshon sat in the back of the truck silently with a blank stare.

​​​She saw a small purple bruise near her knee. Besides that wound, Keshon thought she escaped the blast unscathed.

She hadn’t.​

​ Keshon would see the aftermath of the blast replaying over and over in her mind. She wondered why she had been spared. ”Why me?” she asked herself.

“The average person was not supposed to see what we’ve seen that day, you know?” said ​Charles. “And you never, ever forget about that stuff. It never leaves our head.”

Aftermath

Hours after the blast, ​Keshon still felt anxious and on edge. In the days that followed, the Soldier found she couldn’t return to her duties as a truck driver. Initially, her company commander moved her to the gunner spot of her vehicle, but​ she couldn’t bear it.

The pain had not yet subsided. She could still feel the heat of the truck’s flames. She thought of​ Ricky often.​

Then-Pfc. Keshon Barton and her future husband, then-Spc. Charles Smith during their 2004 deployment to northern Iraq.

After returning to Camp Speicher​ Keshon and other members of her unit held a memorial for ​Ricky. Keshon performed a Paiute ceremony by burning cedar from her medicine pouch. Each Soldier said a prayer for their fallen friend.

​When Keshon returned home, she and Charles wed four months later in Oahu. The memories of that November morning still lingered within her. She learned that Charles, too suffered from PTSD after the attack.

​​Keshon couldn’t bear loud noises and feared large gatherings. Charles said his soft-spoken wife grew more withdrawn.

“I couldn't go out without … just feeling like I was about to be attacked,” she said. “Or that I might run over something, you know, I just, I was a mess.”

Along with PTSD,​ Keshon would later be diagnosed with traumatic brain injury.

​Keshon Smith admitted she did not seek counseling or professional help at the time. Her life moved quickly. The couple went on to have four children, two boys and two girls. She would go on to five more duty stations and reach the rank of​ sergeant first class.

“As Soldiers we kind of compartmentalize and don’t seek help until it’s too late,” her now-husband ​Charles said.

Keshon, however didn’t let the panic attacks deter her career. ​She even earned an invite to the prestigious Sergeant Audie Murphy Award or SAMA, an honor reserved for the top performing non-commissioned officers who demonstrated exemplary leadership. She led her Soldiers by example, using her actions to teach the finer points of vehicle maintenance rather than words. “She was a high-speed Soldier,” her husband, Charles said.

Keshon kept her inner turmoil within. She would hide her panic attacks​ from her children and fellow Soldiers.

“I would just be so uptight and so wound up over everything,” she said. “I would have road rage. I was always in a hurry.”

Finding inner strength

In 2011, Keshon ​learned of a new organization founded by Native American women who served in the military, the Native American Women Warriors Association. She emailed the founder, ​ ​Mitchelene BigMan, a retired sergeant first class who started an all-female color guard.

After enduring discrimination and sexual assault, BigMan formed an all-native women’s color guard to give American Indian female veterans a support network and the opportunity to perform spiritual ceremony.

​Keshon decided to apply for membership and wrote an essay describing how BigMan’s stories of survival had moved her. The writing brought BigMan to tears.

Keshon liked the idea of reminding the nation of native people’s ways, and restoring cultures that have slowly faded from the national consciousness.

From BigMan, Keshon learned the jingle dance of the Ojibwe Nation. During the performance, the dancers wear jingles and make noises that resemble the sound of raindrops. The noises and movements act as remedy for those afflicted by physical or mental illness. The Soldier found the dance therapeutic during her performances. ​She also became more in touch with her people.

Keshon said participation in the NAWW helped her reconnect with her own culture and heritage, and share her tribe’s teachings with her family and children.

“I was able to lean on my faith,” Keshon said. “I was able to be very spiritual and healing … I was able to just give back to my community and really, show the respect to the elders and those that had taught me our ways.”

Although NAWW members hailed from different background and indigenous tribes, Keshon found comfort in meeting with other women who shared similar combat experiences. She became more involved in the organization during her last two years in the Army, and attended Powwows and special events.

​​​She proudly wore her people’s colorful traditional garments of breechcloth sewn from sagebrush bark.

“She became more outgoing and talkative,” Charles said. “She’s became way more connected with her culture.”

Keshon and the NAWW even performed a virtual ceremonial dance during the inauguration of President Biden. The NAWW become the nation’s first-ever color guard comprised of Native American women.

​When the symptoms of PTSD became too much to bear, Keshon would call BigMan and the women of NAWW. BigMan, too suffered from PTSD and the women would share experiences through Zoom meetings and texts. They’ve laughed and shed tears. They learn about their cultural differences.

“[NAWW] is a comfortable place to share personal things like that without judgment and without fear,” Keshon said.

Shortly after, Keshon finally made an appointment to seek professional help while stationed in Germany. She then admittedly took a break from therapy thinking she could manage her symptoms.

The Nevada native didn’t fully come to grips with her grief however, until she took an assignment at Fort Moore, Georgia.​​ A 2022 talk with her then-16-year old son, Jaden. One afternoon, while sitting on the front porch of the family’s Columbus, Georgia home she sat with Jaden. A part of the outpatient program required her to connect with a family member about her mental health struggles.

“My son and I had a tremendous breakthrough, to where he was able to tell me my trauma, made me not be the best version of myself,” Keshon said. “My children were able to tell me how my PTSD was affecting my family. And that was heartbreaking … I just knew I needed help.”

Today Ricky’s death still looms, Keshon and her husband said they think of Ricky each year on the anniversary of his death. This November marked the 19th anniversary of his passing. ​

“Two decades after the devastating day that took our 'Ace,' Spc. Ricky Flores we’ve always remembered, never forgotten,” Keshon said. “Not a day goes by that we don't feel the loss or pain for our friend, ‘Chuko.’”

“This year, it was especially tough … just after talking [recently] about it,” she said. “I think that it was triggering for me … it had me thinking about it again, and it was just, it was emotionally heavy for me. So yes I have my moments with it.”

​She now works at a gym in the Columbus area, where her husband also serves as a firefighter. Jaden will graduate from high school next spring. Keshon said her grief no longer controls her, rather she has found ways to manage it, as she charts life after the Army. She has also succeeded BigMan as the NAWW president. Keshon coordinates color guard performances​, White House events ​and visits to schools where members educate children on Native American culture and history.

Keshon now will openly talk about her past traumas, in order to heal and help others with their struggles, even at the risk of triggering another panic episode.

“On one hand, it's emotionally heavy, but on another hand, it's also healing in a way,” Keshon added. “But it never ever, ever gets easier. You know what I mean? It's a part of my life that's always going to be there.”

​She, Charles and their children recently travelled to Atmore, Alabama for the annual Poarch Creek Thanksgiving Powwow.

Keshon still returns to the northern Nevada reservation as often she can.​ There, she takes her family to spend time with her mother, extended relatives and fellow tribe members at Fort McDermitt.

​And there she said, under the embrace of tribal lands she reunites with her people and feels whole again.

VATICAN CITY – Sgt. Raul Vargas clutched a small necklace with a golden cross, a memento for his 8-year-old daughter, as he awaited Pope Francis’s weekly remarks at St. Peters Basilica.

What brought him to Rome in the first place? The “Vatican Cup, friendly soccer match against the Swiss Guard – who protect Pope Francis – is an annual tradition for U.S. Soldiers in Italy. It provided an unusual opportunity for Vargas, a logistics noncommissioned officer from the Vicenza, Italy-based 173rd Airborne Brigade, to bring his faith and his love of soccer together.

Vargas, 31, who was raised Catholic in Mexico City, joined a contingent of U.S. Soldiers – most of them members of U.S. Army Garrison Italy’s Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers program for the Vatican trip. Seeing the Pope in person was a career highlight, Vargas said.

“The fact that he lets his own guards play against us in a soccer match, I feel blessed,” said Vargas, a lifelong soccer player who explains that his first spoken word was ball. “This is something greater than just a match. This is something that will impact our lives in the future.”

Prior to Pope Francis’s remarks, a nun greeted the Soldiers in front of thousands of attendees.

“We welcome the Soldiers from U.S. Army Garrison Italy at Vicenza,” she said, as the BOSS group erupted in cheers.

More than just a trip to Rome

Soldiers visiting the Eternal City took part in a papal audience and competed in a friendly competition against troops from a foreign military – much more than what a tourist normally does, said Col. Scott Horrigan, USAG Italy commander, who attended with Command Sgt. Maj. Jonathan Dyon, the garrison’s senior enlisted leader.

“It’s an awesome experience for them and an example of how BOSS gives them that option,” Horrigan said. “These are Soldiers and they have a day job, but they also take competition seriously.”

The Pontifical Swiss Guard, known as the world’s smallest army, have been guarding Popes and the Apostolic Palace since 1506. There are approximately 130 Swiss soldiers tasked with protecting the Pope.

The games began a decade ago when Claudio Adamo, a retired garrison Directorate of Public Works employee, collaborated with Fabio Bertoluzzi a Swiss Guard friend, to start the “Vatican Cup.” For the past ten years, the friendly rivalry has mostly seen the Vatican guards as victors in these soccer games. In August, the Swiss Guards played the U.S. Soldiers at Caserma Ederle and lost.

Cathy Garcia, the BOSS representative from the garrison Directorate of Families, Morale, Welfare and Recreation, organized the trip that included that included 18 Soldiers and one Airman from both Vicenza and Camp Darby. Planning took nearly a year, but it was worth it, she said.

“I get to meet Soldiers with different backgrounds and show them different parts of Europe and make their experience here better,” Garcia said.

From Kick Off to Hat Trick

In the first half, the Americans took a quick 3-1 lead – thanks to Sgt. Jose Ortiz, a 173rd NCO who scored three times. The U.S. Soldiers held hopes for an easy win.

At half time, Swiss Guard Vice Corporal Joel Imholz, 25, from Uri – Switzerland’s oldest canton, spoke of similarities between the two teams.

“It’s a great honor when we’re playing against Soldiers,” Imholz said. “It’s also the soldier against the soldier, we all make different experiences in the army, but at the end of the day, it’s probably the same all over the world.”

The Swiss turned things around in the second half, evening the score to 3-3. Ultimately, with penalty kicks, 4 to 1, the Swiss Guards won – taking the trophy back from the U.S. Army.

Soccer remains important to the pontiff, who is a fan of San Lorenzo Almagro, a soccer team in his native Argentina. He reportedly relies upon the Swiss Guard to tell him the scores. Just as in the Pope’s earlier remarks in St. Peters Square, there was joy. Both teams had fun, on and off the field.

Reflecting on the experience

For Chaplain (Maj.) Stephen McDermott, a garrison priest, Rome feels like coming home, he said. He shepherded the troops through the city, to the Vatican and the nearby Swiss Guard barracks. Then, he was the referee for the soccer game. He called the ongoing matches between the U.S. Army and the Swiss Guard a “wonderful, friendly rivalry.”

“It’s such a wonderful cultural and spiritual experience, for all,” McDermott said.

For Sgt. Kevin Navas, 25, of Union City, New Jersey, Rome’s walkable streets reminded him of home. Co-captain with Vargas, Navas missed last year’s Swiss Guard game due to 173rd training. Through sport, Soldiers from various jobs and backgrounds build cohesion and camaraderie, he said.

“It’s not just soccer, it’s a community we’ve built,” Navas said. “It’s open to everyone, not just soccer players, so we have a range from beginner to advanced. We have fun on and off the pitch. People help each other out, especially with all the (jobs). You’ll have finance people help out infantry guys. When they (move) they still talk with each other.”

In the evening, before the game, Dyon offered a pep talk while the Soldiers’ warmed up. He hopes events like this help spark a greater interest in the BOSS program among other Soldiers.

“It’s more than just great trips to go on” Dyon said. “It’s also a way to find healthy habits and friendships that are out of their usual teams, and find activities that they like and to enjoy the country they’re in.”"

LIVORNO, Italy – Mission command of the five Army Prepositioned Stocks-2 worksites in Europe is the responsibility of the 405th Army Field Support Brigade and it’s four battalions, but the primary workforce at these APS-2 sites is a mix between contractors, local national employees and in the Netherlands – Dutch Ministry of Defense civilian employees.

In a first, foreign national uniformed military personnel will conduct the day-to-day maintenance operations and work at an APS-2 site in Europe, and those military personnel recently took their first step to assume that mission.

More than 30 Polish air force personnel who will work at the new APS-2 site in Powidz, Poland – officially known as the Long Term Equipment Storage and Maintenance-Complex – conducted a site visit to Leghorn Army Depot in Livorno Nov. 13-17 to see how an APS-2 site operates.

Robert Guess is the support operations director for Army Field Support Battalion-Africa at Leghorn. He said the Polish air force personnel tapped to work at the APS-2 site in Poland came to Italy to “get a taste of what an APS-2 operation looks like and what that all entails.”

“Our Polish counterparts who visited were split up into groups,” said Guess. “For example, some shadowed the maintenance directorate, and some shadowed the directorate of supply. The goal was to show them our day-to-day operations and how APS-2 supports U.S. Army Europe and Africa and two combatant commands.”

“It was a lot of young officers, some of them straight out of their military academy, and they asked a lot of very good questions,” Guess said.

When introduced to AFSBn-Africa’s manning and workload planning and analysis efforts, Guess said he could tell the Polish airmen were slightly overwhelmed, especially at first. But he said the visit was mainly a chance for them to observe how an APS-2 worksite operates, and they’ll learn much more over the next year or two before they assume full responsibility of APS-2 maintenance operations at the site in Powidz.

“This initiative gave the Polish military personnel an opportunity to put eyes on what a fully operational APS-2 worksite looks like,” said Thomas Fiori, AFSBn-Africa’s director of maintenance. “Even though our APS-2 set here at Leghorn is quite a bit different than what they’re going to have in Poland – they’re going to have an [Armored Brigade Combat Team] and we have mostly tactical sustainment brigade type sets – the goal was to show them what right looks like.”

In total, the Polish military personnel spent almost a week on the ground at Leghorn with AFSBn-Africa. During this time, they attended briefings, met with senior leaders from the battalion, walked the APS-2 worksite, spoke with the maintainers and team leads doing the work, and observed all the day-to-day operations at the site.

“It wasn’t a lot of showing them how we physically turn wrenches, but more of the planning, production control and supply management functions,” Fiori said. “Overall, I think it was successful, especially as a first look. Nobody walked out of here an APS-2 expert. What we gave them was some basic tools to get started.”

“I don’t want to say first level,” Guess added, “more of an observation and orientation to APS-2 – a firsthand look at what a well-managed and well-maintained APS-2 worksite looks like.”

And the Polish military personnel who visited AFSBn-Africa and the APS-2 site at Leghorn made it clear they don’t take lightly the importance of their role in supporting the APS-2 mission in Europe.

“This is one of the most important missions for the Polish military right now,” said Lt. Col. Przemel Musiej, the officer in charge of the Polish logistics support workforce at Powidz. “This is the first site of its kind in Poland, and for us the Long Term Equipment Storage and Maintenance-Complex demonstrates the strong partnership we have with the U.S. and NATO.”

Comprised of 650,000 square feet of humidity-controlled warehouse space, a vehicle maintenance facility and supporting facilities, and a 58,000 square foot munitions storage area – the state-of-the-art LTESM-C in Poland demonstrates the commitment and investment of the U.S. with Poland and NATO through enduring agreements to posture resources for rapid deployment and deter potential adversaries.

On order, the 405th AFSB’s Army Field Support Battalion-Poland will assume mission command of APS-2 operations at the LTESM-C. Musiej’s workforce will work shoulder-to-shoulder with AFSBn-Poland, performing the vast majority of maintenance and mechanical repairs on APS-2 vehicles and equipment pieces.

In Livorno, AFSBn-Africa is charged with receiving, maintaining, storing and issuing APS-2 at Leghorn Army Depot as well as at locations forward – known as equipment configuration and hand off areas. The battalion is also responsible for linking national logistics capabilities and providing logistics solutions to Army units and joint forces South of the Alps through U.S. Army Materiel Command’s Life Cycle Management Commands.

Organizations AFSBn-Africa directly support – helping to enable readiness across two theaters of operations – are U.S. European Command, U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa, Southern European Task Force-Africa, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and other strategic partners and allies.

The 405th AFSB is assigned to U.S. Army Sustainment Command and under the operational control of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command, U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The brigade is headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany, and provides materiel enterprise support to U.S. Forces throughout Europe and Africa – providing theater sustainment logistics; synchronizing acquisition, logistics and technology; and leveraging the AMC materiel enterprise to support joint forces.

59,Safety officer looks for challenges and exciting opportunities.,https://www.army.mil/article/272017/safety_officer_looks_for_challenges_and_exciting_opportunities,"WIESBADEN, Germany –Melanie Barajas, IMCOM-Europe safety director, has built her 13-year federal career by seeking out opportunities in varying assignments around the globe.

“I’ve always taken the jobs that may be the challenging ones,” said Barajas, who joined IMCOM-Europe in August, following an assignment as the division safety chief with the Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Division in Winchester, Va.

For Barajas, she looks to improve not only herself as she takes on a new assignment, but also the entire organization she moves into.

“That’s what I hang my hat on is rebuilding – rebuilding safety programs, growing safety cultures, integrating safety management systems, and increasing safety education and awareness. Safety is a team effort, and wherever I go, my goal is to make it better and educate the team on what safety is all about, why we should care, and how we can work together,” she said. “And that goes for the leadership too, so when they move on, they carry the culture with them.”

After graduating from Western Kentucky University, Barajas became an Army intern at the Army Safety Center at Fort Novosel (at that time Fort Rucker), Ala., finding a calling working with safety professionals and learning the Army from a retired warrant officer and other teachers and mentors.

“At the beginning of my career, I directly supported the Safety and Occupational Health Installation Career Field (at the time Career Program 12). I loved my position. It was eye-opening and I enjoyed helping our worldwide safety community,” Barajas said.

Recognizing that she would want to try different echelons and move out of a headquarters environment, Barajas went to work as a safety specialist for a small Army installation in California, Camp Parks, followed by her first assignment with the Corps of Engineers in Sacramento. But Barajas had more in mind for herself.

“I always wanted to work overseas. Europe was on the top of my list,” she said, but realized that decreasing force structure in Europe was limiting her prospects. “I moved to Korea and spent time working at U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan as their deputy safety officer, managing the explosives and radiation safety programs, and then took over as the safety director.”

Barajas also worked as the tactical safety manager for Eighth Army in Korea and the district safety chief for the Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Middle East District. Barajas cites one important thread that has run through each challenging assignment she has taken on.

""Relationship building is critical. I'm constantly coaching, teaching, and mentoring, but must build trust first and credibility, of course,"" she said. ""Early in my career, I quickly realized that when people start coming to you asking for your guidance or expertise, that's when you know you're doing something right and have buy-in.""

One of her most memorable opportunities was joining an exercise with the Australian and New Zealand armies called Talisman Sabre.

“There was a last-minute need for a tactical safety representative to support the exercise, so I volunteered to deploy to Australia and gained valuable experience in tactical safety,” she recalled.

True to her adventurous willingness to learn about new places, cultures, and experiences, Barajas and her husband, Mario, are looking forward to traveling in Europe with their two sons, Mario and Myles.

“I have two incredible boys who continue to amaze me. There is a never a dull moment and they keep me on my toes,” she said.

Barajas is likely to teach them an important lesson she carries from her own mother, about learning – and about being safe.

“Years ago, my mother told me that once you think you know everything, that's when you should be scared and need to watch out,” she said."

SEMBACH, Germany – U.S. Army NATO hosted a week of training for U.S. Military Personnel Exchange Program Soldiers Nov. 5-10.

The weeklong event kicked off with hearing, vision, height and weight, and other medical readiness requirements organized by the U.S. Army NATO G9.

“This was excellent training,” said Maj. Erin Maurer, chemical biological radiological and nuclear advisor to the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense in Winterbourne-Gunner, England, on exchange from the U.S. Army CBRN School. “It's really necessary for geographically dispersed officers to get re-centered on what they're doing related to U.S. Army requirements and also what they need to do to take care of themselves, because it can be very difficult to keep track of all the requirements that are not the focus in our daily jobs.”

MPEP is a security cooperation program involving the reciprocal exchange of personnel between the U.S. Army and a similar unit in a foreign military service. MPEP Soldiers work with their host nation counterparts at foreign military bases and rarely have the opportunity to interact with other U.S. Soldiers.

United States Army NATO hosted a week of training for U.S. Military Personnel Exchange Program Soldiers Nov. 5-10 at Sembach, Germany.

“I love my job,” she said. “It's the best job I've had since company command.

“The thing about this job is that all the actions I take with my partner nation have tangible effects, effects that I can see the outcome while I'm still there.

“I know that I'm helping partner nations to build their capacity and then just keeping the team effort moving forward for both our armies.

“With the ongoing crisis on the European continent CBRN is on an upswing of importance. It's always been important but now it's at the peak of everyone's consideration, and so building the alliance, making sure that we're moving in the right direction with modernization, with innovation, with interoperability, it's at a critical point for the CBRN community right now in Europe.”

The purpose of the program is to provide a framework for bilateral engagement that strengthens alliances and increases defense cooperation in support of U.S. national security strategy.

“The chance to work together as a multinational force in my brigade is just an immense opportunity to really build our alliance’s capability for warfighting and overall crisis response operations,” said Maj. Chuck Sexton, operations officer with the Italian Julia Alpine Brigade on exchange from the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany.

Across the European theater allied nation army units incorporate multinational partners in their command structures at the tactical, operational and strategic levels to help increase interoperability and ensure NATO is able to merge the capabilities of various military forces and provide access to national or regional infrastructure, logistics and information.

“As a member of NATO, the United States knows we will not fight alone in future wars,” said Sgt. Maj. Alex Burnett, who works as an instructor for noncommissioned officer education in Ermelo, Netherlands, as part of an exchange between the Royal Netherlands Army and the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy. “We need our allies and partners throughout the world, so for the exchange sergeants major and the exchange officers that are over here, being able to build those ties, being able to build those relationships with our host nations and strengthen that transatlantic bond is so important for the future.”

Burnett also said he appreciated the time and effort U.S. Army NATO devoted to ensuring the MPEPs are taken care of.

“As senior NCOs and officers who are dispersed all over Europe it's important to get together like this so that we can knock out the mandatory training that the Army requires,” said Burnett. “Maintaining readiness despite where we are working for our various host nations is still a number one priority for Soldiers in the Army.”

The best part of the conference he said was the opportunity to meet with other MPEP Soldiers.

“We are usually one American deep where we live and work in a European community, and so getting a chance to interact, share experiences, share lessons learned and to learn how to make our foxholes better is really the most important part of this conference,” said Burnett.

Service with U.S. Army NATO provides possibilities to people looking for a sense of purpose and community in their career and life.

“This assignment is tougher than I expected going from two years of company command back down to the platoon level, but being able to learn what I am going to teach my students gives me a great familiarization with how the British army functions and as a whole how we fight together with our British allies in any future conflict,” said Capt. TJ Eddy, military exchange officer between the U.S. Military Academy West Point and the United Kingdom’s Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

“My family loves living in England, and we've been particularly impressed with the warm welcome we received from the British army between helping us find a house, making sure my family was settled, and all these other bits and bobs, as they would say, to set us up for success,” said Eddy. “Being able to serve over here as an exchange officer is a unique experience that I would encourage my fellow Soldiers to seek out, because you have an outsized influence to improve the relationships between our allies and ensure our armies are able to be successful in any future conflicts.”

U.S. Army NATO has administrative agent support responsibilities for about 70 Military Personnel Exchange Program and Schools of Other Nations Soldiers and their families at 60 locations in 12 countries.

In addition to MPEP and Schools of Other Nations Soldiers, U.S. Army NATO supports about 1,000 Soldiers assigned to NATO billets at 81 locations in 22 countries.

61,Fort Cavazos officials take proactive approach to deter workplace violence,https://www.army.mil/article/272033/fort_cavazos_officials_take_proactive_approach_to_deter_workplace_violence,"FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Fort Cavazos is one of 17 installations set to implement a program that focuses more on a proactive than a reactive approach to avert acts of workplace violence.

Motivated by incidents of violence that have plagued the Department of Defense through the years, the DOD Insider Threat Management and Analysis Center deployed the Prevention, Assistance and Response program to address indicators and elements of workplace violence and violent behavior at its earliest instance to minimize risk, maintain unit readiness and reduce movement along the critical path.

The PAR program utilizes a multidiscipline approach through collaboration with trained professionals, integrated prevention experts and key stakeholders to develop tailored mitigation strategies intended to provide commanders and civilian leaders with an understanding of overall risk within their organizations and options to care for their personnel.

“I am excited about the opportunity to host such a positive initiative,” expressed Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander. “The command is deeply committed to ensuring a strong vibrant command climate where everyone is free to excel and a program focusing on reducing workplace violence at Fort Cavazos is perfectly in line with our philosophy.”

The program is being introduced in three phases. The first focused on deploying PAR cadre to installations, establishing business rules and processes and conducting coalition building. The second phase will educate and train community members and increase awareness. The final phase represents the full implementation.

Drew Hunnicutt, Fort Cavazos PAR program coordinator, explained that the program is currently in its second phase and that PAR program coordinators are here to assist the Army with its mission and provide guidance.

“The PAR mission is to coordinate with the commanders of units,” he shared, “as well as law enforcement, intelligence agencies and counterintelligence agencies to identify if something might be going wrong as soon as possible and to get the person help.”

Each aspect of the program utilizes environmental factors such as personal predispositions, stressors, concerning behavior and hostile actions to identify potentially aggressive behavior. The program incorporates a multi-tiered methodology to recognize early warning signs, escalation and further escalation.

Prevention focuses on the execution of policies, programs, training or practices that aim to prevent workplace violence and prohibited abusive or harmful acts through recognizing personal predispositions.

Assistance emphasizes actions taken at the earliest indication of stress to provide access to necessary services or treatment to mitigate further risk by categorizing a variety of everyday stressors.

Response refers to actions taken to stop the violent threat and mitigate any damages done by the aggressor through identifying concerning behaviors.

Hunnicutt explained that PAR will work similarly to organizations such as the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program, the Employee Assistance Program and the Family Advocacy Program.

He emphasized that PAR is not an independent program or process, but part of the larger integrated prevention effort that works within the same operating procedures as other prevention efforts.

“We’re not here to have a redundancy on top of what Fort Cavazos is already doing,” he said. “We’re here to make sure that there is the coordination and assist with how we can really get these things that we have in place to really work together to get people off the critical pathway to violence.”

Full operations of the PAR program are slated to begin in October 2025, and Fort Cavazos leadership is in full support of the initiative.

“A violence-free workplace is not only a fundamental requirement for our mission but also a reflection of our values and dedication to the men and women who serve under our command,” Stokes said. “This initiative demonstrates the commitment to maintaining a safe and secure environment for personnel, enhancing morale and ensuring mission readiness. My role is to fully support and actively participate in the implementation of the initiative, prioritizing the safety and well-being of our service members and our Department of the Army civilians.”"

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place officially opened its doors for the 2023 holiday season Thursday with a ribbon cutting ceremony.

Dozens gathered in the facility to celebrate all of the hard work that went into filling the workshop’s toy vault as well as the organization’s 25th anniversary.

Brig. Gen. Thomas Felty, III Armored Corps deputy commanding general of maneuver, stopped by the event to express the leadership’s support for Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place. He expressed his gratitude to the many donors and volunteers who helped to fill the vault with so many toys.

“I’ve got goosebumps thinking about it,” he said. “When our Soldiers come in here, with all the elves, and they get to pick out toys, they’re just overwhelmed with joy and happiness at the opportunity to present their kids all of these wonderful gifts. (The emotions are) overwhelming for these young families and so it is a really, really big deal.”

Marizza Stokes, president of Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place, shared that last year, the organization provided toys to more than 1,600 children, with more than 800 families applying. This year, 973 families applied to Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place, meaning the organization hopes to provide toys for around 2,000 children.

Stokes said donations have made their goal a reality and shared that the organization received the largest donation in its history from the Jack D. Levy American Legion Riders Post 573 totaling $56,000.

“This is the largest donation Santa’s Workshop has ever received and we don’t know how to thank you,” Stokes said before presenting representatives of the American Legion Riders with a Santa-shaped diamond donor plaque.

After acknowledging the many other donors and volunteers, guests were invited to the vault where Felty and Santa Claus himself cut the ribbon, officially opening the vault. The vault was filled with a plethora of toys for children in different age ranges. There are also sensory toys for children with special needs.

When asked how she felt seeing all of their hard work coming to fruition and large support from the community, Stokes was at a loss of words.

“We could not do the quality of toys that we do for all of our families without these donations,” she said. “When the families come through the first thing they say is, ‘Oh my goodness, these are … really amazing toys.’”

Once a family is approved, they come into the workshop and an elf is assigned to them, who takes them around the facility so they can choose stocking stuffers, two toys per child, one book per child and a family board game. Stokes shared that the total package per child totals near $125 retail value, which the families receive completely for free.

Stokes has also been able to witness the lasting impact that Santa’s Workshop at The Great Place has had on the families that it has helped.

“This past weekend we had Santa at the Spouse’s (Club) Holiday Bazaar, and it was a little fundraiser for us,” she shared. “There was a young spouse with three little ones and she was messing with her phone. I said, ‘Can I help you?’ She said, ‘I’m trying to donate. I don’t have cash.’ I said, ‘You don’t have to donate.” She said, ‘You don’t understand, you saved our Christmas last year.’ That’s why we do it.”

Stokes shared that the organization is still looking for elves to volunteer to help families pick out the best toys for their children. She expressed that none of this would be possible without volunteers and encourages those who are interested to apply.

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — The HOP initiated its first holiday transportation service here during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, making several stops, to include the Copeland Center, the Casey Memorial Library and Phantom Warrior Lanes.

The service is scheduled for a second run over the winter holidays and will extend to include the motor pool areas.

Fort Cavazos officials partnered with the Hill Country Transit District to provide transportation on the installation during the holidays to get a feel for how the HOP will run on post in the future and help boost morale during the holiday season, which can be especially difficult for Soldiers so far away from home and family.

The holiday service is pilot for the upcoming Cavazos Connector, which will provide mass transit service on post and throughout the local community.

“The post was kind enough to find us a home here, which will be based out of Fort Cavazos for all of our Fort Cavazos transit needs,” said Derek Czapnik, transportation superintendent for the HOP, during the Red, White and You hiring event earlier this month.

“This is going to be a game changer,” he said.

Darrell Burtner, director of urban operations for HCTD, said the organization is looking forward to the collaboration.

“We’re excited, and we really feel that this can make a huge difference to family morale on post and logistics as far as getting people from point A to point B. We’re looking forward to working together.

“I think historically the Army has done a great job as far as transporting Soldiers, but the transportation options for family members and dependents have not been as strong,” he added. “That is really the focus of this, to give them more options of not only getting around on base but also connect into the transit system immediately off post at the gate.”

Burtner explained that the transit system will eventually enable Soldiers to get wherever they need to go on base and connect into the HOP service in town, “so they can go anywhere from Copperas Cove, all the way out to Temple and really anywhere in between.”

To make things even more convenient, the HOP will launch an app for riders to order transportation, much like Uber or Lyft.

In an effort to help get Soldiers to breakfast and other early morning obligations, the upcoming holiday HOP will start slightly earlier from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. There will be no services on Dec. 25 or Jan. 1, 2024.

The holiday HOP is free of charge to anyone with access to the installation.

HCTD is also looking to hire dependents, spouses and veterans to fill part-time driver positions starting in February 2024. Positions start at $18 hourly, offer flexibility and the security of only driving on the installation. Commercial driver’s licenses are not required for the position.

JOINT BASE LANGLEY-EUSTIS, Va. – The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command’s leader professional development webinar series continued this week as Mr. Michael D. Formica, TRADOC deputy to the commanding general, and Mr. Nathan Whitaker, motivational speaker and former NFL executive, discussed the importance of mentorship in the workplace.

With leadership comes the responsibility to mentor those below you, as both Formica and Whitaker can attest to. With the wake of a new mentorship program developed by the TRADOC Civilian Human Resources Directorate, leader mentorship has become a great topic of discussion.

“The Army is a people business, and if a leader doesn’t acknowledge the aspirations of each individual on their team, there’s an essential piece of leadership that’s missing there,” Formica explained. “Mentorship can help inspire and enable their subordinates to reach their highest potential.”

As stated by Formica and Whitaker, the key qualities of a successful mentor are similar to those of an effective leader: character, trust, patience, empathy, and humility.

Whitaker elaborated on this with an anecdote on his experience working with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where their leadership had a character-based selection process during the NFL draft. This showed just how serious a player’s character is considered during such an important process.

Along with having good character values, Formica and Whitaker emphasized the value of empathy and demonstrating a genuine commitment to support the mentee.

“If leaders operate an organization where they demonstrate their desire to help subordinates improve their competence, they will be much more committed to the organization and its success,” Formica explained.

On the quality of humility, Whitaker stated that empathy and the ability to understand that we are all flawed as humans is one of the most important parts of being a positive mentor and develops a deeper sense of trust.

“If I’m willing to own my mistakes, that’s a powerful message [to the mentee],” Whitaker stated.

Formica expanded on this, adding that “humility is a key ingredient in mentorship, because when you recognize that, as a leader, you are fallible and that you will make mistakes and learn from them, you are opening up a learning environment of trust.”

With this comes a new opportunity for both parties to learn from each other, making the mentorship mutually beneficial.

“[Mentorship] must be a two-way street. I am amazed at how much I’m learning from mentees in the process of being a mentor,” expressed Formica as he shared his experience with the TRADOC mentoring program.

Earlier this year, the TRADOC Civilian Human Resources Directorate established the voluntary mentoring program as a personal and professional development opportunity for Army Civilians.

The program, which is available across the TRADOC enterprise, offers different mentoring approaches including cohort mentoring, peer mentoring, and reverse mentoring.

FORT LIBERTY, N.C. – Medical Soldiers with the 7458th Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Army Reserve Medical Commandb ran a weekend clinic as a part of the ongoing Operation Reserve Care Clinic (ORC) on Fort Liberty, North Carolina from November 3-5, 2023.

The goal of ORC is to aid Soldiers in staying medically ready to deploy at a moment's notice. By hosting a Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP) like event on the weekends, the providers of the 7458th MORU are meeting Soldiers around Fort Liberty and beyond to provide critical medical readiness functions. This saves time for the Soldiers, who may not have the ability or time to complete these assessments outside of the Army. Maj. Latasha Brown, the officer in charge of the ORC mission from the 7458th MORU, explained how this mission is critical to maintaining Soldier readiness.

“A lot of Soldiers have had really great Reserve Care experiences and it starts mainly with the staff,” she said. “They like the way the staff are in depth and really positive in their approach to the Soldiers. They actually really care and they are in depth with the Soldiers patient care, not just pushing them through the system. It is one stop, but they really take the time to sit with the Soldier and work with them through whatever challenges they may have while bringing their medical readiness to the green state. Coming to ORC, they were able to get good patient care where our providers care about their status while updating their health information and they were able to leave here with a positive outlook on their future. If they had problems that were just outlined, they were able to work through it and then they left with answers on how to correct those issues they had in the system.”

The ORC mission has been ongoing for seven years. It was initially implemented to relieve the military health contractors and ensure Soldiers were in compliance with Army medical health standards. Since then, it has served Soldiers conducting battle assembly weekend in the area, ensuring that they maintain medical readiness. The operation has had medical Soldiers from other regions look into performing their own versions of Operation Reserve Care clinics, although there have been resource issues in getting these programs off the ground. Sgt. Tarynn Gardner, the mission's non-commissioned officer in charge from the 7458th MORU, recalled all of the moving pieces unique to keep this mission moving.

“It's a lot easier to keep a ball rolling when it's already started,” Gardner said. “So what is hindering a lot of organizations from starting their own programs is getting that ball rolling. There are a lot of pieces. We're fortunate we have a facility and haven't always been in this facility. We've been in various facilities since it started. We eventually found ourselves here, which has been great because everything that we need is pretty close. So facilities, supplies, you need somebody like a point of contact that works like a liaison between the actual hospital and the reserve unit. So we have a person that's kind of coordinating. Then we have our own leadership, which you've been talking to, to lend unit support. In this particular situation, we've definitely had different leaders, but for the most part, the unit has supported us and the willingness of all these individuals who volunteered. There are obviously a lot of different roles that go into the whole process. So all of these individuals, had to go through MHS Genesis training. They all had to get approval for the MEDPROS update to be able to update patient information.”

Soldiers can expect a multitude of medical services, such as preliminary health assessments, vision screening, audio screening, dental services, and more.

The clinic's providers are Reserve Soldiers coming from the 7458th MORU. ORC allows them to be able to practice their medical skills in a realistic setting. While perfecting these skills, they are able to understand different common afflictions Soldiers are experiencing. The Officer in Charge of the Clark Clinic, Capt. Shanelle Warren of the 7458 MORU, explained the advantage of having a clinic run by Soldiers

“We are driven and ran by Soldiers,” Warren said. “ If there is something going on with the Soldiers, like for instance, when they do their PHA, it is definitely very important to answer all the questions correctly. If something's going on, our providers see and notice those things. They give that additional care. Something most people don't know, lot of Soldiers don't have care outside of here. So if there's something going on and we find, for instance, if a soldier has diabetes. We see that in their records, we do get them the referrals to help them get their medications. We don't just see Soldiers as numbers. We see them as our peers because all of us are Soldiers. It's driven through Soldiers to give them care.”"

BALLSTON SPA, N.Y. — Ten Army National Guard Soldiers from New York’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion volunteered to help send 131 Christmas trees from a Saratoga County tree farm to military families at bases in Virginia and Florida.

The Guard recruiters joined 30 other volunteers at Ellms Family Farm in Ballston Spa on Nov. 28 to load trees donated to the Trees for Troops program on board a truck and dispatch them for shipment by FedEx.

New York Army National Guard Sgt. 1st Class Derrick Zwack said he volunteered because he remembered how seeing a Christmas tree while he was deployed had cheered him up.

“When you are overseas, your fellow Soldiers become like a second family, but you still miss your family back home,” Zwack said. “These trees give us a sense of home when we are away for the holidays.”

Ellms Tree Farm, a Christmas season destination for families throughout the Albany region, has been a collection site for trees for 19 years.

Owner Sally Ellms said she is amazed by the generosity of the local growers.

“When I checked a week ago, we had about 30 trees stacked on the trailer,” Ellms said. “So, I made some phone calls to thank and remind our growers and in our final week, we had another hundred donated.”

Trees for Troops is a national program launched in 2005 by the Christmas Spirit Foundation, and with the help of FedEx, has delivered more than 293,500 trees. Fresh-cut trees are gathered at farm and retail lots, picked up by FedEx and routed through distribution centers for delivery to 84 military bases this holiday season.

This year’s trees from the Albany region are going to a Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, and an Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida. In previous years, trees have gone to bases in Afghanistan.

Volunteers helping this year included veterans representing all service branches from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Gulf War, the Cold War and the Vietnam War.

Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Moseman said it’s all about giving back.

“It’s a great day when we gather these Soldiers together and load the trees onto the truck,” Moseman said. “With so many service members sacrificing time with their families for the holidays, it feels awesome to do this for them and remind them of how much we care.”

Gavin Steel, 1st Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment, 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, shown in Fort Moore, Georgia, after he completed Ranger School in 2021. Steel traces his Native American heritage through his grandmothers. (Photo Credit: Courtesy) VIEW ORIGINAL

RICHMOND, Va. — First Lt. Gavin Steel traces his Native American heritage through his maternal and paternal grandmothers’ bloodlines. His maternal grandmother comes from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. On the paternal side, his grandmother comes from the Coharie Indian Tribe.

“I am always aware of where I come from,” Steel said. “I always want to honor the Cherokee people. I carry pride for the tribes I belong to every day.”

Steel started his military career in 2016 as a cadet enrolled in the Simultaneous Membership Program, which allows National Guard Soldiers to participate in their school’s ROTC program while enjoying the benefits of both. In May, he commissioned as an infantry officer.

“I joined so that I could follow in my adopted father’s footsteps,” Steel said, explaining that his adopted father was a U.S. Navy officer. “From the day I met him, he always explained to me the importance of a good officer and the impact they have on those around them. I want to leave my mark on this organization and leave it better than I found it.”

In 2021, Steel attended and graduated from Ranger School.

“The one lesson that stuck out to me the most is that Ranger School is called a leadership school not because of what they teach you, but because of those you come in contact with,” Steel said. “You are all leaders at Ranger School and you are all taking styles of leadership from each other and creating your own style that you then bring back to the unit.”

At Ranger School, Steel said he learned just how much a body could take and how important it was to divorce himself from bodily discomfort during times of stress. It required resilience and physical and mental strength. When he was 6 months old, his name day ceremony prioritized those qualities.

“This is a tradition that normally happens when you turn 13,” Steel said, explaining that he was extremely sick as a baby. “The Elder who gave me my Native name believed that if I were given a strong name, it would help me.”

Steel was named Whitehawk, which he carries today as his middle name.

“That is the name I was given to show truth that I would live a happy, healthy life with clarity and focus,” he said. “My Native name is something I am extremely proud of.”

One thing Steel wants people to know about Native Americans is that they’re all unique.

“There are over 500 tribes and villages in the United States,” Steel said. “Even though we are all Native American, each tribe practices their own culture and honors and respects their own heritage in unique ways.”

Today, Steel serves as a platoon leader in the Lynchburg-based 1st Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment, 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, and works full time in the National Guard Bureau’s Strength Maintenance Division.

The event began with guests playing a variety of traditional games such as Tuho, a game where arrows are tossed into a pot and the winner is determined by the number of arrows in the pot. People were able to get traditional snacks such as seaweed chips after completing all the games successfully.

“I enjoyed learning how to play the games and tasting the different snacks provided,” said K16 resident Cassie Williams.

TOKYO, Japan – The U.S. Army Japan Band took the stage at Tokyo’s famed Budokan arena for the last time for their final performance as longtime participants in the Japan Self-Defense Force Marching Festival.

The band’s Nov. 17 and 18 appearances in the concert ended their 42-year run of taking part in the annual joint event, as the unit will be stood down next year.

The USARJ Band have been performers in the festival every year since 1981, except for when it was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Current members of the USARJ Band said they recognize the significance of being part of the final iteration of the band to perform in the historic, 14,000-capacity venue, as it marks the end of a notable era for the unit, which was activated in 1957.

“We are obviously so grateful that [the USARJ Band] had a chance to be here for so many years consecutively and had the chance to work with all these great musicians, great people, and great staff that organizes the event,” said Staff Sgt. Nicholas Miller, a two-time performer at the festival. “It’s bittersweet, but it’s cool to be part of the [USARJ Band’s] last performance.”

Miller said he thinks the JSDF Marching Festival is every member of the band’s favorite event they do every year and said their participation in the event is a unique opportunity for a large, predominantly Japanese audience to listen to music from a diverse group of performers.

“It’s a lot of fun getting to meet all the bands, hearing all the great music that they make, and having the chance to show what we all can do when we come together and work as one,” he said.

Miller said he tried to have fun backstage and keep everyone’s energy up, but admitted he felt a tinge of sadness knowing that every time the band finished a song, they would be getting closer to the last time they would ever play at Budokan.

“I think our performance was very successful, and this will definitely stay in my heart for a long time,” he said.

Chief Warrant Officer 3 Matthew David, the USARJ Band commander and a first-time performer at the festival, said he has known about Budokan and the band’s participation in the festival since the start of his Army career 19 years ago. He said it was a huge honor to be able to be part of the event and represent the United States to the people of Japan.

One of the songs the band performed was from an anime series, and they chose it because they thought it was an appropriate tribute to their host country and one that would help the audience connect with them, David said.

The commander said he could see the crowd visibly enjoying and responding to the music. Making that kind of connection with an audience is “something you can’t put a price on,” he said.

“It’s about [exploring] the human dimension through music,” David said. “Music is one of those powerful ways to connect with people.”

The first JSDF Marching Festival was held in 1963, and Budokan has been the venue nearly every year since 1973. In addition to U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine bands joining the event, bands from Australia, France, Germany, India, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have also performed over the years."

ZUTENDAAL, Belgium – Serving in Europe provides Soldiers with many unique and interesting opportunities. For a few Soldiers from the 51st Composite Truck Company who recently trained nearly two dozen Belgian host nation employees at the Zutendaal Army Prepositioned Stocks-2 worksite on how operate and drive the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter, or EHET, this was certainly one of them.

Eight Soldiers from the 51st CTC, 18th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, served as instructors for an EHET drivers academy at the APS-2 worksite in Belgium, Nov. 6-22, training Belgian mechanics and maintainers from the 405th Army Field Support Brigade’s Army Field Support Battalion-Benelux.

In order to receive licensing accreditation on the M1300 EHET tractor and M1302 trailer, the AFSBn-Benelux host nation employees who work at Zutendaal attended the drivers academy training, which was led by the 16th Sustainment Brigade’s 51st CTC and included a classroom portion, a components and basic issue items overview, tie down procedures, ground guide instruction, trailer hook up procedures, winching, trailer maneuvering, and operating and driving the EHET.

With well over 100 EHETs stored at the Zutendaal APS-2 worksite, it’s critical that the Belgian workforce there is not only proficient in maintaining and repairing these EHETs. They must also be able to operate and drive them, and that’s where the expert truck drivers from the 51st CTC showed up to assist.

“I really enjoyed the training. The Soldiers from 51st Transportation Company who trained us were very thorough. They were also extremely patient and showed us exactly what we needed to know. They were great,” said Steven Claesen, the Zutendaal APS-2 maintenance team lead. “We learned a lot, and my team and I are now very comfortable with operating and driving the EHETs. The EHET is an amazing piece of equipment and the biggest piece of equipment here at APS-2 Zutendaal.”

The training consisted of three phases. Phase 1 was entirely done in a classroom environment. There, the APS-2 mechanics and maintainers were presented with all the technical data and regulatory guidance required to operate the M1300 EHET tractor and M1302 trailer.

Phase 2 was the hands-on training portion and focused on preventative maintenance checks and services. The APS-2 maintainers from Zutendaal shined during this portion because for many of them this is part of their everyday duties. In fact, a few of the Soldier instructors from the 51st CTC learned a tip or two from their Belgium students during this phase of the training.

Phase 3 was the most critical portion of the drivers academy and the primary reason for the training. During this phase the APS-2 mechanics and maintainers assigned to AFSBn-Benelux conducted operational control tests and a final driver’s road test. Once this phase was complete, they became fully certified and licensed to operate and drive EHETs.

According to the U.S. Army Acquisition Support Center, the EHET is used to transport the M1 Abrams main battle tank and other heavy equipment weighing up to 90 tons and is capable of attaining highway permits to allow transport within European countries. The EHET consists of an M1300 tractor (M1070A1 modified to reduce and relocate weight to achieve European road permits) and an eight-axle M1302 trailer capable of worldwide transport. The EHET is replacing the Army’s legacy HET. Fielding of EHETs in Europe began a couple of years ago, and the 405th AFSB’s Zutendaal APS-2 worksite was one of the first locations to receive them.

The 51st CTC is headquartered in Grafenwoehr, Germany. According to the 21st Theater Sustainment Command’s official website, the 51st CTC provides transportation assets for the movement and distribution of dry and refrigerated containerized cargo, general non-containerized cargo, ammunition, bottled water, bulk water and assists with unit moves, transports personnel, and provides convoy protection to unit convoys.

The Zutendaal APS-2 worksite maintains equipment designated for a sustainment brigade and separate reporting units and encompasses 600,000 square feet of climate-controlled warehouse space in 15 warehouses as well as 40,000 square feet of hardstand storage.

The 405th AFSB’s APS-2 program is a key component of U.S. Army Europe and Africa’s power projection and warfighter readiness missions. The 405th AFSB’s APS-2 program provides turn-key power projection packages – ready to deploy at a moment’s notice – while helping to reduce the amount of equipment needed from the deploying forces’ home stations. Combatant commanders identify their APS-2 requirements, and the 405th AFSB executes and then issues the equipment to the deploying warfighters.

The 405th AFSB is assigned to U.S. Army Sustainment Command and under the operational control of the 21st TSC, U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The brigade is headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany, and provides materiel enterprise support to U.S. Forces throughout Europe and Africa – providing theater sustainment logistics; synchronizing acquisition, logistics and technology; and leveraging the U.S. Army Materiel Command’s materiel enterprise to support joint forces.

WIESBADEN, Germany - Christmas came a little early for Wiesbaden’s Staff Sgt. Stetson McCallister.

The 30-year-old master gamer from Dickson, Tenn., was among 12 Soldiers worldwide to qualify for the upcoming Soldier Showdown V Esports Finals to be held at the Complexity Gaming Center in Frisco, Texas, Dec. 1-2, 2023. McCallister, with Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 2nd Military Intelligence Battalion, was the only competitor from U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden and one of only four Europe-based players to make the finals.

“I found out two days after the tournament ended on Sept. 30,” said McCallister, who goes by the gaming handle, BlackCatSavage. “I was very excited.”

“I competed last year as well, and I kept looking for it this year. I’m a very competitive person, and I’m passionate about video games,” he said, adding that last year’s experience (having won several games but not making the finals) inspired him to continue this year. Like last year, he earned various prizes while battling for the Best Battle Royale Gamer honors

“I’ve been playing since I was a kid,” starting with his older brother’s Playstation and building his skills on Sega and Nintendo 64 platforms. “I really started playing a lot in high school. When I wasn’t in school or at work I was playing – that was my hobby.”

“I typically play around eight hours on Friday and try to limit myself to Friday,” he said.

“To me gaming is a stress reliever. People need that release for their mental health. … I would definitely say that for any gamer playing improves their comprehensive thinking. You don’t have a lot of time to pick and choose – it takes critical thinking,” McCallister explained, encouraging others to explore the world of gaming – to expand their comfort zones, sense of teamwork and to make new online friends in the gaming world. “Get involved, do something you like and eventually it will be rewarding.”

The avid gamer is also looking forward to welcoming a new family member. He and his German-born wife are expecting their first child in December.

That may change his playing schedule, he said, smiling, but he added that his wife married him knowing that competitive gaming was a major part of his life. “My wife knows I love to do it.”

For now, McCallister is concentrating on the upcoming Soldier Showdown V Dec. 1 and 2 in Texas.

Wiesbaden-based community members ages 18 and above are invited to share in the event during a Watch Party at the Warrior Zone on Clay Kaserne. Free snacks, beverages and giveaways will be featured – starting around 6 p.m. on Dec. 1. The Watch Party will continue on the following day – if Wiesbaden’s own makes it to the final rounds.

Everyone can also follow the action live on Twitch – at https://www.twitch.tv/armyentertainment."

[Editor’s Note: In this series, we are shining a light on our workforce in and around the Benelux. This Spotlight is on Jacqueline Sangen, USAG Benelux-Brunssum Budget Analyst, who works for the Resource Management Office and spends her free time volunteering at a nearby animal shelter.]

BRUNSSUM, Netherlands – Shortly after Jacqueline Sangen found herself unemployed in December 2006, she discovered her passion for volunteering. She chose an animal shelter in Heinsberg, Germany, and started her time there walking the dogs twice a week.

Previous to her volunteer work, Sangen worked in two different positions from 1984 at the U.S. Army installation in Schinnen, the Netherlands, before moving over to Eygelshoven Army Depot nearby in 2000. In 2006, her position in Eygelshoven was eliminated due to the closure of the site.

Without a job, she was ready to engage her social calendar and dabble in volunteering. It wasn’t long before she found the perfect crowd of people—at the animal shelter—where they enthusiastically embraced her volunteerism spirit.

“[The shelter has] a very nice group of people,” said Sangen. “I just enjoy being there with them.”

Even though her unemployed status lasted a mere nine months before picking up full-time work again, Sangen decided to continue walking the dogs. Now she goes for about two hours every Saturday morning and Wednesday afternoon when her schedule allows.

“I didn’t grow up with dogs,” said Sangen, but when her boyfriend began the night shift at his job, she wanted a dog for more security at home. Her favorite breed became the Rottweiler and since, she has always owned one. The dogs at the shelter also quickly grew familiar with her frequent visits.

Eventually in 2011, Sangen adopted one of the dogs, a 10-year-old mixed breed. This dog was old but friendly, and she had walked him for nearly two years. He ended up living nearly eight more.

“Most of the dogs like me,” said Sangen, which has been very apparent to her upon meeting them again after adoption into a new family—sometimes at the biannual rummage sale. The animal shelter sponsors two markets each year in June and the weekend before Advent begins. Sangen helps out and enjoys seeing some of the adopted dogs again.

“It’s like a reunion,” said Sangen as she recalled a story of a German Shepherd with his new family who pushed his way through the rummage sale to greet her.

The shelter often receives dogs with challenging temperaments and animals with health problems when their owners cannot afford the medical care. Sometimes the shelter places a call for donations on social media when the veterinarian bill is high.

Because her co-workers at USAG Benelux-Brunssum know of her volunteering, they have also helped by giving various donations. One brought in an oversized stuffed dog won at a carnival. The shelter then raffled the dog at their rummage sale for an added aspect of fun. Some colleagues have donated unwanted household items for resale. Still others have given bags of unneeded animal food or accessories to the shelter animals.

“[My colleagues] love animals, and they’re always asking about the shelter. It makes me extremely happy,” said Sangen. “I am very grateful to have co-workers like them.”

USAG Benelux Spotlight: Jacqueline Sangen

[Notitie van de redactie: In deze serie schijnen we een licht op onze werknemers in en rond de Benelux. Deze Spotlight gaat over Jacqueline Sangen, USAG Benelux-Brunssum Budget Analist, die werkt voor het Resource Management Office en haar vrije tijd besteedt aan vrijwilligerswerk in een nabijgelegen dierenasiel.]

BRUNSSUM, Nederland - Kort nadat Jacqueline Sangen in december 2006 werkloos werd, ontdekte ze haar passie voor vrijwilligerswerk. Ze koos voor een dierenasiel in Heinsberg, Duitsland, en begon daar twee keer per week de honden uit te laten.

Voorafgaand aan haar vrijwilligerswerk werkte Sangen vanaf 1984 in twee verschillende functies op de Amerikaanse legerinstallatie in Schinnen, Nederland, voordat ze in 2000 overstapte naar het nabijgelegen Eygelshoven Army Depot. In 2006 werd haar functie in Eygelshoven opgeheven vanwege de sluiting van de locatie.

Zonder baan was ze klaar om haar sociale agenda te gebruiken en vrijwilligerswerk te gaan doen. Het duurde niet lang voordat ze de perfecte groep mensen vond - in het dierenasiel - waar ze haar geest voor vrijwilligerswerk enthousiast omarmden.

""[Het asiel heeft] een hele leuke groep mensen,"" zei Sangen. ""Ik vind het gewoon leuk om daar met hen te zijn.""

Hoewel het negen maanden duurde voordat ze weer fulltime aan het werk ging, besloot Sangen door te gaan met het uitlaten van de honden. Nu gaat ze ongeveer twee uur lang elke zaterdagochtend en woensdagmiddag als haar schema het toelaat.

""Ik ben niet opgegroeid met honden,"" zei Sangen, maar toen haar vriend begon met nachtdienst op zijn werk, wilde ze een hond voor meer veiligheid thuis. Haar favoriete ras werd de Rottweiler en sindsdien heeft ze er altijd een gehad. De honden in het asiel raakten ook snel vertrouwd met haar frequente bezoekjes.

Uiteindelijk adopteerde Sangen in 2011 een van de honden, een 10 jaar oud gemengd ras. Deze hond was oud maar vriendelijk en ze had bijna twee jaar met hem gewandeld. Uiteindelijk leefde hij nog bijna acht jaar.

""De meeste honden vinden me aardig,"" zei Sangen, wat haar heel duidelijk werd toen ze sommigen weer ontmoette na hun adoptie in een nieuw gezin – vaak was dit op de tweejaarlijkse rommelmarkt. Het dierenasiel sponsort twee markten per jaar, in juni en het weekend voordat de advent begint. Sangen helpt mee en vindt het leuk om geadopteerde honden weer te zien.

""Het is net een reünie,"" zei Sangen terwijl ze een verhaal vertelde van een Duitse herder met zijn nieuwe familie die zich een weg door de rommelmarkt baande om haar te begroeten.

Het asiel ontvangt vaak honden met een moeilijk karakter en dieren met gezondheidsproblemen wanneer hun baasjes de medische zorg niet kunnen betalen. Het komt wel eens voor dat het asiel een oproep voor donaties op sociale media plaatst als de dierenartsrekening hoog is.

Haar collega's bij USAG Benelux-Brunssum weten dat ze vrijwilligerswerk doet, en hebben dan ook geholpen door verschillende donaties te geven. Een van hen bracht een te grote knuffelhond mee die op een kermis was gewonnen. Het asiel verlootte de hond vervolgens op hun rommelmarkt voor een extra leuk aspect. Sommige collega's hebben huishoudelijke spullen gedoneerd om door te verkopen. Anderen hebben zakken met overbodig dierenvoer of dieren accessoires gegeven.

""Mijn collega's houden van dieren en ze vragen altijd naar het asiel. Dat maakt me ontzettend blij,"" zegt Sangen. ""Ik ben heel dankbaar dat ik collega’s heb zoals zij."""

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Community residents donated, cooked and served a feast for the Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers program here on Thanksgiving Day.

The free dinner was available at the Camp Zama BOSS Warrior Zone Nov. 23, and about 60 Soldiers took advantage of the home-cooked food and chance to spend time with their peers.

Randy Benton, BOSS program adviser for U.S. Army Garrison Japan’s Directorate of Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation, thanked the people who worked behind the scenes to host the event.

“This would have not been possible without the outstanding community support from our residents,” Benton said. “Thank you to everyone who helped us out this year.”

In addition to food for the dinner coming from donations from the community, Benton said the Camp Zama Community Club turkey and ham.

Takila Frazier, an Army Community Services site coordinator, was on hand cooking and serving the food, to include her collard greens, mashed potatoes and banana pudding. She said she just wanted to make sure the Soldiers were taken care of on the holiday.

“If it were my son or daughter, I would want someone to take them under their wing and help,” said Frazier, an Air Force veteran.

BOSS president Spc. Michelle Antonio said the event was an important way to connect with those who might be away from home for the first time.

“The holiday season is especially hard for single Soldiers so if giving them something to do, a place to be at, and especially good food to eat helps make their Thanksgiving away from home easier, we will gladly do that,” she said.

Antonio said the community involvement made the event even more special.

“Thank you to all who helped us make the dinner possible,” she said. “All of us truly appreciate the gift you blessed us with this Thanksgiving. Personally, this is only my second ‘traditional’ Thanksgiving, and [it] has been such an honor to try such delicious food! Truly, I want to thank everyone who donated and took time off their day to make this possible!”

Staff Sgt. Lauren Hassler and Spc. Nayellie Maysonet, both Soldiers stationed at Camp Zama, said they were appreciative of the community efforts to provide them an additional option for Thanksgiving dinner with friends. And both said they told family and friends back in the States not to worry because they were receiving a home-cooked meal.

“This kind of event gives the single Soldiers living in the barracks the opportunity to feel like a part of a community on the holidays,” Hassler said. “It really makes a difference.”

Antonio stressed that Soldiers should continue to utilize the Warrior Zone, especially through the rest of the holiday season.

“As we all know, being away from home is hard enough—holidays are even harder,” she said. “Come out and meet new people. There is a roof, drinks, food, and even entertainment being provided … take advantage of it!

“We wish for you all to know you have a safe space here on Camp Zama, even if it is to just get out of your room—it can get stuffy in there,” Antonio said. “Please come to the Warrior Zone … we are looking forward to seeing you all this upcoming year and taking Camp Zama’s BOSS program to new heights!”"

Representatives from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the National Guard Bureau, U.S. Cyber Command, the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, public utilities, commercial service providers and others joined Guam Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero in the ongoing effort to bolster cybersecurity protection for the island and nation.

“Over the next two days, we are going to lean on one another, exchange ideas, and use our collective expertise to fortify our island and our region’s ability to respond and recover from a cyber attack,” Leon Guerrero said. “To simply say it’s a priority is an understatement. It is mission-critical to our island’s defense and our nation’s defense that we get this done.”

In May 2023, Guam experienced sustained 140-mile-per-hour winds from Typhoon Mawar, wiping out communication systems and other utilities across the 200-square-mile island. On the same day, a multinational advisory and Microsoft announced a malicious computer code was discovered in Guam. The attacks were attributed to Volt Typhoon, a state-sponsored hacking group that conducts espionage and information gathering for the Chinese government.

Guam, home to over 150,000 U.S. citizens, is located in the “typhoon alley” of the Western Pacific. Guam is also closer to Taiwan than Washington is to Fort Bliss, making it the westernmost U.S. soil in the Indo-Pacific.

Additionally, Guam’s Marianas archipelago is the only U.S. soil to have been captured and occupied by an invading force during World War II. This combination of natural and man-made threats to Guam’s fledgling infrastructure, together with Guam’s isolated location, prompted the Guard and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to bring stakeholders together.

Participants at the summit, the second in an ongoing series, addressed capability gaps, resource procurement, organizational structures and more. After two days of presentations and discussions, Guam Homeland Security announced a new, CISA-approved islandwide cybersecurity plan.

Lt. Col. Bumjin Park, chief information officer for the Guam Guard, described the importance of interagency cooperation during the summit.

“When we talk about homeland defense and integrated deterrence, it starts with relationships,” said Park. “Yes, we are generating plans and trying to procure much-needed cyber resources. But really, it’s the human element, like strong partnerships and well-trained communities, even for regular civilian users at home and at work, that provide a strong front against any adversary.”

Leon Guerrero echoed the importance of the whole-of-community approach.

“With so many experts in the room, this integration creates strength that is greater than the sum of its parts,” she said. “This integration showcases our relationships and unity of effort. And when it comes to defending the island and nation we love and call home, this integration deters. Integrated deterrence is a watchword over at INDOPACOM, and this is the work we are doing here today.”

HELEMANO MILITARY RESERVATION, Hawai’i — In the heart of Helemano Military Reservation, where urgent calls for help are met with swift responses, the power of collaboration between the Federal Fire Department, local Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, and the Hawaii Fire Department stands testament to the life-saving impact of mutual aid agreements.

On a critical day, the seamless partnership between these agencies was on full display during a cardiac arrest emergency involving Sgt. Dustin Charles Woodmansee of the 13th Military Police Detachment. The harrowing event, which saw Sgt. Woodmansee fighting for his life, underscores the vital role of interagency cooperation in emergency response.

Mateo Mariano, emergency medical technician, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, a key responder, recalls the intensity of the situation: ""My role was to assist my paramedic partner in every way possible, from EKG monitoring to applying defibrillation pads."" His efforts, alongside those of Lead Paramedic Shalei Meneses, paramedic, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services, were crucial in stabilizing Sgt. Woodmansee.

Meneses, reflecting on the incident, shares, ""It started as a seizure call and escalated to cardiac arrest. The rapid response from FedFire, who were on the scene performing CPR when we arrived, was crucial.""

This sentiment of collaborative effort is echoed by Captain Alon of the Federal Fire Department. ""It was a day where everyone came together – EMS, FedFire, everyone. The result was we saved a life, not just one but an entire family,"" he states, highlighting the broader impact of their actions.

Brittany Woodmansee, Sgt. Woodmansee's wife, played a pivotal role in the initial response. ""I started CPR until the fire department arrived. Thanks to their quick actions and the care at Tripler ICU, my husband is here today, walking and talking,"" she gratefully shares.

Jonathan Poe, battalion chief of the Federal Fire Department, sheds light on the mechanics behind such coordinated responses. ""When our resources are stretched, the mutual aid agreement with city and county is a lifesaver. HFD and our teams have a strong working relationship, and it shows in emergencies like this,"" he explains.

This mutual aid agreement ensures that when one agency is tied up, others step in seamlessly. ""We have a system where city and county's 911 calls are coordinated with our dispatch. This means quicker response times, more hands on deck, and ultimately, more lives saved,"" Poe adds.

The story of Sgt. Woodmansee’s survival is a compelling example of how mutual aid agreements transcend mere policy, becoming a lifeline for those in dire need. His experience, from the initial seizure to his miraculous recovery, is a testament to the dedication and skill of the first responders and medical staff involved.

""I'm here because of the quick actions of EMS and the excellent care at Tripler. I can't thank everyone enough,"" says Sgt. Woodmansee, expressing his gratitude.

This incident in HMR is more than just a successful emergency response. It's a narrative of unity, skill, and the unwavering commitment of various agencies working together to save lives. It's a reminder of how crucial these agreements are in ensuring that when a call for help rings out, it's answered by a unified front, ready to do whatever it takes to bring a person back from the brink."

GRAFENWOEHR, Germany — While the seasons change and leaves start to fall, imagine Medieval castles illuminated by Christmas lights and small stalls offering everything from traditional food, candy and drinks to handmade local tree decorations, candles and hand-crafted wooden toys like vintage merry-go-rounds.

Germany is home of the ‘Christkindlmarkt,’ or Christmas market. These festive markets offer traditional delights for your senses. Aromas of Gluehwein (spiced mulled wine), Lebkuchen (gingerbread) and sausage fill the air as you wander through the cold markets, soaking up the festive atmosphere of the Christmas season again. You cannot find a better place to enjoy it than a snowy winter in Germany!

Ditch the mall, and make the journey to a Christmas market, where you can exchange crowded department stores for lovely wooden chalets and experience a down-to-earth holiday cheer. Some of these street markets date back to the late Middle Ages and can be found throughout Germany — both in big cities and small villages alike. Traditional and popular elements of the holiday season are combined and topped with a good number of regional highlights.

Below you can find a hand-picked selection of Christmas markets — most within a three hours’ drive from Grafenwoehr. It includes some of the largest, oldest and most beautiful markets in Germany.

Karen King-Johnson (center) graduates from the Defense Information School in 1968. She recently shared her experiences in Vietnam. (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — Growing up in a newspaper and military family, Karen King-Johnson wanted to serve her country.

In 1965, as the Vietnam War escalated, she attended Officer Candidate School and commissioned into the Army as a public affairs officer.

She said she was inspired to join the Army by her father, a World War II infantry officer who fought with Gen. George Patton’s 3rd Army before being killed by a mortar blast Nov. 11, 1944.

While in Vietnam, King-Johnson served as the command information officer for the U.S. Army Vietnam in Long Binh and circulation manager for the Stars and Stripes newspaper, publishing 100,000 copies each day. She led a team of 43 enlisted photographers and combat correspondents.

She led a team that distributed the publication in five shops in Vietnam. King-Johnson and her staff also produced another publication, “The Army Reporter.” If a pallet didn’t get delivered, she and her team personally delivered it via a helicopter.

“We were in the field every day, taking pictures and riding with the units,” she said. “Two of my guys are on the Vietnam Wall [Memorial].”

While assigned to the public affairs staff of Army Headquarters-Vietnam, Spc. 4th Class Stephen H. Warner documented the war effort and daily mission of Soldiers in Vietnam through photos and stories for hometown newspapers and military publications like ""Stars and Stripes."" He was killed February 14, 1971. His name is on the Vietnam Wall Memorial. (Photo Credit: Photo courtesy of Gettysburg College) VIEW ORIGINAL

King-Johnson and her staff often embedded with U.S. troops in the field and worked with civilian media. They escorted dozens of media, including legendary American reporter Walter Cronkite.

“We flew almost everywhere we went, and I had a jeep with a [.50-caliber] machine gun,” she said. “There were 754 correspondents in Vietnam. Our job was to escort them safely in and out. We were out in the field, delivering papers. If troops were moving, we were moving.”

They also dealt with logistical challenges in the field. King-Johnson and her staff wore 75-pound wet cell pack radios on their backs that weighed 75 pounds to sustain battery life.

“The radio had to have a 10-foot antenna on it,” she said. “I had a clip on the back of my helmet so it wouldn’t hit me in the head. The young guys would climb the trees and get the antennas up higher so we could communicate with the Air Force. We didn’t want [enemy forces] dropping bombs on us.”

She said they had to “shoot, scoot and communicate.”

“Our job was to make sure everybody back home knew what the guys were doing over there and tell their stories, to make sure no one was forgotten,” she said.

She served in Vietnam with back-to-back tours from 1970 to 1972.

“The VC [Viet Cong] would try to come over the wires at night. They’d turn our ammo around against us, the mortars we had on the outer fence. If we ran out, then they blow back on us. We had to get smart about that,” she said. “They attacked at night.”

Her cousin was a medical evacuation helicopter pilot who flew night and day. He was shot down in 1968. The POW/MIA team is still looking for his remains.

From medical evacuation pilots to nurses to infantrymen, everyone loved the newspapers. If people didn’t get the paper, she heard about it from the three-star general down.

“Everybody loved us,” she said. “We were their favorite thing. They liked us better than food trucks with hot meals. We always gave them extra film. We were using 35-milimeter. My guys would take pictures, and they’d send the extra photos home to their parents. They thought we were great.”

When she returned from Vietnam, she served at Army Recruiting Command and then at Army Training and Doctrine Command, writing field manuals like her father. While there, she met her husband, who served in the Air Force as a Titan II missile commander but retired from the Army and became a federal judge.

King-Johnson, who retired as a major, said she highly recommends serving in the military to the next generation. She said the military provides unique professional training experiences.

“Name a commercial pilot that didn’t get their training in the military,” she said. “You can get so much on-the-job training for free. There are so many different career fields. They’re doing sub training; you’re not going to do that anywhere else in the world. I’m amazed that the American people don’t know what their military does. The military is decades ahead in planning. They knew they were going into the Middle East back when I was in Vietnam.”"

VICENZA, Italy – During the recent flu vaccine campaign at Caserma Ederle, Taylor Campbell used her skills as a registered nurse to volunteer with the American Red Cross, offering shots to community members.

Campbell, who has five years nursing experience, helped the U.S. Army Health Center – Vicenza, accomplish its mission and keep the community healthy. For Campbell, volunteering in healthcare allows her to maintain required hours for licensing even if there is not a paid position for her.

“While I’m relatively new to the area and to volunteering here, the clinic and Red Cross have made me feel very welcomed,” Campbell said. “There is something for everyone, and if you’re able to give a little bit of your time, it can be a very rewarding experience.”

When Amy Branch, an Army spouse, brought her children for a flu shot, she was among the hundreds of people Campbell helped. Having volunteer staff made the process more efficient – she waited just 10 minutes. Without Red Cross volunteers, something like that wouldn’t have been possible, not only here in Italy, but Army wide,” Branch said.

“Volunteers really are at the heart of what the Army does, but especially here in Vicenza, there are so many things, like a flu shot clinic that wouldn’t happen if you didn’t have volunteers,” Branch said.

Volunteers work in nearly every aspect of U.S. Army Garrison Italy. Whatever the job seeker’s skill, there is likely a place on post to volunteer – to gain valuable experience, network for potential job openings and to give back to the Vicenza Military Community.

When Suly Egante arrived in Vicenza, she struggled to find her groove – a new place with limited job opportunities. The Army spouse and mother of two stepped out of her comfort zone to volunteer. She found meaningful experiences at Army Community Service, the Ederle Fitness Center, the USO and the Vicenza Women of Color. Then she turned her skills at multimedia production to the garrison’s public affairs office, who produce The Garrison Outlook – a mobile news site with associated social media. Her videos resonate with community members, helping make others aware of garrison services, events and activities.

“The feeling that you get for doing something you aren’t getting paid for is completely different than having a job and getting paid for it,” Egante said. “There is this gratification that is like, I’m doing something for the world, my community and for people I know, my friends.”

Ruth Ponce-Batts, the garrison’s volunteer program manager, knows the importance of volunteering. A military spouse for the past 21 years, she has volunteered across multiple duty stations for 11 years. When the opportunity came knocking to help people in her community to volunteer, she jumped on it. Now, from her office at ACS, she helps others.

“Volunteering, especially here in Italy, it gives you the opportunity to connect with people,” Ponce-Batts said. “Sometimes when we move over here it’s our first time overseas, and you can be the most resilient person, but it’s still an adjustment to come here, and it gives you that opportunity to talk to other people, know what’s out there, find out all the resources that are available.”"

(Photo Credit: Sarah Patterson) VIEW ORIGINAL

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. – In the complex landscape of U.S. Army Sustainment Command’s logistics infrastructure, Logistics Readiness Centers play a pivotal role in managing materiel and support services to U.S. Army units. From ammunition management to equipment maintenance, and hazardous materials operations to bulk fuel, each LRC's unique mission requires careful analysis. Sarah Nadermann, a management analyst and senior technical subject matter expert in ASC’s G8 (Resource Management) Manpower Management Division, is at the forefront of optimizing these essential LRCs.

Nadermann, who joined ASC in 2020, has spent the past two years leading the operation of analyzing all LRCs in the continental U.S. on their size, complexity, and mission to ensure that they are adequately staffed and have the manpower needed for their workloads. This operation is known as optimization, and to date, 35 out of 57 CONUS LRCs have been optimized thanks to Nadermann’s efforts.

With a total of 78 LRCs worldwide, each with a wide range of supporting requirements that impact Soldiers daily, it is important for Nadermann to get the most comprehensive view of each LRC’s individual mission. This allows her to best assess their manpower needs to enable ASC to get Soldiers what they need, when and where they need it.

To ensure the mission success of each LRC, they must have employees with the right skillset in the right place. “We started by categorizing all LRCs based on mission, size, and type-specific principles in order to maximize standardization and replication of force structure models,” Nadermann explained.

“After sites were bucketed and models were standardized, we met with each LRC one-on-one with their Support Operations Directorate functional area to discuss their structures line by line to ensure they understand how model positions meet their needs and document their additional and unique mission requirements,” she added.

Although it is a tedious process, Nadermann said taking the time to meet one-on-one with each LRC has been invaluable. It has led to increased partnership and understanding between the LRCs and HQ.

The RMM team works closely with ASC G1 (Human Resources) to staff the LRC’s after assessing their manpower requirement level. “Manpower and G1 are uniquely intertwined,” Nadermann said. “After RMM documents a position, G1 is responsible for classifying the positions and hiring. We work very closely and there isn’t a day in a manpower analysts’ job that doesn’t involve collaboration with the G1.""

G1 Human Resources Specialist Shelonda Broyles regularly collaborates with Nadermann. “I can honestly say both directorates do a great job building and maintaining relationships, so we are synced and moving towards the same goals,” she said. ""I am honored to work with Sarah and consider her not only a great colleague, but a great friend as well.”

Prior to Nadermann’s employment at ASC, she worked at U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command in finance and accounting and industrial base operations and Joint Munitions Command in budget and manpower.

The prior knowledge and experience Nadermann brought to the table has led her to become a huge asset for ASC.

“I feel one of my strongest strengths in manpower is due to my extensive background in finance and budget, which allows the greater understanding of manpower and how it affects pay and budget,” she said.

Nadermann’s supervisor Erica Slattery, RMM Chief, also sees the value Nadermann brings.

“Sarah is a self-starter, team player, and change agent who possesses a positive, infectious can-do attitude that is recognized across the command,” Slattery said. “Her enthusiasm and professionalism exemplify commitment to the Army enterprise and personal contributions help propel the organization into the future with staying power.”

Working at ASC has proven to be beneficial for Nadermann as well. RMM has allowed her to advance her career by having opportunities to lead special projects and initiatives, such as LRC optimization.

“I love working at ASC,” Nadermann said of her work in RMM. “ASC gives you the unique ability to interact with military, Civilians, and foreign nationals across the CONUS and OCONUS (outside the continental U.S.) enterprise. It allows you to understand the intricate responsibilities of a logistics command.”

LAS VEGAS – The Nevada National Guard executed Operation Silver Circuit, a comprehensive mission dedicated to ensuring safety and security during the inaugural Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix.

About 90 Soldiers and Airmen from the 72nd Military Police Company, the 152nd Medical Group, and the 92nd Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high-yield Explosives Enhanced Response Force Package Command and Control element were activated Nov. 15-19 to support local law enforcement, including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, and first responders in Clark County.

Their concerted efforts supported local agencies at key locations, including the Las Vegas Strip and two hospitals in the city.

The Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix attracted an estimated 315,000 spectators from around the world and $1.2 billion in economic impact, according to numbers from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Brig. Gen. D. Rodger Waters, Nevada National Guard Joint Staff director, said Operation Silver Circuit enhanced security and emergency response capabilities.

“The deployment is a testament to the ongoing partnership between the Nevada National Guard and local emergency response agencies, showcasing their commitment to public safety and effective collaboration in times of need,” Waters said.

The deployment engaged units with specific roles: the 72nd Military Police Company, providing security expertise; the 152nd Medical Group, emergency and triage response operations at local hospitals; and the 92nd CERFP C2 element, contributing to communications, logistics and strategic decision-making.

Tech. Sgt. Zeshan Mahmood, 152nd Medical Group, the noncommissioned officer in charge, emphasized the importance of proactive measures.

“We grasp the gravity of the situation, the potential for calamity, and why we have been here,” Mahmood said. “We understand that these sorts of things can be very dynamic and fluid. We’re all professionals. So, we know how to handle those situations and how not to.”

Capt. Erica Steele, a critical care nurse overseeing the University Medical Center Hospital site, expressed the group’s commitment.

“We are here to help with triage, basic lifesaving, and patient flow in case of an emergency,” Steele said. “In the case of a mass casualty event, it is crucial that we are here to help the hospital care for their trauma victims.”

Frontline responders, such as Soraya Robertson, a civilian ER Nurse at UMC Hospital, emphasized the invaluable support provided by the Airmen.

“It’s nice to have almost a sidekick, you know, somebody who is a partner that’s like, ‘Hey, I got your back,’ ” Robertson said. “It relieves a lot of stress, and we love the support.”

The 92nd Civil Support Team, one of 57 National Guard teams responding to domestic CBRNE threats, provided an extra layer of expertise and support to the mission.

Beyond the Formula 1 event, the Guard regularly supports local agencies and events throughout the year, including on New Year’s Eve and for the upcoming NFL Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium.

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — It didn’t take Jennifer Zaldivar very long to make her mark at Redstone Arsenal. She has only been with Logistics Readiness Center Redstone, located in Huntsville, Ala., as a transportation specialist since the end of January and already has been named Army Materiel Command Employee of the Quarter for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.

LRC Redstone is one of more than 70 LRCs under U.S. Army Sustainment Command, a major subordinate command of U.S. Army Materiel Command. AMC’s mission is to ensure the Army and Joint Forces have the necessary equipment -- including guns, artillery, ammunition -- to fight and win on the battlefield.

As a transportation specialist in the LRC Redstone Transportation Division for Personal Property, Zaldivar processes official, military dependent, and diplomatic passports. She also reviews preapprovals for household goods moves and passenger travel. ASC is the executing arm of AMC, bringing together all of AMC's capabilities to make sure Soldiers have what they need, when they need it, and where they need it, including at home station.

“Our transportation office supports all AMC customers on Redstone Arsenal by providing personal property, passenger travel, and passport and visa support, including transportation motor pool and freight services,” Zaldivar said.

“My work is important, because by processing accurate and timely passport applications, I am able to support our military with important overseas matters,” Zaldivar said. “I also determine whether extra costs are permitted during household good moves which saves the government money. And by being a contracting officer’s representative, I ensure that the government is being taken care of as well as the contractor.”

Zaldivar said she has always been an ardent supporter of America’s military, and her family has strong military connections. Her grandfather was in the Marine Corps for 28 years, and she was born and raised at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

“All four of his sons, including my dad, joined the Navy,” she said, “and my dad served 30 years, retiring as a command master chief petty officer.” Her husband, Salvadore, was a Marine when she met him but has since left the military.

Getting to where she is took her on a somewhat bumpy road. She and her husband had moved to Alabama from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where both had served as Department of Defense Civilians working for the Navy, in late 2019 when she was hired by CWT SATO Travel in Huntsville, Alabama, home of Redstone Arsenal. She was laid off during the COVID pandemic, but because of her experience in working with government travel situations, she was hired as a quality control inspector for household goods for another company. And after two years, she landed at LRC Redstone.

Zaldivar said she feels very honored to be named Employee of the Quarter after such a short time, and attributes it to her strong work ethic. “I am ecstatic and feel very proud to be honored with this award,” she said. “I take pride in my work,” she added, “and it shows.”"

FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. – Fort George G. Meade held a joint wreath-laying ceremony Sunday, November 19, 2023, alongside representatives from Germany and Italy in honor of the two Italian and 33 German World War II prisoners of war buried at the post cemetery.

Maj. Gen. Trevor Bredenkamp, Commander of the Joint Task Force – National Capital Region and the U.S. Army Military District of Washington, and Lt. Col. Chaveso Cook, Fort Meade Headquarters Command Battalion, welcomed Rear Adm. Axel Ristau, German Defense and Naval Attaché; Col. Paolo Scimone, Italian Military Attaché to the U.S., and guests to pay tribute to those who did not return home.

“Today, we continue a tradition that began just 12 short years ago to recognize the strength of the alliance between our countries and service members,” Bredenkamp said. “Our world has changed a great deal since these young service members were laid to rest. I am humbled to join with representatives from both Germany and Italy to remember and honor the sacrifices made by their countrymen.”

Fort Meade was one of 19 camps where German and Italian prisoners were shipped, receiving 1,600 Germans and 58 Italians in September of 1943. Some of those prisoners died during their captivity and were buried at the installation.

“This location is unique however, as it is the only internment site for foreign prisoners of war in the state of Maryland and remains a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by those who served their nation in a time of war,” Bredenkamp said.

A common duty and knowledge of the danger facing them is a universal understanding between Soldiers that transcends country lines, according to Ristau.

“That is why there will always be a universal common remembrance,” Ristau said. “That is why we are assembling here today remembering fallen German Soldiers resting among Soldiers from other nations who we never met or spoken a word together.”

In his remarks, Scimone stated the freedoms the United States and its allies enjoy today come from the sacrifices made by millions of Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen who fought before, during and after World War II.

“We may change how we operate our weapons, structure and procedures, and it is all part of the business, but the ideals that move us and the examples of our heroes remains steady; unaffected by the flow of time,” Scimone said. “Like our ancestors, we stand together, and we fight together. They did it yesterday, now it is our turn and it’s also our responsibility to inspire our successors.”

Ristau noted there is no better place to start the path for peace than at a war cemetery because it raises awareness of what war means.

“It is precisely this place here that reminds us to differentiate between those who are actually responsible and those who are followers and those who are forced to fight a war that you at the end of the day tried to avoid,” Ristau said. “Let us use this day as a day of understanding, a day to learn from the past and a day not to tolerate violence or to be guided by prejudices for a peaceful future.”

In honor of the fallen, Maj. Rick Barnes of the Maryland Defense Band, Matthew Canales of Howard High School and Connor Wright of Bugles Across America played renditions of “TAPS,” “Der gute Kamerad,” and “Il Silenzio d’Ordinanza,” respectively.

At the conclusion of the ceremony, those in attendance were given time to pay their individual respects to the fallen and to mingle before being invited to share lunch at the Freedom Inn Dining Facility here."

LATHAM, New York -- The New York Army National Guard was tops in recruiting and retaining Soldiers for federal fiscal year 2023, outdoing the other 53 state and territorial Army National Guards, according to figures released by the Army National Guard.

The New York Army National Guard achieved a score of 118.12 percent for the 12 months from October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023, according to a year-end analysis of each state’s recruiting and retention success.

The score is based on the number of enlisted Soldiers, the number of new officers and warrant officers who joined, and the number of Soldiers who reenlisted as a percentage of each state’s total Army Guard strength.

A score of 100 percent means the state met its recruiting goals. Scores above 100 percent indicate a state exceeded those recruiting goals.

This was the third time that New York was rated best in recruiting among the states with “large” Army National Guard contingents and the second time the New York Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Battalion has been rated best in the nation, according to Lt. Col. Josh Heimroth, the commander of New York’s recruiting force.

At the beginning of fiscal year 2023, the New York National Guard was authorized a strength of 10,209 Soldiers and had 10,706 personnel assigned.

The New York Army Guard finished the fiscal year with 10,969 Soldiers in the ranks. According to New York National Guard officials, this reflected an increase of 270 soldiers, 760 soldiers above the authorized strength for New York’s Army Guard.

During that fiscal year, the New York Army National Guard recruited 1,594 Soldiers, with 1,521 new enlisted Soldiers and 73 officers who were not previously in the ranks, according to Heimroth.

Another 1,731 Soldiers chose to reenlist in the New York Army National Guard during the year, while 1,235 Soldiers left the force.

All these gains and relatively few losses resulted in New York finishing first in overall recruiting achievement for 2023, Heimroth said.

“We just had the best year for our retention mission that we have ever had,” Heimroth said.

“Our people focused, and Soldier first strategy is showing results. Our leaders at every level and our recruiting and retention teams are performing at an exceptionally high performing level of effort and achievement,” said Major General Ray Shields, the adjutant general of New York.

Success in recruiting and retention also led to the Army Guard ranking New York as the number one state for Army Guard “Strength Health” in 2023, according to Col. Mark Frank, the personnel officer for the New York Army National Guard.

The combination of assigned strength, recruiting efforts, moving Soldiers who missed drills out of the ranks without delay, resulted in this designation for fiscal year 2023, Frank explained.

This recruiting and retention success means that New York currently fields the fourth largest Army National Guard, Frank said. This recruiting success has also allowed New York to add a division artillery headquarters and a finance battalion headquarters to the Army Guard force structure, he said .

Recruiting and retention success is a result of Shield’s emphasis on recruiting and retention, which has been embraced by leaders at all levels, said Command Sgt. Major Anthony Abbate, the New York Army Guard’s Recruiting and Retention Battalion senior enlisted advisor.

“It is the senior NCOs and company leadership teams working with their recruiters and hiring and training their NCOs to enlist people out in their communities and working and forming relationships,” Abbate said.

Retention success is also being driven by New York Army Guard leaders offering Soldiers the opportunity to go to schools to further their military careers and participate in unique training opportunities, like overseas training exercises to Brazil, he said.

“We continue to invest in our Soldiers,” he said.

New York National Guard Soldiers have been busy at home responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and now a migrant crisis, so there is “a sense of fulfillment and the belief that what they are doing matters,” Abbate said.

A real key, Abbate said, is the adjutant general’s commitment to resourcing the recruiters. Out of the over 800 Active Guard and Reserve Soldiers in the New York Army National Guard, 207 are working in recruiting, he said.

The command is committed to keeping the recruiting battalion full – with 124 “production recruiters” interacting with potential Soldiers – and allowing recruiters to be successful by giving them autonomy, Abbate said.

Recruiting, he said, is vital.

“We are the only [occupational specialty] in the military that’s wartime mission and peacetime mission are the same,” Abbate said."

WASHINGTON – Throughout November, a display at the Pentagon titled, “Why We Serve” highlights how Native Americans have served in all the nation’s wars since the Revolutionary War.

The Defense Department and the nation celebrate National American Indian and Alaska Heritage Month every November.

“[Native American Heritage Month] is an opportunity to recognize the rich and diverse cultures, traditions, stories, and important contributions of Native American and Alaskan Native people,” said Edward Blauvelt, Society of American Indian Government Employees, or SAIGE, warrior society director.

Throughout America’s history, 22 Native American servicemembers earned the Medal of Honor, 29 were U.S. Soldiers.

About 190,000 American Indians are military veterans. The U.S. is about 1.4% Native.

“Our Army is made up of Soldiers, their family members and civilians who come from all of the cultures in our American society,” said Brig. Gen. Joe Hilbert, director, Army force development. “In essence, we are America. Recognizing and celebrating our Native American cultures and those within our ranks who are serving or who have served and have come from those cultures, it is a way to celebrate us. It’s an opportunity to recognize the great contributions Native Americans have provided us, and what they as a people have contributed to our great nation and our Army.”

Blauvelt said many of the warfare and battle tactics the service branches use today originated from the Native Americans.

“The American Indian, Alaskan Native style of warfare is so ingrained into America that it is now America’s version of warfare, and along with excellent training and equipment, it makes the U.S. military superior on the battlefield,” said Blauvelt.

These tactics include their perseverance, skulking (now known as guerrilla warfare), blitz attacks such as shock and awe, and the use of stealth technology.

Native Americans would skulk game when hunting. They used this for enemy attacks as well.

When the Mohawks skulked, they hid in the terrain to surprise attack the enemy, along with diversions and ambushes. Skulking was an essential mode of warfare for the forest Indians in the northeastern U.S. It enraged the European officers who viewed it as being against the “rules of war,” though they had skulked in wars in Ireland, Scotland, France, and other European countries.

Crazy Horse of the Oglala Lakota tribe performed quick attacks and divided the enemy. The Apache leader Geronimo and the Seminole people used resistance fighting with hit-and-run tactics. Muscogee warriors used night attacks. The overall battle strategy of these Native American leaders focused on preserving the lives of the individual warrior, he said.

Infantrymen Sgt. Taylor Ericco, Spc. Mark Quijada, Pfc. Matthew Pryor and Pfc. Johnathan Stewart of the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, conduct Military Operation in Urban Terrain, using similar guerilla tactics traditionally used by Native American warriors.

This warfighting blueprint evolved into the current multi-domain battle tactic concept aimed at overcoming local threats with small units instead of exposing major assets decentralized command structures. These stealth structures include aircraft, drones, ships, tanks and missiles; camouflage to hide assets; and decoys such as drones and missiles.

Stealth methods include swarming to engage an adversary from all directions simultaneously, nighttime special operations teams and using tactics for surprise and mobility.

The U.S. military evolved using Native American guerilla tactics in Vietnam, Afghanistan and other modern conflicts.

Native American leader Crazy Horse and the plains tribes misled Gen. George Crook and his troops to rest at the bottom of a valley. They hid their numbers by walking and attacking in a single file. They waited until they were upon the enemy before they broke formation and surprised them with their numbers with devastating results against Crook’s command.

They also sowed the battlefield with confusion. A similar tactic in today’s battlefield was used during the U.S. “shock and awe” campaign, part of the 2003 Iraq invasion.

During the Revolutionary War, Native American warriors saw the war as an internal battle and didn’t want to get involved. Still, tribal members fed troops at Valley Forge, served as minutemen, or fought with colonists if their tribes were directly attacked.

After the Revolutionary War, many tribes fought against the U.S. as the nation expanded westward. Still, many Native Americans fought with the Army right up to the American Civil War.

Standouts who fought during the Civil War were Cherokee Gen. Stand Watie and Seneca Gen. Ely Parker, also known as Donehogawa.

Between 1872 and 1890, 16 native scouts were awarded the Medal of Honor. During the Indian Wars, 5,817 American Indians served as scouts during the 81 years.

The War Department authorized Native Americans to be enlisted in the Army and serve in Indian companies. Each existing regiment of cavalry would contain one Indian regiment. A maximum of 55 Indians were authorized for each company or troop.

Some Native Americans supported the programs while others fought against it. American Indians served in the Spanish-American War and earned Theodore Roosevelt’s highest regard, Blauvelt said.

Blauvelt said that even though they couldn’t vote and their numbers were thin, the American Indians were registering for the draft or volunteering for World War I.

“Americans were praising them for their virtues, courage, energy and daring,” he said. “Tribes with elite warrior societies sent their sons willingly.”

American Indians were some of the first to land in France during the last week of June 1918. Their service was recognized when seven Indians from seven tribes accompanied General Pershing in the French parade to honor Americans.

American Indians fought in every major engagement of World War I. Pvt. Joseph Oklahombi, Choctaw, Company D, 141st Infantry Regiment, 36th Division, earned the French Croix de Guerre, a French military medal, for sprinting across the battlefield and capturing 171 prisoners.

The most famous Native American servicemembers from World War I and II were the code talkers from the Choctaw, Cheyenne, Cherokee, Comanche, Ho-Chunk, Osage, and Yankton Sioux tribes.

These Native American service members used their traditional tribal languages to send Allied messages in code during World War I and II. They were present in battles such as D-Day and Iwo Jima. They kept their work secret, and their codes were never deciphered by Japan or Germany. In 2001, they received Congressional Gold Medals for their work.

During World War II, 44,000 Native Americans from 50 tribes of an estimated population of under 400,000 served on active duty, including nearly 800 women. About 150,000 served or supported the war effort. The Army used about 534 code talkers from the Comanche, Meskwaki, Chippewa, Oneida, Hopi, and Dine nations during World War II.

More than 6,300 Alaska Natives from 107 communities volunteered to serve in the Alaska Territorial Guard during World War II.

Native Americans continue to serve today.

“American Indians and Alaskan Natives have made major military contributions to this nation that helped America win battles and wars at crucial moments in history,” Blauvelt said."

WASHINGTON - Pfc. Marques Downing thrives on a good challenge, problem-solving and constant change. He spent most of the past two years working in information technology, studying the latest computer networks and systems courses.

“It can be a lucrative career that offers flexibility, but there’s a lot of certificates and classes,” Downing said. “New technology and software are constantly coming out and you have to learn it.”

Last year, Downing realized he wanted a more hands-on job.

“I’m loving every second of my new job,” he said. “I like getting my hands dirty.”

Downing is one of dozens of wheeled vehicle mechanics who keep tactical vehicles operational at the District of Columbia National Guard’s Combined Support Maintenance Shop at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling.

“We’re like the D.C. National Guard’s own mechanic shop. We’re here to make sure people can get from point A to point B,” Downing said.

On any given morning, there is a line of mission-critical vehicles to test, maintain or repair.

“Our mission is to provide readily, fully mission-capable vehicles to the D.C. National Guard,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Courtney Britton, supervisory surface maintenance specialist, officer in charge for the DCARNG Surface Equipment Maintenance Facilities. “Whatever mission is tasked to the D.C. National Guard, and no matter where it is, we have the vehicle to support it.”

Britton leads the operation of four maintenance shops, while Chief Warrant Officer 2 John Eldridge ensures mechanics are technically sound in maintenance and recovery to fulfill mission requirements.

“Medium Tactical Vehicles, Light Medium Tactical Vehicles, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicles — there’s different types of vehicles for different operations,” Eldridge said. “The vehicles belong to the units ... and we are responsible for the maintenance. So, we’re constantly coordinating with units and honing our skills.”

Eldridge stresses expertise and skill aren’t the only traits that keep the operation thriving; he values people in the organization.

“If I likened it like a vehicle, bad parts create bad output, but good parts create good output,” CW2 Eldridge said. “We’ve got good people working in here.”

Britton says preventative maintenance for the D.C. National Guard motor pool is not reserved for a particular season but lasts throughout the year.

“The maintenance community doesn’t have a slow period,” he said. “While requests for vehicles for annual training peak during the summer months, preventative maintenance checks and services are still done every month by individual units on every vehicle in stock.

One of the mechanics helping to keep vehicles fully mission-capable for the past three months is Downing, one of the newest wheeled vehicle mechanics. He likes the responsibility of knowing he can support mission-ready personnel in training, war or national emergency.

“Every week, there’s something new to learn or get my hands on to figure out,” Downing said.

FORT SHAFTER, Hawai’i – In a concerted effort to bolster fire prevention and enhance the safety of military families, U.S. Army Garrison Hawai’i conducted a comprehensive vegetation survey at Fort Shafter. The survey, led by the Deputy to the Garrison Commander, Ms. Brandi G. Skasik, took place on Friday, November 17, marking a significant step towards proactive fire risk mitigation.

The team, comprising key civilian personnel, explored densely vegetated areas to discuss and strategize on fire mitigation techniques. The diverse group of attendees, representing departments and services like Island Palm Communities, Directorate of Public Works, Natural Resources, Wildland Fire, Federal Fire, and Safety, addressed vital concerns related to tree trimming, grass cutting, preservation of native species, and fire prevention.

""The safety and well-being of our residents are paramount. This survey is a crucial initiative by USAG-Hawai'i to assess fire risks and discuss strategic mitigation for the community's safety,"" commented Iris KirkPilger, project director for Island Palm Communities.

The day's activities involved assessing various risks and discussing potential quick-fix solutions. The approach was comprehensive, looking into factors like combustible fences, proximity of vegetation to structures, and the condition of gutters and parking areas. This proactive stance reflects the Garrison's commitment to the safety and well-being of its residents.

Richard Marsh from Installation Management Command Pacific noted, ""This is about more than just surveying; it's about integrating knowledge across departments to achieve the best outcomes for fire prevention and community safety.""

The survey's findings will guide the development of targeted strategies to manage fire risks effectively. This initiative at Fort Shafter is just the beginning, with plans to extend similar surveys to other Army installations on Oahu.

""Today’s effort is a testament to our commitment to create outstanding communities where military families can live, work, and thrive,"" said Ms. Skasik, emphasizing the Garrison's dedication to continuous improvement in safety measures."

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – The Housing Office here is currently looking to form a committee to gather resident input on a new policy that may allow pets in the housing towers.

“We want everybody to have an active role in [the policy] and try to make it their own,” said Jesus Chavarria, the housing division chief.

The two high-rise apartment-style complexes here only permit cats on the first floor, while residents in single-family homes and townhomes can have up to two pets, including cats and dogs, with some breed restrictions set by the Japanese government.

An updated policy, which housing officials plan to publish this spring using resident feedback and pet-related rules found in other documents, may help ease the transition for incoming pet owners.

While still in its early stages, Chavarria said the policy will likely grant tower residents the option to have at least a small pet.

“We’re trying to aim for the right size,” he said. “For apartment living, I don’t know if we would want a 100-pound dog sitting in there and barking and creating a lot of noise.”

There will be other issues to consider as well, he said, such as space for designated pet relief areas.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan, introduced the possibility of changes to the policy during a housing town hall in September.

While he said the garrison tries to accommodate several different things for residents, he noted that a new pet policy would require community involvement for it to work.

“The option to have pets in the towers is being relooked,” Hunter said at the meeting. “Every family comes with its unique situations, and … pets are [often] a big part of that.”

Chavarria said his office needs to listen to the community on this topic, since a pet is something that family members become attached to and can provide them comfort during stressful times.

“A pet is part of the family,” he said. “[It] helps pull you through grief or it's your friend when you're away from home.”

Chavarria said a committee of at least 10 residents from both towers, with a mix of people who are pet lovers or not, could help guide the draft policy in the right direction.

“I want everyone to have a comfortable home,” he said. “The more the volunteers we have to help out with that would be great.”

(Editor’s Note: Tower residents who are interested in serving on the committee to discuss changes to the pet policy can contact Chavarria at DSN: 263-3441 or 046-407-3441.)

ROŻYŃSK WIELKI, Poland — U.S. Army Soldiers with Task Force Marne visited a local school to learn about Polish culture and to familiarize Polish children with American culture near Bemowo Piskie Training Area, Nov. 15, 2023.

A group of U.S. Army Soldiers with Bravo “Barbarian” Company, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, serving as part of NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group Poland, met with the school staff and students of Primary School Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński as part of an effort to learn about Polish culture and connect with local citizens.

Staff Sgt. Bryce Roatch, a tank commander with Barbarian Company, explained that with the large, nearby presence of the NATO base, it’s important to help the children understand that the Soldiers are friendly and not scary and why they are serving in Poland. Likewise, learning about Polish culture and history helps the American Soldiers understand why their service in Poland is so important.

“This is an opportunity for us not just to show that we’re scary beings with big scary vehicles,” Roatch said. “We’re actually here to learn and understand what’s going on with the local kids here. It’s a huge way to show the next generation of Polish children that this is not only a cool opportunity; it’s very fun.”

“My idea for cooperation with Battle Group Poland when I became the director of our school in 2018 was that children have the opportunity of meeting new cultures without going out of school,” Grzegorz Kacperski, the director of Primary School Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, said. “Because we, geographically, have this honor that you are near here. We wanted to take the benefit [of teaching Polish culture] for American Soldiers not just as Soldiers but mainly as American Citizens.”

The students taught the Soldiers about Poland’s history and one of Poland’s most notable figures in its struggle for independence.

“Józef Piłsudski was the most important person in Polish independence after 1918,” Kacperski said. “American Soldiers are here to help us keep our independence. Leaving Poland, they should know, first of all, why they were here… for Polish people they are [helping to keep] the independence which was started by Piłsudski.”

Roatch, in turn, gave a presentation to the students about the culture of the U.S. Army, the state of Georgia, and the United States. The Soldiers also did some arts and crafts with the students, which allowed them to learn words in each other’s languages, as well as their interests and backgrounds. The Soldiers toured the school and answered the students’ questions in different classrooms.

“The children here are really smart and nice,” Cpl. Daemazejah Corbett, a signal operations support specialist with Barbarian Company, said. “They asked me a lot of questions, so I got to talk to them a lot. I had a good time.”

“For me, it’s very fun, because I get to see my Soldiers interact and grow in not just public speaking but also being able to see the different attributes and ways that cultures talk, and do similar things that we do over in Georgia,” Roatch said. “Getting to watch them sit down and relate is notably critical to their growth in being NCOs and Soldiers, but I think it’s critical in our future here and for them when they end up being staff sergeants and sergeants first class.”

“I got to talk to some of the children, where we learned a little about them,” Corbett said. “I’m realizing that we’re all kind of the same in a way. They like some of the stuff I did… I connected with them a little bit more.”

Roatch believes that it is important for Soldiers to get comfortable interacting with local populations, whether it be in Poland, the Middle East, or wherever they may be serving, so they can build trust and positive relations with local populaces.

“We’re here for now, but we don’t know where the conflict is tomorrow,” Roatch said. “A lot of these Soldiers — they may stay in or they may not — when they become my position, it's important for me and for them to see that they need to be able to trust their community when times are tough.”

PABRADE, Lithuania — Task Force Marne Soldiers and their Lithuanian Allies honed their combat skills during a force-on-force training exercise at Pabrade Training Area, Nov. 16-17.

Known as Strong Griffin 2023, the exercise saw U.S. Soldiers with 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, serve as an opposing fighting force for the Griffin Brigade of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, which provided the NATO Allies an opportunity to share each other’s defensive and offensive tactics, strategies, and standard operating procedures.

“Strong Griffin is an opportunity for us to train together and build towards interoperability procedurally, technically, and the human domain,” U.S. Army Lt. Col. David W. Griffith, commander of 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, said. “It allows us to train tactics, techniques, and procedures so we can operate better with each other.”

Task Force Marne Soldiers conducted infantry and armored offensive operations against Lithuanian Armed Forces partners in a series of training exercises across rural and urban environments to test their combat readiness. Lithuanians, in turn, prepared a defense to counter the American attacks. In the training scenario, the American forces worked their way through a forest environment in an effort to seize a town, while the Lithuanians defended the territory.

Both armies were able to adapt and adjust to their situations which allowed them to learn how each other operated as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses in real time.

“The end goal, of course from the tactical perspective… we check the abilities and the gaps we have within the training cycle,” Lithuanian Army Col. Aurelijus Alasauskas, commander of the Griffin Brigade, said. “So if we see that everything goes so well, I don’t think we’re really organizing our exercise the proper way. We happened to see some gaps already, which might be training points for the next year.”

Lithuanian Soldiers trained on their light and anti-tank infantry tactics against an armored force with the help of Task Force Marne tanks.

“We have tanks. We have larger vehicles than they do [in the exercise],” U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Jaden Brown, a tank commander with Alpha “Ares” Company, 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, said. “Bringing in all that heavy machinery against a much lighter force allows them to develop how they would act against a much better equipped, much larger force,”

In turn, Task Force Marne tank crews adapted their tactics to the forested terrain, which meant tankers stayed vigilant by looking out for smaller, light infantry in the tree lines versus much more visible larger vehicles, according to Brown.

Having the opportunity to face each other in a force-on-force exercise during Strong Griffin ultimately made the two NATO allies stronger together. The exercise also allowed the two allies to familiarize themselves with the tactics and techniques they’d employ together as well as similar terrain and environments they might encounter one day on the battlefield together.

“It’s not about fighting [against] each other, it’s about fighting together with a purpose,” Alasauskas said. “So with the U.S. providing offensive capabilities, and Lithuania providing defense capabilities — when you combine those two into one — you have a very mobile, aggressive defense, which is not letting the forces penetrate you or to maneuver in front of you. So you’re leading even in the defense position. This is the main purpose: To lead the battle the way you want to.”

“It’s been an incredibly rewarding experience working with the Lithuanians,” Griffith said. “They’ve been a great partner here in Pabrade. We’ve worked together to define each other's training objectives. We built an exercise that allowed us both to reach them.”

WASHINGTON — The Army’s top leader honored an organization dedicated to funding the education of military children whose parents made the ultimate sacrifice Tuesday morning.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth awarded members of the Children of the Fallen Patriots Foundation the 2023 Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Award, which highlights the efforts of those who profoundly impacted the lives of service members and their families.

Since 2002, CFP has provided $70 million in scholarships and grants to nearly 3,000 children of Gold Star families, or families of veterans who died in combat, including about 1,600 graduates.

“The Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation serves those who have given the most to this nation – our Gold Star families,” Wormuth said during a Pentagon ceremony. “They know the sacrifice of our military families, and they know that the greatest of these sacrifices is to lose a loved one in service to the nation. They also know that one of the greatest challenges faced by parents and students alike is the rising cost of education.”

A 2022 study showed about 25,000 military children today have lost parents in service-related deaths. CFP identified about 12,000 of those children and has pledged to fund any college costs that exceeds Department of Veterans Affairs scholarships for qualified recipients.

The foundation has closed the gap between supplemented expenses and the total cost of a four-year college degree. On average, that funding disparity totals to about $25,000 annually per student.

“The impact that this makes – to lift the financial burden from our Gold Star families, to increase the educational and financial standing of those surviving children, and to realize our fallen service members dreams of setting their children on the road to success – is immeasurable,” Wormuth said.

Steve Smith, a retired Army officer, and CFP development operations supervisor, Kayla Martin, accepted the award in a Pentagon ceremony Tuesday morning.

The roots of the Children of the Fallen Patriots organization began more than 30 years ago, when founder David Kim, then a young Army officer, faced his first bout with tragedy in his military career.

During Operation Just Cause in December 1989, U.S. forces invaded Panama to remove dictator Manuel Noriega from power and restore democracy in the Central American country.

Sgt. William Delaney Gibbs, a member of Kim’s unit, the 7th Infantry Division, died during the operation, leaving behind his wife and unborn daughter. Moved by the tragedy, Fisher, would eventually found Children of the Fallen Patriots in 2002.

More than two decades later, the foundation not only aids those whose parents died in combat, but also those who passed away in training accidents, illnesses and even suicide. CFP does not place limits on its funding for the children’s college expenses, instead it works with each student to assure they graduate without debt.

“Our nation is forever in debt to these children – children who didn’t choose the military life for themselves, but who loved someone who served and wore the cloth of our nation,” Wormuth said. “The Fishers knew this and were dedicated to repaying this debt. And the Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation knows this and has shown us all what it means to make a difference in the lives of these Gold Star families.”

Sixteen of CFP’s 27 full-time staff come from Gold Star families, including four veterans and 13 scholarship recipients.

Philanthropists Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher established the Fisher House Foundation in 1990 to give free housing to family members of hospitalized U.S. troops during treatment. In honor of their efforts, the Army, Air Force and Navy created the award in 1996.

BETHEL, Alaska - The Alaska National Guard’s annual community outreach program, Operation Santa Claus, took an unexpected turn this year as its mission to bring holiday joy to the village of Tuluksak became a vital lifeline for a resident of the nearby village of Napaskiak.

On Nov. 15, the Alaska Army National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter supporting Operation Santa Claus was en route to deliver gifts and holiday cheer to the children of Tuluksak when an urgent call for assistance came into the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

A critically ill patient in Napaskiak required immediate medical evacuation, but adverse weather and icy runway conditions prevented civilian air ambulances from landing there.

Napaskiak is five miles south of Bethel on the other side of the Kuskokwim River. With river ice restricting travel by boat and insufficient snow and ice for travel by snowmachine or ice road, evacuation by helicopter was the only option.

As soon as the AKARNG accepted the mission from the AKRCC, the pilots, Chief Warrant Officers 2 Colton Bell and David Berg, assigned to Golf Company, 2-211th (General Support Aviation Battalion), altered their mission plan to prioritize the medevac.

Having just completed one of two scheduled Operation Santa Claus flights to Tuluksak, the aircrew added two LifeMed paramedics and equipment onto the helicopter with the remaining gifts and volunteers already on board and immediately headed to Napaskiak.

Bell said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Nick Lime, an aviation maintenance technician and crew chief assigned to Delta Company, 2-211th (GSAB), played a crucial role in the team accomplishing both missions within seven hours despite rainy and icy weather conditions.

“He assisted greatly in the configuration of the aircraft and loading and unloading of patients, medics and passengers even with the mission changes and difficult weather conditions,” said Bell. “Our UH-60L is able to transport up to 13 passengers with a full assortment of seats. In this case, we didn’t need all of them, so we took out the extra seats to make room for the presents, medical equipment and paramedics.”

Less than five minutes after departing Bethel, the helicopter touched down in Napaskiak, delivering the paramedics and medical equipment to stabilize the patient for travel to the local clinic, a process expected to take 30-40 minutes.

The aircrew flew 15 minutes to Tuluksak to deliver the remaining volunteers and gifts.

They immediately returned to Napaskiak to pick up the paramedics and patient. They flew them to the Army Aviation Operating Facility in Bethel, where the patient was transferred to a LifeMed ambulance. As of Nov. 16, the patient was in stable condition and awaiting transport via civilian air ambulance to an Anchorage hospital.

“The integration of the LifeMed folks went seamlessly due to previous detailed cold-load trainings and lessons learned in past joint medevac missions,” said Bell. “The coordination with LifeMed was extremely smooth since Chief Warrant Officer 3 Bryan Kruse was in the hangar during the mission and coordinated with LifeMed, RCC, and (a) state Army aviation officer while the crew continued executing the Op Santa mission simultaneously.”

While the Black Hawk and crew completed the medevac mission, Santa, Mrs. Claus and 10 other Alaska National Guard and Salvation Army volunteers delivered an early Christmas to the children of Tuluksak as planned. After celebrating with gifts, ice cream and photos with Santa, the team loaded back onto the Black Hawk for the trip back to the AKARNG aviation facility, where they transferred to an Alaska Air National Guard C-17 Globemaster III for the final leg back to JBER.

“This mission was a great example of how the Alaska National Guard is able to work jointly between Army, Air Force and multiple civilian agencies to support the local population through state missions like Operation Santa and through federal missions such as this RCC request for assistance,” said Bell. “This mission specifically showcases our abilities to adapt to multiple, rapidly changing missions while operating in adverse weather while still completing them efficiently and safely.”

Phillips Jr., from Port Sulphur, Louisiana, is a proud Native American who has more than 21 years of service. (Photo Credit: Courtesy) VIEW ORIGINAL

PINEVILLE, La. – November is Native American and Alaskan Heritage Month, a time to acknowledge the rich and diverse cultures and histories of native Alaskans and Native Americans.

Louisiana Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Bruce A. Phillips Jr. is a proud Native American who has served in the military for over 21 years.

In 2002, Phillips enlisted in the National Guard as an aircraft fueler, reclassing to human resources specialist in 2013. He deployed to Iraq to support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

“From maintaining personnel readiness to ensuring aircraft do not fall from the sky, I enjoy being trained in a variety of skill sets,” said Phillips. “This diversity in skills allows me to better serve the LANG and the people of Jackson Barracks.”

Phillips didn’t plan on a military career.

“My grandfather served in Vietnam,” Phillips explained. “Listening to his stories and watching how he carried himself was a huge influence on me. His guidance has led me in both my military career as well as my personal life.”

His father played a pivotal role in developing an appreciation for his Native American heritage and a positive approach to life.

“I looked up the most to my father,” said Phillips. “He taught me how a man should be, how a man should lead and to be a chief at everything you do. He also taught me to be a good cook and hunter and to provide for my family.”

Phillips continues some of the traditions of his Native American lineage. He attends powwows, has dreamcatchers and uses home remedies.

“I still attend traditional things like powwows, but I especially enjoy fishing and bow hunting. And we Native Americans have such good hair,” he joked.

When not working at Jackson Barracks or responding to natural disasters, Phillips enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.

As a federal technician and reservist with the LANG, Phillips says he understands the benefits of being a Guardsman and serving the community.

“This is an excellent way to earn a college degree while enjoying other benefits the Guard has to offer,” he said. “Living the Guard lifestyle teaches you how to thrive in the civilian world, both mentally and physically. The money and friendships are also an enjoyable part of what the Louisiana National Guard has to offer.”

In 1990, President George H. W. Bush approved a joint resolution designating November 1990 “National American Indian Heritage Month.” Similar proclamations, under variants on the name (including “Native American Heritage Month” and “National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month”), have been issued each year since 1994.

“We are all people under the same roof,” Phillips said. “This month not only benefits Native Americans but people of every heritage that have contributed to what American culture is today. ... We are all in this world together with nowhere else to go, so let’s work together.”

RAPID CITY, S.D. – Elizabeth “Promise” Crawford was promoted to the rank of sergeant major in the South Dakota Army National Guard during a ceremony on Camp Rapid Nov. 9.

“It gives me great pleasure to be the first to address you as sergeant major. You are an outstanding Soldier, you’ve never disappointed,” said Col. Phillip Stiles. “You are always a hard worker and I have a ton of respect for you. I would send my son or daughter to war underneath you any day, any time.“

Crawford thanked her family for laying the foundation she built her character on — love, passion and courage — and for giving her a life that led her to join the Army.

“I’ve had an amazing career and I’m so glad I get to finish it here at Joint Force Headquarters,” said Sgt. Maj. Crawford.

She joined the Army in 1996 and served five years on active duty, stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, and Vilsek, Germany, before becoming a South Dakota Army National Guard member in 2002.

“She’s very deserving of everything she’s gotten in life and she’s worked very hard to get there, but she didn’t do it alone,“ said Marty Reum, retired U.S. Army combat veteran and mentor to Crawford. “With the support of her family, fellow Soldiers, those past and present, they’ve all influenced her life and helped her get to where she is today.”

Crawford incorporated her culture into her ceremony with a traditional flag song, a prayer and an honor song. She presented three satin star quilts to Stiles, Lt. Col. Brian Hass, and Command Sgt. Maj. Monte Patterson.

“These men have provided me with sound guidance and mentorship that I have often relied upon their expertise and advice for over 20 years,“ she said. “It’s to say thank you for all of the support and encouragement they’ve given me in my career.”

Crawford is from Poplar, Montana, and the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Indian Reservation.

“My advice is to always remember who you are and where you came from, keep yourself grounded to the earth and always carry yourself with pride and respect,” Crawford said.

She served as the supply NCO for the 147th Field Artillery Brigade, senior supply NCO for the 109th Reginal Support Group, 1st sergeant for the 152nd Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, and S4 senior operations sergeant for the 196th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade. Crawford was recently selected to mentor and lead as a member of the Joint Staff, supporting performance excellence programs, the State Partnership Program and domestic operations.

Crawford has deployed on federal missions three times, to Afghanistan in 2013, Kuwait in 2016 and Djibouti in 2020-2021.

“This is incredible,” said U.S. Navy Cmdr. Mary Beth Linnell, an optometrist from the USNS Mercy docked in Majuro, Republic of the Marshall Islands. “This is the whole reason that I decided to stay in the Navy after my initial three-year obligation. This is what I always hoped to do.”

Linnell and her team of Sailors flew to Kwajalein in early November to provide medical assistance and care for the residents of Ebeye recently, providing vision screenings and glasses dispensing to the Kwajalein Elementary School students, along with a dental team providing dental screenings and a cardiologist providing heart exams.

“I was able to deploy back in 2007 and 2009 and I waited until now to do it again,” said Linnell. “This is the best thing I’ve ever done in my 16 years in the Navy – the planning for the mission and the mission itself.”

Linnell explained that her team will go back to Majuro to perform vision screenings and glasses dispensing at the Lara Clinic as well as the Majuro Hospital. She said that the next stop on their Pacific tour will be the Solomon Islands where they will provide medical coverage for the Pacific Games. “I will be going to the outer islands to provide vision screenings again and glasses dispensing. It will be an adventure.""

The largest contingent of Sailors provided dental screenings and dental education to more than 800 students over two days on Ebeye, led by Lt. Cdr. Amie Heim, pediatric dentist with the USNS Mercy.

“For the dental component, we screened and treated about 800 children in the local community. We did exams to find out what kind of dental problems they might have or cavities or infections. We painted fluoride vitamins to make their teeth really strong and then provided dental education to try to teach kids the right way to brush and how to take care of their teeth. Then we used all that information to give to the local dentist at the Ebeye Hospital dental clinic where he will continue to do some of the treatment. We had one of our own dentists over the two days helping with the treatments as well.”

Heim said that this is her first Pacific Partnership mission but she deployed for the Continuing Promise mission last year on the sister hospital ship, the USNS Comfort.

“This is something I really enjoy doing,” said Heim. “In dental school, I always signed up for all the mission trips possible. I always raised my hand. It’s just an honor and a privilege to be able to do it on a much larger scale in the Navy. This time was even more exciting because I go to see it from the ground up in the role of a dental planner.”

Heim was here earlier this summer to meet people in the local community to figure out what the needs are here to come up with a plan together.

What was the response from the community like? “Oh my gosh, it was incredible,” Heim said. “All the kids running in the street after we did some of the education with the big toothbrush. They were so happy and everywhere we went they were welcoming and giving us high fives and saluting us.

“Honestly, I was so very touched by the ceremony at the hospital we attended and all the folks at the hospital and elementary school who came to thank us. From a place that, they will tell you that they don’t have a lot but they have big hearts, you could feel that today. It was just a real honor and a privilege to be able to be a part of that and give back to that community.”

The third aspect of the USNS Mercy visit to Ebeye was having a cardiologist conducting exams on the populace.

U.S. Navy Cdr. Matt Russell, cardiologist with the USNS Mercy, said there was a backlog of about 150 patients who need both pediatric and adult echocardiography.

“The first two days we spent doing mostly adults, looking for patients with heart issues,” Russell said. “In total we did 26 echocardiography studies and saw 26 patients and consultations over the two days. Today we saw 13 pediatric patients of varying conditions from congenital heart disease to rheumatic heart disease, ages 2-17.

Russell explained that this was his first Pacific Partnership. “Clinically, I get exposure to a lot of conditions that I wouldn’t normally see in the United States such as rheumatic heart disease or non-corrected congenital heart disease in kids. Personally these were just wonderful people that I’ve ever met and really terrific doctors. It was a privilege to work with them.”

Russell further explained that “they have a major need for cardiovascular studies and it’s unmet unfortunately. I think we made a dent in the number of echoes that they need and the number of consultations they need but I think they need more.”

Russell’s assistant, HM Ramoune Scarlett, a hospital corpsman from the USNS Mercy said that a lot of the patients aren’t sick right now but could be as adults.

“I think this is crucial to get that information out to help the providers here so they can start treatment now so in the long run they aren’t suffering,” said Scarlett who has done this for six years.

“As a technologist, I am the hands-on guy. I take the images and the doctor does the interpretation.”

Scarlett explained that this was the first time he has deployed in 12 years in the Navy. “I’m happy I came on this trip. You get to see why you are in healthcare. You get to see the why. Being here reminds me so much of being back home (in Jamaica) so it hits home for me being able to help people. Being able to go to poorer countries and identifying what they are going through. It just reinforced my why … as to why I am in healthcare.”"

Steven McGunegle, commander, U.S. Army Garrison Hawai’i and Col. Charles Green, director, Directorate of Emergency Services, met with Representative Trish La Chica on Wednesday November 8, 2023. The discussions, which continued at the Hawai’i Okinawa Center in Waipio Gentry, centered around the pressing issue of homelessness, particularly the encroachment of homeless encampments on federal property in Hawai’i.

The meeting marked a significant effort to engage with Representative La Chica, the elected leader for the Mililani Mauka area, in addressing the challenges posed by homeless encampments. These discussions were crucial for Army Garrison Hawai’i, as the encroachment of civilian homeless populations onto Army managed lands presents unique challenges.

“We’ve been seeing increasing homeless trespassing at several Army locations on Oahu,” said McGunegle. “This meeting was important step forward to discuss the joint effort with city and state officials required to reach collaborative solutions.”

Representative La Chica, who had firsthand experience observing the operations of homeless sweeps, brought valuable insights to the table. The talks delved into the complexities of the homeless situation in Hawai’i, including the logistical hurdles and the coordination required with various agencies.

A significant part of the discussion revolved around the removal of debris and hazardous waste from these sites. The group acknowledged the financial and logistical challenges associated with homeless encampments as key concerns.

In addition to discussing the current situation and challenges, the meeting also opened up conversations about potential long-term solutions and strategies to address the broader issue of homelessness in Hawai’i. This included exploring various models from other areas of the country that could be adapted to the Hawai’ian context.

Overall, the meeting was a constructive step towards fostering collaboration and finding effective solutions to the challenges of homelessness in Hawai’i. The discussions highlighted a shared commitment to addressing this complex issue and the importance of working together across different levels of government."

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Kevin McGovern first met his future wife, Armie, in Yokohama after a mutual friend introduced them, sparking what would turn into 20 years of marriage.

From their encounter, Armie recalled that she knew Kevin was interested in her, yet she initially wanted to take her time before pursuing a serious relationship.

But Kevin’s cheerful demeanor, and the sacrifices he made for her along the way, made her realize he was the real deal.

“He was the best thing to ever happen in my life,” she said. “He was a great father; he was a great husband. I will never forget him. He’s always in my heart.”

Armie and her family joined several community members for a memorial service Wednesday at the Camp Zama Chapel to celebrate Kevin’s life following his death from natural causes on Sunday. He was 66.

The dedication Kevin showed to Armie and his five children also extended to his work life.

After graduating high school in 1975, Kevin enlisted in the Navy to serve in aviation ordnance. He retired after 21 years of service and moved to Florida where he received a certification in culinary arts.

Kevin used his new skills at several resorts and country clubs before returning to Japan, where he was previously stationed, to be the chef at the Atsugi Enlisted Club. He later worked for the Defense Commissary Agency and then became a cook for Child and Youth Services, or CYS, at Camp Zama.

He also was active with the Veterans of Foreign Wars post here, where he continued to make an impact with other veterans in the area, said Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan.

“I am struck by the exemplary commitment and performance of Kevin,” the colonel said. “He had such a positive attitude and was infused with joy in everything he did and … made everything fun for all who knew him.”

Hunter said Kevin’s legacy will endure through the lives he touched from both his family and many others in the community.

“I will say Kevin will be missed,” he said, “but his spirit lingers in our hearts and, as such, is a true testament to a life well lived.”

Loretta Murray, the CYS coordinator, said Kevin brought so much happiness to the children as he nourished their lives with the meals he served.

When Kevin interviewed for the job four years ago, Murray remembered that he showed his true self to the hiring panel.

“He said, ‘If you hire me, I’m going to be the cook that’s singing, dancing, hanging with the kids and having a party,’” she said. “And that’s what he did. Mr. Kevin was the life of the party.”

Murray said he also displayed that liveliness outside of work as she often saw him and his wife mingling at the VFW or singing karaoke at the Firelight Lounge.

“I will miss his positive energy and attitude, but I am wishing the family the [best] through these trying times,” she said. “We are here to support you all, because while Kevin was part of our CYS family, his family is part of our family as well.”

Kevin’s eldest daughter, Shannon Nease, said she was thankful for the Camp Zama community coming together to honor her father.

“To know my pops was to love him,” she said. “Our very own ‘Mr. Popular’ that was not bothered by others’ opinions or thoughts. He was an amazing father and loved all of us so, so much.”

Nease then spoke of having the opportunity to see her father one last time. She had just arrived at Tokyo Narita Airport from Florida when she got a call from her family to rush to the hospital.

It was the longest bus ride in her life, she said, as she hurried to the hospital to say goodbye to her father.

“My dad waited for me,” she said. “He gave me 10 minutes and for that I am eternally grateful.”

Nease was able to let her father know that everyone was there with him and that they all loved him.

“I will never forget that moment,” she said. “Dad, we love you and we will never forget you.”

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos Commander Col. Lakicia R. Stokes, Directorate of Public Works officials and Camille Wiseman, a woodland ecologist with the Texas A&M Forest Service, celebrated Texas Arbor Day with a tree dedication and proclamation signing ceremony Nov. 9 at the Sportsmen’s Center picnic area here.

“Today is a great day to plant a tree and gather, as we declare Arbor Day at the Great Place,” Stokes said. “I want to thank you all for being here, but most importantly for your skills, your expertise, your dedication and your commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainability.

April is the month National Arbor Day is celebrated, but November is the month Texas celebrates its own Texas Arbor Day because autumn is the best season to plant trees in the state. The ceremony was also a celebration of Fort Cavazos receiving the Tree City USA award for the 18th consecutive year by the Arbor Day Foundation.

“It’s truly an honor to be awarded for the 18th year,” Stokes said. “The Fort Cavazos Arbor Day proclamation signing is a reminder of how simple acts can create healthy communities, while searching for hope for a better tomorrow.”

The Tree City USA program is sponsored by the Arbor Day Foundation in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters.

“This team is so inspired and motivated, doing such good work being persistent about planting trees, and continuing the effort that it takes to be a Tree City USA community,” Wiseman said. “Celebrating 18 years as trailblazers is a great example to share for other organizations and installations to follow suit.”

Fort Cavazos achieved Tree City USA recognition by meeting the program’s four requirements: a tree board or department, a tree-care ordinance, an annual community forestry budget of at least $2 per capita and an Arbor Day observance and proclamation.

“Our biologists, environmental professionals and community partners serve as a bridging element and bring together communities to create lasting change,” Stokes said. “Thank you for continuing to highlight Fort Cavazos’ commitment to environmental stewardship, and also to creating beautification in green spaces.”

Highlights of Fort Cavazos’ accomplishments included planting 360 trees; pruning and watering more than 3,627 trees; and overseeing design and landscaping plans for construction projects.

“As we look forward, I encourage not only Team Cavazos here but other military installations and our surrounding communities to celebrate and support our efforts on planting and protecting trees,” Stokes said.

Wiseman recognized Fort Cavazos’ successes in maintaining a green space and the symbolism of planting the ceremonial bur oak tree.

“There’s not just environmental sustainability in mind but also the sustainability of this installation that continues to grow,” she said. “The planting of a tree is symbolic and important that you’re not just keeping what exists already. You are improving upon what you have — it’s a great joy to see all the motivation.”

KILLEEN, Texas — Citizens, Soldiers, veterans and families of the Central Texas community lined the streets Nov. 11 in downtown Killeen for the Veterans Day Parade hosted by the City of Killeen and the Central Texas Area Veteran Advisory Committee here.

This year’s parade entries participated with a variety of Soldiers, floats, marching bands from the Killeen Independent School District, and the U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, Col. Lakicia Stokes, as the parade’s grand marshal. The parade serves as a way for the local community to show their appreciation to the veteran and active-duty community alike.

“There’s everything from Soldiers from Fort Cavazos, there’s cars, antique cars, motorcycles, a lot of nice floats. It’s just a great day to come out and see everybody’s kind of creativity come to life and supporting the Soldiers and veterans in our community,” said Pat Christ, co-chair for Central Texas AVAC.

Children waited eagerly on the sidewalk to collect the candy that was being thrown to them from people in the parade.

Shortly before the festivities began, Lori Spencer, AVAC member and spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Day National Committee, presented City of Killeen Mayor Debbie Nash-King a document declaring Killeen, Harker Heights and Copperas Cove as regionally recognized sites for Veterans Day celebrations as citizens, local organizations and friends and families gathered in front of Killeen City Hall looked on.

“Mayor Nash-King’s late husband began this back in 2014. And he did a lot of work to ensure that we were recognized as regional site from the Department of Veterans Affairs,” Spencer said. “I’ve been so honored to be able to take that on and so for the 10th year in a row, the cities of Killeen, Harker Heights and Copperas Cove area has been designated a Veterans Day regional site. It is my honor to present this declaration to Mayor Nash-King on behalf of the Area Veterans Advisory Committee and the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Day National Committee.”

Mayor Nash-King offered opening remarks and kicked off the parade with some encouraging words.

“I’d like to thank you all for attending and thank you for recognizing our area as a regional site for Veterans Day celebration,” Nash-King said. “We stand behind our Soldiers, veterans and their families and it is an honor for me to be able to say thank you for all you do, all you’ve done and the sacrifices that were made for this great nation. Thank you.”

Each year the Central Texas AVAC sponsors the event, according to city officials. AVAC is comprised of all the veteran organizations from Nolanville, Harker Heights and Killeen."

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — Several days of rain provided much needed water to Belton Lake, but also created dense, muddy terrain that was a challenge to maneuver in, let alone conduct the largest combat exercise here in three years.

Remagen Ready 24-1 was a blended live and constructive, joint, multi-echelon, division-sized combined arms exercise that included a contested gap crossing.

Soldiers participated in a hands-on tactical exercise Oct. 30 – Nov. 9, which tested the brigade’s proficiency in navigating a wet gap crossing; moving troops, light and heavy vehicles and supplies from one side of Belton Lake to the other; and reinforced the vital training required to be “ready to deploy, fight, sustain and win in multi-domain operations anywhere in the world,” according to III Armored Corps.

“It doesn’t matter that you have the world’s greatest tank ready, if you can’t get it to where it needs to be,” said Maj. Brian Harris, chief of community relations, III Armored Corps. “The ability to move and not to get bogged down and to advance is so crucial, and so in III Armored Corps, you know, that can’t be more important to us.

“So, this is one step in the evolution of figuring out how we can use the sort of unique aspects of Fort Cavazos, which includes the fact that we have Belton Lake here and that we own both sides of it,” he continued. “And so, we can do something like this which oftentimes at installations you’re not able to do.”

An exercise of this magnitude could not function independently of the many Garrison tenants that provide constructive services and resources support.

Nearly 60 civilian team members from across the Directorate of Plans, Training, Mobilization and Security collaborated to provide range operations support, devices and secure and schedule training areas.

“It’s very important to provide them with training neighbors to assist training units on the installation to be successful,” said Chris Hoffman, chief of training for DPTMS.

The Fort Cavazos Fire Department arranged emergency medical, water rescue and hazmat response support and was prepared to render first aid and water rescue measures at a moment’s notice.

Additionally, more than a dozen volunteer personnel from Morgan’s Point Dive Team provided additional water rescue support.

“The safety of the Soldiers is important,” said Andrew Lima, chief of the Fort Cavazos Fire Department. “If we don’t have the assets for personnel, then we don’t have an exercise. To keep those guys safe at all times, that’s why it’s very important that we were there.”

Maj. Edwin Martinez, deputy corps engineer for Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, III Armored Corps, described the partnership as symbiotic.

“We could not do an exercise of this scale without working hand in hand with the Garrison entities,” he said. “The digital environment, the systems, the hardware, everything enables us to do this.

“We are interconnected. Fort Cavazos installation and the Fort Cavazos units, we have to work hand in hand,” Martinez continued. “When we all work together for the common goal to train our Soldiers and our armed forces, we train our young men and women to be ready and that’s our purpose. We’re working together to achieve that goal.”

Trudging in boot-deep mud, Soldiers from the 74th Multi-Road Bridge Company, 62nd Engineer Battalion, 36th Engineer Brigade, worked to assemble an Improved Ribbon Bridge consisting of ramps and interior bays to create a floating roadway that allows Soldiers, their vehicles and equipment to cross the waterway safely.

M30 Bridge Erection Boats attached to the sides of the IRB guided sections into place and kept the fully assembled structure from floating off site due to the current.

Soldiers drove Bradley Fighting Vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and fuel trucks, onto the IRB to float the machinery approximately 1,700 meters, or a little more than a mile, to the opposite side of the lake.

“It may look like a relatively small gap that they’re crossing,” Harris said. “(Yet) it’s a significant effort to do it right, to do it safely.”

Soldiers were also tasked with completing the crossing while negotiating obscured vision due to thick smoke emitting from non-toxic fog oil canisters.

“It’s a representation of the current operating environments, the current battlefield that we foresee, and we have to move, we have to learn to operate in these conditions,” Martinez explained.

The water crossing began the morning of Nov. 3 and was expected to take a couple of days to complete according to Lt. Col. Tania Donovan, deputy public affairs officer for III Armored Corps.

She explained that the wet gap crossing is just one aspect of the exercise.

“While this is what we are seeing right now, really the entire Remagen Ready exercise is focused on large scale combat operations,” Donovan explained. “It is 24/7 where they test out everything from communication capabilities talking to units all across the battlefield, talking to each other, coordinating, synchronizing.

“In order to have and put together an exercise for the Soldiers, we need planners, we need facilities, we need the support to really identify the objective, set it on the map for the Soldiers and also, play the other side,” she continued. “In this exercise, we have Garrison capabilities doing that, we have a lot of our civilians focused on the systems that are required to facilitate the training for the Soldiers.”

More than 100 civilians collaborated with roughly 6,000 Soldiers from 1st Cavalry Division, III Armored Corps Headquarters, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command, 11th Signal Brigade, 36th Engineer Brigade, 75th Field Artillery Brigade, 504th Military Intelligence Brigade and 3rd Air Support Operations Group, in the exercise and more than 700 wheeled vehicles and nearly 160 tracked vehicles crossed the wet gap during the nearly two-week training.

Harris said the long-term goal is to see if Fort Cavazos can eventually become the gap crossing training headquarters for other installations.

“For now, it’s training tenant units at Fort Cavazos, but there’s a belief that there’s other units around the Army that potentially could use this kind of training,” he explained. “And so, this is the next step in testing out our ability to do it here; can we get it to the point where we could potentially be able to offer it as an option to units that are deploying. Maybe it becomes a training center that’s not just for Fort Cavazos.”"

Fort George G. Meade, Md. – Sailors assigned to U.S. Fleet Cyber Command/U.S. TENTH Fleet focused on self-care and holistic nutrition during a cooking class at Fort Meade’s Kuhn Hall, the Education and Resiliency Center, Nov. 1.

Offered upon request, ""Meal in a Mug,"" aims to assist service members residing in the barracks with healthy meal options and meals prepared using only a mug, a microwave, and a few utensils. During the demonstration and meal preparation, the Sailors prepared two, 2-minute healthy meals, each costing less than $2.00. The course is open to all service members, military family members, and Department of Defense (DoD) ID cardholders, and provides recipes and hands-on experience.

“This class is about laying the foundation for a good whole foods diet,” said Dr. Shari Youngblood, a professor at the University of Maryland, who is also board certified in personalized nutrition. As a self-professed “Army brat,” she volunteers to teach the course at Fort Meade to help service members.

The Demonstration Kitchen at Kuhn Hall was designed by the Fort Meade Alliance, an advocacy group to promote lifelong culinary and nutritional skills.

“There is a lot of confusion around nutrition. We all have cultural and powerful emotional associations with food,” Youngblood said. “Food is the most powerful way of fixing [or avoiding] a health condition.”

“Food facilitates mental, spiritual, emotional and physical wellness,” she said.

One has to be well to perform well, and food habits can be taught, there’s a natural connection between wellness and readiness, she said.

As Cyber professionals, the Sailors duties may require flexible hours and long days. Protecting the DoD’s networks is work that requires dedication 24/7/365 days a year. The force is agile, resilient and responsive to facilitate intelligence, logistics and combat support functions to the Fleet and Combatant Commanders. Fleet Cyber Command is a tenant command at Fort George G. Meade, which employs more than 64,000 personnel, many with specialties in intelligence, information and cyber operations.

One of the Sailors who participated said, learning to cook healthy foods on the run is important and he appreciated the opportunity to participate.

“Growing up, I really didn’t learn to cook,” he said. “I want to be able to cook my own food, three meals a day.”

The Sailors learned to make a Coffee Mug Quiche, Protein-packed quick oats and received other recipes to share with the unit.

Likewise, the other Sailor who participated said buying fast food is expensive and not ideal for personnel living in the barracks. She recalled the resourcefulness of the junior enlisted personnel when it comes to food preparation but said the demonstration kitchen and the course offers new insight.

“We want our service members and community members on the installation to know the demonstration kitchen is available for use,” said Chad Jones, public affairs officer. “The education, resiliency center promotes well-being and can serve as another outlet for continuing education, personal growth and development.”

“We hope the Sailors spread the word,” said Jones. “The class, and the Demonstration Kitchen are open to the community. Our hope is that it’s a safe space for all personnel, units and families.”

Any community members interested in the nutrition program can contact Noelle Austin-Jones, director of Fort Meade Armed Forces Wellness Center at 301-677-2006."

CAMP HENRY, South Korea – The 403rd Army Field Support Brigade conducted a senior leader forum bringing together key personnel from throughout the Korean Peninsula and Japan, here, Nov. 6-8.

The wide-ranging event covered an assortment of topics including academics, professional development, well-being, military history, and more.

Day 1 highlights included remote presentations from Steve Bright, a senior financial analyst with the Office of Financial Research under the U.S. Department of the Treasury, who discussed “Department of the Treasury and Current Economic Conditions,” and Professor Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in International Policy at the Ford Dorsey Master’s International Policy at Stanford University, who discussed “Trilateral Security Cooperation in the Shadows of the Ukraine War.”

In addition, Col. Henry Brown, commander, 403rd AFSB, who assumed command in July, took the opportunity to present his 90-day assessment of the brigade, highlight brigade priorities and discuss his command philosophy.

The day ended with an off-site dinner in Daegu to bolster camaraderie and provide an opportunity for leaders from through the highly dispersed organization to meet new people and reconnect with old friends.

The second day kicked-off with a twist. Forum participants started the day with a “Mindful Movement” worship conducted by Jennifer Faux, American Red Cross regional program manager. The session included stretching, a walking and breathing exercise, general wellness tips and more.

The day also featured professional development sessions on a variety of topics, a discourse on the “Korean Demographic Crisis” by Brown, and a presentation on the Battle of Nakdong River conducted by Patrick Berry, chief, Supply and Services, Support Operations, 403rd AFSB.

The final day of the forum consisted of a visit to the Chilgok Patriots & Peace Memorial which focuses on the Battle of Nakdong River and other heavy fighting that took place in the area during the early stages of the Korean War.

“I was very pleased with the level of planning and execution for the Senior Leader Forum. The level of guest speakers we had were kind of outside the norm of what we normally would see. There were unique topics that we were able to discuss and it and kind of gave a bit broader picture and scope to our organization,” Brown said. “Overall, it was fantastic. I learned a lot myself, the folks enjoyed it, and we established the standard that we're going to do even bigger and better things in the future.”

The event was organized by Logistics Readiness Center-Daegu and was emceed by Mary Tooke, budget analyst, LRC-Daegu.

FORT WAINWRIGHT, Alaska – Alaska is well known for its mega fauna, animals like moose, bears, caribou, and walruses, but the numbers of those animals are dwarfed by the migratory bird population that relies on Alaska as a seasonal feeding and breeding ground. Approximately 5 billion birds migrate to the state each spring and stay through the summer, according to Audubon Alaska.

At 665,400 square miles in area, Alaska is large enough to accommodate the bird biomass from an ecological standpoint, but the annual influx of birds poses a significant risk to military and civilian aviation.

In 1995, 22 American and 2 Canadian service members were killed when a flock of geese on the runway at Elmendorf Air Force Base collided with a U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System airplane, causing the aircraft to crash in the nearby forest.

Nationwide, from 1990 through 2022, 44 civilians died as a result of wildlife strikes to aircraft. In 2022 alone, there were 17,190 wildlife strikes to civilian aircraft, as reported to the National Wildlife Strike Database. While the vast majority of these did not result in death or injury, the collisions caused 67,848 hours of aircraft downtime and approximately $385 million in damage, according to data provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

Such incidents and data are the reason for the U.S. Army’s Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard, or WASH program, more commonly referred to as the Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard program, or BASH, due to birds causing the vast majority of strikes. At Fort Wainwright, the program is carried out through a collaboration between numerous offices on post, such as the airfield staff, Department of Public Works, and contractors who handle snow removal, as well as staff members from the USDA’s Wildlife Services team.

Marc Pratt, the district supervisor for USDA APHIS Wildlife Services, described the partnership in the following way: “WS works directly with Ladd Army Airfield and the Department of Public Works Environmental Division to reduce wildlife strikes to aircraft operating at Ladd and lessen the impact that birds have on the overall mission of the Army. All parties work together in a collaborative effort towards reducing the impact that wildlife can have on mission readiness.”

The USDA team operates on Fort Wainwright from April 1 through Sept. 30, the period when migratory bird activity is greatest.

“Spring migration typically starts in April and runs through May as birds are returning to their nesting grounds in Alaska,” said Cole Suckow, a wildlife biologist with USDA APHIS. “In the summer months, BASH crews are busy dispersing nesting birds such as gulls and raptors.”

Suckow noted that gulls nesting on nearby rooftops, equipment, and vehicles and foraging on the airfield hamper the garrison mission and pose a risk to airfield operations. During the fall migration, “Large flocks of big birds greatly increase the risk of a damaging wildlife strike,” Suckow said.

The risk of such strikes is reduced through a combination of environmental management techniques that require year-round planning and daily actions to make the local environment less attractive to the thousands of birds that pass through the installation each year.

Two of the interventions to inhibit bird gatherings may seem less intuitive to the general public but are highly effective—snow removal and lawn mowing.

Pools of standing water—such as those formed by melting snow—are a bird attractant, so the contractors in charge of snow removal place the large snow piles in areas with proper drainage away from the airfield. When thousands of tons of snow melt in the spring, the formation of temporary ponds in high-risk areas is reduced, and birds will be less likely to gather there.

The lawn mowing schedule on post involves careful consideration of wildlife habitat preference, bird migration timing, and human aesthetic desires. The Department of Public Works’ Environmental, Master Planning, and Operations and Maintenance Divisions work together with the Ladd Airfield and USDA staff to develop maps for the mowing schedule.

“This mowing schedule should allow the grass in open areas to grow long enough to deter large migratory birds like geese and cranes, but short enough that it doesn’t offer cover for small mammals,” said Justin Smith, a natural resources specialist at Fort Wainwright. “Small mammals attract raptors like eagles and osprey, which pose significant BASH issues.” Smith noted that less mowing can result in future cost savings on grounds maintenance but that taller grass and vegetation is considered unkempt by some of the personnel who live and work on post.

Different from techniques that do not involve direct engagement with birds and other wildlife, another significant element of the BASH program is active harassment of target species.

“We employ an aggressive hazing program using a variety of active and passive approaches to mitigate bird presence on an airfield,” said Suckow. “The BASH team has an assortment of pyrotechnics that are launched from a 12-gauge shotgun or pyrotechnic launcher to produce audio-visual effects that scare the birds away from the area.”

No physical contact is made with the birds at any time, and the birds are not harmed by the loud noises or bright flashes, but they are deterred from gathering and staying. The BASH team’s frequent vehicle patrols of the airfield also deter the birds.

Fort Wainwright Soldiers, residents, employees, and visitors can also play a role in reducing the risk to aviation by reducing food attractants for ravens, a year-round presence on post.

“A typical issue we see is common ravens scavenging trash from the back of trucks or overfilled trash receptacles, which can be a major issue near airports,” Pratt said.

Suckow advises personnel to be proactive and said, “If you see a dumpster that has an open lid, close it. If you see a fast-food container in a parking lot, pick it up and dispose of it properly. One of the best ways to control wildlife on or near an airfield is to remove its food source.”

Smith emphasized that people should not feed any wildlife and that they should alert the USDA or Environmental Division if they are experiencing bird and wildlife issues.

While habitat management and wildlife hazing near the airfield may seem extreme, the actions serve to protect the lives of all who use the local airspace. Additionally, they funnel birds to areas like waterfowl refuges that are safer for the birds and accessible to the general public for viewing."

WASHINGTON — The Army’s artillery production doubled in the last year with the service currently producing 28,000 155-millimeter howitzer rounds a month.

The dramatic uptick comes as the Army expanded its capacity at current facilities while looking to bring new ones into the mix next year.

""We will have taken, over a couple years, what was a very fragile, admittedly, industrial base and dramatically improved its strength,” said Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology.

The need for the increased artillery comes in response to supporting the war in Ukraine, the recent conflict in Israel and replenishing U.S. stockpiles. The service has sent more than two million rounds to Ukraine thus far.

Currently, the Army ships steel from Ohio to two facilities in Pennsylvania, the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, and a sister facility in Wilkes-Barre. These two plants turn 2,000-pound steel rods into two-foot-tall artillery shells.

The shells are then transported to the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, where they are filled with explosives and sealed. The propellent and charges for the rounds are mostly produced at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant in Virginia and the Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Tennessee.

Throughout this year, the Army expanded production at these facilities by constructing new buildings, installing new equipment and improving automation. These upgrades helped double the Army’s artillery production rate, Bush said.

With the expanded capacity at current facilities, the Army is shifting its focus in fiscal year 2024 toward bringing brand-new production facilities into the manufacturing process. This will give the service multiple sources for each production step.

“Which is what you want in the ammunition production world,” Bush said. “You don’t want one building being the single point of failure.”

The service is building a new factory in Mesquite, Texas, and it awarded a contract last year to a Canadian company to build the artillery shells. It is also funding two new facilities to load the shells with explosives. One will be in Arkansas, and the other will be in Kansas.

The improved production process is part of the Army’s modernization plan to bring the industrial base into the 21st century. Current and future Army readiness requires modernization on a sustainable path that develops, implements, and deploys new technologies to deter current and emerging threats.

Bush said the Army aims to increase 155-millimeter production to 60,000 by next summer and to 100,000 by the end of 2025. The 100,000-round goal is largely contingent on the approval of President Joe Biden’s request to Congress for fiscal year 2024 emergency supplemental funding, which has $3.1 billion for 155-millimeter artillery production and facility modernization.

""This important legislation is needed to make sure the Army is ready to meet the growing challenges we face today, and in the future,” Bush said. “It will strengthen our industrial base to ensure we can supply our defense needs while we serve as the arsenal of democracy for our allies.”

SAGAMIHARA FAMILY HOUSING AREA, Japan – A new monthly forum that allows community residents to ask questions and hear updates on the local commissaries kicked off here Tuesday.

Col. Marcus Hunter, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Japan, joined Totolua Ripley, director of both the Sagamihara Family Housing Area and Camp Zama commissaries, for the first iteration of the forum that he said is all about taking care of people.

“We want to provide the highest quality products and resources for our folks to get what they need,” Hunter said. “And it’s an important feedback loop for us as well, to know that these are their concerns.”

The ongoing forum, which will be held on the second Tuesday of each month at 8:30 a.m. inside the SFHA commissary, will discuss upcoming sales events, the supply chain, product quality and food safety, as well as product recalls.

Hunter believes the face-to-face interaction with commissary officials will give residents more clarity on the behind-the-scenes work being done at the commissaries.

“It’s an opportunity to communicate and directly answer peoples’ questions,” he said. “Sometimes people just don’t know, or they’ve heard something [else], so this is an important way to make sure correct information is shared and understood.”

One of the challenges mentioned during the forum was delayed shipments arriving to the stores.

Ripley said that has been an issue for the past few years since the commissaries must rely on American container shipping companies to bring goods from the United States.

But if a ship has mechanical problems, it needs to turn back and transfer its containers to another ship to restart the long voyage, further pushing the limit on many goods that have shorter expiration dates.

“When it comes to perishable items, it’s very critical because there’s only so much shelf life,” Ripley said. “By the time a product gets here, we then maybe have five or six days to try and sell the product.”

U.S. Transportation Command recently approved the use of non-American shipping companies to ensure deliveries to commissaries in Japan stay on track. Last month, Ripley said a Singapore-based vessel was used for the first time to transport goods here.

“Hopefully that will resolve the issue with the delays,” he said. “They are filling the gaps where we don’t have a vessel to set sail.”

The initial forum also had Soldiers from Public Health Activity–Japan discuss the food inspections they conduct daily at the stores to ensure only quality and safe products are on the shelves.

If a shopper discovers a spoiled or infested product, for instance, Ripley encourages them to return it to the commissary for a free replacement, even if they no longer have the receipt.

“It’s always best to come and bring the product in,” he said, “so that we can trace the origin of it and see where we ran into problems with it.”

Megan Hansen, a military spouse, was one of the residents to join the chat and ask questions to the leadership. She plans to disseminate the information she learned to other family members in the 35th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion.

“I think it’s great that they’re doing it,” she said of the forum. “Because if there are issues that do arise, [residents won’t] feel like they’re not being heard. It will put those issues to rest, and I think it will help [the commissaries] as well.”

Ripley said he looked forward to receiving more input from customers and educating them on all the efforts to try to keep them coming back to the stores.

“It’s very important, because they are the customers, they are the ones that we serve,” he said. “Whenever there is an issue and a customer is not satisfied, it’s good for us to have that communication.”

FORT RILEY, Kansas – Inside the brain of a division-level combat operation exists a complex neural network consisting of dozens of shops and hundreds of people working towards a common objective.

Over a ten-day period, Danger Ready 2, an exercise designed to train elements of the 1st Infantry Division on the scope and scale of large-scale combat operations implemented multiple movements to test the unit's ability to break down and rebuild functioning sites.

Logistics elements play a key role in all warfighting capacities. The ability to sustain a fighting force often is the difference between victory and defeat. These commodities are the lifeblood of any combat element. In a strenuous environment, knowing what a unit needs is equally as important as knowing how to supply it.

“I believe we are replicating what happens overseas,” said Sgt. 1st Class Tyler Robinson, senior movements noncommissioned officer assigned to the 1st Sustainment, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Division Materials Center, 1st Inf. Div. “It’s great training. It’s kind of rough at times but that’s what refines you and makes you better.”

The second stage of the Danger Ready exercise implemented more advanced warfighting techniques, which focused on perfecting the art of synchronizing time and space in a hostile environment where large forces are engaged with one another. Soldiers reviewed satellite imagery, studied by geospatial analysts, conducted two-minute briefing drills that highlighted key decision points in the simulated battle space and coordinated rapid relocation of key combat assets.

Elements belonging to the 1st Inf. Div.’s Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, Sustainment Brigade, Signal Company and Division Artillery, trained in tandem with Soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Division and the U.S. Army’s V Corps, who are currently operating in Poland, in preparation for Warfighter, a capstone exercise synchronizing the U.S. Army and Allied forces across the globe on more sophisticated operational standards.

“Character development is very important when it comes to day-to-day operations,” said Spc. Bilend Amin a geospatial intelligence imagery analyst assigned to Signal Company, Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 1st Inf. Div. “Part of being an enlisted Soldier there are going to be times where you're going to do grunt work, where you're going to have to help set everything up.

“You’re not just going to walk in and just do your job. Sometimes it requires you to get your hands dirty and set up some C-wire or help run cable or clean up equipment or facilities to maintain the area that you work in.”

Like logistics, accurate reconnaissance of an enemy’s composition and disposition informs senior leaders and provides them with an accurate representation of the battle space as it evolves over time.

“We are responsible for full motion imagery,” said Amin. “This information feeds the other sections of the division staff providing location of the enemy forces in time and space.”

Communication amongst headquarters elements leads to appropriate decisions which, in turn, fine tunes the ability for the division and allied elements to function in synchronization with one another.

“It’s going to start going faster and faster,” said U.S. Army Col. Terry R. Tillis, the 1st Infantry Division deputy commanding officer for maneuver, during one of many two-minute drills. “Your reports are important.”

Providing efficient and accurate communication at every level allows for effective moves to be made on a battlefield. In active combat environments, relaying accurate and timely information to senior officers can make the difference between success and failure. In this simulated environment, officers and noncommissioned officers are offered the opportunity to improve the level of detail and the speed at which accurate information is transferred.

“We should be building upon this every time,” said Tillis. “We are doing this to try and be better.”

For each Soldier the end state of training exercises is in understanding the capabilities of a division involved in a large-scale combat operation and their role in maintaining those capabilities.

The series of Danger Ready training events will continue to build upon one another, improving lethal functions of the 1st Inf. Div. and its ability to operate in any combat environment as it prepares for Warfighter 2024."

FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. – Fort Meade broke ground on the construction of two new buildings, the Freedom Center IV barracks, in ceremonies Nov. 9. The barracks will house 380 enlisted service members from all military branches when complete.

Special guest speaker, Gen. Paul Nakasone, Commander U.S. Cyber Command, Chief Central Security Service (CSS) and the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), identified those service members in his remarks. “It’s going to be members of the Central Security Service, 40 percent of NSA’s workforce, the Marines, the Soldiers, the Sailors, the Airmen, the Guardians, the Coast Guardsmen that make up the analysts and linguists and reporters that ensure that the National Security Agency can do its principal missions of signals intelligence and cyber security.

This is a world-class facility for a world-class workforce,” said Nakasone.

Gen. Nakasone also talked about the cooperation it took to get to this stage. “It’s been a partnership, the partnership of U.S. Army Garrison Fort (George G.) Meade led by Col. Michael Sapp, Directorate of Public Works (DPW), obviously working very hard to make sure that we have everything that we need, and my incredible team, Installations and Logistics led by Mr. Randy Westfall at the National Security Agency. I also pass along my thanks to our representatives and certainly our congressional leaders that have been so key for us to be able to ensure that we have the funding and resources to be able to build such world-class facilities,” he said.

Col. Michael Sapp, Commander, U.S. Army Garrison Fort George G. Meade also emphasized the importance of partnership. “As you know, the combined effort between the NSA and the U.S. Army Garrison (Fort George G. Meade) to fund this facility could only happen because of the partnership and cooperation. When we combine our efforts, we can do so many great things.”

“These buildings and the joint service members that will reside in them are another reminder of the incredible talent and skills that we need to attract and retain service members with skills that the nation needs so dearly. It should not be underestimated and cannot be overstated the quality housing and the impact it will have on morale and the quality of work,” Sapp added.

The Freedom Center IV project represents the first phase of the long-term barracks solution at Fort Meade. “A solution that’s vital for this installation’s growing mission, as it provides tenants with the proper, necessary housing that they deserve,” said Lt. Col. David Myers, Deputy District Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Baltimore District).

Garrison Housing Chief, Aimee Stafford, who also served as the ceremony’s emcee said, “This project has been a long time coming, over 10 years. With included kitchenettes, it will be quite an upgrade from the barracks that will be demolished by the time this project is complete.”

Officials of the Freedom Center IV project have set a target completion date in the Fall of 2025."

BARRINGTON, Ill. - Overcast skies and blustery, cold wind could not stop the patriotic spirit from burning brightly during the Village of Barrington’s Veterans’ Day ceremony, November 10, 2023.

Veterans and civilians gathered to listen to remarks from Karen Darch, Barrington Village President and Captain Michael Ariola, Public Affairs Officer, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, based in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

“Today we say thank you to our veterans and those serving in the military,” said Darch. “Thank you to all for being with us today.”

Darch’s family shares in a rich family lineage of service in the armed forces.

“My dad served in the Army Air Corp during World War II. It was wonderful growing up with a dad who was a veteran. My husband served in the U.S. Navy. He was in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps during college and served on two different destroyers.” said Darch.

“It’s important to remember the sacrifice of those who have served our country and it’s important to be grateful for it,” said Darch. “We are very thankful for our veterans in the community.”

In the audience, Paul Corwin, Navy veteran from Barrington, listened to the Village President’s words and recounted his own military service.

“I attended Lane Technical High School in Chicago and graduated in 1962. I went into the Navy in 1965 and trained to be a nuclear plant operator. My job was to take samples and do surveys of radioactive areas,” he said. “I lost my best friend who was a radio operator with the U.S. Marines. He was killed in Vietnam.”

Corwin served on two ships during his Navy service. The U.S.S. Bainbridge and U.S.S. Cavalier, a Bayfield class attack transport, which operated in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Ariola spoke about the history of Veteran’s Day.

“As many of you know, we celebrate Veterans Day on the anniversary of the Armistice that ended the First World War. On November 11th, 1918, the armistice agreement was signed in a railroad car in Compiegne, France,” said Ariola.

In 1954, Congress changed the name from Armistice Day to Veterans Day to honor all veterans who served the nation.

“On Veterans’ Day, we honor the brave men and women from all walks of life who have stepped forward to defend our nation throughout our history,” said Ariola.

Barrington resident Rich Bowman served in the U.S. Air Force from 1962 to 1967. He is an ROTC graduate from Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois.

“I was in logistics and transportation,” said Bowman. “In Vietnam, I ran a small air terminal. My men loaded and unloaded cargo from cargo planes because it was too dangerous to use the roads.""

Bowman completed his military service at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii.

“They needed people who had served in Vietnam. It was a good experience. People always thank me for my service. It was the highlight of my life,” Bowman said.

Ariola paid tribute to what is the greatest asset in the U.S. military. The people who serve day and night in defense of the nation.

“Our all-volunteer force is a credit to Americans of all races, genders and creeds; and our common commitment to defense of, and love for, our country binds and unites us together. That goes to the heart of what it means to be an American,” Ariola said."

FORT BARFOOT, Va. – Virginia National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crews completed aerial firefighting support and Soldiers and Airmen began ground firefighting training Nov. 11.

After Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Nov. 6, aviation crews assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 224th Aviation Regiment, 29th Infantry Division, used two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters equipped with 660-gallon water buckets to drop almost 22,800 gallons of water on fires in Madison County through Nov. 9. Two helicopters flew missions in Patrick County Nov. 11, dropping nearly 13,900 gallons of water.

“Our helicopter crews mobilized and deployed in record time to provide additional resources to help the Virginia Department of Forestry in the fight against multiple large wildfires,” said Brig. Gen. Todd H. Hubbard, the VNG director of the Joint Staff. “Our partner agencies depend on the VNG to rapidly respond with requested capabilities when needed, and we are really proud of how quickly and safely our Soldiers responded.”

Approximately 30 VNG Soldiers and Airmen conducted the field day exercise portion of wildland firefighter training with the Virginia Department of Forestry Nov. 12 at Fort Barfoot after a day of online training. Guard members received personal protective equipment

and focused on basic tools, familiarization with bulldozers and engines, fireline construction and proper fire shelter use.

Once their training is complete, the troops will deploy where needed by DOF for ground support.

“The Soldiers and Airmen coming together to train for a possible ground support mission are from Virginia Army and Air National Guard units across Virginia, to include our 12M Army firefighters assigned to the Fort Barfoot Fire Department,” Hubbard said. “I am sure they are going to be a welcome sight to the crews who have been fighting wildfires for weeks, and we expect them to provide additional capabilities to allow some people to rest or help speed up the effort to finish getting the fires under control. It really is an honor to work with such dedicated professionals towards a common goal.”

Additional Soldiers and Airmen, members of the Virginia Defense Force and Virginia Department of Military Affairs employees are providing operations center, administrative, logistical and public information support in Richmond and Fort Barfoot.

“We owe a special thanks to the loved ones of all our personnel who are on duty as well their employers,” Hubbard said. “Without their support, we would not be able to accomplish our mission.”

YOKOHAMA NORTH DOCK, Japan – The Yokohama North Dock Running Festival, which returned here for the first time in four years, drew nearly 1,000 competitors for its 5K, 10K and half-marathon races Nov. 4.

The 836th Transportation Battalion, headquartered at North Dock, presented awards to the winners. The unit’s executive officer said the installation was excited and privileged to have runners back for the competition.

“It’s an opportunity for the U.S. Army in Japan to provide the local community with a positive message of camaraderie,” said Maj. Steve Truong, assigned to the 836th’s Surface Department Distribution Command.

Navy Lt. Cmdr. Alex Nestle, assigned to the Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 51 at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, placed second in the men’s division 5K and said he enjoyed the nice view the course provided, which included the backdrop of Yokohama City. The cool breeze coming in from the bay made it even better, he said.

Nestle trains often for triathlons but said he is always looking for running races to join. In addition to the North Dock run, he also competed in an event held last month on Sagami General Depot. The on-base runs welcome Japanese competitors, which both makes for better competition and gives the host-nation guests the chance to familiarize themselves with a U.S. military installation, Nestle said.

“It’s really good to have events like this that help forge intercultural relationships and to have cultural exchanges with others who have common interests,” he said. “It connects people.”

Harumi Yamada placed first in the women’s division 10K and said she found out about the event by accident while browsing social media. She was eager to compete because she had never been to a U.S. military installation before.

Yamada lives near North Dock and said it was a unique experience seeing Soldiers and other Americans working as staff at the event and hearing English spoken everywhere she went. She also enjoyed the course and said she is sure there are a lot more local runners who would have competed if they had known about it.

“I’d like the U.S. military to regularly host these bilateral events so that we have more chances to see what their installations look like and to get us familiarized with them and the people,” Yamada said.

Any time North Dock hosts events that welcome Japanese visitors, Truong said he wants the surrounding community to know they are always welcome. The installation is always looking to build the relationship between the two, he said.

“From what I saw during the event, it seemed pretty positive, and I hope this engagement will continue to grow in the future,” Truong said."

CAMP ZAMA, Japan – Several Shinto priests from the renowned Meiji Jingu Shrine toured this installation Thursday as part of an ongoing effort to increase interfaith dialogue with the unit ministry teams here.

The U.S. Army Japan Chaplain’s Office invited the priests and members from the Association of Shinto Shrines on post after unit ministry teams had the opportunity to visit the Tokyo shrine in August.

The tour here, which included presentations, a luncheon, Catholic mass, a historical site visit and a windshield tour, aimed to create supportive relationships and increase sensitivities toward other faith groups.

“We’re following the commander’s intent on partnership,” said Col. J.P. Smith, command chaplain for USARJ. “The bottom line is that the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force does not have counterparts for us. They don’t have chaplains, so it’s important for us to build community with the religious leaders within this area.”

Smith said that while the budding partnership with the Shinto priests may assist the U.S. Army in bolstering trust in the local community, it could also help JGSDF personnel when they need religious support.

“If we’re interacting with [the priests] and helping them understand military culture, that’s going to help everybody out,” he said. “That’s going to help our bilateral partnership, it’s going to help our Soldiers, it’s going to help the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. We believe it’s something that will help at large.”

One of the priests on the tour was Atsushi Ushio, who also serves as director of the Edification Department at the Association of Shinto Shrines, which oversees about 80,000 shrines in Japan.

Ushio said the event allowed him and others to learn from and share their beliefs with the unit ministry teams.

“We want to spread our Shinto beliefs to the world,” he said, “so this activity and communication with the chaplains is a best practice to show what we do.”

Ushio also appreciated the tour of the installation, which concluded with a brief visit to Kastner Airfield where guests were able to view a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter up close.

“As an outsider, you cannot see inside the base,” he said. “But once you get in, you can see what they are doing and their missions. So, now I understand more [about] their presence here in Japan.”

Maj. Tsungyu Pan, deputy command chaplain for U.S. Army Garrison Japan, said partnerships like these could be beneficial when emergency situations arise, such as a natural disaster, and affected people need a variety of religious support.

“An important mission that the chaplaincy has is to interact with local religious leaders,” he said, “so if anything happens, we can cooperate together.”

Leaders on both sides said they will look to expand the interfaith relationship and perhaps broaden it by inviting other faith groups in the future.

“For us, today is just the beginning, because this is not just a one-time event,” Pan said. “Our goal is to continue the communication and interaction, so we can bring more understanding to each other of what we do.”

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — The month of November started off productive with the annual Red, White and You Career Fair Nov. 1 at the Lone Star Conference Center at Fort Cavazos.

The Texas Workforce Commission, Workforce Solutions of Central Texas and the Texas Medical Center collaborated with the Fort Cavazos Transition Assistance Program to organize the event.

The event is one of three major career fairs held annually at Fort Cavazos to connect transitioning service members, military spouses, veterans and family members with hundreds of employers waiting to put service members’ unique skill sets to work for their respective companies.

Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, welcomed employers and anxious job seekers.

“This joint hiring event with team Cavazos and Workforce Solutions of Central Texas is one way that we improve the quality of life for our transitioning Soldiers, veterans and families,” she began. “This event plays a crucial role in helping Soldiers, veterans and families transition to civilian life successfully by connecting them with employment opportunities, resources and support, while also recognizing their contributions to the community and the nation. This is all about taking care of people.”

Almost two-hundred employers in a variety of career fields set up tables throughout the venue and spoke to a steady stream of interested parties about what their organizations offered and the types of positions available.

Jerry Hernandez, marketing manager for the Fort Cavazos TAP, explained that events like this are vital to help transitioning service members prepare for civilian life.

“What Soldiers need to understand when they get out of the military … right now they get their basic pay, they get their BAQ (Basic Allowance for Quarters), they get the medical and housing all paid for,” he explained. “When they get out to civilian life, that’s no longer covered. So, now they have to pay their medical, their housing, all that good stuff.”

Hernandez added that connecting Soldiers with hundreds of employers under one roof makes it a lot more convenient to find their next careers.

“It’s much easier,” he said. “Soldiers working on Fort Cavazos don’t have to go outside the installation or get transportation. So, that’s why we do it.”

Spc. Shakera King, 115th Brigade Support Battalion, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, said she appreciated being able to connect with numerous employers in one venue.

“Events like this help us. It’s during the workday, our jobs know that this is where we have to go, and we can meet all these people at one time. You can meet everybody at once, so that is really, really great.”

Representatives from “The HOP” were on hand to talk to potential hires about positions as bus drivers on Fort Cavazos. The organization will start micro transit services on post and is hiring Soldiers, veterans and military family members to fill approximately 50 part-time driving positions at $18 hourly, starting in February 2024.

“The base was kind enough to find us a home here, which will be based out of Fort Cavazos for all of our Fort Cavazos transit needs,” said Derek Czapnik, transportation superintendent for the HOP.

“This is going to be a game changer,” he said. “This is going to give the quality of life to a lot of one car families or single Soldiers or anybody that doesn’t want to drive. It’s going to be just a wonderful addition to the community.”

Two brothers from St. Paul, Minnesota joined the U.S. Army in 1917 as the United States was drawn into the First World War. One sacrificed his life serving in the Great War. The other survived a gas attack, returned to Minnesota, and started a family. Several generations hence, his great-grandson, inspired by his family’s legacy of service, is back in Europe with the U.S. Army’s 3rd Infantry Division protecting freedom once again.

It all started when U.S. Army Pfc. Frank Dingle from St. Paul Minnesota, joined in 1917. His brother U.S. Marine Pvt. Richard Wallace Dingle joined the Marine Corps April 20, 1917, just 14 days after the U.S. declared war.

Both brothers fought in World War 1. Frank was attached to the U.S. Army Ambulance Corps from 1917 to 1919, while Richard was an infantryman attached to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. Richard fought in the famed Battle of Belleau Wood where he was killed in action June 6, 1918, at the age of 20 years old.

His brother Frank survived World War I despite a gas attack and received the French Croix De Guerre Medal March 17, 1919 followed by an award citation from a field marshal from the French-East Army.

“Since entering service in the division, he has shown the most robust qualities of courage and dedication,” the award citation read. “During the night of October 1, 1918, despite great fatigue and great disturbances coming from a wave of gas, refused to be replaced and continued his service until all the wounded were evacuated.”

After returning from the war, Frank went to Pine River, Minnesota to become a dentist. In 1921, he founded American Legion Post 98 in St. Paul Park, Minnesota with the help of fellow local World War I veterans and named the Legion hall after his brother, Richard.

A generation later, following in the service of his grandfather, John Dingle joined the U.S. Army in May 1982.

“I wanted to be an Airborne Ranger,” he said.

Determined, he started his military career in basic training, then completed advanced individual training (AIT), as well as the airborne, and air assault schools.

“It’s about taking the challenge in front of you,” John said. “It’s what defines you.”

He was initially assigned to the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade combat team, 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. He was later transferred to the 2nd Ranger Battalion at Fort Lewis, Washington. During this time, he completed Ranger School.

He served with the Ranger Battalion until 1986 and decided to attend college at Saint Martins University in Washington State, where he joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.

“My proudest moment is getting through it all, basic training, AIT, airborne, air assault, Ranger School, and getting to where I wanted to be,” John said. “The second proudest would be commissioning as an officer.”

John served as an officer until 1991 at the age of 32.

“My life would have been drastically different if it wasn’t for the military,” John said.

Starting a family a few years later, John has four children. Three of the four sons, including his son Jordan, decided to follow in the footsteps of their family’s Veterans and joined the military.

“Service has always been on my mind since I was a little kid,” Jordan said. “I was always surrounded by it growing up and my dad would always talk about his time in the service.”

He attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and was commissioned as an armor officer May 21, 2022.

Jordan graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in military history and landed in the top 30 percent of his class.

Like his father, Jordan began completing tough training and military courses, like the U.S. Army’s Armor Basic Officer Leader Course, the Bradley Commander’s Course, and the Scout Leader Course.

“The most challenging of the courses was the Armor Basic Officer Leader Course,” Jordan said. “I had to learn to fight mounted on an (M1A2) Abrams which is similar to fighting dismounted, but maneuvering tanks provides a greater tactical challenge. It was definitely a learning curve.”

He eventually was assigned to the “Rock of the Marne,” the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division, which earned its nickname for its heroics on the same French battlefields of the First World War where his great grandfather and great-great uncle served. In fact, the 3rd Infantry Division fought alongside U.S. Marine Corps units during the Battle of Belleau Wood near the Marne River in 1918, where Jordan’s great-great uncle was killed in action.

“It’s probably my proudest moment in my military career to join the 3rd Infantry Division,” said Jordan. “The history of this unit is very inspiring: from the Thunder Runs in Baghdad, Vietnam, most campaigns in the European theater of war during the Second World War, and then back to my lineage, World War I.”

Like many service members, Jordan, who is currently deployed in Eastern Europe, looks to his fellow Veterans and his family’s legacy of service as a source of inspiration in his own service.

Members of the Dingle family have served in World War II, Vietnam, and Afghanistan to the present day in addition to Jordan’s service with the 3rd Infantry Division in Europe.

“I think it’s humbling to be able to serve in Europe just like previous Dingles,” Jordan said. “I am proud of my family for serving, especially my great-grandfather, and great-great-uncle, for their sacrifices. They represented the family well for the service they gave and I want to thank them for their impact on my life even though I’ve never met them.”

Veterans Day takes on a special meaning for Jordan. It’s important to him to not only reflect on family members who have served or those who continue to serve, like his brothers, but it’s important to remember all those who have served for the United States, he said.

“Ultimately it’s about selfless service and sacrifice,” Jordan said. “Most people see military sacrifice through the lens of combat, but it also encompasses the day-to-day sacrifice. It harkens back to being told what you do, even if it’s not something you want to do, you do it. Service members choose to join the military, to be something bigger than themselves, to give back to the country, and to challenge themselves every day. That’s why we honor service members on Veterans’ Day.”

Jordan’s service may very well inspire another generation of his family or other Americans to follow in his footsteps of service one day, just as previous generations of Dingles inspired him. He wants to continue being the best he can be for his unit and country. He hopes to attend law school someday and continue his service in the Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps. At the same time, his brothers are currently serving elsewhere in the U.S. Army. Capt. Jack Dingle is the commander of Alpha “Able” Company, 3rd Battalion, 509 Infantry (Airborne) in Anchorage, Alaska, and 2nd Lt. Jared Dingle is attending the Infantry Basic Officer Leadership Course at Fort Moore, Georgia.

As for John, he has plans to retire and move to Florida within the year.

“I am very proud of all four of my boys,” John said. “What comes to mind when I think of Jordan, he’s very intellectual. He enjoys learning and sharing his knowledge. I’m proud of what he has accomplished so far in his career, and I can’t wait to see what he does in the future.”"

WASHINGTON – As the air raid sirens and mortar blasts went off, medical evacuation crews dropped the wounded off at a hospital near the demilitarized zone. Young nurses worked around-the-clock to treat the injured despite attacks from the Viet Cong in South Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam War.

Some of the nurses never made it back and are honored on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Many of the other women gather each year at the Vietnam Women’s Memorial for camaraderie and to share stories of the past. This Saturday several of those women will celebrate the memorial’s 30th anniversary in Washington.

Call to Service

Many female combat veterans were following in their family members’ footsteps when they joined the Army.

Two former first lieutenants described their family connections. Patti Ehline’s father served in World War II and Vietnam. Her future husband was also joining the Army and would serve in Vietnam with her. Mary “Edie” McCoy Meeks commissioned into the military because her brother joined the Marines.

Capt. Diane Carlson Evans became an Army nurse because her brother served in the 101st Airborne Division, and then her other brother was drafted. Mary Breed, also a first lieutenant, joined after losing family members and a friend. Her brother was injured in Vietnam in 1968; a friend from her church was killed; and her girlfriend’s brother died.

“I was closely affected by the war,” she said.

Eileen King, then a second lieutenant, didn’t have any family members who served but felt a call to service. “There was a lot of criticism about America, what it stood for, especially about our military,” she said. “I wanted to serve my country. I felt very protective of my nation and the military. I wanted to do my bit.”

Nurse Recruiting

Jobs for women were limited in the 1960s. Many of the female nurse candidates were in nursing school when Army recruiters contacted them about joining the Army Nurse Corps.

“They were desperate for nurses over in Vietnam. They were desperate for stateside nurses to take care of the wounded because the Army hospitals needed staff,” Breed said.

As a student nurse, Breed received permission from her parents to enlist and sought out an Army recruiter. “I said, ‘I’m going to graduate next year as a registered nurse. How do I go to Vietnam?’” Carlson Evans said. “The Army offered the Army Student Nurse Program because there was a shortage of military nurses. They paid my tuition, my books and my uniforms my senior year in college. It was nice.”

They all said they passed their state boards, enlisted as private first classes for basic training, and then commissioned into the Army Nurse Corps.

In the trenches

The Viet Cong dug tunnels under the hospitals and stole equipment while the nurses worked in shifts that lasted 12 hours or longer. Soldiers would go into the tunnels to retrieve equipment but some would die from fatal cobra attacks.

The nurses learned techniques such as starting intravenous lines in the dark, performing amputations and working with burn patients.

“We had to measure up. When a Soldier came in and his life depended on us, we learned quickly,” Evans said. “We were the youngest nurses ever sent into battle. We had energy and stamina. We wanted to do our job. We were given a mission. We wanted to get each other home alive.

The men sandbagged the hooches and hospitals as they were rocketed and mortared. They were in the guard towers, some standing guard, getting killed, protecting us. We were in the hospitals saving lives.”

She said they heard artillery rounds 24 hours a day.

“We got used to the sounds of war, but we pulled together as a team. The men valued our service, and we valued theirs,” Carlson Evans said.

Breed worked at the 18th Surgical Hospital, which sat close to the demilitarized zone, and the 95th Evacuation Hospital.

“Sometimes you would have at least four doctors [working] on the same patient at the same time,” she said. “In the U.S., doctors take turns. Everybody had to work at once as quickly as possible to save the patient’s life and then move on to the next patient.”

“There was a tremendous team effort in caring for our patients,” Capt. Elaine Niggemann added. “We worked long hours but everyone pitched in. Some days were very hard but the camaraderie among us was great. It was enlightening to go from a college atmosphere to a war zone caring for patients.”

Memorable Patients

While nurses remember quite a few of their patients, each of the nurses have memorable patients from Vietnam.

King worked with a pilot who had lost both of his legs and one of his arms.

“It was obvious he was going to die. I don’t remember his name; I feel so guilty about it,” she said.

She said she went to the bathroom and when she came back, she saw that someone had left a letter for him.

It was from his wife and had a photo of his wife and child in it. “She told him she loved him,” she said.

Although King was tired from working a double shift, she said she didn’t want to leave. King finally had to rest for a few hours before her next shift. The pilot died 20 minutes later.

“For years, I wondered if I had just stayed, would he have lived longer? But I did my best,” she said.

Edie Meeks said an encounter with a young Soldier from Kansas still haunts her.

“I read a letter to him from his mom. She talked about his dad just coming in from pheasant hunting with his dog. At the end, she said, ‘We’re so proud of you, son.’ Three days later, he died,” she said.

Breed said she was in civilian clothes shopping at a shoe store on Fort Dix, New Jersey, when a former Soldier approached her.

“He said, ‘You were my nurse in Vietnam,’” she said. “He told me I took off his leg. I took off so many legs. I couldn’t remember each patient at that time and didn’t want to tell him that. I was still grieving the loss of my father at the time. I didn’t even hug him.

“Now I would give him the biggest hug in the world,” she said. “I asked him how he recognized me, and he said, ‘When you’re dying, you remember the last person you heard. You said to me, ‘I’ll take good care of you.’”

Ehline grew attached to a 10-year-old Vietnamese boy named Mai Van Bo. “It was the only day I cried in Vietnam,” she said. “It was the day I had to send him back to his village. I had become very close to him in the months he was at our hospital. He was paralyzed from the waist down, and I feared he wouldn’t survive in the village. His mom and I both cried.”

Niggemann worked three consecutive 12-hour shifts while caring for a young South Vietnamese man in the burn unit. On day four, he had a cardiac arrest and passed away.

“It was very sad and one of the few times I cried at work,” she said. “I will always remember him and the delightful conversations we had before he died. He told me about his family and children.”

Five years ago, she found his sister while searching the internet and spoke to her on the phone. “It was an emotional conversation,” she said. “I was able to answer some of the questions she and her family had regarding their loved one [and] tell her how much the nurses cared for and liked her brother; and that he did not die alone. It was an incredibly healing phone call for both of us.”

Life After Vietnam

Because of their hands-on experience, many of the Vietnam nurses went on to become physicians, dentists, civilian nurses and other high-ranking positions which were uncommon to women in the 1960s and 1970s.

Evans served as head nurse in a surgical intensive care unit and recovery room at Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas, and then founded the Vietnam Women’s Memorial in Washington.

Ehline serves on boards for the Vietnam Veterans of America to fight for the rights of veterans with PTSD.

Niggemann went to medical school and became a doctor.

Breed worked as an ICU nurse for the Department of Veterans Affairs for 15 years, as a missionary nurse for two years and then in the operating room.

King went on to practice law for 10 years, then she sat on the Superior Court of California. Now, she serves on the California Court of Appeal.

Advice for the Next Generation

Nurses faced mortar attacks and worked long shifts from Vietnam to Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. For these Vietnam nurses, they said they’d do it again in a heartbeat and recommend service to the next generation of nurses.

“It was an honor to serve in the Army Nurse Corps. I would do it all over again,” Niggemann said.

“Those two years changed my life, and I’d do it all again in a minute. Don’t just sit on the sidelines of life. Step up and participate,” Meeks said. “For the nurses after me, talk to each other, get help if you need it. We don’t have to carry everything alone.”

“I encourage young people to think about the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, some area of service,” Evans said. “I’m biased. I liked the Army. I liked boots on the ground. I wanted to be close to where the fighting was. Serving our country makes us more united; taking that oath to protect the Constitution and our democracy.”

WASHINGTON — Before James Earl Jones was making Americans remember their love of baseball or striking fear into their hearts as the voice of Darth Vader, he was an Army officer.

He commissioned in the summer of 1953 as a second lieutenant following graduation from the Reserve Officer Training Corps at the University of Michigan. After his initial training, he completed his first and only assignment by establishing a cold weather training command at the former Camp Hale near Leadville, Colorado.

Jones is just one of many Army veterans who not only served their country but also had illustrious civilian careers.

Below are a few others:

Tony Bennett

The late Tony Bennett was the son of Italian immigrants and grew up during the Great Depression in New York. Born Anthony Dominick Benedetto, he was drafted into the Army in 1944 during World War II.

As a young Soldier, he deployed to Europe with the 63rd Infantry Division, which replaced large casualties suffered during the Battle of the Bulge. His division fought its way across Germany throughout 1945 and liberated the concentration camp at Dachau.

At the end of the war, Cpl. Benedetto was sent to Mannheim, Germany as part of an Allied occupation force. There, he started singing with the 314th Army Special Services Band under the stage name Joe Bari.

Bennett used his GI Bill to study bel canto singing at the American Theatre Wing in New York City after leaving the Army in 1946. He was discovered shortly after by Bob Hope while he was on tour with Pearl Bailey. Hope told him he needed to change his name and said they would start calling him Tony Bennett.

Bennett went on to win 20 Grammy Awards and two Emmys during his prestigious career before passing away this summer.

Robert Duvall

Actor and filmmaker Robert Duvall grew up in a military household. He was the son of Navy Rear Adm. William Howard Duvall. Instead of following in his father’s Navy footsteps, Duvall enlisted in the Army in 1953 at the end of the Korean War.

He served two years at Camp Gordon, Georgia, now Fort Eisenhower, before being honorably discharged as a private first class.

He too used his GI Bill to take acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. He was classmates with Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Gene Hackman. His big acting break came in 1962 playing Boo Radley in “To Kill a Mockingbird.”

That springboarded a career that saw Duvall appear in many military theme films including “M*A*S*H,” “The Great Santini,” “Gods and Generals,” and “Apocalypse Now.”

Duvall, now 92, spends some of his spare time visiting Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals to thank injured veterans for their service.

Another celebrity that was drafted in the 1950s was Clint Eastwood, known to many as “Dirty Harry.” He became a swimming instructor at Fort Ord, California, after basic training.

In his spare time, he was a bouncer at bars and clubs off base, gaining recognition from some in Hollywood. After his honorable discharge in 1953, he used his GI Bill education benefit to take acting classes.

That was the start of a 70-year career in the entertainment industry as an actor, director and producer of movies and television.

The “King of Rock and Roll” went from superstar to Army private after getting drafted in 1957. Following an initial service deferment to finish filming a movie, Presley went through basic training in 1958 before being assigned to the 2nd Armored Division and then the 3rd Armored Division.

He spent two years on active duty, which included an 18-month stint in Germany where he was a truck driver. He finished his Army career as a sergeant and received an honorable discharge in 1960.

""I was in a funny position,” he said during an Armed Forces Radio and Television interview before his discharge. “Actually, that's the only way it could be. People were expecting me to mess up, to goof up in one way or another. They thought I couldn't take it and so forth, and I was determined to go to any limits to prove otherwise, not only to the people who were wondering, but to myself.

Jackie Robinson

The future Hall of Famer and man who broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson was drafted into the Army in 1942 during World War II. This was following a distinguished college career at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he became the first athlete to letter in four sports: baseball, basketball, football and track.

He was initially assigned to a segregated cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas, before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1943. He joined the 761st “Black Panthers” Tank Battalion.

In 1944, Robinson boarded an Army bus and was ordered to sit in the back but refused. He was taken into custody by military police and court-martialed. He was later acquitted and sent to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky.

There, he served as an Army athletics coach until receiving an honorable discharge in 1944. The next year, Robinson began playing baseball for the Missouri’s Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro leagues. He was spotted by Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Rickey signed Robinson and placed him with Brooklyn’s minor-league club, the Montreal Royals. Robinson was called up to make his major league debut with the Dodgers in 1947 as the first African-American player in MLB history.

He went on to be a six-time All-Star, Rookie of the Year and 1955 World Series champion. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 and passed away in 1972. His number was retired by MLB in 1997.

Schulz Museum; Roger Higgins/Library of Congress) VIEW ORIGINAL

The man we all must thank for “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” Schulz is the author and illustrator of the popular “Peanuts” newspaper comic strip, which stars Charlie Brown, Snoopy and friends.

Before he created the iconic series, Schulz, who grew up near Saint Paul, Minnesota, was drafted into the Army in 1943 during World War II. He served as a staff sergeant in the 20th Armored Division.

He came back to the U.S. in 1947 and started his career as an illustrator with the publication “Li’l Folks” in the St. Paul Pioneer Press. He pitched a four-panel strip to the United Feature Syndicate, and it was accepted.

The first release of “Peanuts” was Oct. 2, 1950, and it ran until Feb. 13, 2000. He passed away in his sleep at 77 after completing the final comic strip.

Cooper, an Army veteran and Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army who holds more than 20 U.S. patents was awarded the medal for developing innovations in wheelchair technology and helping to strengthen the nation’s well-being. Cooper has dedicated his career to helping veterans to lead full and rewarding lives through engineering and advancing assistive technology.

WASHINGTON — While bike riding along a busy German road, Rory Cooper suffered an injury that changed the trajectory of his life.

An avid runner, the Army sergeant pedaled to work while recovering from knee pain on a summer day in 1980. Suddenly, a bus sideswiped with his bike. The impact pushed Cooper into the oncoming traffic, where a semi-truck hit Cooper and his bike.

Cooper awoke in a German hospital with tubes inserted into his body. The impact broke his clavicle, several ribs and ruptured his spine. Doctors told him that he would never walk again.

The sergeant didn’t know then, but the devastating injury would steer him towards a career where his work would touch the lives of thousands of Soldiers and civilians.

Years of treatment and therapy would follow for the sergeant before his medical discharge from the Army in 1982. As Cooper recovered and began planning his next steps, he never forgot the lessons he learned during his years in the Army as a unit armorer and civil affairs Soldier.

“If you take care of your people, they will take care of you,” he said. “I also learned about the importance of selfless service and not leaving anyone behind.”

The native of San Luis Obispo, California applied those lessons to the rest of his life.

He devoted his career to improving the lives of people with disabilities, from his research at the University of Pittsburgh to his more than three decades of work as a senior scientist and director of the Department of Veterans Affairs Human Engineering Research Laboratories. Cooper and his research teams developed new models of wheelchairs and services designed to make activities and facilities more accessible to patients throughout the nation.

Those achievements culminated in a White House ceremony Oct. 24 when Cooper accepted the National Medal of Technology and Innovation Medal from President Biden, the highest honor for technological achievement.

The medal reflected the impact of his wheelchair and service innovations, and the example he set for future rehabilitation engineers as a professor and mentor. Two days later, the distinguished professor was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

Since 2014, Cooper has served as a Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army, or CASA, for Western Pennsylvania. In addition to acting as advisors to Army Secretary Christine E. Wormuth, CASAs use their positions of influence to connect the Army with the larger civilian population.

“I think the CASA program is awesome. The CASAs that I’ve had the opportunity to work with are truly remarkable Americans and patriots,” Cooper said from his office in Pittsburgh. “[The CASA program] allowed me to connect with the Army in a deeper, broader way. I intend to stay connected and serve the Army in any way I can add value.”

As a CASA, he has coordinated Army-related events at the Pittsburgh Marathon and worked with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers on visits by Army leaders. During the marathon, he organized the planning of Army recruiter stations at the race and a military relay. Cooper said he coordinates internships for veterans and helps former service members with job placement.

“Being a CASA has been good for me because at the time I was injured, there was no warrior transition support,” Cooper said. “You just kind of went from being in the Army to being a patient. It’s been great to reconnect with the Army and serve again.”

Following that July 1980 injury, Cooper faced a crossroads in his life. He had originally considered returning to the Army as a commissioned officer prior to the accident, but after his spinal injury, he admittedly didn’t know his next move.

Cooper’s commanding general in Germany, then-Maj. Gen. Clarence McKnight visited Cooper at the hospital and encouraged him to pursue a career in engineering science.

“[He] told me I should continue to pursue my dreams,” Cooper said.

Before the bicycle accident, Cooper represented the Army as a track and cross country athlete at the World Military Games. While studying electrical engineering at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo County, Cooper again found his competitive edge, and began training to compete in wheelchair racing and wheelchair basketball.

He later participated in the National Veterans Wheelchair Games and eventually became a Paralympian, winning bronze at the 1988 Paralympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. He currently chairs the Paralympic Games Science Task Force, which studies athlete classification and ethical standards.

After receiving his master’s degree in electrical engineering at California Polytechnic State University Cal Poly, Cooper earned his doctorate in electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Cooper considers himself a “Soldier for Life,” concurrently contributing to the Army while working on his research in academia.

One of his projects at the University of Pittsburgh included the development of a lightweight, battery less wheelchair called a “PneuChair,” which allowed people with disabilities to participate in waterparks. Through the use of a joystick, patients could control their movements in the park while eliminating the danger of electrocution.

Cooper also invented a device known as the SmartWheel, which tracks and categorizes user movement and a variable-compliance joystick that makes wheelchair controls customizable.

“My proudest achievement, besides convincing my wife to marry me, is creating the Human Engineering Research Laboratories and all that we have been able to do, the people I’ve been able to train, and the impact that we’ve been able to have on the lives of people in our veteran population,” Cooper said.

For more nearly 30 years, Cooper worked with the Wounded Warriors program to help accommodate the needs of veterans with spinal injuries, traumatic brain injuries and multiple amputations. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Cooper made regular visits to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.

Cooper provided the veterans with devices that included ultra-light wheelchairs, and manual wheelchairs.

“To see our service members come back despite the challenges they were facing was very rewarding,” Cooper said. “We really give them good, quality wheelchairs and teach them about hand cycles, [cycles powered by hands]. To me it was very rewarding to see that the technology that we had contributed to was allowing them to get back into society.”

Cooper served as an Army World Class Athlete Program coach for the Army’s Paralympic athletes in wheelchair racing in 2011, even training future Paralympian swimmer Elizabeth Marks. Cooper also helped former Army Col. Greg Gadson, who lost both of his legs during a bomb attack, with his mobility. Cooper trained Gadson on hand cycling and helped get his wheelchair fitted.

“It is a privilege to serve. I’m very grateful to have served as a Soldier and then again as an athlete, and as a coach,” Cooper said. “It’s pretty meaningful.”

WASHINGTON — Around the corner from the Vietnam Wall stands a bronze statue of a nurse with a wounded soldier lying across her lap and sandbags at her feet. A second nurse searches for a medivac while the kneeling female Soldier stares at an empty helmet. The scenes are enshrined on the Vietnam Women’s Memorial, a monument that honors the services of women during the Vietnam War.

Female Vietnam veterans visited the memorial for its 30th anniversary celebration this past Saturday. Among them was the woman who spent 10 years fighting for its construction.

“I founded the Vietnam Women’s Memorial because I was very proud of the women I served with, and I felt they hadn’t received recognition and honor and had been left out of our memorials, books and movies,” said Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a captain and nurse in the Army.

The Vietnam Women’s Memorial, unveiled on Nov. 11, 1993, is the first monument to honor the efforts of military women at the National Mall. Evans, a Vietnam War veteran, said her time in the Army inspired her to find and tell more stories of women who served.

“No one really talked about the women who served in the military,” she said. “We were just invisible veterans. Even while we were serving, there wasn’t a lot written about what we were doing around the world during the Vietnam era. My service in Vietnam galvanized me to help tell their stories.”

Veterans returning from Vietnam weren’t welcomed by the public, Evans said. “It was very painful but I was very proud of my service, what I had done and accomplished, but we weren’t allowed to show that pride as women or men because we were being disparaged and diminished and scorned for serving our country. It was extremely painful,” she said.

After attending the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1982, she said she started to heal but recognized that many women who had served remained unknown.

“When I started this effort in 1983, I had to defend my proposal as to why women deserve this and why there should be an addition,” Evans said “There’s lots of criteria and gatekeeping, all kinds of opposition. It took 10 years of fighting and winning various approvals and working with Congress. It was like a second war for me. I wanted to honor my sister veterans.”

Her Time in Vietnam

Evans was raised around farmers while growing up in Buffalo, Minnesota. In 1964, many of those farmers were getting drafted. Two of her brothers enlisted in the Army, and one served with the 101st Airborne Division. While attending nursing school, Evans decided to talk to an Army recruiter. She learned the Army had a shortage of nurses and decided to join the service.

The military paid for her tuition, books and uniforms for her senior year in college. After her college graduation, Evans was assigned to Kenner Army Hospital at Fort Lee, Virginia for training. Finally, she deployed to Vietnam from August 1968 to August 1969.

“We were the youngest nurses ever sent into battle,” Evans said. “Most of us were under 25 years old. I was 21. The casualties in Vietnam in ’68 and ’69 were huge.

It was the height of the war, and I learned quickly. It didn’t take long to learn how to start IVs in the dark. We had to measure up when some Soldier came in and his life depended on us. We learned quickly. We were young and had a lot of energy.”

She said the hospital would get rocketed and mortared regularly. Soldiers put sandbags around the hospital and manned the guard towers.

“We were in the hospital saving lives as we heard incoming and outgoing artillery. We got used to knowing what the sounds meant; the air raid sirens,” Evans said. “We pulled together as a team — men and women. Our job was to take care of each other and get our jobs done and get home safely. We were there to protect our patients.”

Because of her hands-on experience in Vietnam, when she returned to the U.S., she was immediately promoted to captain at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. She later became head nurse in a surgical intensive care unit and recovery room.

Nurses on the Wall

Evans said she and her fellow nurses helped save the lives of 300,000 men who were wounded in Vietnam. “We were with so many of the men [whose names are on the Vietnam Wall] when they took their last breath,” she said.

Many of the nurses who made it back from the war continued their careers as physicians, dentists, teachers and colonels, Evans said. Some even went on to be the first female generals, including Brig. Gen. Anna Mae Hays, the chief of the Army Nurse Corps who became the U.S. military's first female general officer.

Importance of Memorial

Vietnam veteran Eileen Moore, now a justice with California Courts of Appeal, said having the memorial is important for her and the other female veterans.

“Being there and being among the other nurses who had gone to Vietnam was really healing for me,” the former second lieutenant said. “I had never tried dealing with the memories. Being around that statue and the other nurses helped me begin healing. The community really helps you.”

Moore, travelled from California to attend the anniversary, said she will never forget a pilot she treated who lost both of his legs and one of his arms. Like Moore, the pilot was Irish, so Moore spent more than 12 hours singing him Irish songs that they both had grown up with.

“I could see tears going down his face because I suspected his parents sang him the same songs,” she said. “I took a break and when I had come back, there was a letter for him. One of the guys in his unit must have brought it in. I opened it up and read it to him. It was from his wife. It had a picture of his wife and a little boy. She told him she loved him.”

She said her time in Vietnam gave her the courage to go to law school, sit on the Superior Court of California and then the California Court of Appeal.

Mary “Edie” McCoy Meeks served as a first lieutenant from February 1968 to February 1970 in Vietnam. She said she joined the Army Nurse Corps so that she could be there for her brother, a U.S. Marine, if he suffered an injury.

She said the memorial saved her life.

“I now know where to find women who speak my language; no explanations necessary, no judgements, just understanding,” she said.

If she could, McCoy said she would join the Army Nurse Corp again in a heartbeat. “Don’t sit on the sidelines of life. Step up, participate,” she encouraged.

For the nurses of the next generation, she said, “Talk to each other, it makes all the difference. Get help if you need it. We don’t have to carry everything alone.”

Mary Breed was a first lieutenant from 1969 to 1971 in Vietnam. Because of her on-the-job experience, she became an ICU nurse for the Department of Veterans Affairs for about 15 years and worked as a missionary nurse in developing countries.

“Vietnam taught me a lot,” she said. “I learned you are not self-sufficient. You have to work as a team and respect what everybody does. Their job is just as important as yours.”

She said she’s honored to have the memorial.

“I can’t thank Diane enough for all of the work she put in to make that possible,” she said. “As women, we’re taught to just accept life experiences. A lot of people kept it inside. We all identified with at least one of the people on that statue. I identified with the one holding the patient and the one looking up to the choppers.”

She said 17 crew members from the 237th Dustoff medical evacuation helicopters died the year she was in Vietnam so she was thankful she made it back safely.

“The statue is very moving, and I’m so thankful,” she said. “I hope it leads to more recognition of women in conflict and war.”

Call to Serve

As a pioneer who led the way for nurses to serve in the years that followed Vietnam, Evans encourages young women of the next generation to join the military.

“It’s the responsibility of each one of us to serve our country in some way. It makes us a better country to know that we took an oath to protect the Constitution, to protect our democracy,” she said. “We should all be taking that oath and stepping up to do whatever we can in service through military service or some kind of service to our country. It makes us a stronger, more united country.""

WHEELER ARMY AIRFIELD, Hawai'i — The normally quiet airstrips of Wheeler Army Airfield have transformed into a buzzing hub of military activity as airfield operations increase their support the 25th Infantry Division’s Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Capability (JPMRC) exercise. The airfield, which traditionally accommodates helicopters from the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade and unmanned aerial systems, has expanded its operations to include large fixed-wing aircraft, significantly increasing its traffic and operational intensity.

""Since the onset of the joint and multi-national exercise around October 27, operations have been ceaseless, functioning round-the-clock,"" stated James Knight, Wheeler Army Airfield's Airfield Manager. Knight highlighted a significant surge in activity, particularly noting an exceptional increase in fixed-wing operations involving C-17s and C-130s, marking an unprecedented level of activity compared to recent years.

This year's exercise has supported air and ground traffic averaging 850 movements per day, a substantial escalation from last year's exercise, which supported only five C-17s. The marked uptick in operations underscores the expanding scope and scale of the training exercises, reflecting a heightened focus on readiness and capability across the joint forces.

The airfield's operations team has been working tirelessly to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of these aircraft, coordinating closely with air traffic control, and conducting regular airfield inspections for potential safety hazards.

Rory Turner of Wheeler Army Airfield Base Operations noted the logistical complexity involved. ""Our workflow has at least quadrupled,"" he explained. ""We're not just managing our helicopters now but also processing the influx of C-17s and C-130s, ensuring they're smoothly integrated into the national airspace.""

The expanded operations have necessitated a collaborative effort with other military and civilian agencies to coordinate the use of airspace and ensure safety. This has included issuing Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) to inform the local flying community of the military exercises and the potential hazards they may present.

Despite the challenges, including increased noise concerns and the need to close roads around the airfield for safety, the exercise has been a success, with all involved units contributing to an effective and efficient operation.

""It's been intense,"" said Spc. Jennifer Arreola, now a rated controller thanks to the rigorous training provided during the exercise. ""We've had to remain vigilant, but it has been rewarding to see all the pieces come together.""

In addition to supporting JPMRC, the Wheeler team has continued to move forward with multi-million dollar infrastructure projects, which began two years ago, such as new maintenance hangars for the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, while simultaneously deconflicting current operations to maintain safety.

""This exercise has tested our capabilities and shown our ability to adapt and manage a significant increase in operations,"" said Samuel (Reggie) Aricayos, Wheeler Airfield Operations, manager. ""It's about orchestrating everything in concert, and I'm proud of how our team has handled the challenge."""

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas — On Oct. 28, Fort Cavazos hosted many local veterans to thank them for their service during Retiree Appreciation Day here.

The former service members were welcomed into the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in the morning, where there were pastries and coffee waiting for them before the opening ceremony.

The ceremony began with Col. Lakicia Stokes, U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos commander, welcoming the attendees and acknowledging their contributions to the nation.

“I am deeply honored to stand before you today on behalf of Lieutenant General (Sean) Bernabe, the III Armored Corps and Fort Cavazos commanding general, to express our heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for your unwavering dedication, sacrifice and service to our nation,” she began. “As we gather here on this special occasion, it is important to reflect on the profound impact that each and every one of you has had on the defense of our nation. You are the embodiment of our military values, the legacy selfless service and the embodiment of duty honor and country. Retirees, you have witnessed firsthand the transformation of our military, the challenges and triumphs of the past to the innovations and advancements of today. You have been part of our nation’s history and your contributions have helped shape the strength and resilience of our military.

“Today, as we take this opportunity to spread gratitude, we also acknowledge the sacrifices that you and your families have made,” Stokes continued. “You endured long deployments, faced uncertainty and supported one another through thick and thin. Your commitment to our nation’s defense is an inspiration to all who wear the uniform. Our annual Retiree Day serves as a small token of our gratitude, but it’s our hope that you feel our greatest appreciation everyday.”

Many of the retirees in attendance were active members of the community, including Killeen Mayor Debbie Nash-King. Stokes acknowledged their continued service.

“We recognize that your service did not end with retirement,” she said. “Many of you continue to give back to our communities, mentor the next generation of leaders and support our Soldiers and their families in various ways. Your continued engagement is a testament to your enduring dedication.”

During the ceremony, a presentation with Soldiers wearing historical and current uniforms showed the long history of the U.S. military. Honorary retiree retired Sgt. Maj. Guadalupe Lopez was also recognized for his years of service in and out of uniform.

Guest speaker Robert Farias, assistant director of the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, spoke to the retirees on the health care available to them in the area and thanked them for their service.

“Thank you for your service,” he said. “Thank you for your bravery. Thank you to your spouses and family members for supporting you … and most importantly, thank you for all of your great sacrifices to our great country.”

There were many resources available to the retirees at the hospital including the CRDAMC Health Fair, which provided immunizations as well as health screenings. There were resources also available around Fort Cavazos, including legal assistance and ID card services.

Stokes encouraged them to take advantage of the resources available at the facility, connect with other veterans and allow the installation to help them receive the benefits and support that they earned through their service.

“As we look to the future, know that your legacy lives on in the military service members who stand here today and those who will follow in your footsteps,” she said.

“Your wisdom, experiences and leadership continue to guide us as we face the challenges of an ever-changing world,” Stokes added. “The bond that connects us as military service members, past and present, is unbreakable and we stand united in our commitment to defending freedom and protecting our great nation.”"

KILLEEN, Texas — Hundreds came out to enjoy the United Service Organizations at Fort Cavazos Trunk or Treat with H-E-B Operation Appreciation event Oct. 27 at the Killeen Special Events Center here.

Originally slated to be held on Fort Cavazos, the event was moved to the indoor venue because of inclement weather.

But a few intermittent showers didn’t stop hundreds of attendees who waited outside in long lines, while hundreds more enjoyed the festivities inside.

Benjamin Griffin explained that the USO at Fort Cavazos partnered with H-E-B for their Operation Appreciation 10-year anniversary, making the annual Halloween event one of the biggest ever.

“Events like this is something that’s super exclusive to our active-duty service members and their families. That’s what it’s about,” he said. “We see all these kids out here dressed up and we have provided a safe environment for them to come enjoy some candy, enjoy a bouncy house, some ice cream, some music and it’s once a year that we’re able to do something like this.”

With the smell of barbecue in the air and the upbeat sounds of the 1st Cavalry Division Band entertaining onlookers, the wide-open space bustled with interactive activities, circus performers, face painting stations, games, six large bouncy houses and a huge inflatable slide.

Because no Trunk or Treat event would be complete without an array of sweet treats, the USO at Fort Cavazos staff and volunteers, along with volunteers from the Directorate of Public Works, 1st Medical Brigade and Cavalry Family Housing, handed out candy.

The H-E-B mobile kitchen provided barbecue sandwiches, drinks, popcorn and cotton candy. Guests also delighted in using the 360-activation station.

Military spouse Sandy Kerfoot and her five children made quite a creative and tasty impression dressed as a variety of iconic characters representing their favorite cereals.

“It’s the highlight of our Halloween season, picking out costumes,” she said.

Kerfoot shared that dressing up is a 12-year tradition for her children and the event was a great opportunity to bond with other military families.

“It’s just great to see the whole community out together, making those connections, seeing those same people over and over again.”

But it wasn’t just the youngsters that showed off their creativity when it came to their Halloween get-ups.

Dressed as superheroes, the Go Team Therapy/Crisis Dogs Central Texas joined in the fun and delighted guests with their inventive outfits and friendly dispositions.

Spc. Brittney Caraway and Spc. Sahria Blanks, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command, said the event was a great way for Soldiers to get out and have a good time.

“It’s important for the unit as a whole to boost morale and get to know each other,” Caraway said.

“You have people that come, dress up, without it being so serious. We can actually have fun together,” Blanks added.

Griffin estimated that more than 4,500 Soldiers, military families and Halloween enthusiasts attended the event, adding that it’s about serving the military community.

“At the USO, it’s all about hospitality,” Griffin said. “Touching those folks in ways where they can relax, have a good time and just enjoy themselves. We’re talking just an exceptional amount of things that were put into this, and again, with the weather changing, we could not be happier with the turnout.

“This was a once in a lifetime thing to partner with H-E-B to be able to put on this amazing gift for the 10-year anniversary of Operation Appreciation,” he added. “All the stars aligned, and we are just so happy and thrilled to be able to do that to support our community in the best way possible.”"

FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. - When discussing national security is not uncommon to examine India in comparison to China as a rising power in the Indo-Pacific. In the second Cultural and Area Studies panel of the 2023 academic year and 11th of 2022-2023, the impact of India as a rising power, the history of the U.S. and China’s counter strategic stances and basic blockades to a U.S.-China relationship were examined by a panel of experts in each area during the event held Nov. 2.

The panel included Mr. Michael Kugelman, Director of the South Asia Institute, The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; Dr. Megan Greene, Professor of modern Chinese history, Department of History, the University of Kansas; and Mr. Terry Mobley, Diplomacy Chair, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, a career foreign service officer, U.S. Department of State.

Trifold of advantages of India to national security

Kugelman discussed India’s role in the China-U.S. relations from three perspectives; history, geography, and strategy.

In the late 1950’s the U.S. was quite interested in having India as a partner to counter China, but this idea was altered with the changing of administration in the 1970s.

This change was followed by an ebb of pursuit of U.S.-India partnership for nearly 20 years. With the emergence of China competition, the views of India for national security have shifted.

“In the last decade, especially in the last several years, India is being seen as partner in efforts to counter China,” Kugelman explained.

China continues to push westward to expand its presence in south Asia.

China’s recent aggressive territorial claims to areas equally important to the U.S. and India such as the south China Sea and Taiwan Straight have encouraged the U.S. and India to again amplify their partnership, Kugelman explained.

“For many years India has been concerned with what it describes as a ‘String of Pearls’ and ‘Encirclement’ strategy on behalf of China to deepen influence in India’s backyard,” Kugelman said. “India has grown increasingly concerned in more recent years as China has been doing that even more intensely. BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] being one of the main vehicles in which it has done that.”

Kugelman introduced the question if space should be a frontier of concern in the future when it comes to the U.S.-India-China triangle, with a recent lunar landing by India.

Strategically, India has been seen as the best bet to countering China in south Asia due to its size and location, among other areas such as military and population size, he explained.

“U.S.-India relations have been growing exponentially since the early 1990s and trade cooperation has been one of the reasons for that,” Kugelman said. “U.S.-India trade cooperation proceeds along a track that is completely separate from China that doesn’t relate to China competition that much.”

There are challenges for the U.S. India policies due to certain factors such as bureaucracy slowing down or stopping initiatives between the two countries; India’s continued connection to Russia for various goods; and India’s stance on the U.S. alliance system.

“India has vowed to never join the U.S. alliance system because of its policy of strategic autonomy,” Kugelman said.

China-U.S.-Taiwan Relationship: then and now

As early as 1945, the Chinese absorption and then rapidly afterward control over Taiwan began, Greene explained.

Due to the continued control of the Republic of China over Taiwan, in the 1900s and 2000s, Taiwan began to call for separation from China as a whole.

The late 1970s saw the creation of the Taiwan Relations Act by the U.S., vowing the need to ‘maintain capacity’ to defend Taiwan, after the nation was de-recognized within the United Nations.

Prior to this the U.S. invested heavily in Taiwan’s economic growth particularly in the areas of fiscal, advising, and technological support, Greene explained.

“These efforts on the part of both the U.S. and Taiwan have led to the emergence of Taiwan as a high-tech hub in certain areas, with a good example of that is semiconductors,” she said. “In 2023, Taiwan produces more than 60% of all semiconductors and over 90% of the most advanced semiconductors produced worldwide, which is a strategic concern.”

“Although Taiwan was governed for 40 years under martial law, in 1987 martial Law was lifted. It was lifted partly as a strategy to gain support outside of Taiwan,” Greene said.

Since then, Taiwan continues to hold elections that have garnered rotating representation of the parties within elected leaders.

“The democratization was at some level a strategy to solicit continued U.S. support,” Greene said. “It also satisfied the demands on the part of Taiwan’s people to determining their own futures. And it certainly succeeded in doing the later.”

Five Key Issues in China-U.S. Relationship

Taiwan continues to be a central priority to the China-U.S. relationship.

An upcoming election could see a leader in power who is motivated for independence, which would be contrary to China’s thoughts on the nation, Mobley explained.

South China Sea is another area of focus, Mobley said, pointing out the Chinese Nine Dash Line.

A significant trade route for more than 10% of U.S. trades plus competing interests of territories and area create choppy geopolitical waters for this region.

“Maritime domain awareness is something the U.S. has been pushing with south Asian countries for some time now,” Mobley said.

The Senkaku or DiaoYu Islands, are used as a way to push nationalism by China, he explained, making incidents around the area volatile, much like events of similar nature around Taiwan, with the U.S. taking a neutral stance on the area’s sovereignty.

Rare earth elements are critical to several different applications to include defense.

“As of the end of 2022, China accounted for 63% of the world’s rare earth mining, 85% of rare earth processing, and 92% of rare earth magnet production,” Mobley said. “Not just the U.S. but the entire world is heavily, heavily dependent on China for rare earth elements.”

Furthermore, nearly 20% of pharmaceutical ingredients are imported from China, with 40% of global antibiotic production also falling to China.

The discussion continued with questions regarding the effect the Belt and Road Initiative has on the U.S. and China relationship, conversations about what India-U.S. cooperation may look like in space and the potential use of Myanmar by China to bypass the South China Sea trade route tension.

This panel is part of a seminar series discussing issues of operational and strategic importance to the U.S., which CASO in coordination with CGSC, universities, think tanks, interagency and other partners conduct every two to three months, which is also live streamed on CGSC's Facebook page.

124,COMMENTARY: Flanders Fields still remain in the hearts of America’s veterans,https://www.army.mil/article/271557/commentary_flanders_fields_still_remain_in_the_hearts_of_americas_veterans,"Flora four and six open up, blood petals of young poppies,

and dance and weave ‘neath violent winds of change.

War rages betwixt blackened air and chopped seas,

Central Powers four and Allies six, hatred’s blood overspills.

Warriors, rooted, stand their ground where vainglories die—

No hope of home light’s warmth beyond Flanders Fields,

just poppies freely waving where heroes, resting, lie. ~ E. Pilgrim

Some veterans have served in combat, some have served in peacetime, some have served a few days or years, some have served until retirement and beyond. But each has taken the oath to support and defend the Constitution and the United States against all enemies, even if that means losing their life. All are worthy of honor on this and every Veterans Day. (Photo Credit: Eric Pilgrim, Fort Knox News) VIEW ORIGINAL

Like Memorial Day, Veterans Day sprang from war.

Unlike Memorial Day when we remember and honor our fallen heroes, Veterans Day is an opportunity to honor all who have answered the call to serve the nation. Service in war, service in peacetime, 10 days, 10,000 days, it matters not.

It doesn’t matter because those who have served or are serving have done so with the full understanding that they might one day have to sacrifice their lives for that service. It starts with the contractual oath:

“I solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic …”

It’s implied in the Warrior Ethos:

“I will ALWAYS (emphasis mine) place the mission first. I will NEVER accept defeat. I will NEVER quit. I will NEVER leave a fallen comrade.”

It’s clearly spelled out in the Soldier’s Creed: “I am an American Soldier. I am a warrior and a member of a team. I serve the people of the United States, and live the Army Values … I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy, the enemies of the United States of America in close combat.”

Soldiers regularly sing about it in the Army Song at every ceremony: “Count the brave, count the true, who have fought to victory” and “Fighting till the battle’s won.”

They breathe it every day of their service to the nation, spelled out in the Army Values: Loyalty. Duty. Respect. Selfless Service. Honor. Integrity. Personal Courage. Those aren’t empty platitudes that are spoken to deflect the unsuspecting away from our failures or substandard efforts. The words matter. Every word matters.

Most successful organizations have mission statements, mottos, cultural beliefs and standards. Otherwise, they likely wouldn’t be successful. Few employees, though, are willing to die for them. That’s what sets the warrior apart.

It’s what ushered the Central Powers – Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria -- to agree to an armistice with the Allied Forces of France, United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Japan and the United States on Nov. 11, 1918. It was a way for the Central Powers to admit defeat without further bloodshed.

Most historians agree that it was the entrance of America’s warriors into World War I that eventually led to the armistice and then to the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, which officially ended the war. On Nov. 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson officially called for the nation to celebrate “Armistice Day.” He told the public to honor the day with parades and public gatherings as well as a moment of silence at 11 a.m.

Exactly two years later, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was established at Arlington National Cemetery when officials interred and commemorated a warrior who had died in World War I. The Soldier’s casket was chosen by Sgt. Edward Younger out of four identical caskets. Younger had been wounded in the war and had earned the Distinguished Service Medal.

The unrelenting, determined sacrifices of America’s warriors is a fixture in the American psyche. It is stitched into America’s banner: a banner carried in war, a standard raised high in battle by men and women who have answered the call and have stood in the gap to defend the nation’s freedom and its Constitution against all enemies.

Our veterans devoted their lives to safeguarding our freedom. Devote some time on this special day to thank them. Remember the red poppies of Flanders' fields, and honor them all."

MADISON COUNTY, Va. - Virginia National Guard Soldiers assigned to the Sandston-based 2nd Battalion 224th Aviation Regiment, 29th Infantry Division, are helping fight wildfires in Madison County.

In the first 24 hours, VNG aviation crews dropped nearly 10,000 gallons of water on the fires.

After Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Nov. 6, the VNG deployed two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters equipped with 660-gallon water buckets at the request of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management to support the Virginia Department of Forestry.

The Guard planned to continue to assist in the firefighting efforts Nov. 8.

“We are extremely proud of how quickly and safely our aviation crews responded to start assisting with aerial fire suppression in Madison County after Governor Youngkin’s emergency declaration,” said Brig. Gen. Todd H. Hubbard, the Virginia National Guard director of the joint staff.

“The role of the National Guard in domestic operations is to provide additional capabilities to partner agencies to help our fellow citizens in times of need, and this is a perfect example of how that works,“ Hubbard said. “The Department of Forestry and firefighting crews from across the region have been battling the fire in Madison County for nearly two weeks, and now our capabilities give them extra resources in the fight. It is an honor to work with such dedicated professionals towards a common goal.”

VNG aviation crews conducted water bucket training in October at Fort Barfoot. Aviation assets can support firefighting efforts using water buckets, which require periodic training for flight crews to ensure proficiency with the equipment.

The training provided currency and qualifications for three flight crews, capitalizing on lessons learned fighting fires during the unit’s deployment to Kosovo in 2022.

During domestic operations, the VNG receives missions from VDEM and responds as part of a multi-agency team with other state and local agencies.

SAGAMIHARA FAMILY HOUSING AREA, Japan – As his daughter becomes more curious about the world, Chief Warrant Officer 3 Eddie Saldarini said she will often ask questions about his military service and that of others who have served before him.

Saldarini, a support operations maintenance officer assigned to the 35th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, plans to retire soon after a long career that saw him deploy four times to Afghanistan and Iraq.

While in Germany for his previous assignment, he said he would take his daughter, now 13, to visit former concentration camps and other historical sites to learn about the history of World War II.

The trips, and later an opportunity for her to personally thank a WWII veteran during a random encounter, eventually made his daughter want to better understand her father’s own service, he said.

On Tuesday, Saldarini and other current and former service members briefly shared their military stories to groups of fourth graders at Arnn Elementary School here as part of a Veterans Day project.

“I feel like history is important,” he said of why he volunteered for the project. “Maybe it will spark conversations with [the students’] loved ones when they get home, just like it did for my daughter, and it continues to do as she gets older and wants to learn more about what Dad does.”

Charlotte Hansen, a fourth grader, was one of the students who interviewed Saldarini for the project that included a list of questions, such as when and where the veterans served and their best memory in the military.

“I think it’s good to honor Veterans Day, because these veterans came in here today to teach us about what they did or why they served,” she said. “That’s important because we could learn so much from them.”

Another student, Jessica Foxe, said the project was a great way for the students to show their appreciation to all of those who have defended the United States.

“Some people went to war and helped their country,” she said, “so I think it’s important to celebrate and thank them for doing that for us.”

Htet Lin, a former infantryman who served seven years, recalled his 18-month deployment to Iraq, where he conducted a range of missions from convoy security and route clearance to cordon and search operations.

“They are already from military families, so they had a good idea of the military,” he said of the students. “They just wanted to know what other people do in the military.”

Lin, now an operations assistant at the Camp Zama Golf Course, said speaking with the students was refreshing since they took an interest in what the veterans had to say.

“It was a good experience,” he said. “I wish a lot [more veterans would do this], so the kids could have a variety of input or knowledge.”

While somewhat brief, Lin believed the hourlong interviews still provided students a glimpse into what it’s like to serve the nation.

“I hope they can get inspired from it,” he said, “and maybe one day they will sign up for the military and serve their country honorably.”

127,Sowing seeds of service starts with vets,https://www.army.mil/article/271532/sowing_seeds_of_service_starts_with_vets,"REDSTONE ARSENAL, Alabama —The excitement was almost electric when I dropped my kids off at school this morning. You could feel the energy pulsing in the halls and the current of conversation was all about the day’s big event: the Veterans Day program.

As I sat and sipped my coffee waiting for my husband to arrive, I reflected on the morning’s progress so far. My usual challenge of rousing my girls was effortless – they were up and fully dressed before I was – and all because their Soldier dad was coming to school for Veterans Day. It was, apparently, a VERY big deal.

As I observed and listened to the hallway chatter, I heard snippets of conversation. “My mom is a veteran – she’s coming!” “My grandpa is a veteran – he’s coming!” These were endearing to hear, but not surprising. It’s totally natural for immediate relatives to come and support their kids’ and grandkids’ school events.

What did surprise me, however, were those with no familial relation showing up as a guest of a student, or as a supporter of the school. As the program commenced, students and their veterans were announced and then walked under the sabers of an honor guard, getting the full VIP treatment for all in attendance to recognize.

Some who came with the students were announced as friends of the family, others as neighbors. Some of the older veterans who were invited by the school to participate were solo and announced as friends of the school.

Every single one of them was treated like a rock star and cheered by a gym full of pre-kindergarteners to eighth graders. Every. Single. One.

It struck me, as I looked around at little hands waving clutched American flags that, as military families, we often take for granted that everyone has a veteran in their lives. That everyone has someone to set the example of selfless service for them. That everyone has someone who took an oath to protect and defend our nation.

We forget that many of those little flag-waving hands, cheering at the events, want to have a veteran, too. They want to have a special person on Veterans Day to stand proudly next to and declare to the world, “This is MY veteran!”

When you look at the statistics of people who have served in uniform, it’s an astonishingly small number when compared to the rest of the population. And it’s getting smaller by the minute.

Whether through the passing on of those who served in prior wars, or simply the lack of those currently enlisting or commissioning, our supply of veterans is dwindling. And friends, that simply is “unsat” (to employ a phrase often used by veterans when the situation isn’t satisfactory).

So, for those veterans still hearing a call to duty, here is a challenge to you: find a young person who may not have a veteran in their life and be THEIR veteran.

It might be a neighbor, it might be the child of a co-worker, it might be someone you already mentor. Talk to them about your service. Let them know you care about them, and their Veterans Day activities at school.

Be the one to teach them about the importance of selfless service, duty and honor. Be the one who inspires their own service to their community.

Be the one to teach them to be all they can be.

It’s an investment worth your time. Your military leadership and mentorship experience could be the key to their success. Being THEIR veteran could have far-reaching impacts for our nation that you can’t even begin to imagine.

Just take the first step, sow the seeds of service, sit back and watch them grow.

Who knows?

You might just grow a Soldier."

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Senior army leaders from 21 Western Hemisphere nations gathered in the coastal city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for the 2023 Conference of American Armies Commanders Conference beginning on Nov. 6, 2023. Brazil served as the host of this year’s conference as they concluded their role as the permanent executive secretariat of the 35th cycle.

Each CAA cycle lasts two years and rotates on a voluntary basis between the 23 member armies. The theme of the 35th cycle is, “The CAA’s contribution in the process of transformation and preparation of the ‘Army of the Future’ for the expansion of cooperation and integration on confronting the challenges and threats that may affect the security and stability of the American Continent.”

“Just the fact that you are all here means you are committed to strengthening these relationships,” said Brazilian Army Commander, Gen. Miguel Mine Ribeiro Paiva Tomas, during the opening ceremony. “The CAA reinforces the military diplomacy and is a forum where we can have conversations on topics of similar interest. The CAA is indispensable to the politics of the region.”

As a founding member, the U.S. Army stands alongside the partners in an effort to achieve each cycle’s goals. The U.S. Army also recognizes the significance that international organizations such as the CAA play in stabilizing various regions of the world.

“The CAA is an opportunity for us to foster relationships and provides a platform to increase the stability and security across the Americas,” explained Gen. Andrew P. Poppas, U.S. Army Forces Command commanding general and senior U.S. Army representative at the CAA. “I am honored to have taken part in this event.”

Throughout each year, the U.S. Army participates in several training exercises to further the CAA objectives of strengthening integration and cooperation among the American Armies, protect against threats to peace in the region, and advance democracy and freedom.

U.S. Army South, commanded by Maj. Gen. William L. Thigpen, serves as the primary representative for U.S. Army activities throughout the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility.

“Throughout the year, we conduct a large number of events demonstrating our commitment to the CAA objectives, including training exercises, subject matter expert exchanges, and senior leader dialogue,” said Thigpen. “In the past week, Soldiers arrived in Brazil to take part in Exercise Southern Vanguard 24 and we hosted the Chilean Army commander in chief at our headquarters to discuss future combined training opportunities.”

This year’s commanders conference started with an opening ceremony followed by a plenary session, during which the Brazilian Army provided an overview of the 35th cycle’s activities. Participants also reviewed the results of the electronic vote that took place earlier this year which made changes to CAA bylaws, included Portugal as a special observer to the CAA, and identified Paraguay as the host army for the 37th cycle of the CAA.

At the conclusion of the plenary session, attending armies conducted bilateral meetings to discuss shared challenges and security cooperation opportunities.

“This conference was a great experience,” remarked Poppas. “I enjoyed being able to sit down and discuss training opportunities and develop a better understanding of the unique challenges throughout the region.”

This year’s conference concluded with the official handover ceremony marking the end of the Brazilian Army’s role as the permanent executive secretariat as they passed the responsibility over to the Mexican Army, who will fill the position for the two-year duration of the 36th Cycle."

ARLINGTON, Va. – In a hallowed corner of Patton Hall at Northern Virginia’s Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, a journey through the annals of American military history awaits. An officer’s saber from the late 19th century, a World War I-era combat helmet, and a flag that bore witness to the attack on Pearl Harbor stand as sentinels to a remarkable legacy.

Welcome to The 1636 Room, a treasure trove of nearly 200 unique artifacts curated by the National Guard’s 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia. It’s a living tribute to the nation’s oldest military organization.

For Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, the room honors the Guard’s heritage and its legacy of “courage, duty, honor and service.”

“The 1636 Room is a tribute to that tradition, a commemoration of a force unlike any other — one that continues to have an impact as 20% of the Joint Force and continues to shape the course of history,” Hokanson said during the ceremony unveiling the exhibit Nov. 1.

The idea for The 1636 Room originated late last year when Hokanson asked the National Guard Bureau History Office to develop a plan for a heritage space where Guard members could gather for events and social occasions and for others to learn more about the force.

By spring, he signed off on the history office’s recommendation that Patton Hall would be the ideal spot, said Richard Clark, NGB chief historian.

“It is centrally located, and it has a rich history of its own,” he added, noting the 3rd U.S. Regiment, as “the oldest regiment in the Army, has a room at Patton Hall, and it seemed appropriate for the oldest U.S. military organization to have a place there as well.”

Honoring the roots of today’s National Guard, the exhibit space is named in tribute to the 1636 Massachusetts Bay Colony militia and boasts an extensive array of strategically positioned artifacts that include framed flags, panel displays, photographs, visual artworks, and replicas. Clark explained each item encapsulates the essence of unique events, remarkable achievements, unit emblems, and historic missions undertaken by different Guard elements.

Army Maj. Gen. James W. Ring, adjutant general of Virginia, said the series of framed pictures showcasing Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division from its beginnings in World War I to Operation Iraqi Freedom was a fitting contribution to the room.

“For us on the Virginia side, we carry heavy within the 29th,” said Ring, who attended the ceremony along with nearly 150 senior Guard leaders.

While the photographs are significant for Virginia Guard members, Ring said the room’s spirit can resonate with all Soldiers and Airmen.

“This is a chance for all of us to have the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of the Citizen-Soldier and Airman tradition of those that came before us,” he said. “It’s a tremendous honor to be here today.”

NGB history officials emphasized the room’s purpose extends beyond showcasing history.

There is a canteen, cup and mess kit engraved by Soldiers from New Mexico National Guard’s 200th Coast Artillery during World War II. These very Soldiers later endured the harrowing Bataan Death March, followed by internment in POW camps.

The artifacts represent valor and immense suffering. Of the roughly 1,800 Soldiers from New Mexico who fought in the Pacific Theater, only about half returned at the war’s end.

The history office will continue updating the room as it receives more items representing different aspects of Guard heritage.

“As the National Guard evolves, the room will evolve with it,” said Clark, adding the room “is not a static display. It’s a dynamic space that evolves as states swap out artifacts, and as additional states and territories and District of Columbia identify their contributions.”

In his closing remarks, Hokanson said the room — with the intent and purpose of honoring Guard heritage with unique items from the past — is only the beginning.

“These items are not only part of our history — they are part of our ongoing story,” he said.

OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. - The 55th Operations Support Squadron’s survival, evasion, resistance and escape specialists, better known as SERE, joined with the Nebraska Army National Guard to conduct hoist training Nov. 4.

Company G, 2nd General Support Aviation Battalion, 104th Regiment, flew a UH-60 Black Hawk from Lincoln to Offutt, which enabled personnel from both units to carry out some mandatory training.

“In order to maintain our mission-capable status, SERE specialists are required to accomplish hoist proficiency training every 36 months,” said Master Sgt. Clifton Cleveland, 55th OSS SERE program superintendent.

All of the 55th OSS SERE specialists had accomplished their training before arriving at Offutt, so Cleveland came up with a plan to keep them proficient.

“We reached out to the Nebraska National Guard in September and the discussion evolved into this joint training opportunity,” he said.

For the Nebraska Army National Guard Soldiers, this training also allowed them to remain current, which is required every 90 days.

“It is important for us to continuously train hoist to remain proficient for any potential missions we may get,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Russell Kuhlman, G Company, 2-104th GSAB training officer. “For example, during the 2019 floods, we conducted many hoist missions to rescue people from the cold water.”

SERE specialists are experts at surviving in the most remote and hostile environments. Hoist training is invaluable for exfiltrating people when aircraft cannot land.

“Hoist training is designed to prepare SERE specialists and aircrew members how to properly execute recovery tactics, techniques and procedures safely in a wide variety of austere environments,” Cleveland said.

“If an aircraft could not land for whatever reason, like steep terrain, foliage or urban environments, a hoist could be used,” Kuhlman said. “This involves hoisting a medic down to patients to treat, package, triage and evacuate them from the battlefield. Once the medic has done what is needed on the ground, we can hoist patients and the medic out using different types of extraction devices.”

Maintaining proficiency is essential not only to the SERE specialists but also to all of Team Offutt. By maintaining their mission-capable status, they can offer SERE refresher training, a 36-month requirement for all aircrew members.

“The SERE program exists to better train, prepare and equip over 2,700 warfighters here at Offutt as well as at three operating locations and two geographically separated units,” Cleveland said.

With the positive outcome for both units involved, they are already looking ahead for other chances to collaborate.

“This initial integration with the Nebraska Army National Guard has already opened numerous opportunities for our SERE specialists to integrate into future personnel recovery exercises and events together,” Cleveland said.

“There are a lot of valuable training opportunities our teams could mutually benefit from,” Kuhlman said. “We are looking at the possibility of doing a SERE training event for some of our crew chiefs and medics who do not get the same SERE training our pilots do.”

SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, Hawai'i -- In an unprecedented move to bolster community engagement and address on-base living concerns, U.S. Army Garrison Hawai'i conducted its first-ever ""walking housing town hall"" today at Schofield Barracks. The walk, led by Garrison leadership, took a proactive route from Kawika St. through various residential lanes, concluding at Lalauiku Way.

Col. Steven McGunegle and Command Sgt. Maj. Derek Wise, command team, U.S. Army Garrison Hawai’i, spearheaded the session alongside Iris Kiplinger, project director, Island Palm Communities (IPC), and Dave Reynolds, chief of housing, Directorate of Public Works. They engaged with residents on a myriad of issues, from grass maintenance along fence lines to the upkeep of solar panels.

Residents Amy Ziem and Courtney Edens who are spouses and veterans, voiced concerns about feral animals disrupting the community and water drainage issues that have been exacerbated by improper disposal of waste and inadequate infrastructure. The forum provided a platform for open dialogue, with military families sharing insights into daily challenges, including the potential dangers posed by wildlife and the effects of wear and tear on communal spaces.

The Garrison leadership took note of the community's suggestions, such as the need for additional parking to prevent damage to grassy areas and the importance of maintaining clear and functional drainage systems. The dialogue also touched on the importance of maintaining a safe environment for the children in the area, as reports of property damage and safety hazards due to feral animals were brought to light.

The walking town hall concluded with a commitment from Garrison officials to review concerns and develop actionable plans to address the highlighted issues, signifying a collaborative step forward in enhancing the living conditions for soldiers and their families stationed in Hawai'i.

As only the first one planned, stay tuned to U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii official channels for information about future walking housing town halls. Residents can provide the Military Housing Office suggestions of communities for consideration as locations for future town halls at (808) 656-7051."

FORT MITCHELL, Ky. – Honor Guard Soldiers from the Kentucky National Guard on Nov. 4 helped honor a Medal of Honor recipient whose grave had gone unmarked and almost forgotten for 148 years.

U.S. Army Sgt. John F. Rowalt of Bellville, Ohio, served during the American Indian War before contracting smallpox and dying at the age of 28 in Cincinnati. He was buried at the nearby Highland Cemetery in Kentucky.

“It’s definitely something special for us,” said Army Sgt. Scott Zelensky, northern Kentucky area coordinator for the Honor Guard. “It’s not something we get to do every day, especially for a Medal of Honor recipient, but at the end of the day, we do the same job as normal. We provide the same honors to that veteran.”

Representing Rowalt’s family was his great-niece, Fran Dankovic of Lexington, Ohio.

“This is awesome,” she said. “I’m so grateful to everyone who helped put this together and to the ones that showed up. I was nervous yesterday thinking about it, but being here today has been great.”

During the ceremony, Capt. Mitchell Hagen with the KYNG Honor Guard presented Dankovic with a folded flag in honor of her late great-uncle.

“I’m at a loss for words,” she said after the ceremony. “This was a lot more than I expected. I’m just so honored by all this.”

Former Kentucky Air National Guardsman Rob Schultz and journalist Carl Hunner with the Richland Source led this “labor of love.”

Their research and hard work paid off, as they were able to provide a headstone for Rowalt.

According to Hunnell, Rowalt was 19 years old when he earned the Medal of Honor. As a private serving in Company L with the 8th United States Cavalry Regiment, his unit got into a fight at Lynx Creek in the Arizona Territory during the Apache Wars Oct. 14, 1869. It was during that battle that Rowalt distinguished himself, earning the Medal of Honor for “gallantry and action with Indians,” according to the citation.

Rowalt was discharged from the Army May 11, 1873, in Fort Union, New Mexico, as a sergeant. He returned to Cincinnati to live with his brother but contracted smallpox, for which there was no cure. He died and was buried at Highland Cemetery. The grave was unmarked for the past 148 years.

“It will never again be unmarked,” said Hunnell, as he spoke to those in attendance. “A hero has his recognition.”

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash.— —A movement on the horizon catches the eye of a sniper team. Through his scope, the spotter tracks the gentle movement of the grass, gauging the direction of the wind and distance to the target. His partner takes aim, gently squeezes the trigger... and bang.

For a snipers and spotters with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion, 161st Infantry Regiment, 81st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, success depends on perfect calculation in an imperfect environment. That is why they conducted an alternate position and urban stress shoot training event at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Nov. 4, 2023.

This training is all in preparation for Guard snipers to compete at the Winston P. Wilson Sniper Championship, an annual National Guard competition held at Camp Robinson in northern Arkansas.

“The preparation for this competition is pretty hard,” said U.S. Army Sgt. Remi Milslagle, a sniper team leader with HHC, 3-161 Inf. “They keep the majority of the details from all of the competitors, so you really have to work well with your teammate to prepare for whatever the competition throws at us.”

Getting to know how to best work with a teammate is essential for a sniper. Training together and participating in these competitions help build unit cohesion as well as allow the unit to know how well they can perform alongside their peers. Sniper/spotter teams must work quickly to make precise adjustments in a high-stress environment. The attention to detail before taking a shot at a target is a key factor for every move a sniper and his teammate will make.

“You’re taking out all of the factors such as wind, distance, position and so on before the first shot even goes off,” said Milslagle. “It's definitely a two-person job. If you don’t hit the target, you need your partner to spot the shot and make adjustments quick.”

In addition to showcasing a unit's excellent marksmanship skills, the competition's objective is to evaluate the performance of competing teams and how it pertains to unit training. Teams have the opportunity to network and display how well they perform when given newer and more efficient equipment.

“We just recently received the MK22 rifle which will replace the M2010 that we currently use,” explained fellow sniper Sgt. Matt Meckley. “So doing these training sessions as much as we can will help us get familiarized because these new weapons are what will be used in the competition.”

Training with better equipment allows for the snipers to do their job to the best of their ability. When units take part in training and competitions, it enables snipers to shoot at long distances, learn how to maneuver, conduct reconnaissance operations and overall prepare and train for missions.

“The competitions are a great way for us to measure our skill relative to our peers,” said Meckley. “We don't get a chance to do that with other units very often because we're such a small organization. It allows us to work as a team and to see how other teams perform as well.”

Snipers are an asset whose primary focus is to be able to shoot at long distances. It takes time and effort for a sniper unit to prepare and train. Their mission begins long before a shot is even fired.

“We conduct reconnaissance for days at a time, we hike through the woods, and we try to get vantage points to best see the battlefield before the battle even starts,” said Milslagle. “The sense of responsibility that is given to us as a small team and being able to accomplish the mission feels very rewarding.”"

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash.-- U.S. Soldiers with the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion (Linguist), 56th Theater Information Operations Group, Washington National Guard, put their language skills to the test during the annual Valor Language Games on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., Nov. 4, 2023 .

""It has been a very successful iteration of these games,"" said Maj. David Grun, operations officer for the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion. ""Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves and they feel challenged by the events.""

The Valor Language Games, named after the battalion’s call sign and motto,“Vigilance and Valor”, consists of three events, each testing intelligence soldiers on their expertise in tactical questioning, voice intercept/analysis, and briefing a senior office on the commander's priority intelligence requirements (PIR) they found during their questioning. Linguists are tested as individuals and as a team on their abilities to read, speak, and listen to the languages including Russian, Korean, Chinese, Spanish and French.

""The Valor Games are used to test the linguists' proficiency in their language and as a precursor to a much larger game, called the Polyglot games, hosted by our higher headquarters, the 300th Military Intelligence Brigade (Linguist),"" said Grun.

The first test of the games is a tactical questioning lane where linguists must question an informant to obtain potentially critical information about a scenario using their foreign language skills. The second lane is voice intercept/analysis, a computer-based challenge where competitors must use their skills as a linguist in both reading and listening in their perspective languages while gathering details of the scenario for their brief during the culminating event. During the last lane, linguist must come together as a team and compile all of their intel from their previous lanes and create a brief to present to a senior officer. They are graded on the interpretation of the information they gathered and on the presentation.

""We're just happy we can support the battalion and looking forward to doing this again next year on an annual basis,"" said Capt. Jeff Bridges, commander, Bravo Company, 341st Military Intelligence Battalion.

The Valor Games are a precursor to the Polyglot Games, an annual language game hosted by the Utah National Guard's 300th Military Intelligence Brigade (Linguist). More than 140 participants from 25 different organizations came together earlier this year for the 5th annual Polyglot Games, the 2024 games are expected to be the largest language games ever conducted.

“The Valor games tested the language proficiency of the Soldier's before being sent to the Polyglot Games,” said Grun. “We want to make sure our folks are set-up for success.”

The 341st has been successful in the past at the Polyglot Games: Staff Sergeant Sergei Corduneanu was named language professional of the year at the games in 2019. In 2020, Sgt. Robert O’Donnell took top honors, followed by Spc. Louis Delorme in 2021. Each year the 341st was also named the Best Command Language Program in the 300th.

“Time and time again our Soldiers have proven that they are professionals in their assigned languages,” said Lt. Col. Nolan Rinehart, commander of the 341st Military Intelligence Battalion. “The work we do is critical in developing intelligence products for combatant commanders when deployed and postured to help to assist civil authorities and our communities during disasters, so ensuring our linguists are at their best is one of our training priorities.”"

FORT INDIANTOWN GAP, Pa. – A routine flight on Nov. 2 was much more than that for two Pennsylvania National Guard pilots, as it encapsulated a family’s unwavering commitment to service and a shared love for aviation.

That morning, 2nd Lt. Zack Adams, a recent flight school graduate, got to fly a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter alongside his father, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Rich Adams, a veteran of Army aviation.

According to Zack, a platoon leader with Alpha Company, 2-104th General Support Aviation Battalion, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, his father was his hero growing up and he wanted to become a helicopter pilot like him.

“My father has always been a huge role model for me both in life and now inside the cockpit. It doesn’t happen very often for someone to begin their career field where one of the most senior and skilled individuals also happens to be their father,” Zack said. “I have this privilege of learning from the best.”

Upon graduating from the U.S. Army Initial Entry Rotary Wing school at Fort Novosel, Alabama, an aviator returns to their assigned unit to learn to tactically employ their aircraft on military missions. They train and grow as aviators in a process broken up into three readiness levels.

The Adams’ flew together for Zack’s first flight of his readiness level progression, with Rich as his instructor pilot.

With crisp air and fall foliage as a backdrop, their flight originated at Muir Army Heliport and took them around the Harrisburg and Fort Indiantown Gap areas.

Inside the cockpit, their interaction was professional — instructor pilot to pilot-in-training. But their connection as father and son was apparent with occasional comments like “been waiting a long time to say that” from Rich when he handed over control of the helicopter to Zack. Or “not a bad life” from Zack as they took in the moment and the views from the sky.

Rich is the command chief warrant officer for the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, a full-time standardization instructor pilot and aviation mission survivability officer. He has served on multiple combat tours over his 34-year career, including 1,500 hours of missions in an AH-64 Apache helicopter during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006, where he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. He has flown nine types of helicopters.

Even after such a long career, Rich says this experience with his son will stay with him forever.

“The opportunity to fly a military helicopter with Zack has always been in the back of my mind. However, if anyone knows how challenging the path can be, I never assumed it would happen,” Rich said. “Here we are, a few years into his service and me near the end of mine, and the culmination of planning is met with opportunity.”

Among their family and friends, there is a running joke that Zack had been conditioned from birth to want to fly. Rich acknowledges he may have planted a seed there, as many fathers who love their profession also do with their children. But the path to becoming a pilot requires years of hard work, preparation and discipline, and Zack followed the blueprint himself.

“I always get people saying I have been brainwashed since birth with all the helicopter toys, being taken to airshows and listening to all the stories from my father,” Zack said. “Although those things certainly contributed to my desire to fly, I find that for myself, what made me want to start this career is wanting to experience the joy of flying while supporting my desire to serve our great nation.”

Many may expect Zack to emulate his father’s experience and skills. Zack holds himself to high standards, but for now, he is soaking everything in, taking advantage of the lessons he can learn from his father and making his own path.

“The biggest piece of advice I can give anyone is to make their career their own journey. If there is someone that you emulate and aspire to become just like, know that your paths will never be exactly the same,“ he said. “Find a path that best suits you and strive to get to where you want to be and never give up on that.“

DJIBOUTI CITY, Djibouti -- Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) engineers and civil affairs service members delivered refurbished desks and chairs to schools throughout Djibouti as part of their Desk Rejuvenation Project (DRP).

The DRP is a small, yet self-sustaining mission that’s been carried out by the civil affairs and engineering battalions of CJTF-HOA during the past year. The project focuses on creating a comfortable learning experience for students across Djibouti.

U.S. Army SFC Josh Barnett, 294th Engineer Support Company (ESC) member, was the project lead for the ESC’s portion of the desk program. Barnett led ESC service members on rebuilding broken chairs and refurbishing and sanding desk pieces to help make the desks they gather look good as new.

“It’s easy, it doesn't cost too much and it really helps the city out,” said Barnett. “The kids love the work we do and so do the teachers”.

The 294th ESC and former Alpha Company Civil Affairs Battalion refurbished and delivered approximately 400 desks to four schools across the country.

Earlier this month, they passed their mission and the DRP to the 1782nd ESC, who began making desk deliveries to both the Hali English Institute and the Annex 3 School. Their most recent delivery took place in October during which they delivered 15 refurbished desks for children at the Annex 3 School in the Balbala district of Djibouti City.

“We’ve delivered a lot of desks already,” said Barnett. “At Annex 3, we were even able to help build new swings for their playground to really help these kids have a more enjoyable learning environment. The headmasters’ are always super thankful when we come by, which makes it all the more worthwhile.”

Kamil Mohumed, Hali English Language Center CEO and Headmaster, shared this sentiment. Kamil works with Civil Affairs as a translator and hosts English Discussion groups for all ages out of his school. He’s been outspoken within the Djibouti community about the positive work that comes from the presence of U.S. military personnel in the country.

“I started my center off very small and provided some of my own chairs and desks for the students,” said Kamil. “ Now, thanks to Civil Affairs, I’m able to see my school grow. The work they do is really good for my community.”

U.S. Army Civil Affairs personnel work as the primary liaison between the Army and non-U.S. populations. In Djibouti, the Civil Affairs East Africa Team spends their weeks planning and organizing ways to engage and coordinate cross-national events and cultural exchanges between CJTF-HOA’s partners and the Djiboutian community.

U.S. Army Sgt. Allan Jefferies, CJTF-HOA Civil Affairs East Africa Team member, explained that while dropping off new desks might seem like a small win, these projects have helped improve conditions at local schools considerably and helped foster a bond between U.S. personnel and the local community.

“When we see there’s a need at these schools, it’s always great to be able to help fill that need,” said Jefferies. “As civil affairs personnel we try to really get involved in these communities and especially try to do things for the youth since they are the future.”

When their deployment is up, the 1782nd ESC and the current Civil Affairs East Africa Team will be replaced by new companies and personnel just as they replaced the 294th ESC and previous Civil Affairs team. However, just as each new team has made their own mark on Camp Lemonnier and the region, the DRP will remain an enduring legacy of Camp Lemonnier’s ongoing humanitarian efforts in the Horn of Africa.

The 2023 West Africa Logistics Conference, co-hosted by the Chief of Defense of the Armed Forces of Côte d’Ivoire and United States Africa Command, convened in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, Sept. 19-20, to address West African security challenges through logistics cooperation.

Rear Admiral George Bresnihan, Director of Logistics at U.S. Africa Command, welcomed logistics leaders representing 12 African nations, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union.

“We’re here to share our collective insights and discuss challenges and potential solutions to the herculean task of sustaining and maintaining a military through peacetime and crisis,” said Bresnihan. “I’m very excited to hear from our African partners and learn how we can strengthen our partnerships through logistics.”

The specter of terrorism, transnational crime, humanitarian crises and the effects of climate change were at the forefront of vigorous discussions on regional security challenges.

U.S. Ambassador to Côte d’Ivoire Jessica Davis Ba, speaking in the country’s official language of French, stressed, “It is through our shared experiences that we can emphasize the importance of continued dialogue, cooperation and mutual understanding as we move forward in our joint efforts to maintain the security and stability of our countries and our world.”

The Ambassador identified military logistics as a pillar of strategic power and reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to our African partners in their pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity. She also highlighted the United States’ 10-year partnership plan aimed at addressing the root causes of violent extremism.

The initiative, she stated, “emphasizes the importance of a proactive approach in building trust between communities and security forces. It is essential, more than ever, to improve interoperability and coordination [in order to] to strengthen our armed forces and work together to address the myriad security challenges we face.”

In the keynote speech, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for African Affairs Ms. Chidi Blyden echoed the Ambassador. “In Africa, synchronized operations, coordination and interoperability are key to readiness when addressing a multitude of threats in the region such as humanitarian and climate disasters, threats from violent extremist organizations and even cyber criminality.”

Blyden further highlighted that Department of Defense events like the West Africa Logistics Conference, annual exercises, noncommissioned officer training and rotational engagements with state partnership programs advance military strategic logistics in Africa.

Dr. Joel Amegboh, from the African Center for Security Studies, provided a regional overview and scene-setter outlining emerging threats confronting West African militaries. Attendees critically analyzed real-time threats of violent extremist organizations engaging in terrorist activity, drug trafficking, organized crime and poor governance in the region within the frame of three reoccurring themes: interoperability and equipment compatibility; logistics strategy, support concept development, and doctrine; and resourcing readiness.

Interoperability and Equipment Compatibility

Conference participants viewed interoperability between regional forces as a critical component to countering emerging threats. In the current operating environment, equipment, parts, supplies and diversity of language pose challenges to logistics support among militaries in the region. Partners shared real examples of how those challenges presented obstacles to interoperability and collaboratively agreed that joint exercises were an effective way to verify and validate capabilities and gaps.

Examples shared brought to light how varying equipment from international donors arriving with inadequate levels of resupply and repair parts can greatly affect interoperability. Additionally, the variety of official languages spoken in the region invariably poses challenges to information sharing and communicating in the battle-space. Attendees agreed that a common operating language and compatible equipment have the potential to significantly enhance interoperability and shared logistics practices in the region.

Logistics Strategy, Support Concept Development, and Doctrine

Multinational operations demand ready forces from contributing nations. Participants agreed that readiness is a national priority within their respective countries, but preparedness for peacekeeping operations can sometimes be misaligned with the readiness demands of counter-terrorism or disaster response efforts. This perceived gap drove discussions on the need to harmonize efforts starting with aligned doctrines, strategies and concepts of support.

Partners acknowledged the benefits of U.S. support, highlighting logistics institutional capacity building, lauded national and regional centers of excellence, and encouraged potential for increased instruction on logistics concept development at professional military education establishments across the region.

Resourcing Readiness

West African partners described the need for a culture of accountability in defense procurement and in a limited resource environment, sharing mechanisms, mutual logistics agreements and common-sense resource strategies as critical to sustaining operational readiness. At the core of addressing readiness, is the needed investment in human capital recruitment and retention. Members also discussed the efficacy of local manufacturers as organic sources of supply, acknowledging that the reliance on donor equipment implies a lack of absorptive capacity to sustain a variety of donor equipment using local sources. Dependence on donors also requires supplying more than just major end items, but the spare parts to sustain them. This problem set intersects with barriers to interoperability.

For example, partners outlined how although U.S. security cooperation programs are affordable options to defense equipment and a force enabler, there is a need for faster delivery of equipment and parts. More efficient access to partner or regional markets by U.S. industries is vital to resourcing and readiness.

The reality of donor nation processes and slow delivery windows generated ideas among participants centered on regional training support centers and repair depot concepts that enable forces to conduct counter-terrorism training while sustaining forces and equipment employed in multinational operations. There was interest among African partners in utilizing a logistics hub for crisis response in the Gulf of Guinea.

There was also a consensus that in crisis response, forces need to be prepared to collaborate with commercial and non-governmental organizations and integrate quickly with other teams on the ground. The expectation of militaries to be highly organized, responsive and easily mobilized in the event of natural and man-made disasters requires forces to be prepared as first responders.

At the beginning of the conference, the Director of Cabinet for the Ministry of Defense of Côte d’Ivoire, Mr. Jean Paul Malan, enthusiastically shared his hopes that from the West Africa Logistics Conference would emerge “viable logistical solutions that effectively contribute to meeting the challenge of peace and security in our sub-region.” By the conclusion of the conference, participants achieved a shared understanding of regional military logistics challenges, best practices and opportunities for increased collaboration.

To continue momentum, Bresnihan stated, “During this event, we heard insights from our African partners and gained a greater understanding of methods to strengthen regional collaboration. In the upcoming months, we look forward to continuing to fortify logistics efforts in the region.”"

CASERMA DEL DIN, VICENZA, Italy — Class of 2024 Cadets from U.S. Military Academy West Point’s Civil Engineer Capstone Design Program are designing a canopy structure to cover the west-side basketball court for the U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) on Caserma Del Din, Vicenza, Italy during their stay on October 23 to 25, 2023.

The Capstone Design program requires students to navigate a complex engineering problem, work collaboratively in teams, and persistently tackle the challenge over the course of an academic year.

“For their senior year, instead of having a typical taught class, one of their classes is a capstone project. For the entire year, they are working in teams of 3 to 6 on some project, typical for a client, with the idea that they are working on something that doesn't have a solution already,” says Capt. Robert Hume, a civil engineering instructor from U.S. Military Academy West Point. “This trip is a small part of that year-long project. We figured it would be helpful to meet the clients we are working for, see the site, and see if we can get a feel for the region as well.”

The Deputy Chief of Staff, Engineer (DCSENG) of SETAF-AF has been mentoring and providing open-ended engineering design projects to the program for four consecutive years, guiding students in meaningful engineering design projects that align with their academic commitments.

This year, the Cadet team must provide a structural analysis and design for a canopy structure that fully covers the three basketball courts while minimizing interior columns.

If constructed, this canopy promises to open up exciting possibilities for the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) department, allowing them to expand the fitness area to include an outdoor workout space, mirroring the offerings at Caserma Ederle.

“The strongest benefit is the partnership opportunity, both for West Point, the department of civil mechanical engineering, and for SETAF-AF,” said Capt. Matthew Glavin, a civil engineering instructor from U.S. Military Academy West Point. “We both benefit by providing the Cadets a world class opportunity to put their engineering education into practice to solve a real world problem.”

Student teams undergo an iterative design process: defining the problem and its requirements, analyzing alternatives within the constraints of applicable codes and standards, and ultimately selecting the most viable solution that culminates into the presentation of written deliverables and presentations to a faculty advisor team, external customers, and stakeholders.

SETAF-AF's continued involvement in West Point's Capstone Design Program exemplifies its dedication to fostering engineering talent, preparing Cadets to confront real-world engineering challenges, and ensuring they are equipped to contribute to innovative solutions in the future, reflecting SETAF-AF's commitment to building the engineers of tomorrow.

SAGAMIHARA FAMILY HOUSING AREA, Japan – About 150 American and Japanese children participated in a football and cheerleading clinic here Friday to enhance their cultural understanding.

The clinic marked the first event jointly hosted by U.S. Army Garrison Japan and Zama Junior Chamber International.

To kick off the event, Jenifer L. Peterson, deputy commander of USAG Japan, thanked everyone for joining or volunteering for the free clinic, which also had professional football players from Ebina Minerva run drills for the children.

“I am happy to see so many participants from the local community in Zama City,” she said. “We hope that we will deepen our friendship even further with our local community through this sports exchange.”

Hayato Inoue, president of Zama JCI, said he appreciated the garrison for helping hold the event at the sports field next to Arnn Elementary School.

“We’d like to provide such opportunities for children in the U.S. and Japan to interact [with] each other and be exposed to different cultures and languages, and give them a global perspective,” he said. “That’s why we organized this event.”

Children from first through sixth grades at Arnn Elementary and local Japanese schools were invited to attend the event.

Participants were split into several teams to run various drills, such as passing and catching a football and running a 40-yard dash, while another group of children practiced cheers on the other side of the field.

Hidekazu Kanmuri brought his daughter and son to conduct the football drills taught by the pro football players as well as Morale, Welfare and Recreation staff members.

He said his children learned of the event after a flyer was distributed at their school, adding that his daughter really wanted to come since she has a strong interest in American culture.

“I want my children to have an international experience,” Kanmuri said. “And since it is nearby, I used this opportunity for my children to experience this bilateral event.”

Brynn Riley, spouse of a 1st Corps (Forward) Soldier, had two of her sons do the football drills while her daughter performed cheers that were later demonstrated to the crowd to conclude the event.

“I feel like we kind of live in a bubble here,” she said, “so when we do these bilateral things it’s nice for [our children] to get to meet Japanese kids.”

Riley said her family will often attend open-post events to provide her children the chance to broaden their understanding of Japanese culture.

Despite the language barrier, Riley said her children will even befriend random Japanese children also at these events and introduce them to her.

“They always come back and say, ‘This is my friend,’ and I ask, ‘What’s their name?’ and they say, ‘I don’t know, but they’re my friend,’” she said, laughing. “It’s good for them to see that kids are kids regardless of where we are.”

SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, Hawai'i -- In an intimate and heartwarming performance, acclaimed singer-songwriter Brian McKnight took the stage at U.S. Army Garrison Hawai’i, delivering a musical experience that echoed the sentiment of appreciation and deep respect for service members and their families. The free concert, held on November 3 at 7 p.m., was not just a showcase of McKnight's hits but also a poignant tribute to those who sacrifice daily for the nation's safety.

With a setlist filled with soulful ballads, McKnight reflected on the inspiration behind his songs. The artist, known for hits like ""One Last Cry"" and ""Back at One,"" shared that his songwriting journey began in his teenage years, crafting stories from the experiences of others rather than his own. It wasn't until later in life, McKnight admitted, that he truly understood the emotions behind his lyrics – a revelation brought forth by the love he shares with his wife, Leilani.

In an exclusive interview before the event, McKnight expressed his admiration for military personnel. ""The sacrifice that it takes to say... That I'm going to go out here and protect the freedoms and liberties of people that I do not know, but are my countrymen, is something truly commendable,"" McKnight stated. He sees his performances for the troops as a way to ease their burdens, even if momentarily, acknowledging the comfort and security his family enjoys because of their vigilance.

McKnight's engagement with the soldiers and their narratives revealed a deep connection, one that has visibly influenced his music and perspective. Recounting his visit to Ramstein in Germany, the gravity of service members' experiences became even more tangible. ""Seeing those young guys... who were on their way, it was an ah-ha moment,"" McKnight recalled, expressing how these interactions amplify his respect and appreciation daily.

In his closing act, McKnight dedicated his song ""Red, White, and Blue"" – an emotional ballad inspired by the profound conversations between soldiers and their families. The song, which features collaborations with Rascal Flatts, resonates with the collective spirit of the American family, particularly those separated by duty.

As the night drew to a close, the community of service members and their loved ones gathered together in the Tropics Recreation Center's candlelight setting, unified by McKnight's melodies. His voice, a beacon of gratitude, elevated the spirit of patriotism, and reminded everyone present of the unyielding connection they share as Americans – a connection that music, in its universal language, so beautifully articulates.

McKnight's dedication to the troops extends beyond his music; it's an embodiment of his respect for the men and women who uphold America's values. As the echoes of ""Red, White, and Blue"" lingered in the air, it was clear that Brian McKnight's performance was more than entertainment – it was a heartfelt salute to those who serve."

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Nine Army National Guard Soldiers from across New York State spent more than 48 hours in competition to become the “Best Warrior” of the Syracuse-based 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.

Spc. Peter Fillion, 23, of Rochester and Sgt. 1st Class Travis Wood, 32, of Basom were named the brigade’s best warriors in the Soldier and Noncommissioned Officer categories.

Fillion and Wood, both infantrymen, are assigned to Charlie Troop of the brigade’s 2nd Squadron, 101st Cavalry Regiment. They will compete in the New York Army National Guard Best Warrior Competition in spring 2024, with hopes of extending a five-year streak of 27th IBCT Soldiers placing first and representing New York in the Army National Guard’s northeast regional and national competitions.

“The best warrior competition tests a Soldier’s mind, body, and spirit,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Kevin Roeser, senior enlisted leader of the 27th IBCT.

Over two and a half days from Nov. 3 through 5, Soldiers were tested in six events:

- Formal interview board in dress uniform

- 12-mile ruck march carrying a 35-pound pack

- Three-gun shoot, combining rifle, pistol, and shotgun qualification with 10 burpees, a high crawl, and 25 air squats

- Warrior tasks and battle drills

- Land navigation

- Army Combat Fitness Test

Soldiers also had to submit a paper on their Army experience, with junior enlisted competitors focusing on how to improve peer relationships and best prepare for military schools, and NCOs focusing on how to improve leadership, operations, and management.

During the warrior tasks and battle drills, Soldiers were challenged to bound with a buddy while under fire – taking cover behind barriers, crawling under obstacles, and firing back at an enemy. Once they cleared the challenge, they had to immediately provide care to a simulated wounded Soldier under stressful conditions.

“Adding a lot of pressure like screaming, battle sounds, and even putting pressure like hinting at the time – that can allow them to perform under pressure in real scenarios,” said Staff Sgt. Danielle Dillard, a combat medic evaluating Soldiers on their medical skills.

“You have all these factors to increase the heart rate, increase the blood pressure, make them sweat, and get nervous. Their hands are shaking, and that’s what we want. We want them to be under that pressure so that they can train and perform,” she said.

Competitors were chosen as the best-of-the-best from thousands of 27th IBCT Soldiers across the state, after completing competitions at their home units. Fillion and Wood spent extra time preparing for the challenges at the brigade-level.

“It’s a lot of studying, maintaining physical performance, and your sponsor preparing you to go out there and succeed,” said Wood.

Fillion works part-time as an architect for Kideney Architects, while pursuing his graduate degree in architecture from the State University of New York at Buffalo. Wood is an area manager for Amazon.

Whether operating weapons, enduring the ruck march, or presenting knowledge in a professional manner during the formal appearance board, both say the skills and traits they used in competition translate to their civilian careers.

“A lot of my job is attention to detail. Reminding myself, you need to think about the little, tiny things. They all affect something later down the line,” said Fillion. “And just [having] a never-quit attitude.”

Fillion has served in the New York National Guard for more than two and a half years. Wood has served for 14 years, and returned this summer from a deployment to Germany, where he helped train members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Runners up in the competition were Spc. Damien Pagano, an infantryman from Buffalo, assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment, and Sgt. Nicholas Dorrman, a military intelligence systems maintainer and integrator from Saranac, assigned to Delta Company, 152nd Brigade Engineer Battalion.

Competitors in this year’s competition also included:

- Spc. Andrew Buck, an unmanned aircraft systems operator from Victor, assigned to Delta Company, 152nd Brigade Engineer Battalion

- Staff Sgt. Kurtis Schneider, a wheeled vehicle mechanic from Mechanicville, assigned to Golf Company, 427th Brigade Support Battalion

- Spc. Bradley Brundige, a wheeled vehicle mechanic from Baldwinsville, assigned to Bravo Company, 427th Brigade Support Battalion

- Sgt. Nedp Edouard, a cannon crewmember from New York, assigned to Alpha Battery, 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery Regiment

- Pvt. Keara Conn, a fire control specialist from Patterson, assigned to Charlie Battery, 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery Regiment"

BELEM, BRAZIL – Four New York Army National Guard combat medics assigned to the 466th Medical Company, Area Support (MCAS), completed a Brazilian jungle familiarization and academics course with U.S. Army South, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), 7th Special Forces Group and 1st Security Forces Assistance Brigade Soldiers Nov. 1-4.

The medics are among 18 medical personnel and their Brazilian partners providing medical care to service members in Belem, Macapa and Oiapoque during the Southern Vanguard training exercise Nov. 6-16.

New York Army National Guard Maj. Shelly Respecki, the commander of the 466 MCAS, believes the opportunity to learn about the jungle from the Brazilian Army is an invaluable experience.

“The course allows our Soldiers to understand what threats and risks are involved with training in the jungle,” said Respecki. “We’ll be better able to treat the participants knowing what they’re going through and how to survive in the jungle.”

Participants in the jungle course learned about fruits and vegetables in the jungle, hunting and survival techniques, day and night land navigation, and conducting jungle movements and recovery.

Sgt. Gina Alexandro enjoyed the experience.

“I’m excited to not only function as a medic but actually be incorporated in the training with them,” said Alexandro. “I’ve been able to practice on my machete, build my own jungle hooch, and eat exotic fruits.”

Sgt. Brion Pasquale, a combat medic and civilian emergency medical technician, returned for his second visit to Brazil after attending Operation Parana III in the southern region of Brazil.

“I really love coming back to Brazil,“ he said. “It was such a great experience the first time, but to get this type of training in the Amazon is special.”

The 466 MCAS had medical field tents in various locations where service members could be treated for heat-related illnesses, environmental threats, emergency trauma and any other potential illnesses or diseases.

“We have a strong team here on the ground with lots of experience,” said Respecki. “The Brazilian medical team here have been open and receptive, and it’s been great working together.”

The New York National Guard and Brazil have been partners under the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program since 2018.

The 30-year-old SPP program now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe.

RICHMOND, Va. – The Virginia National Guard’s 34th Civil Support Team was evaluated by U.S. Army North as trained and mission capable Oct. 17 and 19.

The 34th CST supports civil authorities in a domestic chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive incident.

During the training proficiency evaluation, usually conducted about every 18 months, the CST was evaluated during two full-scale training exercises, responding to scenarios involving a mock chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive threat.

One of the exercises was conducted at the Petersburg National Battlefield’s Five Forks Unit visitor center, and the other at the Dinwiddie Airport. During the exercises, the CST conducted reconnaissance and sample-collection missions, analyzing substances to determine the severity of the hazard and appropriate next steps, all under the scrutiny of ARNORTH evaluators.

“We are very proud of the men and women of the 34th CST,” said Brig. Gen. Todd Hubbard, VNG director of the joint staff. “Their performance during this TPE reflects their ability to perform a very complex, technical mission with a high level of proficiency. The team demonstrated an ability to deploy at short notice in support of local, state or federal requirements within the commonwealth or anywhere in the nation.”

Lt. Col. Thomas D. Mecadon, commander of the 34th CST, said the unit trained for several months to prepare for the evaluation.

“I could not be prouder of them,” said Mecadon. “The truth is that based on our rigorous training schedule over the past six months and the dedication of the team to training, the TPE just felt like another day of training.”

Their ARNORTH-certified success was even more impressive given the relative lack of experience by many of the CST’s members.

“Over the past year, the team has gone through an immense amount of changeover, approximately 50%,” said Mecadon. “The amount of work, time and preparation they all dedicated to developing as a team is not measurable. It is a testament to their dedication to our mission.”

Mecadon singled out Virginia Air National Guard Capt. Samantha Vittorioso, the CST’s science officer, for developing realistic scenarios to prepare the team.

“The scenarios and agents may have been different and unknown, but nothing presented was new,” he said. “The team approached the evaluation days with flexibility and the knowledge required to overcome the challenges.”

Each team member completes 500 to 900 hours of specialized training during their first year of assignment and continues advanced training throughout their tenure with multiple agencies, including the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, the National Fire Academy, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency.

The team’s primary response area includes a 300-mile radius from Fort Barfoot south to South Carolina and north to Pennsylvania. They maintain personnel on standby at all times and can deploy an advance team within 90 minutes and the main body within three hours.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - The Tennessee National Guard celebrated the life and legacy of former President James K. Polk in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tennessee State Capitol Nov. 2 in honor of Polk’s 228th birthday.

Each year, a representative of the current president is responsible for placing a wreath on the tomb of past presidents to honor them and their service on their birthday. Col. John Kinton, commander of Jackson’s 194th Engineer Brigade, represented President Joe Biden at the ceremony.

“It was a privilege and honor to represent the president today,” said Kinton. “As a Tennessean, I’m flattered to be able to commemorate President Polk for all he has done for our state and country.”

During the ceremony, Kinton and Jaryn Abdallah, the education and outreach coordinator for the President James K. Polk Home and Museum, laid a wreath on Polk’s tomb. Kinton spoke about Polk’s legacy and contribution to the state and nation.

“Polk devoted his life to making Tennessee and the country a better place,” said Kinton. “As president, Polk directed the country’s efforts in the Mexican-American War and shaped the nation into what it is today. There are many parallels with what he endured during his time as president and what we are going through in modern times. We can learn much by studying his life and presidency.”

Also participating in the ceremony was Col. Mark Phillips, the Tennessee National Guard’s state chaplain, who gave the invocation; Sgt. 1st Class James Tate with the 129th Army Band, who played Taps following the wreath laying, and Soldiers from the Tennessee National Guard’s Joint Forces Headquarters, who served as honor guards.

Polk was the 11th president of the United States from 1845 to 1849. He also served in the Tennessee Legislature, as governor of the state and as a member of Congress. He was a captain in the Tennessee Militia and a colonel on Tennessee Gov. William Carroll’s staff.

WASHINGTON — The Army wants to add 800 new students over the next two months to its Army Recruiting and Retention College at Fort Knox, Kentucky, a service leader said today.

In addition, Soldiers who volunteer to serve as recruiters will receive incentives, and the Army pledges to care for those troops and their families, said Lt. Gen. Doug Stitt, deputy chief of staff for personnel.

The bonuses include immediate promotion to staff sergeant upon reporting to their first recruiting assignment and graduates of the school who enroll in the Army Recruiter Course by February 2024 will receive a one-time lump sum of $5,000. The promotions to staff sergeant will be conditional, and Soldiers will still need to meet professional military education requirements.

Staff sergeants who volunteer will be eligible for promotion to sergeant first class if they field 24 signed enlistment contracts and all 24 recruits attend Basic Combat Training over a maximum 12-month period. Current recruiters who extend their three-year assignment will be awarded $1,500 per month for up to 12 months.

The service will also consider reassigning Soldiers slated to attend the Army’s Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina to the Recruiting and Retention College.

Sgt. Maj. Christopher Stevens, senior enlisted advisor for Army Personnel, G-1, said that the selections will not impede the service’s abilities to train new recruits.

Stitt said that last week the service identified a drop in the number of students scheduled to attend the college on Monday, as the service looks to bolster its recruiter corps of more than 10,000 Soldiers.

“The losses exceeded the gains and in order to maintain that momentum that we were seeing within the recruiting force, we [started] to set the conditions for transformation,” Stitt said while speaking to reporters Wednesday. “We made the decision this week to bump up the numbers [of recruiting college students].”

Over the past two weeks, the Army screened and selected Soldiers throughout the force to report to the college by Monday.

Staff Sgt. Dustin Biven, assigned as a non-commissioned officer-in charge of multimedia production at the Defense Media Activity, Fort Meade, Maryland said he received his notification to report to Fort Knox on Friday. Biven’s wife recently gave birth to a baby boy, and he was scheduled to complete his paternity leave. The father of four also had mission commitments and a full-time college schedule that could be compromised by the new assignment.

Biven said that reassigned Soldiers have been asked to shift their life and careers in a short window of time.

“I am very fortunate to have the support system and a wife who could care for our children,” said Biven, 30. “But there are some single Soldiers out there and some single mothers out there — people who probably are not medically fit or are able to go because of pre-existing conditions or surgeries — that are being tapped with this [assignment] and they are frightened.”

Stitt expressed regret for the late notice and said the service will contact the selected Soldiers and work with their unique circumstances.

“I’d like to open up and first of all apologize to the Soldiers and the families that received this last-minute notification,” Stitt said. “That mistake is mine.”

He said the service is working on multiple avenues to minimize the impact to Soldiers and families.

“It’s not lost on me, particularly at this point in time, the impact this last-minute notification and now being on the cusp of the holidays has on our Soldiers and our great NCOs as they navigate a process to support the recruiting enterprise,” Stitt added.

When questioned whether the service will open selection to candidates who do not meet requirements, such as fitness and physical training scores and body fat requirements, Stitt reiterated that standards will be met.

He said that the branch will prioritize identifying the candidates that meet the qualifications to attend the college. Soldiers must be in the grade of E-5 to E-7 and have a minimum four years in service to qualify.

“This is not about a number,” he added. “This is about identifying the right Soldiers to go in there and support this effort.”

“Our standard for suitability screening has not changed,” Stevens said. “We're talking about positions of trust.”

Army human resources will work with the Soldiers’ chain of command and career counselors on a case-by-case basis to assure that recruiter candidates have a smooth transition, Stitt said.

“We will communicate with the family and the chain of command and work this by the individual, to ensure if that Soldier has a life situation, family situation or professional situation,” Stitt said. “We’re going to talk to that Soldier, to that family, to work through this to ensure that we have the right NCOs at the right time to perform this vital mission in service of our recruiting enterprise.”

To build recruiting momentum, Stitt said Army leaders are working closely with U.S. Army Recruiting Command to outline required knowledge, skills and behaviors for the Army’s new military occupational specialty, 42T talent acquisition specialists.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth announced on Oct. 3, 2023, the Army will transform its recruiting force from temporary positions to permanent military occupational specialties for both Soldiers and warrant officers. A pilot program will soon be in development.

For now, the Army hopes to attract enough volunteers to recruit the next generation of Soldiers and asked commanders and leaders throughout the force to encourage Soldiers to volunteer to become recruiters.

“We are communicating through the chain-of-command,” Stitt said. “Talk to your Soldiers. If they are ready to volunteer, here are the incentives. And if you've been identified for reassignment and have some family, personal, professional concerns, let's sit down and let's talk about it.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Native Americans have a long and proud history of military service in every major American conflict for over 200 years. According to a Department of Veterans Affairs report, Native Americans have served at higher rates than any other ethnic group in the post-9/11 period.

One such person building upon this legacy is Army Sgt. 1st Class Vincent Orosco, a senior human resource sergeant with the 40th Infantry Division.

“I am Chiricahua-Apache and Pascua-Yaqui,” said Orosco. “My birth name is Storm. My daughters are Beautiful Storm and Graceful Storm.”

Though his birth name is steeped in Native traditions, he goes by Vincent Orosco, taking on his father’s name. Orosco’s mother instilled in him a deep respect for his Native heritage.

In Indigenous communities, women spearhead the families. Native American matrilineal societies trace descent through the mother’s line. Women hold significant roles in decision-making and leadership.

“My mom initially motivated me to know my roots and where I come from,” he said.

At a young age, his mother guided Orosco to culturally significant events like ceremonies, pow-wows, and watching his sisters dance in the community. He quickly learned that in the Native community, a person is defined by their actions.

“My uncle had just joined the Guard a couple of years earlier, so I talked to the recruiter, and that changed the course of my life,” Orosco recalled.

Throughout his 20-year military career, Orosco has led the way for Native Americans. One of these contributions is teaching others how to be a leader.

“What makes [us] successful is what makes us tick,” he said. “... When it comes to my ancestry, I seek to understand it better, to know what’s in my bloodline, and to understand where other people are coming from. That makes me a better leader.”

In 2010, Air Force Maj. Gen. Mary J. Kight, then adjutant general of California, nominated Orosco for the Society of American Indian Government Employees award, which honors Native American service members and veterans in government service. To earn the award, individuals must make substantial contributions to the government and the Native identity while demonstrating exceptional dedication and performance in their roles. He won.

For some Native Americans, their connection to their heritage is deeply personal. For others, it is a matter of family history or cultural identity, but what unites them is a profound sense of pride and strength as they serve their country with commitment and loyalty.

“For the young kids reading this, you are not by yourself,” he said. ”There are others paving the way for you. You can go anywhere in the world as long as you open your mind to the impossible.”

JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, Va. – Almost 150 people from all service components, including National Guard leaders from all 50 states and four territories, gathered in Patton Hall to witness a defining moment in National Guard history: the unveiling of the positional flag for the senior enlisted advisor to the chief, National Guard Bureau.

Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, the National Guard’s top officer, noted the significance of the day, emphasizing the ever-evolving nature and significance of the Guard.

“Tonight, we honor a new chapter in the National Guard Bureau’s history,” said Hokanson. “This role joins two enlisted forces with two unique cultures — the Army and the Air Force — united by their duties and identity as Guardsmen. The SEA’s colors and insignia make it clear: Today’s National Guard is a valued and valuable force —on the world’s stage, in the homeland we defend, and at the highest levels of military leadership.”

With a history dating back to 1636, the National Guard boasts centuries of tradition and tenacity. However, this marks the first time a senior enlisted advisor to the National Guard chief has been recognized with positional colors. The introduction of the colors symbolizes an acknowledgment of a storied past and the forward momentum of the enlisted force.

Tony L. Whitehead currently serves as the SEA to the CNGB and is the sixth Guardsman to hold this position.

He’s the first to bear the unique Air Force rank of SEA — equivalent to the Guard’s parent service senior enlisted leaders, the sergeant major of the Army and chief master sergeant of the Air Force — and the position now has the unique associated colors. At the pinnacle of enlisted leadership, Whitehead steers the enlisted force and voices their interests.

Whitehead, a Jacksonville, Florida, native, began his Air Force career in December 1982 and transitioned to the Air National Guard in 1994. He served in a range of roles in Air Force security specialist and security forces career fields. With retirement on the horizon, he envisions the new colors as a beacon, signaling to National Guard Soldiers and Airmen that all achievements are within reach.

“After over four decades in this uniform, there are goals you set, and then there are transcendent moments that defy description,” Whitehead said. “Being here, recognized in this new capacity, is not by chance. It’s the fruit of guidance from pioneering leaders and mentors. I see this as a turning point to uplift our enlisted ranks, solidifying the National Guard’s stature for future generations.”

The National Guard, comprising roughly 430,000 Soldiers and Airmen, makes up about 20 percent of the Department of Defense’s Joint Force. Today, some 20,000 Guard members are on overseas assignments, underscoring the National Guard’s pivotal roles in homeland defense and the National Defense Strategy.

“What does the future hold for the senior enlisted advisor role?” Whitehead said, adding that he believes the new colors are an acknowledgment of unwavering dedication and a nod to the foundation they’ve laid.

“In the National Guard, when we join hands with our allies, it’s less about showcasing our prowess and more about underscoring the respect and dedication intrinsic to our role,” he said.

In recent years, Whitehead has traveled globally, forging connections with military leaders, Soldiers and Airmen. His core principles — educate, empower, execute — will define his legacy.

Whitehead’s philosophy centers on the idea that every service member has the potential to drive change and exhibit leadership qualities. He believes continuous learning and growth are critical to build an educated and effective military force. He encourages service members to empower those around them, enabling them to showcase their talents and skills and execute missions with their knowledge and expertise.

“The positional colors echo the spirit of the entire National Guard, not merely the enlisted,” he said. “These colors resonate strength, power, humility and service that embodies us in the National Guard. Our mantra remains, Always Ready. Always There.”

THE ARMY UNIVERSITY, FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. - The Army University’s Command and General Staff College inducted two new military members to the International Hall of Fame; Commodore Errington R. Shurland, Chief of Staff, Barbados Defence Force and General Javier Iturriaga Del Campo, Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, Oct. 31, 2023, at the Lewis and Clark building on Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

Since its establishment in 1973, the CGSC IHOF has inducted nearly 300 military officers representing 80 nations.

Nominees are selected based on their distinguished service that has helped them achieve the highest level of leadership within their respective militaries.

“The inductions of Commodore Shurland and Gen. Inturriaga’s today represents the fulfillment of the potential that resides in each student in the military education institution as a direct return on the investment made jointly by our respective militaries and the professional military education of our officers,” Lt. Gen. Milford H. Beagle, Jr., commandant, CGSC said. “Today we celebrate alliance capability and credibility and commitment. Something as necessary as now, as any other time in our history.”

Shurland, a graduate of the Class of 2002 and classmate of Beagle’s, is the first inductee from the nation of Barbados.

He has served since 1984 with his career culminating in his appointment to Chief of Staff to the Barbados Defense Force in September 2021, the first naval officer to serve in this position.

Throughout his career, Shurland has represented Barbados at every level of military service and his leadership is and will remain important as the U.S. and Barbados relationship moves forward, Beagle explained.

Shurland joked that while most claim CGSC is the best year of a young officer’s life, his time can’t be labeled as such wholeheartedly due to a missed first wedding anniversary, tragic events of 9/11, and a historic ice storm.

He continued that the lessons learned while at CGSC 21 years ago have made lasting impressions personally and professionally.

“It was impactful and a significant professional development program that I’ve ever undertaken on my military career,” Shurland said.

He mentioned lifelong lessons in diplomacy and experience in joint, interagency collaboration.

The two lessons he’s taken with him for the entirety of his career include not to seek perfection, and dispute remediation and diplomacy.

“Perfect is the enemy of good enough, is a phrase he [then Commandant Gen. James Sitright] used during an introductory speech to us back in 2002,” Shurland said. “That phrase provided me and I’m sure some of my classmates with some critical guidance.”

Shurland explained seeking perfection often ties up progress to completing tasks.

The second lesson was the impact of the events of 9/11 on the class which included 91 international students representing more than 70 students.

“The current deputy was responsible for managing that situation. He did so with a calm reassurance,” Shurland explained of how the tragic events were explained during the 2002 CGSC. “He managed to resolve concerns and disagreement and conflict in a very constructive way. He encouraged ‘creative tension’ and for a difference of opinions to be share.”

The creation of a space to share conflicting ideas and opinions in a professional, constructive environment was recognized by the international student population who would later address the leadership’s actions in a letter of reflection and condemnation of the actions against the U.S.

Beginning his military career four years before Shurland, Inturriaga’s would take him to positions at every level of the Chilean Army to include his current as Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army.

In 2017, he gained notoriety as he commanded military forces during a national state of emergency during devasting wildfires of Santa Auga.

Since returning to Fort Leavenworth after 18 years, Inturriaga has also reflected on his time at CGSC and its impact on his career.

“My time as an international student of the class of 2006 afforded me the opportunity to complement and enhance my character and knowledge as a field grade officer and throughout my career,” he said.

The CGSC experience was a “key factor” to help him achieve one of the highest levels of his career.

The experience includes the professionalism of the teachers and professors who were part of his CGSC time.

“They acknowledged the experience of our differences that would improve the quality of their lessons and was demonstrated for their respect to our opinions and customs,” Inturriaga said.

He closed his remarks thanking his sponsors and with a parting thought for those in attendance.

“Success is never the objective. Sometimes it is the result of hard work, loyalty and friendship between partners, to include within the Army.”

Inductees into the International Hall of Fame are presented gifts from the Greater Kansas City Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars and the CGSC Foundation.

FORT MEADE, Md – Hundreds of retirees from all branches of service gathered at McGill Training Center here Oct. 27 for Fort George G. Meade’s 48th Annual Retiree Appreciation Day.

The installation hosts this annual event to honor our retiree community and showcases diverse services and support that is offered to retirees around Fort Meade and state of Maryland.

“Every year, Retiree Appreciation Day is Fort Meade’s chance to show our appreciation and celebrate you all for your committed service to our nation,” said Fort Meade Garrison Commander Col. Michael Sapp during his opening remarks. “It’s our connections with the community that make us strong. You all are a significant part of that community.”

Sapp’s intent for this event is to provide a first-class Retiree Appreciation Day event for our deserving retirees, their families within the safety and comfort of Fort Meade.

This year’s event featured a health fair, vaccine clinic, vendor exhibit, DEERS/ID card renewals, casualty and legal assistance, raffle and door prizes as well as an opportunity to hear from keynote speaker, Maryland Secretary of Veteran Affairs, Honorable Anthony Woods.

“We have a military that is going to be called upon to do challenging things at some point in the future. Your experience, seeing everyone stand up here today, makes that very clear. As much as we love to preserve peace, every once in a while, we find ourselves in very tough times,” said Woods. “I am thankful for your service, but I also call upon you to see what you can do to encourage the next generation of people to serve.”

Woods went on to describe different initiatives that the Maryland Department of Veteran Affairs is currently working on to improve quality of life for veterans including the MDVA Service and Benefits Program, PACT Act, Cemetery and Memorial Program, Maryland Veterans Trust Fund, 988 infrastructure and the Joining Forces Project.

The office is also focusing on improving employment options for military spouses, combating food and housing insecurity, encouraging health and wellness initiatives and seeking opportunities to serve alongside the civilian community. Woods took the time after his remarks to speak with many of the attendees one on one to address their specific concerns and point them in the right direction.

Retirees also heard from Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center Commander, Col. Chris Maker, Fort Meade Human Resources Director, Wes Smith, and Fort Meade Military Personnel Division Chief, Marcus Ufeanyui. Maker spoke on KACC’s dedication to taking care of veterans and service members while Smith offered attendees a hearty welcome and Ufeanyui highlighted services available to retirees and their spouses through the Fort Meade Retirement Services Office.

This event ensures retired service members and their families are kept up to date on changes affecting their retirement rights, benefits, and privileges, while fostering goodwill between the retired and active-duty communities.

Every November, the United States pays tribute to the cultures, traditions, and contributions of Indigenous Americans during Native American Heritage Month.

The observance originated in the early 20th century when Native American advocate Dr. Arthur C. Parker, a Seneca Indian, urged the Boy Scouts of America to recognize a day for the ""First Americans."" Later, in 1990, President George H.W. Bush declared November as National American Indian Heritage Month.

Our Native American population, from the Iroquois Confederacy in the Northeast to the Apache and Navajo in the Southwest, and the Inuit in the far North, encompasses more than 500 recognized tribes, each with unique cultures and languages.

Native Americans have made remarkable contributions to society. Activists like Elouise Cobell, who fought for Native American rights in land and resource management, and Wilma Mankiller, the first female Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, exemplify the determination and leadership within Native American communities.

Native Americans serve in the United States’ Armed Forces at five times the national average. Incredible accounts of heroes from the Revolutionary War to the present are online at: https://www.army.mil/nativeamericans/

Recently Fort Picket, Virginia was re-designated Fort Barfoot in honor of Col. Van T. Barfoot, a World War II Medal of Honor recipient. Barfoot, a Choctaw Indian from Mississippi, served as a second lieutenant in the Thunderbirds.

On May 23, 1944, during the breakout from Anzio to Rome, Barfoot knocked out two machine gun nests and captured 17 German soldiers. Later that same day, he repelled a German tank assault, destroyed a Nazi fieldpiece, and carried two wounded commanders to safety.

During Native American Heritage Month, there are numerous ways to get involved and show support. In addition to attending local events, this is a great time to support Indigenous Artisans by purchasing authentic Native American crafts, artwork, and jewelry, or support their communities with a family trip to explore museums, heritage centers, and historical sites.

By honoring Native American history, we can foster greater understanding, respect, and unity among all Americans. This November, let us come together to celebrate the vibrant tapestry that is Native American heritage."

Randy George, Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer and their spouses address Pre-Command Course students and spouses Oct. 19, 2023, at The Army University at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. — Predictability is not usually a trait leaders strive to achieve, especially on the battlefield. But creating a culture that includes predictability is key to leadership success, according to U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.

The CSA and SMA addressed a record number of Pre-Command Course future commanders, command sergeants major and spouses at The Army University Oct. 19, 2023, at Fort Leavenworth.

The pair explained, as the students and spouses step into their battalion and brigade leadership roles, establishing norms early helps create predictability.

This includes knowing how a leader will react and lead during low times, knowing training schedules well in advance and even knowing how communication will flow throughout the entire unit even to the families.

Predictability as a leader

“There’s nothing more important to any formation than leadership,” George said. “People are always looking up asking, ‘Do I want to do that?’”

Knowing how a leader operates can create invaluable trust within a unit. George offered four areas of focus for the students to achieve this:

Be steady. Be present. Be reliable. Take care of yourself.

Emphasis on these four topics allow leaders to be resilient and adaptive, Weimer added. “The investment early, will help you minimize the time you spend in those low spots,” he said.

As students and their spouses return to their units, they have important roles beyond Soldiering; creating a cohesive team that includes the families.

“There needs to be a deliberate, sustainable process to make sure people feel a part of the team, part of the family,” Patty George, spouse of CSA said. “Being part of the unit is just as important to us as families ... Being connected with the other families in the unit gave us stamina and purpose all our own. We all felt that tension of being something bigger and better than ourselves. It makes us feel we were part of the team.”

Weimer added events allow leaders to not only connect with families but enables them to demonstrate and create the culture of the unit.

Predictability in the Permanent Change of Station process

A culture that includes predictability starts from the moment a Soldier receives orders to a unit.

Moving an entire family to a new installation is hard, even for senior leaders, Weimer explained.

The impression of a unit and its leaders starts before a Soldier and their family even see a box in their homes.

George elaborated, how their unit is welcoming Soldiers and families, needs to be a priority for the new leaders.

George offered the ""WAR"" of onboarding to consider when creating onboarding processes, with communication being at the top of the list.

W — Welcome new Soldiers and Families.

A — Accurate contact information.

R — Reliable unit and community information.

Information cannot stop at unit specifics, George explained, it must include information from every level to include the Soldier and family’s new garrison.

“That window to build trust and welcome Soldiers is essential. You don’t get a do over on that,” Weimer said. “We have a lot of technology answers to how a Soldier and their family comes to a unit, but that does not replace the human aspect of this.”

Phone calls or even a text, establishing a line of communication on the other side of orders can help individuals, including spouses, feel like part of a something early, Patty George said.

Predictability in schedules

Continuing the trust and predictability created during onboarding comes in the form of schedules.

George challenged the PCC students to be “looking deep”, at least a 90-day calendar, that can be shared with service members and families.

Having a longer-range calendar allows Soldiers to prepare themselves and families for their work loads.

“We owe it to our Families and Soldiers,” George said.

While the work of a leader is focused on ensuring units are trained and lethal Soldiers, there’s a balance PCC students need to consider, Weimer explained.

“We train hard. We have to put that same effort into our families,” he said.

Deliberate focuses on connecting to Soldiers and families; personal leader development; and predictable communication of everything from installation resources to trainings schedules can create a successful unit culture, and it starts with leaders."

YEREVAN, Armenia — Members of the 35th Infantry Division staff met with the Armenian National Defense Research University, members of the ministry of defense general staff, and students of the Vazgen Sargsyan Military Academy September 1-16, 2023, as part of the Kansas Army National Guard State Partnership Program. The purpose of the visit was to facilitate discussions and training on mission command and the officer/non-commissioned officer relationship from a U.S. Army and National Guard perspective.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the State Partnership Program between the Kansas National Guard and the Republic of Armenia and the 30th anniversary of the State Partnership Program overall. Over the years, the Kansas National Guard has worked closely with the Armenian Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Health, Rescue Service and other governmental offices and agencies, cooperating on military-to-military, military-to-civilian and civilian-to-civilian events.

Topics for engagements are chosen through discussions between the two entities and depend on the capabilities and interests of each.

“One of the first things we did was meet with the commander of the NDRU — which is the equivalent of the U.S. Army War College — and his staff and talk through what he wanted out of the engagement,” said Lt. Col. Jason Inskeep, deputy operations officer for the 35th Infantry Division. “And then similarly, we talked with the commander of the military academy to see what his intent was. A big part of it is making sure we are meeting the commander’s intent.”

Mission command and officer/NCO relationships were chosen as topics in part because of the significant differences between the two countries’ doctrines.

“Currently, they are in the process of revising their doctrine and looking at how they utilize their NCO corps,” said Inskeep of the Armenian military. “Their NCOs don’t have the same types of responsibilities that NCOs have in the U.S. Army.”

Discussions centered around the U.S. Army’s concept of mission command, which allows for decentralization and the execution of disciplined initiative.

Command Sgt. Maj. Richard Peplow, senior operations NCO for the 35th Infantry Division, also noted of the differences in the way the doctrine of the two militaries codifies officer/NCO roles and responsibilities, remarking that the concept of mission command might seem somewhat strange to militaries in other countries.

“The Armenian idea of how their NCO corps works is completely different than in the United States Army,” said Peplow. “I hoped to be able to give the Armenian officers a different point of view. We weren’t there to say ‘Our way is the right way.’ It was about having an open dialogue about how we operate and the success we’ve had with it.”

Peplow, who recently returned from the 35th Infantry Division's 2022 deployment in support of Operation Spartan Shield, said it was helpful being able to provide real-world examples from his experiences.

“It was my first visit to Armenia and I didn’t really know what to expect,” said Peplow. “But I was pleasantly surprised with how open and accepting everyone was of us bringing a somewhat unusual, different way of doing things and their willingness to at least listen.”

With the Armenia/Kansas Army National Guard relationship being now well-established, Inskeep sees many more opportunities in the future to continue the conversations.

“Over the past 20 years, the amount of involvement we have had has only increased,” said Inskeep. “There’s a lot of opportunities to participate in exercises and instruction. The division is the unit of action for the Army, so it’s a good opportunity for us to teach what we know and what we do, and also for us to learn from their experiences.”"

WASHINGTON — Each day Spc. Joelle Pamplona, a physical therapy specialist, heads into the Madigan Army Medical Center on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington to help veterans, Soldiers and their families heal.

Being able to make a difference in their recovery is what drives him.

""It's the reason I picked this job,” he said. “It makes my day every time knowing that I helped someone and that now they are living their best life again.""

Growing up in Southern California, Pamplona was an active kid. He was into athletics and martial arts.

While watching the popular animated series “Naruto,” he became drawn to one of the characters, Rock Lee, who lacked the talent of others but was able to keep up by training extremely hard.

“This inspired me as a kid to get strong and always improve,” he said.

He started doing pushups, sit-ups and running to increase his strength and endurance. As he got older, he turned to weightlifting and then powerlifting to push himself harder.

While in college in 2018, he broke the state squatting record for his weight class during a powerlifting competition.

The constant training and repetitive heavy lifting took a toll on his body as the injuries mounted. He dealt with foot, ankle, knee and back pain.

“I’ve had it all,” he said. “When you’re younger you have a little bit of an ego, and you just need to outlift everybody. It doesn’t always work out well, and sometimes you have to learn from your mistakes.”

He did just that. He researched how to improve his form, how to prevent injury and how to heal himself. He also started changing his workouts to increase flexibility and mobility.

With his ability to transform his own body, others in school started to take notice and began coming to him for advice. He enjoyed coaching them and helping them bounce back from injury.

This love of movement, physical activity and helping others fueled him as he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology from California State University, Fullerton in 2020.

The timing was not on his side as the coronavirus pandemic hit, limiting his ability to get the hours and experience he needed for a physical therapy specialist position.

He turned his attention to the military and contacted an Army recruiter. The Army offers more than 200 ways to serve as a Solider, including careers in science, cybersecurity, combat forces, aviation, law and medicine.

The recruiter told Pamplona that nothing was available in his desired field at the time, and he would keep him in mind if anything popped up.

Sure enough, a few months later the recruiter called and asked if he was still interested.

“I was like, ‘Heck yea,’” he said emphatically. “I always wanted to join the military. I always looked up to people who served the country. Being able to put on the uniform gives me a lot of pride.”

He enlisted in 2021 as a physical therapy specialist and went to basic training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma before heading to Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston for job training.

The course was challenging as he juggled studying, staying fit and being a Soldier. Time management became a key to making sure he didn’t burn himself out.

Finding enough hours in the day to complete his work might have been a struggle but comradery with his classmates was not.

“We became like brothers and sisters,” he said. “I still talk to them almost every day.”

Following his completion of phase two of physical therapy training at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, he was assigned to his first duty station at Madigan Army Medical Center last year.

There, he’s been able to help veterans, Soldiers and their families recover from injury. He’s even helped several of them rehab following surgery to repair Achilles tendon tears.

This time has allowed him to grow close to many of his patients.

“You build a lot of great relationships in this field,” he said. “You spend so much time with them, and they are in such a vulnerable state. They put a lot of trust in you and in the process to get them better.”

The rehab can be slow at times, but Pamplona says patients get energized as they start to make progress. This is an important step for them physically and mentally.

“Getting back your life is critical,” he said. “It’s critical to your mental health and it’s critical to your well-being.”

In just a few short years, Pamplona has used his drive to improve and help others to become the Soldier everyone on post knows for helping them recover.

“[Joining the Army has] been better than I thought it’d be,” he said. “Just the opportunities it’s given me and the friends it’s given me. I think I got placed in a great situation.”

Pamplona is scheduled to be promoted to sergeant next month.

October is National Physical Therapy Month. It is a dedicated time to celebrate the ways physical therapists, physical therapy assistants and physical therapy students help improve the lives of patients across the country.

CAMP SMITH TRAINING SITE, New York— Soldiers of the New York Army National Guard’s 1156th Engineer Company got a lesson in Indian military history and a taste of traditional Indian food during their October 14, 2023 drill training at the Camp Smith Training Site near Peekskill.

The event was the latest in a series of cultural meals held one drill weekend each quarter, according to the company first sergeant, 1st Sgt. Theodore Gentile. The goal, he explained, is to introduce the members of the company, a component of the 204th Engineer Battalion, to the diverse backgrounds of its company members.

The Soldier who suggested the October 14 meal and history lesson was Sgt. Talwinder Singh, a Queens resident and a plumber in the company who is Sikh.

Sikhs follow the Indian religion of Sikhism, which has 25 million adherents worldwide. While 80 percent of Sikhs live in India, the Pew Research Center estimates there are about 280,000 Sikhs in the United States, and 11 percent of those live in New York.

Sikhs have a long tradition of military service, and during the 19th Century they were valued by the British Empire for service protecting what was then British India, which today are the countries of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

In 1897, a group of 21 Sikh soldiers fought to the death against 10,000 Afghans attacking a key fortification on the British Empire’s frontier. The heroic stand of the Sikh soldiers delayed the Afghans and prevented the fall of other forts in the area.

Singh said he got the idea for a presentation on the battle after attending a lecture given by Dr. Gurinderpal Singh Josan, the founder of the Saragarhi Foundation, which works to commemorate the battle.

Singh pitched the idea to company leadership, and they liked it, Gentile said.

“This group, the Saragarhi Foundation, was willing to come here and give us a whole brief on the battle, and then tie it in with the food, so it’s an awesome experience to have the history of their culture and their military tie in with ours,” said Gentile.

“I said, ‘You know, we should do this with the United States Army too’ it’s about the warrior, it’s about the Army,” said Singh. “I wanted to introduce my food and also my culture’s history.”

During the lunchtime lecture, held at the Camp Smith visitors’ quarters, the Soldiers heard about the battle from Singh Josan.

He told them how the 21 Sikh soldiers of the 36th Sikh Regiment, led by a sergeant, decided to fight it out at their outpost to help protect the rest of the unit rather than retreat.

The details of the fight were transmitted to the other units using a device called a heliograph which used flashes of light on a mirror to send messages.

Although the Sikh soldiers were all killed, they killed at least 180 Afghans and delayed the advance of the Afghan Army long enough to prevent other units from being destroyed.

The Sikhs were all posthumously presented the Indian Order of Merit, the highest Indian Army award at the time and the battle was eventually commemorated with two monuments.

Singh said he was happy to get the chance to share some of his cultural history and food with the other Soldiers of the 1156th.

“I’m starting here, and hopefully we will go forward to other battalions, and other companies, and slowly teach everybody about us,” Singh said."

WASHINGTON — From war heroes’ stories on the front lines to discussions on leadership, Soldiers have a wide palette of podcasts available to them.

Organizations across the Army have adopted podcasts to share local services and events while podcasts from service-wide publications such as the NCO Journal focuses on broader Soldier topics like transitioning to civilian life. Soldiers can conveniently stream episodes on or off duty, while working out or traveling.

The Army News Service looks into nine growing podcasts from across the Army.

NCO Journal and the Sergeant’s Time podcasts: What began as supplemental content for NCO Journal articles and stories has expanded to regular episodes with topics that vary from career advice, tips on building Soldier camaraderie, and talks on future combat operations.

The NCO Journal podcast provides relevant advice for Army NCOs as well as leadership lessons. The publication fields submissions from the Army’s senior NCO academy staff, NCOs and civilians. For instance, the program hosted a discussion on transition assistance for Soldiers retiring from active duty. The NCO Journal hosts have also held talks on ending NCO misconduct.

“We're trying to diversify and make it more all-encompassing, more approachable for all NCOs,” managing editor Chago Zapata said. “Everything that we do in the NCO Journal we look at it through the eyes of the NCO. Does this article have any bearing? Or does it provide any sort of for depth professional development opportunities for our audience? We have a chance to dive deeper into it in our podcasts.”

Zapata, a retired Marine Corps gunnery sergeant, expanded the programming to a second podcast, titled “Sergeant’s Time” to feature guests of different ranks and backgrounds who do not submit articles. Guests will include the Recruiter of the Year and Drill Sergeant of the Year winners with retired Sgt. Maj. of the Army Daniel Dailey slated to be featured in the first episode.

The Spear, Modern War Institute, West Point: Already renowned for its harrowing accounts of Soldiers in combat, “The Spear” ranks as one of the Army’s top podcasts in listenership. Timothy Heck, deputy editorial director, wanted to diversify the program further.

Heck featured Soldiers of all ranks, genders, and career fields, including logisticians and public affairs officers, and even included troops outside of the Army. Heck, now a former assistant West Point professor, noticed episodes focused heavily on Operation Enduring Freedom and the war on terror.

He then began featuring stories from the Vietnam War and World War II.

“There’s more to the Army, and there’s more to combat than the 11 Bravo [infantry] experience,” Heck said. “So, let’s look there. I wanted to make [the podcast] more than just the Global War on Terror.”

In the Spear’s episode “Across the Fence” on Sept. 27, Heck interviewed former Army Green Beret John Meyer, who went on secret missions in North Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Meyer volunteered for Special Forces training in Vietnam, where eventually Green Berets would join indigenous Soldiers in an eight-year secret war.

Heck spent time as a Marine Corps artillery officer and did one tour in Iraq before becoming a military historian. His featured guests included Medal of Honor recipient Earl Plumlee, Navy Seal Rick Witt, and Army Rangers.

Heck added that the podcast’s audience grew in part to episodes that focused on the Russian-Ukraine conflict and the U.S. contributions to the war. Last spring, Heck interviewed the chief of the Ukrainian Army’s chaplain corps.

The Marne Report, Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia – Fort Stewart’s local weekly podcast has slowly grown after initially having a small following. Hosted by Molly Cooke, the Marne Report updates Soldiers and post residents on local events including holiday celebrations and fitness competitions.

The episodes offer tips on deployment preparation for Soldiers, as well as back to school advice for families, and interviews with installations commanders and leaders.

Topics range from discussing respite care for the family members of deployed Soldiers to anti-terrorism awareness tips.

“A really cool thing about this podcast is that we've got interests across the board from active-duty service members to their family members,” Cooke said. “So, it’s a broad range of topics.”

FORSCOM Frontline, Army Forces Command, Fort Liberty, North Carolina – FORSCOM’s podcast focuses on the command’s mission of bolstering Soldier readiness and tells stories of troops on the frontline. The program features topics unique to the command, including FORSCOM’s recent Best Squad Competition but also delves into subjects that impact the whole force, including improving quality of life and suicide prevention.

Frontline publishes two episodes a month and most recently featured the Golden Knights, the Army’s demonstration and competition parachute team. The podcast has posted interviews with Olympic Gold Medalist Amber English, a member of the Army’s World Class Athlete Program as well as an explosive ordnance Soldier who was featured on the Food Network.

Some episodes offer advice including one that discussed how to identify scams and fake social media profiles of prominent military members, while another offered testimony from a holistic health and fitness officer.

Leader Up, Army Management Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas – The “Leader Up” podcast, hosted by the Army Management Staff College, focuses on Army civilian professionalism and leader development.

Episodes feature commentary by Army senior leaders including James Helis, director of the Army Resilience Directorate. Helis discussed how Soldiers and civilians can build resilience by learning coping skills to plan, set goals, and maintain positive attitudes to prevent harmful behaviors.

“If you’ve got the coping skills to deal with the challenge, you’re less likely to turn to unhealthy alternatives; to substance abuse, to [suicide], to acting out in the workplace,” Helis said.

The podcast also tackles broader Army topics including the service’s digital transition to streamline its data processes.

The Great Big Podcast, Fort Cavazos, Texas- Derived from the installation’s “The Great Place” nickname, “The Great Big Podcast” explores the mission and achievements of Fort Cavazos’ local units including the 1st Cavalry Division. However the podcast features a diverse array of topics that not only caters to Soldiers but the larger military community.

The weekly program, which launched on Dec. 16, 2019, also delves into topics such as the prevention of domestic violence, domestic abuse and suicide. The episodes feature a variety of subjects, from the role of a first sergeant to how Soldiers can contribute to the Army’s antiterrorism program and environmental sustainability.

“The Great Big Podcast is unique truly because of the focus that we take when it comes to telling the Army story,"" said Samantha Harms, command information chief. ""So often you only hear about the typical topics of being a Soldier — trainings, weapons, deployments — which are covered in our podcast.

""But it is important to remember that a Soldier is human first ... We tell the story of services on the installation, the reminders of how the Army operates for that young Soldier or to inform the public, share intimate stories on domestic violence to remind people that they are never alone, and so much more.""

Episodes have discussed the impact of Army civilians in service modernization as well as leadership development. One episode featured the impact of the Army on the Texas-based rock band Bowling for Soup.

""The community we have here in Central Texas is something that is quite special,"" Harms said. ""It is filled with service members, retirees, veterans, Department of the Army civilians, contractors and people who truly work hard to constantly better the place they live in. Our podcast reminds them that we are here for them too.""

Breaking Doctrine, Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, - The Army’s flagship center for doctrine located outside Kansas City, Kansas focuses its “Breaking Doctrine” podcast on current and trending topics related to doctrine; the fundamental principles that guide the military’s actions toward national objectives.

For example, a recent episode examined recruiting challenges as the Army looks to rebound from recruitment shortfalls. Gen. Johnny Davis, who leads Army Recruiting Command, answered questions on how Army recruiters could better appeal to potential candidates for military service.

Another episode performed a case study on a dangerous combat operation maneuver called passage of lines. During the operation, a stationary force creates a pathway for another force to pass its position.

Episodes ranged from exploring how the Army shifted from active defense to the most recent operational philosophy, “AirLand Battle,” which stresses air and ground theater operations to intricacies of the Army Field Manual 3-0. The manual establishes the doctrine for multi-domain operations, the service’s operational concept.

The Army Soldier for Life Podcast, Soldier for Life – “Army Soldier for Life,” which connects Soldiers and families to assistance programs, offers advice on permanent, change-of-station moves and the transition to civilian life.

The podcast, hosted by Lt. Col. Ismael Ortiz Rivera, Soldier for Life employment director, also discusses financial tips for Soldiers, career development for military spouses and career skills programs.

Additionally, episodes highlight eligible healthcare for Soldiers once they retire. The program featured episodes that explored various career opportunities including the Secret Service.

The Army Soldier for Life program works closely with communities to encourage opportunities for veterans to keep ties with the Army.

The High Ground, Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama – USASMDC’s podcast offers news of the command, which provides space and missile capabilities to joint services and partner nations while supporting multi-domain operations.

One episode discussed how members of the 100th Missile Defense Brigade Operations Team in Colorado Springs, Colorado, perform a critical national security mission. Under the guidance of a presidential order, the 100th Missile Defense Brigade defends the U.S. from the threat of intercontinental ballistic missile attacks.

FORT RILEY, Kan. – Soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division welcomed Command Sgt. Maj. Derek Noyes as the new division command sergeant major during an assumption of responsibility ceremony on Fort Riley, Kansas, Sep. 29, 2023.

Noyes replaced Command Sgt. Maj. Clarence Raby, who assumed the position on Aug. 9, 2023 from then Command Sgt. Maj. Christopher Mullinax.

“This division has an incredible history and I am humbled, honored and incredibly excited to be standing before you today as a Big Red One Soldier and your command sergeant major,” said Noyes. “It’s not lost on me the legacy of the Soldiers who came before me in this storied division. From the battlefields of France, to the beaches of the Normandy, to the jungles of Vietnam, to standing watch on the frontier of freedom in Europe, to the deserts of the Middle East.”

A native of Amarillo, Texas, Noyes enlisted in the United States Army in July 1996. He attended One Station Unit Training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, as an armor crewman. He has since held every enlisted leadership position in the armor and cavalry branches from tank gunner to brigade command sergeant major. Noyes now adds division command sergeant major to that list.

Noyes served as the command sergeant major of the 194th Armored Brigade, the operations sergeant major for the 3rd Infantry Division Sustainment Brigade and the command sergeant major of the 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, at Fort Stewart, Georgia.

He deployed twice as part of Operation Iraq Freedom, once in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and once more in support of Operation Spartan Shield.

He has completed all levels of noncommissioned officer education, while also graduating from the Army Recruiter Course, the M1A1 Master Gunner Course and the Battle Staff Course, to name a few. He holds a bachelor’s degree in history from the University of Maryland and is currently pursuing a master’s degree in human resources from Columbia Southern University.

“The reason I chose sergeant major [Noyes] is for the reasons I have just described,” said Maj. Gen. John V. Meyer III, commander of the 1st Inf. Div. and Fort Riley. “I want somebody who is a leader, who will accept the authority that I have given him and the responsibility that comes with that.”

“I wanted somebody to accomplish what we need to do in the division and that is to focus on our people, focus on gunnery and focus on our maintenance; and this command sergeant major has the right training and experience to help us improve in those areas.”

Since its inception, the noncommissioned officer corps has served an essential role in the United States Army. They are pivotal players in understanding commanders intent and end state and executing key tasks.

“When something happens to us on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, and the officers are no longer present on that beach because they have been killed, the noncommissioned officer corps steps up and leads the Soldiers off that beach and up that bluff to liberate a continent,” said Meyer. “That’s the authority our NCO Corps has.”

Noyes joins the Big Red One as it prepares to conduct extensive training exercises designed to improve warfighting capabilities alongside multinational allies and partners.

“I promise that I will give my all, every day, to continue to move that legacy forward,” said Noyes. “Danger Seven signing on the net.”

In the coming months, the 1st Inf. Div. will participate in a war-fighter exercise, a capstone training event where the division will exercise systems in simulated large scale combat operations."

ORT CARSON, Colo. – There are more than 8,000 Citizen-Soldiers in the Oklahoma Army National Guard, but only one holds the title of Soldier-athlete: Spc. Dalton Duffield.

Duffield, a horizontal construction engineer with the 3120th Engineer Support Company, 120th Engineer Battalion, discovered an extraordinary way to blend his love for wrestling with his dedication to his state and nation.

“I’ve been wrestling since I was about 7 or 8 years old,” Duffield said. “I had a bunch of life-size stuffed animals like the ones you’d get from the fair, and I’d wrestle them in the living room. Finally, my dad bugged my mom, saying, ‘We need to put him in wrestling,’ and so, at a young age, they took me to wrestling practice, and I loved it.”

Today, Duffield serves as a proud member of the Oklahoma National Guard and is on a relentless pursuit of excellence in his sport of Greco-Roman wrestling, thanks to the U.S. Army’s World Class Athlete Program.

The WCAP allows top-ranked Soldier-athletes to perform at the international level while serving the nation in uniform. WCAP Soldiers come from the Active, Reserve and National Guard components and are selected for their ability to perform at the highest level of their sports.

Duffield chose to join the Oklahoma Army National Guard to reach the WCAP after speaking with fellow wrestler and OKARNG recruiter Staff Sgt. Zachary D’Amico.

“He already knew what he wanted to do when it came to joining WCAP and pursuing his Olympic dreams,” D’Amico said. “What we did was sit down and find the best way for him to get there and what was the best for his family, and that was to join as a Citizen-Soldier.”

Once in the WCAP program, Soldier-athletes like Duffield are trained by elite civilian and military coaches. Simultaneously, they fulfill their military duties, attend relevant military schools, and maintain their competitive edge against fellow uniformed athletes.

“The World Class Athlete Program gives you big opportunities that most people don’t get, such as to serve your country and compete in my sport and continue to try to reach Olympic goals,” Duffield said. “I’m gaining all these accolades, but I’m also helping something bigger than myself. I’m working on something that’s not just for me personally.”

Thanks in part to being a member of the WCAP, Duffield is a six-time U.S. National Team member. In 2023 alone, he won 1st place in the Final X Wrestling Challenge Tournament and Pan-American Wrestling Championships and 2nd Place at the Final X Wrestling Tournament and Armed Forces Championships.

“I feel like we really push toward the ‘be all you can be’ motto for the Army,” Duffield said. “The Army has so much to offer and you have so much more to offer the Army than you could ever think. Anything you could possibly want to do throughout the world, the Army offers it in some shape or form.”

CAMP SMITH TRAINING SITE, New York--One of the New York National Guard’s most famous units welcomed a new commander during a Sunday, Oct. 22, 2023, change-of-command ceremony at the Camp Smith Training Site near Peekskill, New York.

Army National Guard Col. Patrick Clare, a veteran of the Iraq War, took command of the “Harlem Hellfighters,” the 369th Sustainment Brigade.

The unit earned the nickname during World War I when it was the 369th Infantry Regiment, an all-Black regiment in a segregated Army which distinguished itself on the battlefield.

The unit's official nickname comes from the location of the brigade’s National Guard Armory in New York City's Harlem neighborhood, and an English translation of the German word ""hollenkampfer,"" which is reportedly what the enemy called the African-American Soldiers fighting against them in France.

Today, the 369th Sustainment Brigade is a headquarters which controls up to five major logistics and support units which sustain Army combat forces.

Clare replaced Col. Seth Morgulas, who had commanded the brigade since 2019. Morgulas, who is also a veteran of the Iraq War, commanded the brigade during a 2022-2023 deployment to the Middle East in support of the Army’s Task Force Spartan.

“Commanding a Sustainment Brigade during these trying times is extremely humbling,” Clare told the brigade’s Soldiers.

“Know that I will do my best to build upon what Colonel Morgulas has already established, and continue to move the brigade forward,” he said.

In his remarks, Clare also thanked the officers and non-commissioned officers he has worked with who helped him become a better leader.

He also thanked his family, and his wife Nicole, for their support.

“You have stood by me through three deployments, countless weekends and weeks apart, and you stand with me today ready to take on this next challenge,” Clare said.

A new command sergeant major also took over following the change of command. Command Sgt. Major Leyland Jones replaced Command Sgt. Major Curtiss Moss as the brigade’s senior enlisted Soldier.

Clare, a resident of Clifton Park, New York, joined the New York National Guard in 1994 as an enlisted truck driver.

In 2000 he was commissioned as an officer through the New York Army National Guard's Officer Candidate School.

Clare has served in a number of key logistics positions, to include forward support battalion company commander, forward support battalion commander, brigade logistics officer, assistant chief of staff for logistics for the 42nd Infantry Division, deputy commander of the 53rd Troop Command, and Joint Force Headquarters logistics officer.

He deployed to Iraq in 2004-2005 as the transportation officer for the 42nd Infantry Division in Tikrit. And in 2011 he deployed to Kuwait as brigade logistics officer for the 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. He also deployed to Kuwait as the chief logistics officer for the 42nd Infantry Division in 2020.

Clare also responded to New York City in 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Clare is a 2002 Graduate of Nyack College with a BS in Business Administration and is a 2019 graduate of the U.S. Army War College with a master's in strategic studies. He earned an associated degree from Cayuga County Community College in Auburn in 1997.

His awards include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.

Clare works for the National Guard as a full-time federal technician serving as the New York Army National Guard Director of Logistics.

The 369th Infantry Regiment was originally the 15th New York Infantry (Colored), which was established in 1916. The unit was renumbered by the Army, but the Soldiers proudly carried their state unit flag into battle throughout their time in combat in 1918.

During World War I the unit fought with the French Army, because the United States Army at the time did not have confidence that Black Soldiers could fight.

The unit Soldiers however, repeatedly distinguished themselves in battle and 171 won Frances highest battle honor, the Croix de Guerre. In 2015, Sgt. Henry Johnson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in battle.

Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, who later became the first African- American general officer, commanded the regiment in 1938.

In 1940, when the National Guard was federalized at the start of World War II, the regiment converted into an antiaircraft unit. The Soldiers deployed to the Pacific where they were reorganized into smaller units guarding island bases against Japanese air attack.

The unit was reorganized during the Cold War period and eventually became the 369th Support Battalion, which went on to serve in the Persian Gulf War.

In 2006, the unit was reorganized again as the 369th Sustainment Brigade, which is designed to command multiple support units."

Eric Emmerling, a Springville resident, takes command of New York National Guard artillery battalion in October 20 ceremony",https://www.army.mil/article/271188/army_guard_lt_col_eric_emmerling_a_springville_resident_takes_command_of_new_york_national_guard_artillery_battalion_in_october_20_ceremony,"Camp Smith Training Site, New York — New York Army National Guard Lt. Col. Eric Emmerling, a Springville, N.Y. resident and Iraq War veteran, took command of the New York National Guard's only artillery battalion during an October 20 ceremony at Camp Smith Training Site in the Hudson Valley.

Emmerling, who is a New York State Police investigator in civilian life, took over from Lt. Col. Jeffery Roth, who had led the 1st Battalion, 258th Artillery Regiment, since 2021.

The 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery, traces its history back to an artillery company founded in New York City in 1784.

In 1789 that company escorted George Washington to his inauguration as first president of the United States. Today, the battalion's crest is emblazoned with the Washington family crest, and the battalion is nicknamed ""the Washington Greys"" because of that event.

The unit has served in the Civil War, World Wars I and II and the Iraq War.

Today, the unit provides fire support for the New York Army National Guard's 27th Infantry Brigade and is equipped with M-777 155-millimeter howitzers and M-117 105-millimeter howitzers. The battalion has elements in Queens, the Bronx, and New Windsor in the Hudson Valley.

FORT BUCHANAN, Puerto Rico—Various service members and federal civilian employees supported the Red Ribbon Week campaign, led by the 1st Mission Support Command and U.S. Army Garrison Command Fort Buchanan Army Substance Abuse Program, by wearing a red shirt for work to raise awareness about the dangers of substance abuse and encourage healthy, drug-free lifestyles, October 25.

Red Ribbon Week is a national campaign in the United States. Dr. Carlos Montañez Cintrón, the ASAP coordinator for the USAGC Fort Buchanan, explained that the campaign was established in 1985 to honor Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, an American Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was killed in the line of duty while working undercover to investigate drug trafficking.

""The red ribbon has become a symbol of his sacrifice and a commitment to drug prevention efforts,"" said Dr. Montañez. ""With the slogan 'Be kind to your mind, live drug-free,' our aim is to raise awareness in the community.""

An information booth was set up at The Exchange here, where informative pamphlets and campaign materials were distributed. Visitors were also educated on the proper use and handling of controlled substances.

The goal is to guide veterans and the community towards a healthier, drug-free lifestyle, said Sgt. 1st Class Yadira Valle Lopez, a soldier of the 1st MSC working at the ASAP information booth.

""We are actively raising awareness in the community about substance abuse and promoting Drug Collection Week,"" said Yesenia Pagan Rosario, the Drug Testing Coordinator of the 1st MSC. ""On October 28, the Fort Buchanan community will have the opportunity to drop off their expired, unused, or unwanted medications at the Fort Buchanan's PX from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm.""

Pagan Rosario explained that the event is organized by the DEA and promotes proper disposal of medicines.

Visitors at the Exchange expressed their appreciation for the initiative, as they believe that the information provided promotes the well-being of the community.

""I found the presentation very informative because there are times when people are unaware of the consequences of mishandling medications,"" said Jose Miguel Rodriguez Melendez, a retired veteran.

""The last time I attended an event like this, I received a campaign ribbon, which I still have hanging in my vehicle to raise awareness,"" said Nilda Lopez, the wife of a retired veteran.

The 1st Mission Support Command offers services and programs that enhance readiness and resiliency, like the Sexual Harassment and Assault Program (SHARP), Suicide and Prevention, Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP), and Private Public Partnership Office."

WASHINGTON — It is four in the morning and already they are lined up at Chicago’s Midway airport, ready to go. It’s like a military formation, 107 men and three women, all veterans who served either in World War II, Korea or Vietnam.

Their destination: Washington D.C, on a chartered Southwest Airlines 737 thanks to Honor Flight Chicago, a group of dedicated volunteers who make it their mission to provide a well-deserved thank you to veterans for their military service.

“Three World War II veterans, 10 Korean War veterans and 97 Vietnam veterans are on this flight,” said Honor Flight Chicago Co-director Doug Meffley, “We have now flown over 10,600 Veterans which is the most of any Honor Flight hub in the nation.”

Southwest Airlines First Officer Brian Dunn, who serves as an Army Reserve public affairs officer at the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, was the co-pilot on this flight. He met with the veterans, shook their hands, and asked about their service prior to the flight.

“I think it’s such a special thing. There’s an organization that will mobilize all these volunteers to have such an impactful day for the World War II, Korea and Vietnam Veterans,” said Dunn, who worked his first honor flight eight years ago. “To have the honor of working as a crew member on this flight is pretty special.”

Flying and military service are part of Dunn’s Family heritage too. He always wanted to pursue flying since he was a young man.

U.S. military veterans who served in World War II, Korean and Vietnam Wars pause for a photo during an Honor Flight Chicago trip to Washington D.C., October 18, 2023. During the one-day trip, they visited the U.S. Marine Corps War memorial, the World War II memorial, Korean War Veterans memorial, Vietnam Veterans memorial and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. They also enjoyed a performance by the U.S. Marine Corp Silent Drill team. Honor Flight Chicago co-director Doug Meffley says the organization has flown more than 10,600 Veterans to Washington D.C. to thank them for their military service. U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col.

“I think flying was always a part of me. I’ve known since I was eight years old that I wanted to be an airline pilot. I put all my energy and focus into achieving that dream. It’s a big reason why and how I (joined) the military,” said Dunn.

Dunn, who currently serves at the rank of lieutenant colonel, further touched on his service in the Army Reserve.

“Along the way I’ve made a wonderful career in the Army Reserve in a non-flying capacity. I’ve had the opportunity to be the head of human resources on a general staff and I’ve taught military history at the University of Illinois Chicago. I’ve been a commander and now I get to work in Army public affairs,” said Dunn. “It’s been a diverse, wonderful 26-year career so far and I’m not done yet. I’m grateful for it.”

Dunn’s grandfather was the captain of a B-17 crew that flew 38 missions over Europe at the end of World War II.

“He was at Pearl Harbor when it was bombed. My father and husband both served in nuclear submarines in the Navy,” Dunn said.

After they arrived in Washington, D.C., a police escort led the chartered buses to the Iwo Jima memorial for the first stop. Then it was on to the World War II memorial where they were greeted by an actor portraying General George Patton.

There, John Clauson, a St. Charles, Illinois resident, recalled his service in the Army Air Corps during World War II.

“I was in the air corps cadet program for pilots for about 18 months. They sent us to college for four months in Galesburg, Illinois. Then I went to cadet training in San Antonio, Texas. In 1945, we finally got to Chickasha, Oklahoma where we started to fly the PT-17 Stearman,” said Clauson. “I was reclassified to go to B-29 gunnery school. We used the B-24 to learn the gunnery system. We finished gunnery school in August and we were ready to go when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.”

Clauson was honorably discharged at Fort Sheridan, Illinois.

After leaving the World War II memorial, the veterans traveled to the Korean War and Vietnam Veteran’s memorials.

At the Vietnam Veteran’s memorial, a veteran quietly etched the name of a Soldier on a piece of tracing paper.

Vietnam Veteran James Doffin, of Dyer, Indiana, who served as a demolition expert and combat engineer, was moved by the outpouring of gratitude from citizens which, Doffin stated, did not happen when he returned home.

“When we came home (from Vietnam) nobody paid much attention to us. Today was awesome. I think I shook more hands than I did in my lifetime,” Doffin said. “Words can’t express how nice it was.”

The last stop for the veterans was the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport. It is home to the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Space Shuttle Discovery and a SR-71 Blackbird spy plane.

When they returned to Midway Airport that evening, the veterans were greeted by hundreds of well-wishers who waved American flags and held welcome home signs thanking them for their service.

“This is the most fulfilling thing I will do in my life. To see the veterans come home to this love and respect that is 50 years in the coming,” said Meffley. “I have yet to get through a flight day without tears."

JOHNSTON, Iowa – The president of Kosovo visited the Iowa National Guard Oct. 24 as part of an international trip to Iowa spurred by an invitation from Gov. Kim Reynolds and Maj. Gen. Stephen Osborn, the adjutant general of the Iowa National Guard, when they visited Kosovo in June.

Iowa military leaders greeted Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani with much fanfare at Camp Dodge. Flags lined the halls of Joint Force Headquarters, and men and women wore their finest military attire.

During her visit to Camp Dodge, she met with Osborn and discussed various topics, from global security to strengthening the National Guard’s military-to-military training.

Osmani provided brief comments to leaders while at the Iowa capital.

“Partnerships such as this one are the best example of what visionary leadership can do,” said Osmani. “Our partnership grows stronger by the day as we expand our cooperation in all areas of common and strategic interest, such as defense, agriculture, tourism and energy.”

Her visit to Camp Dodge included a tour of the Sustainment Training Center, the Medical Simulation Training Center and the Joint Operations Center.

This was Osmani’s first visit to Iowa since being elected in April 2021. A Kosovo president last visited Iowa National Guard leaders in Iowa in 2012, shortly after a State Partnership Program with the country began.

The State Partnership Program is a Department of Defense National Guard Bureau initiative that develops mutual military cooperation. The 30-year-old program now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations.

“The State Partnership Program serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration,” said Osborn. “It showcases the power of unity, resilience and the human spirit.”

In 2023, the Iowa National Guard made significant efforts to build ties with the Kosovo Security Force. Iowa Airmen traveled to Kosovo in April for a large-scale medical training exercise. Additionally, Lt. Ylli Dalladaku was the first KSF member to complete the U.S. Army’s Basic Officer Infantry Leaders Course and Ranger school alongside Iowa Soldiers.

“Our bond with Kosovo Security Forces allows for the exchange of knowledge, skills and experiences in the field of defense and security,” said Osborn. “Our brave men and women in uniform gain invaluable insights through joint exercises, training programs and information sharing.”

The KSF and the Iowa National Guard will hold weapons maintenance and religious affairs workshops in 2024 as part of the SPP.

David Paxton, center, meets with Pacific Island officials during a State Partnership Program exchange.

CARSON CITY, Nev. – Nearly two years into his role as the Nevada Guard’s bilateral affairs officer based in the picturesque South Pacific island nation of Fiji, Maj. David Paxton emphatically dismisses the notion his job is an extended vacation thousands of miles from the pressures and stresses of the mainland.

As the representative of Nevada’s State Partnership Program in the U.S. Embassy in Suva, Fiji, Paxton helps organize, coordinate and manage Nevada’s SPP engagements with Fiji and Tonga. He is also deputy chief of the Office of Defense Cooperation with Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga and Tuvalu. (Nevada’s third partner country in the SPP, Samoa, falls under the oversight of the U.S. Embassy in Wellington, New Zealand.)

Those jobs leave little time for tourism, Paxton said recently while in Nevada for a series of meetings.

“It’s not as romantic as one might imagine. The resorts are not far away, but there is little time to venture there,” Paxton said. “The tempo of engagements has really ramped up in the post-Covid era, and the region is one of the most visible in the world as nations vie for influence in the Blue Pacific (a diplomatic term that encompasses the Pacific Ocean-island nations and their collective interests.)

“The job itself hasn’t been romantic, but it’s been rewarding to be in a position where I am a part of a team that can influence global relationships on behalf of the United States,” he said. “I did not know much about international affairs and diplomacy before becoming the bilateral affairs officer, but now I know how much the State Partnership Program really matters on the geopolitical scale.”

Paxton, 36, of Reno, will reside in Suva until his international tour concludes next year. He lives just a few blocks from the U.S. Embassy in Suva.

An engineer branch officer, Paxton joined the Nevada Army Guard in 2008 and was commissioned as an officer in 2009. After his 2016 deployment to Iraq and Kuwait with the 17th Sustainment Brigade as its battle captain, he became the commander of the 240th Vertical Construction Company. His most recent military assignment was as the personnel officer for the 421st Regional Training Institute.

For his full-time employment, Paxton was the facility and construction master planner for the Nevada Army Guard’s Directorate of Installations and Environment.

In 2021, Paxton veered from the engineering officer career path to succeed Maj. Michal Riggs as the second bilateral affairs officer in Nevada Guard history.

Paxton said it’s his job to share information between the embassy and the Nevada National Guard that might otherwise go unknown by both parties. For example, Fiji recently needed equipment distribution and familiarization training on explosive ordnance disposal equipment the Department of State granted to Fiji. Within weeks, Paxton helped organize an international engagement including Fijian Soldiers and Soldiers in the Nevada Army Guard’s 3665th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company. The SPP-coordinated team even acted as couriers on behalf of the Department of State to get some of the equipment into the country.

Paxton has no complaints about the location of his office and the traveling opportunities.

“The geographic region and climate are completely opposite Nevada’s,” Paxton said. “It has been amazing to have nearby access to other countries and get out and do different activities.”

Paxton said most Blue Pacific citizens support the U.S. presence in the region. Many remain grateful for the U.S. defense of the Pacific during World War II.

“The most important thing I can do in my position is maintain the existing relationships that have been established with our partners and further develop new, positive relationships,” Paxton said.

Paxton will return to the mainland in March to a yet-to-be-determined position. Renowned aviator Maj. Zackary Taylor-Warren will become the Nevada Guard’s third BAO.

“The job of bilateral affairs officer has been the most impactful and diversely challenging experience of my military career,” Paxton said. “The learning curve was enormous, but I can now say I know at least a little about how the U.S. conducts international diplomacy — it definitely differs from what we see on television.”

TEMPLE, Texas — Selfless service, a core Army value that is instilled in Soldiers from the minute they enter basic training and a theme that is heard at a constant beat throughout the career of service members, doesn’t end after military service. Rep. John Carter (TX-31) was present to recognize 13 veterans from the Central Texas community for their dedication and continued selfless service during a ceremony awarding the Congressional Veteran Commendation Oct. 7 at Temple College.

“These heroes wore the uniform of our nation with pride and honor, while serving our country during challenging periods,” said Brig. Gen. William A. Ryan III, commander of 1st Army Division West and keynote speaker for the ceremony. “Following their military service, those we celebrate today put on the uniform of their community and continued to serve their fellow citizens in a different way; serving and leading in influential and important positions, resulting in stronger more resilient communities all while inspiring countless others to public service through their example.”

City of Killeen Mayor and 2023 Congressional Veteran Commendation recipient Debbie Nash-King shared that she truly enjoys serving the Central Texas community, though her inspiration for service came long before the Army.

“What inspires me most was growing up watching my grandmother serve in our community,” she said. “In my neighborhood we didn’t have things like sidewalks, and she fought for things like that. She was always an advocate. So, it was instilled in me through her, to serve others above self.”

As it turned out, service in the military only ignited a fire to emulate the example set by her grandmother.

Nash-King continued, “So, when I left military service, I was now equipped with these leadership skills, and the skills to work as a team and to solve problems and be solution oriented. Serving my community is just a part of who I am.”

Smiles and chests swelled with pride were a consistent sight as Carter presented awards. Each citation highlighted the continued mission these veterans embarked upon on behalf of the greater good not only for the veterans, active-duty service members and their families, but for the entire Central Texas community.

“Receiving a recognition like this means a lot,” said retired Sgt. 1st Class Steven Moore, chief of community relations for U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Cavazos Public Affairs Office and a 2023 Congressional Veteran Commendation recipient. “It means that my service and work is not in vain. It shows me that people, not only in our communities but at the highest levels, appreciate the efforts not only I but all these wonderful people put in day in and day out. No matter how big or small the service, it has effect, it is noticed and it is being recognized.”

For Nash-King, receiving the honor held something a bit more personal.

“Receiving this commendation is a bit emotional for me. My late husband was a recipient of this commendation,” she said. “To be a part of that legacy and be the face and representative for the city of Killeen and the community as a woman vetaran with my own story and to be found worthy of this prestigious recognition by Congressman Carter and the people of this community, it is a tremendous honor.”

Carter agreed.

“And this is why we’re here,” Carter said in closing, “to honor the service after service. It is what is instilled in the thought process of our warriors. You never stop serving.”"

LATHAM, N.Y. — Forty-eight New York Army National Guard Soldiers are heading to Brazil Oct. 28-29, 2023, to exercise with Brazil’s 52nd Jungle Infantry Battalion and U.S. Army Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault).

Exercise Southern Vanguard 24’s main action will occur near Macapa in the Amazon Delta, according to 1st Lt. Elliot Zalewski, a project planning officer for the New York National Guard.

Zalewski said the Brazilian battalion, and an infantry company and other Soldiers from the 101st will conduct tactical exercises in the Amazon rainforest.

The exercise will enable the New York National Guard to continue to develop its relationship with Brazil under the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program, according to Army Brig. Gen. Isabel Smith, the New York National Guard’s director of joint staff.

“The exercise will continue to expand and increase interoperability between the New York National Guard and Brazil,” Smith said. “We look forward to continuing knowledge sharing and relationship building with our Brazilian partners.”

The New York National Guard and Brazil’s military initialed a State Partnership Program agreement in 2019.

Southern Vanguard exercises are organized by U.S. Army South and pair U.S. Army elements with those of South American militaries.

Exercise Southern Vanguard 23, for example, took place in Colombia with members of the Georgia and Illinois Army National Guard.

The New York National Guard Soldiers will come from:

The 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment, based at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan

The 1st Battalion, 258th Field Artillery, with current headquarters at Camp Smith Training Site near Peekskill

The 133rd Composite Supply Company, based at Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn

The 466th Medical Company (Area Support) from Queensbury

The 138th Public Affairs Detachment from Camp Smith Training Site

The New York Air National Guard’s 105th Airlift Wing will fly the Soldiers to and from Brazil on a C-17 Globemaster III transport.

The 466th Medical Company will provide medical services during the exercise and the 138th Public Affairs Detachment will conduct public affairs operations.

The 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment, whose Soldiers are trained to interact with other nation’s military forces, will work with the Brazilian battalion’s operations section.

The field artillery Soldiers and the Brazilians will work on coordinating fire support missions.

Thirty-eight New York Army National Guard Soldiers will attend a three-day jungle survival course alongside members of the 101st Airborne Division outside Belem.

Zalewski said Soldiers from the 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment would not participate in the course because of their duties as headquarters staff.

Since entering into the State Partnership with Brazil, the New York Air National Guard has sent aircraft and personnel to participate in Brazilian exercises, and Air Guard personnel specializing in space operations have worked with their Brazilian counterparts.

New York Soldiers and Airmen have attended the Brazil Jungle Warfare School, and New York Army Guard Soldiers took part in Brazil’s Operation Parana, an international military domestic response exercise in May.

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. – The 39th Annual Army 10-Miler, held October 8, 2023 in Washington D.C., annually attracts more than 35 thousand runners and 900 teams from around the world.

U.S. Army Reserve Master Sgt. Laroy Warren, G-1 Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge, IPPS-A Liaison, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, was in the pack competing in his first Army 10-Miler.

“At the starting line, they had runners broken down into waves. It was a lot of people. The atmosphere was inspiring. There were all levels of fitness, whether it was walk run or run,” Warren said. “Each wave may have had five thousand runners.”

Each wave was released roughly eight minutes apart, followed by another wave. During the race, Warren maintained a nine minute per mile pace and finished in one hour and 35 minutes while encountering trouble at mile four.

“I sprained my ankle near the water stop. I stepped into a pothole. For six miles I was in pain, but I knew if I stopped, the swelling would have intensified,” said Warren. “I stopped thinking about the pain and continued the same pace. I wasn’t looking for an excuse to stop. I just kept pushing through.”

Despite the pain, the veteran Soldier, with 24 years of Army Reserve service, said he found plenty of enjoyable moments along the route.

“My favorite parts of the course were running past the Washington Monument, running through a viaduct where the light changed from sunny to dark, and during the turnaround where you get to interact with other runners by giving each other a high five or yelling words of encouragement,” said Warren.

Leading up to the Army 10-Miler, Warren ran numerous 5 Kilometer (3.1 mile) races for months.

“I was training to run 5Ks in 2022. I ran a total of 30 5K and 10K (6.2 mile) races from March to November. In 2023, I decided to step it up and run 10K races. I have run 35 races so far this year. I run every weekend. When the Army 10-Miler came around, I decided to get involved and go for it. I’m currently looking to participate in a half marathon,” said Warren.

However, it is an ironic situation for a Soldier who pursued running because he does not like to do it.

“The reason I run is because I don’t like running. If I make it fun, I kind of enjoy it,” said Warren. “The way you get better at something is you pick something you do not like to do and work on it and get better at it.”

He referenced a quote, from boxer Mike Tyson, that he keeps on his phone.

“Discipline is doing what you hate to do but, nonetheless, doing it like you like it,” said Warren.

Fitness and sports have always been a passion of Warren’s since he was a child.

“I played little league baseball. I swam in high school and played a lot of basketball. I’ve been an athlete all my life. I think I found my passion to be fitness,” said Warren. “If you love doing something, whether you get paid or not, I consider that a passion.”

He also conducts a free early morning fitness session for Soldiers and Army Civilians working to improve their fitness.

“I’ve been doing my morning fitness group for five years,” said Warren. “There are other Soldiers that need help with fitness, and it also helps me out. Just like I’m pushing them, sometimes they push me.”

Warren stated that he has advice for those thinking about running the Army 10-Miler in future years.

LAPU-LAPU, CEBU, Philippines — The Hawaii Army National Guard conducted its first rotary wing aviation maintenance and standardization subject matter expert exchange in the lively coastal city of Lapu-Lapu Sept. 25-29.

A contingent from Company C, 1st Battalion, 183rd Aviation Regiment, alongside personnel from Army Aviation Support Facility No. 2, engaged in the event with the Philippine Air Force (PAF) 205th Tactical Helicopter Wing (THW) at Brigadier General Benito N. Ebuen Air Base in Mactan.

“This is a great opportunity for us to learn from the experts and gain valuable knowledge,” Col. Moises Micor, 205th THW deputy wing commander, said during the opening ceremony.

The event established a robust framework for bilateral relations, fostering cooperation, collaboration and interoperability rooted in the shared use of rotary wing platforms.

“It’s truly an honor and a privilege to be a part of this inaugural subject matter expert rotary event between the PAF and the HIARNG,” said Col. Byron Cadiz, HIARNG aviation and safety director. “This year marks the 30th anniversary of the State Partnership Program. This year also celebrates its 23rd year of the state partnership between the Hawaii National Guard and the Philippines, one of the longest relationships in the United States Indo-Pacific Command.”

PAF counterparts were acquainted with the intricacies of the UH-60M platform, encouraging a comparative analysis with their existing standard operating procedures, technical training, and operational protocols for their Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk helicopter.

“The subjects covered by the HIARNG team spanned from sling load operations, mission planning, phase maintenance inspections, and corrosion control,” said Maj. Ryan Hong, aviation operations and training officer. “A great deal of time was dedicated to crafting a syllabus delving into salient touchpoints that mattered the most to the 205th THW, setting our sights on empowering the PAF with the means to achieve maximum utilization of the S-70i airframe.”

The classroom environment was the backdrop for comprehensive training and roundtable discussions about aviation maintenance and standardization.

“Our aviation team collaborated with the 205th THW, offering support, sharing ideas through training sessions and open discussions for domestic and combat operations,” said Capt. John Worthington, 183rd Aviation Regiment commander. “The aim was to teach and learn while forging a lasting partnership for mutual operational preparedness and readiness.”

Micor said the four-day event opened up opportunities for pilots and maintenance crews and allowed greater interaction and exchanges between forces.

“I hope the connections and the relationships forged during this subject matter exchange will continue to grow and strengthen in the future,” Micor said.

The Philippines is the oldest treaty ally of the United States in the Indo-Pacific Command, with the Hawaii National Guard playing a vital role as a partner.

WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense conducts more than 40 army-to-army joint multinational exercises annually in the Indo-Pacific to increase integrated deterrence.

Allied partners and U.S. Army Pacific leaders spoke about the importance these exercises play in readiness and how landpower affects the region during a panel discussion at the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C. last week.

""I believe that the security architecture that binds this region together is landpower,” said Gen. Charles Flynn, U.S. Army Pacific commanding general. “The armies [in the area] play a central role in territorial defense and protecting their national sovereignty.”

Allies and partner nations are moving toward multilateral and multinational operations because of the challenges they are facing from the People’s Republic of China, Flynn said.

""This is a very serious threat that is facing the region,” he added. “We have to do everything we can as a nation to get into the right place with the right capabilities in support of our allies and partners as a counterweight and as a method of deterring war.”

U.S. Army Pacific is tackling these challenges by implementing the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center, utilizing Operation Pathways, and building joint interior lines.

The readiness center was established three years ago to provide realistic training opportunities to U.S. service members and partner nations in the region. It’s the first new combat training center outside the continental U.S. in 50 years.

Each year, the center executes three training rotations, one in the terrains of the Hawaiian Islands, one in Alaska’s extreme cold weather, and one at a satellite location.

The deployable version was used in Indonesia in 2021-2022 before making its way to Talisman Sabre 23 for a one-of-a-kind collaboration with the Australian Combat Training Center.

""The region sees the value of what our combat training centers present, and they want to get that level of high-end training in their countries,"" Flynn said.

Through Operation Pathways, USARPAC strengthens regional defense partnerships by training with allies and partners on numerous exercises including Talisman Sabre, Super Garuda Shield, Orient Shield and Yama Sakura.

U.S. Soldiers and Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members recently participated in Orient Shield 23, which aimed to improve bilateral targeting processes ahead of the large-scale Yama Sakura exercise in December.

""I believe Orient Shield and the Yama Sakura exercise are extremely important and a rare opportunity to improve our cross-domain and multi-domain operational collaboration,” said Lt. Gen. Kobayashi Hiroki, vice chief of staff, Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force.

USARPAC is building joint interior lines through protection, sustainment and command and control.

“The joint interior lines are us building forward positions to create enduring advantage, to create operational reach and to build operational endurance for the joint force,” Flynn said.

The protection piece comes through counter-unmanned aerial systems, engineering and medical, as well as short-, medium- and long-range air defense.

For sustainment, the Army is building distribution centers and using Operation Pathways to test the deployment of pre-position stocks of equipment throughout the Pacific.

Talisman Sabre 23 tested those lines during joint petroleum over-the-shore and joint logistics over-the-shore operations.

Joint petroleum over-the-shore simulated the transfer of fuel pumped from an offshore vessel to inland distribution points used for operations. The joint logistics over-the-shore tested the discharge of vehicles and equipment from sea to shore in harsh environments.

“What those joint interior lines are doing, along with Operation Pathways, and along with training in the region, is to take time and space away from [China], to deny them terrain, and to keep our physical presence forward with hard power to deter a war from happening,” Flynn explained.

These efforts combined with the establishment of two multi-domain task forces in the region give the Army scalable, survivable and maneuverable land forces that create multiple challenges for the enemy across all domains, he added.

“The goal is no war,” Flynn said. “Landpower’s contribution to the joint force is to prevent that from happening.”

WASHINGTON — The Army will build a new blue book and blue book app to reinforce standards and discipline across the service, the Army’s top enlisted leader said.

The Army Software Factory in Austin, Texas leads the initiative, scheduled to release by October 2024.

The app will contain the non-commissioned officer and Soldier creeds and feature a set of standards that will remain uniform across the Army including leadership responsibilities. A digital library in the app will link to other service publications and units can add their own unique history.

The new blue book mobile app will eventually be able to provide instant updates and alerts when the Army passes a new regulation. Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer said that adopting clear, service-wide reference, like the new blue book, will be critical in future conflicts.

“You can’t build standards and discipline in a time of crisis,” Weimer said during his initiatives briefing at the Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington Wednesday. “If we’re really going to be truly ready for large-scale combat operations, we have to have those standards and discipline before we get called upon for that.”

Army Training and Doctrine Command Sgt. Maj. Raymond Harris will form an operational planning team to seek Soldier feedback to help create the app across the three service components, Active Duty, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard.

The Army created the blue book as a guide for all Soldiers for standards, discipline and culture. Soldiers will receive the document upon entering Basic Combat Training. The book establishes Army ethics early in a Soldier’s career to introduce new troops to the Army’s culture and form their moral core.

Weimer said the responsibility of enforcing the Army’s standards remains with its NCO corps.

“The foundational document will be the same for all of us, period,” Weimer said. “You still have to lead and still have to have the personal courage to live the standard and enforce the standard.”

Concerns over the erosion of discipline and adherence to service regulations grew during the coronavirus pandemic when many Soldiers teleworked from home for the first time.

“I think COVID really highlighted an issue with standards and discipline,” Weimer said.

Weimer said that Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy A. George’s transition team held more than 500 conversations with division commanders and division sergeants major, and the most frequent topic was standards and discipline.

Harris said Soldiers have had some questions about the clarity of current Army standards and their interpretation. He said that the new blue book will provide needed specificity.

“We’re going to remove some of that ambiguity, so you leaders and Soldiers feel empowered or are empowered to make that change and correction,” Harris said. “And you’re not afraid to do it.”

WASHINGTON — Between his full-time duties as a special operations non-commissioned officer, deployments and parental obligations, Sgt. Maj. Benjamin Buzek spent more than nine years earning his bachelor’s degree.

He then wanted to pursue a Master of Business Administration without pulling dual responsibilities as a Soldier. So Buzek devised a way for NCOs to attend The College of William and Mary Raymond A. Mason School of Business in Williamsburg, Virginia full time while still receiving active-duty pay.

The college offers a full-time MBA program for active-duty officers and veterans, but previously, there was no program for active-duty NCOs, Buzek said.

Two other NCOs have earned their MBA through the Buzek’s initiative since Buzek graduated from William and Mary in August 2022. Although the program has limited eligibility, Buzek now hopes to expand it to afford other Soldiers the same opportunity.

Buzek’s efforts earned him the 2023 Sgt. Maj. Larry L. Strickland Educational Leadership Award. Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer presented Buzek the award in a ceremony at the Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington Oct. 9.

Strickland, senior enlisted advisor to the Army deputy chief of staff for personnel, died in the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. The 29-year Army veteran strongly believed in Soldier education and professional development.

Buzek believes the changing nature of war requires Soldiers of all ranks to be better educated to make smarter decisions in combat.

“I think the times when officers were the only educated people that make decisions, that’s changed,” said Buzek, 40. “[On] today’s battlefield, the command team of officers and NCOs have to move at the speed of light because the enemy is moving that quickly.

“As the wars have ended, the best thing that you could have is experience,” he added. “The second best thing you could have is education. So, I think it’s incredibly important that our force is educated and that our NCOs get the time to go to school.”

Buzek said that he had to secure permission from his chain of command for successful enrollment in the program and to receive his full-time salary.

“I think great leaders don’t do things for themselves,” Buzek said. “They do things for people that they’re leading. This program that I’ve developed wasn’t just for me, it was for the next person.”

As a teen growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, he described himself as a “troublemaker.” After enlisting in the Army at 17 in 2000, he went on to have a successful 23-year career in special operations.

Master Sgt. Jacob Connor, NCO-in-charge of the 101st Airborne Division Public Affairs Office at Fort Campbell, Kentucky won the Sgt. Maj. Dawn Kilpatrick Memorial AUSA Scholarship Award for excellence in Public Affairs.

The award is given in honor of the late Kilpatrick served in Army public affairs from 1979 to 1999. She took roles as the editor of three Army publications and also acted as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Army. She died of cervical cancer eight days after her retirement from the Army in 1999.

Connor, a 16-year veteran who started his career as a cavalry scout, credited his fellow staff members for winning the award.

“My shop stands out because of the teamwork; the team that we built, the camaraderie that we have,” Connor said.

WASHINGTON — The Army becoming a data-centric, technology-driven service is one of the Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth’s top objectives.

During her keynote speech to kick off the 2023 Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C., she spoke about the importance this plays in fielding the Army of 2030.

“We must continue to embrace innovation and transformation or risk failing to address future threats,” she said. “In close partnership with industry, the Army has pressed ahead and stayed on track to implement our most ambitious modernization effort in 40 years. With the introduction of each new system, we continue to increase our force’s capability to respond to various threats and serve as a credible deterrent to our adversaries.”

To expedite changing the Army and its business and operating model to leverage data strategically, the service created the Digital Transformation Strategy in 2021.

This outlines three key areas the Army must improve to leverage innovative and transformative technologies: modernization and readiness, optimized digital investments, and a technically savvy, operationally effective digital workforce.

In the last two years, the Army has been laying the foundation of the strategy by implementing the right policy, guidance and resourcing so it can quickly integrate technologies in the future.

“I think that is a big piece of where we are moving right now, and as you look at the next couple years, it really is about maturing that foundation,” Army Chief of Information Leonel Garciga said during an AUSA panel this week. “I don’t care how good an algorithm is. If you don’t trust the platform, or you don’t trust the network, do you trust the output of that algorithm? I think the answer is no.”

One of the key foundational pieces is making sure that the data being collected is properly labeled across the entire Department of Defense. This will allow the systems to communicate and scale quickly.

“We’ve got to ensure across all the functional communities in the Army, we have a common way of tagging, governing and ensuring that the data is accurate,” said Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo, who serves as the Army’s chief operating and management officer. “Once we do that, then I think we’ll be able to really start humming.”

The Army is taking an enterprise approach to change and transform faster. It is working on a more unified and coherent network. It’s changing how it trains Soldiers to use and interact with emerging technologies. It’s also adopting industry best practices for software development and updating its acquisition policy.

“In order for us to succeed, the challenges aren’t really technical because industry has most of this stuff already figured out,” Camarillo said. “The real question is how quickly can we adopt and change our processes to make the most advantageous use of capabilities that are already in the market.”

All this work is being done to give commanders and Soldiers on the battlefield the timely information they need to make informed decisions.

“So much of what we do involves software, involves data, it’s going to impact the entire range and spectrum of military operations in the future,” Camarillo said. “For us to maintain [our technological] advantage, we absolutely, as an imperative, have to get this right.”

WASHINGTON — Hundreds of Soldiers and Family members participated in a Family forum on quality-of-life concerns with Army senior leaders during the last day of the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C.

The participants voiced their concerns on a wide range of topics including health care, spouse employment, education, and barracks and housing issues.

“I know that we have a lot of work to do,” said Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth. “We are an enormous organization with an enormous inventory of housing and barracks. We know there is always continuing work to do, but I think we’ve done a lot in the last few years to make sure we are supporting our Soldiers and Families.”

Child Development Centers

The Army is putting an emphasis on expanding its number of child development centers, Wormuth said. The service built six new centers and has at least five more on the way.

The Army is also looking to increase staff at CDCs by increasing wages and providing incentives. The Department of Defense recently adjusted how much service members pay for child care at CDCs for the current school year.

“I know child care is a huge issue,” she said. “For me, as a mom, that was one of the hardest things when my kids were young.”

New Installation App

When Soldiers and Families move to new installations, one of the biggest challenges they face is finding the right resources for the information they need, said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George.

To alleviate the problem, the Army Software Factory is working on a mobile application that will bring information into one place. The team is currently reaching out to Soldiers and Families for ways to tailor the “My Army Post” application for use across the service.

“We are going to make this happen, and we want your feedback on what else you need,” George said. “I think this is important. We have a lot of resources in the Army, and we want to provide them.”

Spouse Employment

The Army is working on a number of initiatives to increase spouse employment. One example is that military spouses and dependents stationed in Italy can now telework for American companies. This is a big win, Wormuth said.

The Army is looking at increasing direct hiring opportunities for spouses. They are also working to ensure states follow the recently passed Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act that recognizes service member and spouses’ valid professional licenses when they move to another state.

Barracks and Housing

The Army is the service with the largest number of barracks. It spends more than $1 billion annually and has a maintenance backlog of $6.5 billion to bring the quality of barracks up to standard.

“That’s going to take some time, but we are making progress,” Wormuth said. “The chief of staff of the Army and the sergeant major of the Army and I are working to increase the amount we are spending on military construction for barracks.”

Army leadership is working to provide 100% sustainment funding for barracks and to spend more on renovation and construction, Wormuth added.

There is a barracks summit scheduled for the end of October to discuss improvements.

“We are doing a lot in that area to really try to make sure that our Soldiers are living in the kind of accommodations that they deserve to live in,” she added. “Be patient with us.”

As the forum ended, leadership reiterated the importance of these quality-of-life issues for Soldiers and their Families.

“We just want you to leave here today knowing that none of these concerns surprised us,” said Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Weimer. “We absolutely know they’re important. We absolutely know these are priorities, and we are taking a look at each and every one of them.”

176,Army command works to engage with African partners,https://www.army.mil/article/270749/army_command_works_to_engage_with_african_partners,"Army Maj. Gen. Todd Wasmund, commander of U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa, and Ghana’s military leadership share a lighthearted moment following the culminating exercise at African Lion 2023 near Daboya, Ghana, June 13, 2023.

ARLINGTON, Va. — Africa is a continent of potential and service members at the Southern European Task Force, Africa, work every day to help African partners turn that potential into reality, said Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, commander of the unit based in Vicenza, Italy.

“We are responsible for all of the Army’s operations, activities and investments in support of U.S. Africa Command,” Wasmund said Oct. 11.

Africa is the second largest continent, with more than 50 nations and hundreds of languages. Tens of millions of people live in poverty even as the resources exist to lift up populations.

The African continent contains more ungoverned, under-governed or misgoverned areas, which attract extremist groups like Boko Haram, al-Shabaab, al-Qaida and the like, according to Defense Department officials.

It’s also a continent with little infrastructure and many natural disasters.

SETAF-AF — as the task force is abbreviated — provides a scalable crisis response option to the commander of U.S. Africa Command.

“It is scalable from a platoon all the way to a two-star joint task force headquarters,” Wasmund said.

The command had to do that recently following the coup in Niger. The task force quickly stood up and managed the U.S. forces in Niger. There are about 1,000 U.S. service members in the country, with a small footprint in the capital of Niamey and the most at an airfield in Agadez. The command provides the facilities for the Air Force and Special Operations Command — Africa, which had the counterterrorism mission.

The State Department said the July 26 deposition of the elected president was a coup, which limits the aid the command may provide to Niger. Restrictions under section 7008 of the State Department’s annual appropriations dictate what the United States can provide to Niger in foreign assistance, military training and equipment.

”With the announcement yesterday of the 7008 status for Niger, there will be some things that are suspended,” Waslund said. “They do require a little bit more scrutiny of how we might provide some of that partner support. That’s not something we can continue without further policy decisions.”

The general said the command will continue to maintain communications as the State Department establishes with the Nigerien junta a path to reestablish constitutional government.

Overall, the command’s operational activities include security cooperation, exercises, key leader engagements, medical readiness exercises, and other engagements.

The command also provides crisis response, including a noncombatant evacuation operation from Sudan earlier this year.

While West Africa is a focus for the command — it is the most populated portion area — it engages across the continent. The biggest exercise each year is African Lion, hosted by Morocco and SETAF-AF. It brings together nations from the continent and Europe to train together. The command also sponsors a yearly African Land Forces Symposium, giving military leaders the chance to meet and exchange ideas.

SETAF-AF and U.S. Africa Command help partner militaries as many of them mount counterterrorism efforts. U.S. service members help train partner militaries. The Africans train with U.S. Army security force assistance brigades and civil affairs teams. U.S. military personnel participate in medical readiness exercises and more.

“We have a lot to offer, but we are careful about their capacity so that we don’t overwhelm them,” the general said.

The command works closely with the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program. Wasmund called the program “brilliant” and a true force multiplier. The program, which pairs state National Guard units with nations, began in 1993 and started in Africa 20 years ago. The first two partnerships in Africa were Morocco-Utah and South Africa-New York.

“These Soldiers grew up together,” the general said. “That gives us this depth of relationship, [and] continuity. What we’re doing is ensuring everything ... we do with the African partner is synchronized and complementary.”

VICENZA, Italy – U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, commanding general of U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), said goodbye to a close friend and colleague, Italian Army Col. Michele Biasiutti, Caserma Del Din base commander and SETAF-AF deputy chief of staff - Italy, Sept. 8, 2023.

At an awards ceremony, Biasiutti received a plaque from Wasmund, thanking him for his service and dedication to SETAF-AF.

Biasiutti served in the position since Jan. 2020, and relinquishes his post to incoming Italian Army Col. Michele Amendolagine, who currently serves as the Italian base commander for Caserma Ederle in Vicenza.

“I served with a total of three [U.S. Army] generals during my time at SETAF-AF,” said Biasiutti. “Of course, everyone has their own personality, but there’s a common professionalism within each of these leaders.”

He shared how the source of this leadership must be traced back to the professional development and education the American military provides to its soldiers.

As the Italian deputy chief of staff for SETAF-AF, Biasiutti supported all training and operations for U.S. deployments and redeployments on Italian soil. His team ensured that all Italian rules were followed while Americans lived and operated on Italian bases and training areas.

His work also helped forge lasting partnerships between U.S. and Italian forces.

He regularly facilitated engagements between SETAF-AF leadership and the Italian Army, as well as local civilian and regional authorities.

""Working with my close friend Col. Michele Biasiutti over the last three years was a pleasure,” said U.S. Army Col. Keith McKinley, who recently retired as SETAF-AF’s chief of staff. “Michele contributed directly in enhancing the great military-to-military relationship between the command and our Italian hosts.""

Biasiutti’s position at SETAF-AF was not his first exposure to working alongside American service members.

Previously, Biasiutti deployed to several countries including Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Balkans, Kosovo, as well as Afghanistan where he served as the executive officer to the deputy chief of staff for operation Resolute Support headquarters. In this last assignment, Biasiutti worked under U.S. Army Gen. Scott Miller, commander of U.S. and NATO forces, during operation Resolute Support.

“Gen. Miller personified how a great leader can maximize and magnify the strengths of those around him, leading different services and diverse professionals to unified objectives,” said Biasiutti.

Biasiutti looks forward to his next assignment as he takes command of an Italian Alpini unit in Bolzano, Italy. Donning his distinctive peaked Alpini cap, adorned with a white feather, the new assignment marks a return to his mountain combat roots, he said.

“I am going back to my origins,” said Biasiutti. “I expect there will be challenges, but I will be equipped with the skill set developed over my career, enhanced by my experience working with SETAF-AF.”

WASHINGTON — Simplifying the way the Army trains and builds teams while continuously transforming the force are among the focus areas of the Army’s new Chief of Staff Gen. Randy A. George.

George said the Army must reduce the use of complicated, cumbersome technology while leveraging technology that cuts costs, including video game simulations that can lower spending on training formations. Using artificial intelligence, the Army can replicate realistic battlefield scenarios with less assistance from additional units.

The Army’s top uniformed leader said the nation’s largest military branch must find ways to continually transform, including developing methods to better access and process data while enabling machine learning and autonomy.

“We have to ruthlessly prioritize how we use time and resources,” George said during an Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition’s Eisenhower luncheon today. “Our days, dollars and decisions must be spent on building lethality and cohesive teams.”

George said the service’s top priority in transforming the force will be effective command and control as a foundation. In June, the Army discussed plans to transition to divisions as its unit of action to allow smaller units to maneuver and provide greater command and control capabilities.

The general recently visited the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Vilseck, Germany and praised the unit for its innovative command and control. The 2nd Cavalry’s regiment commander uses five Stryker armored vehicles digitally connected across the battlefield to exercise command and control.

“[The regimental commander] understands the challenges of large-scale combat operations and is adapting in real time to be more mobile, low signature and lethal,” George said.

George also said the Army can use simple, accessible technology such as a tablet to replace large operations centers.

“The world and warfare are changing rapidly,” George said. “We will stay ahead of our adversaries. And so, continuous transformation means iteratively adapting and evolving how we fight, how we organize, how we train, and how we equip.”

George said that he will place trust in Army leaders and commanders to decide how to invest in resources and find the means to build lethality.

The Army must remain ready when called to support operations worldwide. George cited the conflict in Ukraine as an example. Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Army deployed an armored brigade in Poland and paratroopers in the Baltic region to bolster the war effort.

George also announced plans to reduce excess and little-used equipment to help deliver combat-ready formations.

“Our leaders spend too much time laying out equipment and checking serial numbers,” George said. “I talked to a company commander in Europe who had a 118-page property book. That makes no sense.”

Gen. Andrew Poppas, Army Forces Command commander, and Army Materiel Command leader Gen. Charles Hamilton will lead a two-year effort to reduce the supply of excess equipment at two divisions by the end of 2023. In turn, the initiative will save Soldiers hours from managing excess materials, George added.

George said the Army will reduce time spent on vehicle maintenance across the force with “modest changes” to maintenance intervals in the service’s fleet of vehicles. The saved hours will give Soldiers more time to train and spend with families.

The war in Ukraine also revealed the need for greater reserve munition stocks. George said the establishment of a Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team earlier this year will help the Army create a more predictive maintenance model and leverage advanced manufacturing.

“We’ve learned so much from Ukraine’s experience and our experience supporting them,” George said. “We are going to adapt and change.”

During the next iteration of Project Convergence in spring 2024, the service will focus on establishing “kill webs” across the joint and combined teams with partner nations. Kill webs provide decision aides for commanders to quickly outline and identify tasking and re-tasking options on the battlefield.

George said the service’s efforts to modernize and innovate paints a positive portrayal of Soldiers to the American people. He said Americans see Army leaders who demand excellence and hold Soldiers accountable.

“This is critically important because the character of war is changing,” George said. “It is changing rapidly because disruptive technology is fundamentally altering how humans interact.”

WASHINGTON — Gen. Randy A. George, Army chief of staff, detailed five areas that Army Recruiting Command will revamp during the Be All You Can Be Symposium at the Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington D.C. Oct. 9.

The Army will shift how it prospects for recruits, transform its recruiting workforce, realign the recruiting command structure, create an experimentation capability within the recruiting command, and use evidence-based recruiting. It already revamped its slogan, “Be All You Can Be” in March.

George said recruiting has changed drastically since he joined the Army 42 years ago, when “Be All You Can Be” was also the Army slogan. He was trying to figure out how to get money to go to college. He talked to a Korean War veteran who told him he should join the Army.

“It was the best thing I ever did,” George said. “He was very successful in my very small, local community and had a big impact on me.

“When I first came in, I went over to the National Guard armory; got into a van; drove down to Des Moines, Iowa; took the ASVAB test; [and] got to stay in a hotel,” George said. “The next day, I did the medical piece, and by noon I was calling my mom to let her know I was signing up. It was that quick. It’s different now.”

He said he went out and talked to troops around the world to learn from the boots on the ground.

“We’re retaining great Soldiers; they love being in the Army. They love the people and the mission. They’re making lifelong friends and being fulfilled by what they do by being in the military,” he said. “Now we just need to look at how we need to recruit a little differently in today’s day and age.”

Changing how the Army prospects

Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, commanding general of the Army Recruiting Command, trains and leads more than 8,000 recruiters worldwide.

Recruiters are prospecting in a competitive environment with shifting generational and workforce preferences.

George said the Army may need to target recruits from the labor force who are going to work during the day and college in the evenings.

“They still think of the Army as only infantry, armor and combat arms when we have a gamut of critical career fields, George said. “I don’t know if many in the labor force and those in school understand what we truly do for this nation.”

“The high school markets make up a large portion of our enlisted force but with that number shrinking, we need to expand into the labor market,” Davis said.

He said he talks to non-military people like his delivery drivers as much as possible.

“I ask them to educate me. I’ve been in the uniform for so many years. I just want to understand from their perspective,” he said. “They’re very supportive. They trust the military. But they don’t relate to the Army.”

Transforming the Army’s recruiting workforce

The Army developed its recruiting workforce reforms after conducting a 90-day quantitative and qualitative analysis of two million contracts, 1.5 million accessions and 70,000 recruiters since 1998.

“We’re picking the right people, training them and keeping them, and not rotating them all the time so they can interact in their communities,” George said. “They will have language skills, know the area, know the people, continue to progress, know the environment and can be more effective.”

The change will result in a new military occupational specialty, 42T, talent acquisition specialist.

“This whole rollout, it has been on all of our minds every single hour as we look at transforming. This is potentially the biggest change ever to occur in the United States Army Recruiting Command’s history,” Davis said.

Davis grew up hearing war stories from his grandfather, who served in World War II.

“He spent a lot of time sharing his Army story with me,” Davis said. “He was very inspiring to the whole family.”

He hopes to carry on that inspiration to his team of recruiters as they create this new career field.

Davis touts the Soldier referral and recruiter performance incentive programs as successes because they were recommended by recruiters on the ground.

“When [they see] that investment in them, then there’s this surge of energy to get out there and do more in terms of our prospecting, processing and future Soldier management,” Davis said. “Listening to these recruiters and acting on their recommendations, that’s what I’m doing; it’s driving this positive resurgence across the recruiting force.”

Realigning the recruiting command structure

George said that marketing and recruiting will be consolidated and realigned into a three-star command directly reporting to him and the secretary of the Army.

“The tenure will be for four years. I’m going to be personally involved to help drive and make sure we’re getting after the change that we need,” he said.

“This synergy with the brand rollout has been able to help us align our marketing with the needs of our recruiters,” Davis said. “We’re starting to see all of our efforts from marketing, our retraining, what we’ve done to invest in our recruiters and then educating them on this brand.

Creating an experimentation capability within recruiting command

The Army will have an experimentation team, comprised of recruiters supported by experts in information management, data management, survey design, labor market analysis, marketing, operations and procurement.

Recruiters will be able to use technology to analyze the job market, what is and what isn’t working, and use technology in recruiting efforts.

“Most of the great ideas come from the people who are actually doing the mission,” George said. “We need to empower the people who are out there innovating for the Army.”

“Everything we’ve done in this command is from the feedback provided by these recruiters. It’s allowed us to really move resources and invest in their needs. We’re all interdependent,” George said.

Using evidence-based recruiting

George said the Army needs to improve the formal measurement and evaluation of recruiting policy decisions to better determine return on investment and more effectively allocate resources.

“We need to do a better job in the Army of understanding what’s working and what isn’t,” he said. We need to know what’s working in our marketing, how effective is it if you give someone a bonus, [and] what is the sensitivity analysis.”

Some people join the Army to be assigned to specific locations or for specific career fields, George said.

“We need to study that and make sure we have the analytics behind it as we move forward. There’s no more important topic in our Army right now.”

“Our responsibility to the Army is to be experts in warfighting and to be prepared to defend our nation,” George added. “We need the right people inside the Army. People have always been the strength of our Army.”

Rebranding the Army

In March, the Army rolled out the “Be All You Can Be” brand to address a younger generation.

Brian Griepentrog, executive vice president, Fors Marsh Group, leads a team of more than 60 scientists who conduct research for the Army with a focus on recruiting, market and advertising research, vocational choice, personnel selection, training and youth demographics.

His team conducted years of research with young adults and veterans about the perceptions of the Army and Army service. They used the concepts of possibilities, purpose, passion, communities and connection to find out what slogan participants liked best for the Army.

“Across all of these stakeholders, in a number of criteria, when asked if it would be a strong representative of purpose, passion, communities and connection, that was the winning candidate, so that’s why we’re now represented with Be All You Can Be,” Griepentrop said.

Lt. Gen. Douglas Stitt, deputy chief of staff G-1, joined the Army 33 years ago when the slogan was “Be All You Can Be.”

“My father encouraged me to be a part of something bigger than myself. I started out thinking about the mission but fell in love with the people I served with,” he said. “I’d do this job for free. I’d sign up the day after I retire.”

Whether it’s revamping the slogan, prospecting the workforce, transforming the recruiting command structure and workforce, creating experimentation capabilities, or using evidence-based recruiting, the Army is seeking Soldiers for the 21st century.

WASHINGTON — With the Georgia heat bearing down on them, Sgt. Jake Phillips and members of 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, struggled to finish the final leg of the 2023 Army Best Squad Competition’s first phase in September.

Still, the Soldiers had confidence in one another as they carried 35-pound rucks for 15 miles in the woods of Fort Stewart, Georgia. The Soldiers operated on only two hours of sleep and endured food deprivation. Fortunately, the squad boasted some of the most physically-fit Soldiers in the Army including Spc. Chancellor McGuire, who had the highest physical training test scores among all 60 competitors.

They had also competed and trained together for at least three years and some members even deployed together. Knowing his team’s robust fitness levels, Phillips wanted to push his squad to its limits.

The fire team leader learned that slowing their speed during the march actually helped his squad find the endurance needed to secure victory.

“I was always wanting to push the pace past what I think we’re capable of as a squad,” said Phillips, 25. “I was wanting to put more gas when it should have been more brakes. That was personally more challenging.”

Phillips’ guidance helped his 75th Ranger Regiment, U.S. Army Special Operations Command squad win the 2023 U.S. Army Best Squad of the Year award. Phillips, a native of West Chester, Pennsylvania, took Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year honors. McGuire, who hails from Austin, Texas, won Soldier of the Year.

“I think the key for us to win was we’ve all been working together for years,” Philips said. “We all know each other pretty well.”

Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael R. Weimer presented the awards in a ceremony at the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C. today. Soldiers from Army Medical Command finished in second place while the Army Pacific Command squad took third.

McGuire said keeping the goal in sight helped his squad weather through the endurance march.

“It was the last day of the competition. You can do anything for however long you tell yourself you can,” he said.

The 24-year-old McGuire credited his squad leaders and company commanders with helping mold him into a more capable special operations Soldier.

“It means I’m doing something right,” McGuire said of winning Soldier of the Year. “I took a lot from my team leaders coming up, my squad leaders. I took in everything that they have taught me … I’ve kind of become a sponge, so really I’m an image of them.”

The Army revamped its former Best Warrior contest two years ago into the Best Squad Competition to encourage a greater focus on team building and unit cohesion.

This year’s contest, executed by 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, featured another incentive. While competing, the participants could simultaneously earn their special skills certifications: the Expert Infantry Badge, awarded to Soldiers in infantry and Special Forces units; the Expert Soldier Badge, given to Soldiers who are not in infantry, Special Forces and medical branches; or the Expert Field Medical Badges, earned by outstanding medical technicians.

Twelve, five-person squads competed in the first phase of the competition during 10 grueling days at Fort Stewart.

The Soldiers went on ruck marches, completed exercises and did battle drills across more than 200,000 acres of land. The Soldiers engaged in land navigation, operated in urban areas and rucked from each destination. They learned to operate while sleep-deprived, while also taking part in night exercises.

During the competition’s final phase, the competitors travelled to Washington D.C. to be interviewed and evaluated by senior leaders.

McGuire said that his squad, which also includes Staff Sgt. Andrew Ewing, Spc. George Mascharka, and Spc. Shane Moon, finished first because of the bonds that the Soldiers share during and outside of duty. The Soldiers know each other’s families. They work out together and spend time studying in coffee shops.

The USASOC Soldiers faced stiff competition, particularly from the MEDCOM squad of Sgt. Jaime Padilla, Spc. Axxel Pasos, Sgt. 1st Class Kaleb Richardson, Spc. Robert Rupers and Christopher Trejo.

“My squad is the best squad,” said McGuire, a fire team leader. “We achieved something that we set our hearts and minds to, but at the end of the day we came out on top.”

WASHINGTON — Army leaders gathered at the 2023 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C. to discuss the service’s strategy as it starts the new fiscal year.

Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth spoke about the Army’s need to innovate and transform its modernization effort, force structure and recruiting.

“This is a crucial moment for the Army to summon our ingenuity,” she said. “To innovate and invest in emerging technologies; to test and develop in uncharted areas like artificial intelligence and contested domains like space and cyber; to reshape and transform the force to be more adaptable and flexible.”

In the past year, the Army has moved several systems into stages of advanced prototyping, production or fielding.

The Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office demonstrated the successful launch of a Tomahawk Land Attack Missile from the prototype Mid-Range Capability Weapon System in June. This followed the successful launch of a Standard Missile 6, or SM-6, from the system earlier in the year, confirming its full operational capability.

This system gives the Army the ability to strike enemy ships from land, a capability Wormuth said is well-suited for the Indo-Pacific.

One of the top modernization efforts for the Army is the development of long-range hypersonic capabilities. In February, the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force deployed the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon during Operation Thunderbolt Strike.

The Army is also working on emerging technologies including short-range air defense capabilities to defeat unmanned aircraft.

“As small unmanned systems increase in number and decrease in cost, we must have this capability to defend our formations against what will soon be the most common threats on the battlefield,” Wormuth explained.

Robotics is another area where the Army continues to research and develop new capabilities.

This year, the Army started fielding the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport to lighten the logistical load for infantry Soldiers. This paved the way for an even larger system the Army is prototyping, the Robotic Combat Vehicle designed to carry weapons, sensors and other robots.

The secretary also announced the Army is beginning a Human-Machine Integrated Formations Initiative to figure out how Soldiers and robots will work together on the battlefield. She said these integrated formations will bring robotic systems into units alongside Soldiers with the goal to have robots make first contact with the enemy.

“I see us embracing change, looking to the future, and becoming the more modern, more lethal, and more adaptive force we need to be,” she said. “As we pursue the most significant modernization effort in generations, we are building an Army that can dominate in large-scale multi-domain operations.”

Building this Army will require transforming the force structure to ensure the service has the capabilities it needs to meet current and future strategic requirements, she added.

As the force structure changes, so will Army recruiting. Last week, Army leadership detailed the change in who they recruit, how they recruit, and who will be recruiting.

The service is shifting its focus from high school seniors to the larger available workforce. It will also switch to permanent specialized recruiters by creating two new military occupational specialties.

“We have to innovate and transform in recruiting, but also in warfighting concepts and modernization, or risk irrelevance,” Wormuth said. “And the United States Army cannot and will not be irrelevant.”

AGADIR, Morocco — This past month marks the start of a new edition of the annual African Lion military exercises, a partner-led, U.S. enabled exercise executed across North and West Africa slated for next summer. This planning meeting, organized by the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) and the U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), hosted military planners from Ghana, Italy, the Netherlands, Senegal and the United Kingdom to begin detailed planning for Exercise African Lion 24, Sept. 18-22.

This year also marks the twentieth anniversary of the African Lion exercise series. What started as a bilateral exercise between the U.S. Marines and the Moroccan Army has grown every year to include three additional African host nations, multiple African and European partners and allies, and the entire U.S. joint and total force.

African Lion is U.S. Africa Command's premier, joint, annual exercise hosted by Morocco, Ghana, Senegal and Tunisia from May to June 2024. Annually, more than 10,000 participants from 20 nations and NATO train together with a focus on enhancing interoperability with African partner nation forces.

“We are incredibly excited to convene this exercise alongside our partners across Africa and Europe for this 20th anniversary of African Lion,” said Lt. Col. Drew Schaub, U.S. AFRICOM Joint and Combined Exercise branch chief. “While this partner-led, U.S. enabled exercise has changed and grown over the years, the commitment to improving security cooperation between African nations and communication among all our partners is unwavering.”

The week-long planning meeting aims to identify training scenarios, logistical requirements and training objectives for all participants for next summer's multinational exercise. Based on the complexity and scale of this exercise, planning begins months before execution.

The exercise is a joint, all-domain, multi-component and multinational training event, employing a full array of mission capabilities to strengthen interoperability among participants and set the theater for strategic access. The annual exercise provides unmatched opportunities for participation and cooperation on the African continent.

A key element of the growth of African Lion over the past several years has been the inclusion of other North and West African nations as hosts of the exercise. This year, Ghana, Senegal and Tunisia each host significant training events in their country, integrating U.S. units as well as other European and African partners into their training plans.

""As we have for the past three years, we are again ready to host African Lion in Ghana,"" said Ghana Army Brig. Gen. Frank Tei, deputy chief staff officer for operations and training, Army. “This exercise provides us the opportunity to work on a broad range of skills directly with the U.S. and our neighbors. We believe this coordination not only contributes to our security, but the broader security of our region.”

As a large-scale global exercise, African Lion demonstrates U.S. AFRICOM building and maintaining interoperability with our African and European partners to improve our ability to meet security-related challenges together. Over the next eight months, military and civilian planners will meet multiple times in each host nation to deliberately plan and refine the exercise.

VICENZA, Italy – The U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) will co-host a Warriors Corner presentation titled ‘State Partnership Program: Twenty Years of Making a Difference in Africa’ during the Association of the United States Army’s Annual Meeting and Exposition Oct. 9-11 in Washington, D.C.

The National Guard’s State Partnership Program has been successfully building relations for 30 years and now includes 88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe. There are currently 16 State Partnerships in Africa from 13 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

Gen. Daniel Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard, will introduce the National Guard’s SPP Program. Maj. Gen. Todd Wasmund, SETAF-AF Commanding General, will discuss the Army’s support U. S. Africa Command's campaign in Africa and where it interfaces with SPPs in Africa, before turning over to Maj. Gen. Alan Dohrmann, The Adjutant General for the North Dakota National Guard, state partner to Ghana, Benin and Togo to discuss his state’s individual partnership.

Lastly, Maj. Gen. Thomas Oppong-Peprah, Chief of Staff for the Ghana Army, will discuss partnering with both North Dakota and SETAF-AF.

The SPP evolved from a 1991 U.S. European Command decision to set up the Joint Contact Team Program in the Baltic Region with Reserve component Soldiers and Airmen. A subsequent National Guard Bureau proposal paired U.S. states with three nations emerging from the former Soviet Bloc and the SPP was born, becoming a key U.S. security cooperation tool, facilitating cooperation across all aspects of international civil-military affairs and encouraging people-to-people ties at the state level.

This cost-effective program is administered by the National Guard Bureau, guided by State Department foreign policy goals, and executed by the state adjutants general in support of combatant commander and U.S. Chief of Mission security cooperation objectives and Department of Defense policy goals.

Through SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-society relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic and social spheres.

The panel will be held Monday, Oct. 9 from 1430-1510 in the Army Exhibit in Exhibit Hall E at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The discussion will also be livestreamed on the SETAF-AF Facebook page and on DVIDS.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III paid a special visit to service members deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, during his first trip to Africa Sept. 24-25, 2023.

The Secretary addressed a small formation composed of Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines from various units reflecting the joint mission operating out of Camp Lemonnier.

“This command and this installation is the epitome of jointness. The work you do here with our Djiboutian partners and our other allies here is important,” Austin said. “I also know that because you’re here you’re away from home missing family, missing birthdays and anniversaries. So when you talk to your family tell them Lloyd Austin said ‘thank you’ not just for your service as the military members, but for their service as well.”

Before departing, Austin personally recognized several enlisted members for their superior performance while deployed. Among them was U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Craishod Norris, a Foreign Liaison Officer assigned to CJTF-HOA.

“It was an honor to meet Secretary Austin and the feeling of having someone at such an esteemed position in our chain of command take the time to congratulate service members like myself is indescribable.” said Norris. “I’m thankful to be recognized during such a special occasion, but our mission here at Camp Lemonnier is a team effort.”

Secretary Austin’s stop in Djibouti exemplifies the strategic importance of the U.S.-Djibouti partnership and is home to Camp Lemonnier, a critical military installation that serves as a linchpin in counterterrorism efforts and regional stability.

During his visit, Austin met with the President of Djibouti Ismail Omar Guelleh and the Minister of Defense Hassan Omar Mohamed Bourhan to discuss the security partnership between the two nations and shared priorities in the region. He also met with Somali President Hassan Mohamud and discussed the shared effort to counter al-Shabaab in the region.

From here Austin will continue his travels through the African continent later this week by traveling to Kenya and Angola to showcase the department’s appreciation for our African partners."

WASHINGTON — The Army will now provide incentives for more skilled, experienced civilians who join the Army Reserve.

The service recently expanded the number of certifiable, reserve career fields in the Army Civilian Acquired Skills Program from seven to 44.

Nearly 200 new Soldiers in Fiscal Year 2023 have enlisted or commissioned through the program, which has mutual benefits for both recruits and the Army.

Civilians with experience in jobs that range from musicians to human intelligence collectors, and orthopedic specialists to vehicle mechanics can take advantage of the program. Enlisted Soldiers who meet qualifications will be awarded the rank of specialist, or E-4, and bring needed skills into the force.

The Army in turn will spend less time training new Soldiers, who have already certified their skills through trade schools, professional certifications, academic degrees and time on the job.

“[ACASP] allows us to open a greater talent pipeline to the Army, giving more people an opportunity to join with those skills,” said Col. Fred Hockett, deputy commander for support, Army Recruiting Command. “[ACASP] makes it a little more attractive when people say I can use the skills I've already gotten in the civilian workforce in the Army.”

Hockett said the Army does not currently have plans to expand the number of active-duty career fields but may add more ACASP jobs as the service’s needs change.

Angie Holbrook, Army chief of military personnel, Accessions Division, said that the majority of the new ACASP recruits joined as in the military occupational specialties of42R/S musicians, 68W combat medic specialists and 88M truck drivers. About 80 Army band members enlisted through ACASP.

Holbrook said the program has given Army recruiters another tool to entice potential recruits as they compete for talent in a highly-contested job market.

“The expansion of seven MOS to 44 gives us a much broader range to bring in [Soldiers] who have those skills,” Hockett said.

Holbrook said the service expanded the program due to the success of the original seven reserve MOS and changing demographics. He added that the Army has recently seen more interest towards in intelligence, technology and vehicle maintenance. Coincidentally, Army leaders have targeted recruiting Soldiers in those fields.

“[ACASP] allows us to get people that are using recent, relevant technologies into the force,” Holbrook said. “I think it’s going to give us more depth because it takes a long time for the Army to field the new equipment or field new systems … These people are coming in straight away and being able to put those things into practice with the most recent technologies.”

Holbrook said that qualified applicants may also have the option of shorter service contracts because the Army saves time and funding on ACASP recruits’ training. ACASP not only gives Soldiers a head start on their careers, but it provides a cost-savings tool to bring skilled troops into the force.

“The Army realizes there’s some definite, emerging skills, talents and technologies that we want to be able to put into the force quicker,” Holbrook said. “[ACASP] is giving more opportunities to more people, but also it gives us those knowledge, skills and abilities faster.”

A Soldier who enlists as a track vehicle repairer with two years of training and experience in the repair and overhaul of engines, power trains and chassis components will only require three weeks of advanced individual training compared with 14 weeks for a normal recruit.

Other careers including firefighters, construction engineers, electricians and carpenters require two years of professional experience to receive an ACASP certification.

In some career fields such as combat medic, Soldiers already certified can also hasten the training process. Combat medics must re-certify their skills every two years, and ACASP recruits will already be familiar with the certification process.

Medics must attend a 16-week training program where they will not only learn emergency care but basic life support and in-patient and out-patient care. Through ACASP, a recruit can reduce that training time to 9 weeks.

New Army Spc. Adam Michael of Walterboro, South Carolina joined the Army through ACASP as an 88M Motor Transport operator because of his prior civilian experience working for J.B. Hunt, a motor transport services company.

The program specifically benefits recruits considering joining the National Guard or Army Reserve. Hockett said that qualified recruits can begin applying their skills immediately in their home states.

“There's a lot of overlap between those civilian skills that they've already gone to school and potentially paid for and the MOS-producing courses that we have in the Army Reserve,” Hockett said.

More than 80 leaders from 14 European countries met to discuss strengthening reciprocal fuel support during Defense Logistics Agency Energy Europe & Africa Fuels Exchange Agreements Forum in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Sept. 19-21.

For the 18th year, international partners met to learn more about the DLA Energy International Fuel Agreements program and explore increased partnership opportunities.

“The relationships we have built consistently show the world that we can stand united while supporting one another. This is especially true during the turbulent times being experienced in the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and on the African continent,” DLA Energy Commander Navy Capt. Brian Anderson said during his opening remarks. “Together, we continue to improve and grow this forum through the interchange of open discussion. We all have a lot to learn from each other.”

What started in 2005 with 34 representatives from eight countries talking about fuel support has grown to 80 representatives from 14 countries spending almost a week together networking, discussing capabilities and exploring enhanced interoperability. Representatives were from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Albania, Georgia, and NATO Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

For first-time attendees like Albania and Georgia, the forum provided an opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge of the U.S. fuel exchange agreements program. These agreements, which provide cross-servicing capabilities between partner nations and coalition forces worldwide, help manage fuel costs and optimize the supply chain.

“When a host nation partner with a DLA Energy international fuel agreement receives DLA Energy-owned fuel, the host nation partner pays the standard price DLA Energy charges U.S. military forces,” said Gerald R. Candelaria, DLA Energy Europe & Africa International Agreements chief.

As of July, DLA Energy has 40 fuel agreements with 23 countries around the world. Its International Fuel Agreements team synchronizes with regional DLA Energy offices to establish and maintain these long-term Defense Department fuel agreements with foreign militaries.

Lt. Col. Giorgi Maisuradze of the Georgian Defense Forces said the forum helped him better understand the Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreements process. ACSAs are the formal mechanisms that allow the DOD to acquire, and in some cases to provide, logistics support, supplies, and services directly with eligible countries and international organizations.

“It’s a very good event especially because we are conducting a lot of different exercises and activities with U.S. forces in Georgia,” he said. “This forum is really great for improving understanding of how the system works, especially ACSA and ACSA orders, and to eliminate some of the deficiencies we have in the process and better understand the procedures.”

Capt. Lampros Lampropoulos of the Hellenic Navy General Staff in Greece said the benefits are mutually beneficial.

“The collaboration between DLA and the Hellenic Navy is useful for both parties,” he said. “We are looking forward to improving future engagement.”

Maisuradze found value in meeting his counterparts in person.

“This conference has been great for sharing information and knowledge of other people, who is doing what,” he said. “This is perfect ground for finding people you’ve only met by email and to discuss issues face to face.”

Albania General Staff Lt. Col. Oliverta Dulo agreed.

“Through DLA, we have the opportunity to have fuel access for our troops when they go abroad for training exercises or other cases,” she said. “Now that I’ve been here, I now know the right process to follow and the right person to contact for help.”

Candelaria said his team works hard to maintain strong partnerships across Europe and help DLA Energy’s international partners understand the ASCA process and its benefits to all that participate.

“These fuel agreements are essential elements for U.S warfighters and partner nations not only during routine and emerging operations but in supporting international exercises around the world,” he said. “They help build supply chain efficiency, enhance interoperability with participating foreign militaries, and strengthen long-term collaboration with our partner nations.”

During the week, Italian, Spanish and British partners briefed participants on their fuel programs and experts discussed the Central Europe Pipeline System, Spanish Pipeline System, Turkish Pipeline Facility and Italian Pipeline. A DLA Finance team was also on site to explain invoicing and financial settlements.

“This forum provides a great opportunity to enhance partnerships, discuss worldwide capabilities and explore potential reciprocal fuel support, as well as a chance to reconcile fuel accounts between allies and partners,” said Army Lt. Col. Leslie Shipp, DLA Energy Europe & Africa commander.

DLA Energy Finance personnel presented a briefing, met one-on-one with international counterparts, and signed settlements totaling $80.4 million providing reimbursement to the Department of Defense Working Capital Fund.

Carl Petermann, a fuels management analyst for the U.S. European Command Joint Petroleum Office in Stuttgart, Germany, said the event was one of the best events he’s attended.

“Well done to the DLA Energy Europe & Africa team for putting on a first-class event,” he said. “I've been to a lot of conferences, forums and meetings over the years. However, I don't ever recall one being executed so well.”

The next forum is being planned for Sept. 17-19, 2024."

Each year, U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) engages in hundreds of theater security cooperation activities, events and exercises in Africa. These initiatives encompass a wide spectrum of training activities across various warfighting domains, reinforcing partner capabilities and fostering improved interoperability.

In order to assist with training activities and exercises, SETAF-AF Soldiers must maintain their own training and readiness. Soldiers permanently assigned to the unit are required to achieve qualification on an M-4 carbine, while those on temporary duty orders are expected to qualify on an M-17 pistol.

“The first things we look at before sending a Soldier to the continent is medical readiness, current with annual training and weapon qualification.” says Capt. Fernando Rubio, company commander of Intelligence and Sustainment Company, SETAF-AF.

SETAF-AF hosts ranges twice a year, specifically during the first and fourth quarters. This scheduling enables the unit to prioritize its support for executing theater security cooperation activities in Africa, including the largest multinational, joint, all-domain exercise conducted by U.S. Africa Command - African Lion.

“The operation tempo slows down during the first and fourth quarter of the year. That is the best time to be proactive with individual readiness and position us to be prepared for exercises such as African Lion and Justified Accord,” said Rubio.

SETAF-AF places emphasis on maintaining and improving Soldiers’ marksmanship by first refreshing their skills on the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST). The trainer is designed to simulate live weapon training and permit Soldiers more trigger time on a weapon, allowing them to increase confidence and familiarization once it is time to qualify their assigned weapon on the range.

“The EST helps Soldiers get comfortable with weapons they haven’t shot before and develop muscle memory…practice makes perfect!” states Sgt. 1st Class Erin Reagan, mobility and exercise non-commissioned officer with 79th Theater Sustainment Command assigned to SETAF-AF.

Soldiers are allocated one week to zero their weapons and refine their skills at the EST. Afterward, they have another week dedicated to qualify with their assigned weapons. Rubio said, “We make every effort to accommodate the schedules of Soldiers departing for and returning from diverse exercises in various parts of the world, including countries in Africa.”

The range is where Soldiers become familiar with their weapons, as the repetitive nature of firing live ammunition helps Soldiers develop muscle memory and fine-tune their marksmanship fundamental training. To qualify, Soldiers must shoot no less than twenty-three out of forty targets on the M-4 carbine, and twenty-one out of thirty on the M-17 pistol.

“You never know what’s going to happen, I can speak from experience. As soon as I graduated from AIT [Advanced Individual Training], I went to Iraq. The more you know about your weapon the better, if anything should happen, you can pick up that weapon and suppress fire,” continued Reagan.

Marksmanship is a fundamental aspect of readiness and embodies the Total Soldier Concept. It fosters weapon proficiency, reinforces safety protocols, and instills confidence in soldiers. Moreover, it contributes to SETAF-AF’s overarching mission in the continent of Africa. Africa is crucial for the security and stability of the United States, as well as for our allies and the global community. SETAF-AF cultivates partnerships with African nations through security cooperation, fostering strength through friendship and a steadfast, enduring commitment. The United States and our allies recognize the significance of Africa, and the U.S. Army is dedicated to promoting security and stability across the continent.

The Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) committee and members from the CJTF-HOA plans and policy section organized a three-day class in Djibouti City, Djibouti, Sept. 25-27.

The WPS level 100 class allowed students to engage in group discussions with their peers to focus on ways they can better integrate the WPS model and gender perspectives across management, development, and employment within the joint forces.

WPS focuses on teaching U.S. service members how to proactively integrate the needs and perspectives of women and empower them to participate in decision-making processes at all levels to influence international peace, security and prosperity. It also aims to work within both the ranks of the military and partner national defense and security sectors to protect the human rights of women and girls, especially during conflict and crisis.

U.S. Maj. Gen. Jami Shawley, CJTF-HOA commanding general, emphasized the importance WPS plays within the command, the African continent, and the military as a whole.

“If one woman is in the room, will she have a voice that has the power of every other voice,” said Shawley. “If not, use your voice, I promise you that for as long as you are here in my command, you will be supported and you will be listened to.”

As one of Shawley’s high-priority initiatives during her time at CJTF-HOA, the WPS has welcomed engagements with both Djiboutian and foreign partners to find ways to educate service members on gender perspective and how to promote equal representation of all voices.

Leading the WPS level 100 course was Denise Phillips, the CJTF-HOA WPS gender advisor, and her team. The intent of the level 100 course is to maximize the success and reach of WPS objectives and give the students the necessary resources they need to serve as Gender Focal Points within their command.

“Every human being deserves the right to feel secure within their ranks, within their jobs, and within their lives,” said Phillips. “The goal of this week’s course was to bring over 40 individuals from CJTF-HOA and spend the proper time to teach them how they can better implement the lessons they’ve learned in their sections and in their components back home.”

During the class, men and women from all branches of service and backgrounds learned practical lessons on how to make their workplace more secure and accepting of different gender perspectives. They also participated in moderated group discussions on problems they have seen in the commands they have served under and how they can solve these issues in their own ranks.

Among the 40 students in attendance was U.S. Army Capt. Ronald Lofano, Civil Affairs East Africa team leader. Lofano and his Civil Affairs team facilitate an English discussion group in Djibouti, teaching English pronunciation and grammar to Djiboutian citizens. A key aspect of his mission is to engage with the Djiboutian community, something he feels more prepared to do with the lessons he has learned from the 100 course.

“WPS impacts every facet of Civil Affairs operations,” said Lofano. “In our bi-weekly English discussion groups WPS plays an integral role in identifying and understanding the socio-economic and cultural experiences that impact women, children and men in vastly different ways.”

Another student, U.S. Army Col. Antionette Mulholland, CJTF-HOA logistics director, expressed the importance of looking inward and then

“In a lot of cases we’re so focused on trying to fix other countries when we need to look at ourselves first,” said Mullholland.“One of the most important things with WPS for me is to empower that next generation of female leaders. I see WPS as one of the key drivers of making sure that we fulfill the promises we’ve made to our young women and service members and that we will promote inclusion and equal opportunity within our ranks.”"

STUTTGART, Germany — General Randy A. George, Chief of Staff of the Army, addressed U.S. Africa Command Soldiers and personnel at Kelley Barracks on Thursday, September 28, 2023, to provide direction and inspiration for those serving within the combatant command.

""I want to thank each and every one of you for what you do,"" expressed George.

The Army Chief of Staff is currently in Europe providing guidance to Soldiers across various military installations. The theme of his tour includes key principles of military leadership, among them reputation, professionalism, and operational excellence.

""If you've got Soldiers on your staff or in your unit, it's imperative they are the absolute experts at their warfighting mission,"" stated George. ""Whatever your rank, the expectation is that you know your job.""

Articulating his expectations, George emphasized the importance of professionalism and expertise in contribution to a Soldier's reputation among peers and superiors.

On physical fitness, George highlighted the connection between fit Soldiers and operational efficiency and excellence. He emphasized the role of physical health in ensuring mental clarity, especially in the demanding context of military operations.

""Expect that you have to be athletes,"" said George. ""If you're more physically fit, you are better able to be a clear thinker.""

Acknowledging the significant role families play in supporting Soldiers, he stressed the importance of families as integral support systems, enhancing the morale and effectiveness of military personnel.

""My wife was in the military for a while,"" stated George. ""She was my classmate at West Point. My view is our families are combat multipliers.""

The 41st Army Chief of Staff also reiterated his ""Ready Army"" mnemonic, a foundational guide for leaders disseminated in August.

Concluding his address, George challenged the audience to empower peers and rising leaders in upholding professional standards despite hesitation.

""We have to push through that and make sure that we are getting after our standards. That's our profession. That's what a profession means."""

I'm glad that the regiment recognizes his leadership abilities. He deserves this award.""

Nominees for this award were judged on their duty performance, Soldier development, leader development, significant accomplishments, military and civilian education achievements, volunteerism, and overall impact on the MP Corps.

Smith’s recent contributions to the MP Corps included creating a leadership development program tailored for MP Soldiers within his brigade and developing a fitness program that increased his unit’s overall Army Combat Fitness Test first-time pass rate to approximately 90 percent.

""Smith always goes above and beyond for Soldiers. He always goes above and beyond in everything that he does, as a person and as an individual,” said Sergeant Maj. William Angelo, who previously served as the 290th MP BDE operations senior enlisted advisor, but now serves as the Readiness Training Academy’s senior enlisted advisor at the 83rd U.S. Army Reserve Readiness Training Center.

“It's a great honor to know him and serve with him, and just to be able to call him a friend. I am very appreciative the Army is recognizing what everyone else has already seen in him. He is just an all-around outstanding NCO.""

Dolsan, Somalia - U.S. military members from Kismayo, Somalia partnered with the Kenya Defence Forces and Somali National Army Danab Forces to bring medical supplies and treatment to a local village as part of a Medical Civic Action Program clinic, July 1, 2023, in Dolsan Village, Somalia.

The 91st Civil Affairs Battalion, Special Operations-Airborne, coordinated with the Mobile Surgical Response Team to provide medical care to the villagers as the KDF screened patients and distributed prescriptions for those who were ill. Members of the Somali National Army Danab Forces and Somali National Army provided security while the KDF and 91st Civil Affairs Battalion assisted patients.

“With the partner forces, we were able to administer medical supplies to the local population,” said U.S. Army Capt. Ben Coad, 91st Civil Affairs Battalion Civil Military Support Element-Somalia Team Lead. “It’s a great opportunity for the Kenya Defence Forces and the SNA Danab to work together and to bolster those partnerships.”

Operated by host nation partner forces in coordination with U.S. joint services, MEDCAPs serve as temporary field clinics to provide limited medical treatment to the local population. U.S. forces regularly engage in MEDCAPs to work alongside African partners and provide medical care to remote communities, bolstering trust and security within the region.

“We have come to promote the safety of the local populace,” said Maj. D. K. Mosbey, KDF commanding officer. “It’s about the promotion of security, justice and local authority to the federal government of Somalia, to include Jubaland. Today we met with the chief of this area and had an opportunity for a positive engagement.”

Over 250 men, women and children sought medical aid at the MEDCAP for conditions ranging from Dengue fever to urinary tract infections. Patients that required specialized treatment were referred to the medical facility on Kismayo where more advanced treatment options were available from the KDF.

“It goes a long way towards building confidence,” said Capt. B. C. Omondi, KDF physician. “It has been a pleasure working with the locals, as well as working with our partner forces (Somali National Army, Danab, U.S. forces).”"

WASHINGTON — To keep pace with a changing battlefield, Army leaders said the service must continually adapt while maintaining a robust exercise schedule and adjusting to a challenging recruiting landscape.

In addition, the Army’s new Chief of Staff, Gen. Randy A. George said the service must continually change the force, through strengthening deterrence capabilities and bolstering interoperability with other services and multinational partners.

“We’re trying to look at [warfighting] as continuous transformation,” George said during a Center for Strategic and International Studies land power discussion Sept. 19. “What we want to do is tie all the pieces together and make sure we’re doing this in a continuous fashion.”

The Army engaged in two of the largest multi-national exercises, Super Garuda Shield in September and Australia’s Talisman Sabre in July and August. Super Garuda Shield, which concluded Sept. 13 in Indonesia, fielded participation from 14 nations including first-time participants Australia, Singapore and Japan. The event included a combined arms, live-fire and amphibious and airborne exercises.

In August more than 3,000 Soldiers completed Pershing Strike 23, a mass mobilization exercise at Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois; Fort Riley, Kansas; Camp Atterbury-Muscatatuck, Indiana; Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort McCoy, Wisconsin and other locations.

Earlier this year, the Army announced the branch’s joint, multi-domain series of experiments, Project Convergence, will no longer be an annual event. Instead, the service will adopt a more steady set of exercises throughout the year in support of the experiments. The service expanded the complexity and scope of its exercise during both Project Convergence 22 and Talisman Sabre 23, which included 12 partner nations with exercises across five states and territories.

Talisman Sabre featured a joint, mass exercise where U.S. forces and allies protected an island chain from a hostile force. In PC 22, the Army used autonomous vehicles to simulate longer distances that U.S. forces could see in future wars.

For the first time, Project Convergence included participation from the United Kingdom, Australia and the U.S. Space Force in 2022. The Army will resume its fourth iteration of Project Convergence 4 in spring 2024.

“What we found is generating that complexity and learning all the lessons from the previous years, Project Convergence really needed to take more than 12 months,” Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth said Tuesday. “So, we are not doing this now on strictly an annual cycle. And that allows us to both learn fully from last year's experience and really build the set of experimentation cases for the next year so that we get the most out of it.”

George added that the Army could explore more cost-effective options including using 3D printing drones and loitering munitions.

The ongoing Ukraine conflict has led to a greater focus on contested logistics, Wormuth said. In April, Army Futures Command announced the establishment of a Contested Logistics Cross-Functional team, which will reduce the service’s logistics footprint, use autonomous technology to extend operational reach and movement, and leverage data analytics to invest in predictive logistics capabilities.

To meet the requirements of supporting operations in the Pacific and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Army must continue to bolster recruiting, Wormuth said. In June, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks assigned the Army as the lead service for the defense of the U.S. territory of Guam.

“The Army, in terms of [operations] tempo, is about a busy now as we were during two decades of the global war on terrorism,” Wormuth said. “That’s surprising but when you think of everything we’re doing in Europe … with all that we’re doing in the Indo Pacific. We’re very, very busy.”

While the branch will likely fall short of its recruiting goals in 2023, the service has seen an uptick in the “pace” of new enlistment contracts over the last two months Wormuth said. Wormuth said that she would like the Army to be able to recruit about 60,000 new Soldiers annually to attend basic training.

“You could not fight a major war in Europe or in Asia very effectively with an Army that's smaller than 450,000,” Wormuth said. “That’s why it’s really an existential issue for us to resolve our recruiting challenges.”

George added that the service must holistically transform the way it trains and educates the Army’s people.

“People are decisive element of this and I think we’ve seen that in Ukraine with the will and the skill down at the very tactical level,” George said.

The CDE was held in Vicenza and brought together military medical professionals, planners and experts from SETAF-AF, U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Medical Command and others, alongside medical providers from Burundi, Chad, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The primary objective of the event was to work collectively to refine the fiscal year 2024 MEDREX execution strategy and discuss the framework for fiscal years 2025 to 2027.

MEDREX is a program designed and overseen by the SETAF-AF that allows medical personnel from the U.S. military and partner nation militaries to exchange medical procedures and strengthen treatment capabilities.

U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Todd R. Wasmund, SETAF-AF commanding general, welcomed participants and emphasized the importance of such collaborative events.

""The MEDREX program is a vitally important component of our global health engagement strategy,” Wasmund said. “The work you are doing here reflects your commitment to build strong partnerships and enhance medical capabilities that benefit the force and people in your communities.""

One of the highlights of the CDE occurred when participants from the various nations discussed the positive impacts and exchange of medical practices during FY23’s MEDREX events.

Discussions touched on addressing challenges within each country’s healthcare systems, lessons learned during the MEDREX prevously held in their country and strategies for future global health engagement. This knowledge-sharing served to create a cohesive approach to the planning and tailoring of the FY24 MEDREX plan.

“Medicine is universal, so regardless of where you come from or what language you speak medicine unites us all,” said Commander Doctor James Aggrey-Orleans, Ghana Armed Forces. Aggrey-Orleans is the MEDREX program director for Ghana and is in his fifth year serving in this capacity.

“The MEDREX program is important to Ghana because it allows our medical staff to work with our partners from the U.S. where we share and learn from each other,” he added.

During the CDE, African partners divided into small groups with their U.S. state partners and engaged in tabletop discussions to refine plans for next year’s MEDREX season. The State Partnership Program is a U.S. Department of Defense joint security cooperation program which began in 1993. Administered by the National Guard Bureau, the program links a state’s National Guard with the armed forces of a partner country in order to build long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships. Through SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-society relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic and social spheres.

The SETAF-AF CDE collaboration resulted in seven MEDREX events scheduled to execute in FY24 in Angola, Burundi, Chad, Ghana, Senegal, Rwanda and South Africa. The event concluded with a closing ceremony and served as a testament to the growing cooperation between participants in addressing healthcare challenges on the African continent.

(Photo Credit: Photo illustration) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — The Army Maternity Uniform Pilot Program, also known as “Rent the Camo,” provides eligible female Soldiers stationed in the continental Unites States with free maternity uniforms.

The pilot program is available to officers and enlisted service members in all three components of the Army.

“This program is going to help give [Soldiers] the one-stop shop they need,” said Maj. Irma Richards, Army Logistics, troop support. “By streamlining the process to where they only have one person to deal with, which is the MUPP representative, that eliminates the back and forth a female Soldier has going to several locations to obtain her uniforms.”

In June 2020, Congress passed the “Rent the Camo: Access to Maternity Wear Act,” which directed each military service to establish a pilot program for issuing and recovering maternity uniforms to pregnant service members.

The Army started their program in October 2022 with two active-duty installations and the Maryland Army National Guard before expanding to all installations in the continental U.S. in May. Pilot participation is not available overseas at this time.

The initiative is volunteer based. Once a member reports a pregnancy to their unit, the command may offer the opportunity to use the program. Then the Soldier works with her installation representative for direct online ordering.

The Army also incorporated new developmental items into the pilot; the Army physical fitness uniform – maternity, the tan maternity T-shirt, and the nursing T-shirt. These items are only available in limited quantities.

Each member receives five maternity T-shirts and three sets of the operational camouflage pattern maternity uniform. Pilot uniforms are delivered directly to the service member and will be kept during the duration of the pregnancy. The uniforms will be retained by the service member for up to 15 months from the time they are received.

The program saves Soldiers hundreds of dollars on uniforms.

Each installation representative receives feedback from the volunteers and passes that to program leadership. So far, 204 participants have volunteered.

The initial response from Soldiers has been extremely positive, Richards said.

The pilot will run until fiscal year 2025 or when the service reaches 1,200 participants in the program.

At the end of the pilot, the information gathered from volunteers will be used to create courses of action and recommendations for Army senior leaders to determine the best way forward.

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — Capt. Elizabeth Dupont, U.S. Army South G3/5 planning officer, has battled her whole life for what she wanted: her athleticism, her education and her military service. But all the challenges she faced to forge her life couldn’t compare to the trauma of losing her only child.

Despite all of the adversity she encountered, Dupont credits her family, upbringing and Hispanic culture for her ability to continue moving forward in life and persevere through it all.

A farmer's daughter

“I was born in San Juan, Texas which is near the border,” said Dupont. “My mom had me with a midwife and then crossed to Reynosa, Mexico, and that's where I was raised.”

Her mother, who had U.S. residency, crossed the border to give birth to Dupont and give her U.S. citizenship, which was a privilege her older siblings didn’t have.

The daughter of a family of farmers, Dupont is the fifth of seven siblings. She described her upbringing as humble with her mom cooking whatever vegetables they grew in their fields, and they wouldn’t often have meat.

Capt. Elizabeth Dupont, U.S. Army South G3/5 plans officer, stands in a field of vegetables on her family farm in Reynosa, Mexico, January 1, 2019. Dupont grew up in Reynosa, Mexico where her family would grow various vegetables. “I would go to school from 8 a.m. until noon, and after school and all day on the weekends I would go to work with my dad,” Dupont said. “Different vegetables, different seasons, selling the produce, we would work all year round.” (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

“So, you get what you get,” she said as a matter of fact. “My siblings and I shared beds and there was no air conditioning in our house, but we didn’t know any different.”

From a young age, Dupont said her father instilled an unwavering work ethic in her and raised her to have values that she would later come to find mirrored the Army Values.

She helped her father work the land, becoming disciplined as well as physically and mentally tough.

“I would go to school from 8 a.m. until noon, and after school and all day on the weekends I would go to work with my dad,” she said proudly. “Different vegetables, different seasons, selling the produce, we would work all year round.”

She looked at manual labor as a competition with her siblings, vying to be the best worker among them.

“Out of all of my sisters, my dad would wake me up because I wouldn’t complain,” Dupont bragged. “I mean my sisters would work, but they would get tired. I just wanted to beat them and show that I was able to do better than them in the field.”

That sparring spirit transferred over into athletics, where even after a long day of school and work, Dupont said she would find a way to play sports with her friends.

She said they play any sport they had the resources for, playing baseball or simply racing each other on foot. Of all the sports they played, she loved soccer the most.

“We would come home from work around 7 p.m., and right after that I would play soccer with my friends,” she said. “I was the one that had the ball, so they would always come look for me to play.”

Dupont said she would do everything possible to play sports or compete, like wear shorts under her school uniform just in case her friends wanted to play soccer, or even run track in her bare feet.

“My friends found out I was good at track, but most of the time I only had my uniform and girly shoes,” Dupont claimed. “So, I would just remove my shoes and run barefoot. Obviously, I was the only one who ran barefoot, but I was competing and winning!”

Moving to the U.S.

As Dupont grew older, three of her older sisters decided to move to the U.S. to attend school and work. At 14 years-old, Dupont had an opportunity to follow in their footsteps and moved to Edinburg, Texas.

“I arrived in December, in the middle of the school year, so they dropped me back one year, and then they dropped me another year because I was still learning English,” she admitted. “So, I started in eighth grade.”

Despite the two-year scholastic setback, Dupont said she took everything in stride and kept rolling along.

She became a freshman in high school and luckily had her sister, who was a senior, to help her navigate attending school in another country.

Dupont said, along with her sister's guidance, her involvement in high school sports was a huge help for her adapting to life in Texas.

“Sports got me through the challenge of adapting to American culture, because I was able to connect with other students through my athleticism,” said Dupont.

First-generation university graduate and ROTC

After overcoming the language barrier and culture difference of moving to the U.S., she decided she wanted to pursue a college education.

She saw an opportunity to pursue her passion of coaching with a degree in kinesiology and pay for her education through the U.S. Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

“I saw being an officer as simulating coaching but in a different spectrum,” explained Dupont. “I didn’t want to be a normal Soldier, but rather coach the Soldiers.”

She noted that she experienced barriers due to her race, ethnicity and accent, with other cadets criticizing her pronunciation and doubting her abilities, but when it came to the physical and mental aspect of training in the ROTC program, she said she was second to none.

Dupont admitted that her humble upbringing came as an advantage especially during the field training exercises.

“I talked to most of the other cadets and most of them said they had an easy life, but I didn’t and I’m proud of that,” remembered Dupont. “We got MREs and everyone was like, ‘what is this?’ But I just took what I could get, and when we didn’t have air conditioning, I didn’t make it a big deal’”

Dupont graduated at the top of her ROTC class and became the first in her immediate family to receive a college degree with both an associate and bachelor’s degree in kinesiology and was commissioned in August of 2018 as a second lieutenant.

She went on to attend the ordnance Basic Officer Leader Course at Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia and was stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas for her first assignment as platoon leader of the fuel and water platoon with 501st Brigade Support Battalion, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division.

Unimaginable loss

Dupont met her husband, Capt. Keith Dupont II, in October of 2018. They eventually wed and decided to start a family.

In May of 2021 their son, Keith Dupont III, was born with a strong personality from the start, said Dupont, and she felt the purest love she had ever known.

“He was truly a baby that could light up any room with his smile and laughter,” Dupont said. “He was attentive and had a curious mind, but sleeping was not his priority for fear of missing out.”

But one night when he was about three months old, her son suddenly stopped breathing.

“He started having breath holding spells, and his whole body would just turn blue or purple,” said Dupont with tears in her eyes. “I knew CPR and stuff so the first time it happened I started doing it, and he just gasped for air and came back.”

Dupont and her husband brought their son to several specialists to understand and treat the symptoms as the spells worsened in severity and became more frequent.

“I started to know when he was going to have the episodes, because as soon as he would start to get bothered he would have one,” recalled Dupont. “I would already be standing by the oxygen mask.”

She said that after months searching for answers, doctors diagnosed their son with Gaucher disease.

According to the National Library of Medicine, Gaucher disease is an inherited genetic disease that affects various organ systems and tissues, including the central nervous system. There are three types which vary in the age of onset and which bodily systems they affect.

There is no cure for any of the three types, but there are treatment options for types one and three. The Dupont's son had type two, which has no treatment.

Over the course of 17 months Dupont said their son’s heart stopped 12 times, and each time they were able to bring him back with CPR.

But in January of 2023, their son passed away at 20 months old.

“When he passed we were in acceptance,” she said solemnly. “We were hurting, but we knew it was best for him to not suffer anymore.”

Coping and the future

Through all of the trauma and caring for her son, Dupont was able to complete the Captain’s Career Course and promote to the rank of captain.

She still remembers the pain of losing Keith III but is finding ways to cope like talking and spending time with her husband and seeing a behavioral health provider.

“It's quite a sensitive topic still since it just recently happened, but my husband and I pull through every day,” Dupont expressed with hope. “We kind of find that little peaceful moment with a workout or going out to see a movie.”

On top of finding peace, Dupont said that putting life into perspective is important to pushing through trauma like she has experienced.

“All of this has made me stronger in the sense of just looking at things more positively,” she said. “I'm just taking it day by day, because no matter what life throws at you, you just have to adapt, continue training and just continue going.”"

NAIROBI, Kenya – Representatives from U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) and several partners nations met with exercise planners from the Kenyan Defence Forces to conduct the mid planning event for exercise Justified Accord 2024 (JA24) Sept. 11 - 15, 2023.

JA24 brings together service members from the U.S., Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Somalia, Djibouti and the U.K. Key highlights include a multinational live-fire field training exercise, counter-improvised explosive device awareness and combined company-level assault activities.

One of the driving factors for a successful exercise is trust among partner forces. The mid planning event allows multinational planners to sit down with each other and develop that necessary trust by working through all the details together.

The training portfolio has expanded significantly from a tabletop exercise with limited participants just a few years ago to over a thousand service members from approximately 20 nations converging in Kenya for JA24.

The exercise is scheduled for late February to early March, 2024.

Each iteration, planners continue to include progressive and innovative elements into the exercise scenario, reflecting the most pertinent issues impacting East Africa.

""It's exciting that this year's exercise will include a course discussing partner nation gender focal points through the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) initiative,"" said U.S. Army Maj. Teisha Barnes, a civil military operations officer with SETAF-AF. ""In meeting with my KDF counterpart, Kenya has a significant interest in promoting the role of women in military service.""

Along with the WPS exchange, an AU staff officer course, a command post exercise and defensive cyber course will heavily engage participants in crisis response operations. The classroom-based portion takes place simultaneously with maneuver elements out in the field.

A key objective during JA24 for the KDF is to enhance their ability to conduct training in an austere environment, while integrating their joint and interagency forces. To that end, this year's exercise will be hosted at a new Kenyan venue designed at doing just that.

Working together with the Kenya U.S. Liaison Office (KUSLO), KDF planners recommended the brand new, U.S.-built Counter Insurgency, Terrorism and Stability Operations Center (CITSO) as the primary location for field training exercises at JA24.

""CITSO allows the KDF and partner forces to meet several training objectives, realizing the potential for this new institution to support peacekeeping operations in the region,"" said U.S. Air Force Maj. Scott Gregory, U.S. Embassy Nairobi KUSLO officer. ""The location is remote and has enough training area to support simultaneous maneuvers from multiple units.""

JA24 will also feature a multinational air advisory exchange where partner nations will share best practices related to crisis response. The goal is to build, sustain and expand relationships and the capabilities of partner nation air forces.

Together with U.S. Navy-led activities in Mombasa, this year’s Justified Accord has expanded into a joint multinational, combined event. The exercise is poised to increase joint readiness in preparation for an actual disaster or crisis response.

Selebi-Phikwe, Botswana — In a demonstration of international cooperation, the U.S. Army’s 2nd Security Force Assistance Brigade and the Botswana Defense Forces joined forces for rigorous training at the Mantswe a Ditschwene range here, Sep. 18, 2023. Amidst this austere environment, SFAB advisors and BDF soldiers worked to improve their proficiency at small-unit tactics.

The 2nd SFAB served as advisors for the BDF as they took part in a five-week Urban Combat Leadership Course (UCLC). This course consists of mainly small unit tactics training, with a focus on leadership development, casualty care, marksmanship, and close quarters combat training. The course culminated in the rugged terrain of Mantswe a Ditschwene range, with the BDF participants taking part in squad and platoon missions to include platoon raids and room clearing operations.

The collaboration marks yet another milestone of continued partnership for the 2nd SFAB, U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) and the BDF, a partnership founded on shared security interests and the pursuit of regional stability.

“Advising our partners at the tactical level on tasks such as room clearing, platoon raids and operations orders establishes foundational proficiencies that enable a more capable and professional force,” explained Sgt. 1st Class Stephen Patterson, 2nd SFAB maneuver advisor team sergeant.

The 2nd SFAB, charged with advising and training allies and partner forces in Africa, brought its many collective years of experience to the table. In adherence to Army tradition and doctrine, American instructors and their Botswana counterparts meticulously drilled soldiers in small-unit infantry tactics.

“We recognize the pivotal role that African nations play in promoting stability and security on the continent. Our partnership with African military forces is a testament to our shared commitment to peace and prosperity,” added Capt. Phil Cavanagh, 2nd SFAB maneuver advisor team leader.

The vast, unforgiving landscape of the Mantswe a Ditschwene Range posed unique challenges for the training unit. Soldiers had to adapt swiftly to the challenging terrain, where unpredictable weather and limited resources mirrored the conditions they might encounter in real-world missions.

""This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to strengthening alliances with our partners in Botswana. By honing their skills, we are not only preparing the BDF for any challenges they may face but also solidifying the bonds of friendship and trust between our two nations,” said Cavanagh.

""We value the enduring relationship between our countries,” said Maj. B. Selepeng, the officer-in-charge of BDF soldiers. ”This training will undoubtedly enhance the capabilities of our soldiers, allowing us to better serve our nation and contribute to regional security.""

Botswana's position in Southern Africa places it at the crossroads of various regional dynamics. It shares borders with South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, making it a critical point of contact with neighboring nations. This geographic centrality enables Botswana to monitor and respond effectively to regional security threats, including violent extremist organizations.

The 2nd SFAB is regionally aligned with U.S. Africa Command and is under the operational control of SETAF-AF. This mission in Botswana is one of many which 2nd SFAB executes on the African continent, maintaining periodic presence in up to 15 African countries. Engagements such as this underscore the importance of partnerships where global challenges require collective responses."

Daniel Mitchell, US Army Garrison Rock Island Arsenal commander and Command Sgt. Maj. James Brown, exercise with children at the Rock Island Arsenal Child Development Center in Rock Island, Illinois on April 4, 2023.

WASHINGTON — The Army has now staffed more than 70% of its total child development center work force, bringing the service closer to fulfilling its quality-of-life pledge to provide better care for military families, an Army leader said Tuesday.

More incentives for CDC workers led to the spike in the hiring of more Army childcare workers, after sitting at about 63% earlier this year, said Lt. Gen. Kevin Vereen, Army deputy chief of staff for installations.

In October 2022, Army leaders promised to bolster staffing at CDCs to improve the quality of service and to raise enrollment. Vereen said adequate childcare ranks as one of the top concerns of Soldiers and spouses.

“[CDCs] are important because we know families want to have safe, secure childcare facilities for their young ones so they don’t have to worry about what’s happening to them while they’re at work,” said Vereen, speaking during an online broadcast Tuesday.

As part of a 2022 Department of Defense mandate, the Army offered CDC employee applicants 50% off childcare fees at CDCs for their first enrolled child. Former Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston said last year that 100% of CDCs had previously operated understaffed, prompting the service to set a goal of fully staffing 90% of childcare centers.

“We are coming off a pandemic. We have a lack of workers not only across the childcare enterprise, but across almost every enterprise in the U.S.,” Vereen said. “We are in this mad push for talent. We are in the same pool of pulling for young, qualified people who want to serve long term not only in the Army, but in childcare.”

Army leaders said last year that adequate child care also plays a critical role in recruitment and retention. Additionally the service has funded 15 new CDCs over the past four years, Vereen said. Many CDCs across the Army extended their business hours in 2022.

In addition to childcare centers, the Army addressed housing concerns both for residents in the barracks and Army housing. Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth pledged to invest $1.5 billion in Army-owned housing and another $3.1 billion in privatized housing.

To gain a better understanding of housing concerns, Vereen has toured installations across the Army, most recently at posts in Alaska and at Fort Carson, Colorado, in August. There, Vereen met with junior Soldiers and commanders to gather feedback, with most of the conversations centering on housing and barracks conditions.

“Soldiers won’t complain,” Vereen said. “They’re folks on a mission. But we also know as leaders, we want to do everything we can to take care them.”

Barracks at Fort Carson will be renovated for the first time since 2000, with upgrades that include more living space for junior Soldiers and adding kitchenettes for enlisted troops.

Vereen inspected recently renovated Army housing, as well as units that still require more upgrades.

“We’ve been able to invest quite substantially in barracks,” Vereen said. “We’re not done yet. We have a strategy and this is [Wormuth’s] strategy to invest over $1.5 billion over the next 10 years in barracks.”

“I think we’re seeing the [results] and we’re excited where we’re going. We’re in the long game when it comes to infrastructure requirements.”

Finally Vereen praised the efforts of military spouses for not only supporting their military member but advancing their careers. Vereen said many spouses have taken advantage of internships and fellowships, including the 12-week paid DOD College Acquisition Internship Program.

Vereen said adding professional development to spouses’ resumes helps potential employers know that military spouses have extensive training and skills.

“It’s showcasing the talents of our spouses,” Vereen said. “They’re not a hiring risk because they’ve had multiple jobs over a small period of time and in some cases, they couldn’t control it; the Army caused a family to move.”

The Army and DOD has taken measures to help relieve spouses of hefty relicensure fees as spouses can now collect up to $1,000 in reimbursements for license and certification costs during a permanent-change-of-station move. The Army recently changed the application procedure so that spouses can more easily apply for seven different professional license and certification exam registration fees.

The service expanded its noncompetitive hiring authority for spouses with the DOD Military Spouse Employment Partnership, to connect spouses to 610 employers. More than 258,000 spouses have been hired."

WASHINGTON — On a summer morning in 2022, Kaileen Santos met with her supervisors in a Pentagon office. The staff sergeant considered leaving the Army to pursue a career in law enforcement or work for the government.

Maj. Josefina Martinez and Lt. Col. Izabella Lundy saw her as a Soldier who could innovate and thrive in challenging environments, and they didn’t want to let her go, so they encouraged her to apply for the Army’s Green to Gold Program, an initiative that provides enlisted Soldiers a means to earn a college degree and an officer’s commission while remaining in the Army.

“I [saw] the strength and motivation to do more for herself and her daughter,” Martinez said.

Santos applied for the scholarship with Martinez and Lundy’s encouragement and was accepted into the Green to Gold Program in December 2022.

Santos, the first member of her family to join the armed forces, will study health systems management at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte this fall. She will continue to receive her current pay, a stipend, basic allowance for housing and basic allowance for subsistence, which will help pay for tuition, textbooks and rent. Her Post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefits she is saving for her daughter’s education.

Santos will attend ROTC during the school year and a cadet summer camp between her junior and senior year.

“I never thought I'd get this chance or opportunity,” she said. “The changes that it’s going to make in my life — in my daughter’s life — it’s such a great feeling.”

Hometown hard knocks

Santos’ soft-spoken demeanor masks a tough interior from growing up in a rough neighborhood in southern Massachusetts.

New Bedford, a small coastal city settled on the Acushnet River along Massachusetts’ south coast, attracts tourists for its architecture and colonial history. But its gothic and federal-style buildings and the charming ambiance of its downtown hide a dark turmoil in its lower-income neighborhoods.

The town grew into a hotbed for gang activity, with 11 known street gangs, including the Latin Kings. In 2021 the city reported that 20% of its residents lived below the poverty line, with more than 80% classified as economically disadvantaged.

Youth in New Bedford often become addicted to narcotics, and some turn to prostitution.

“You walk down the street, and you see girls getting sold,” she said.

Santos’ mother Maria, a Honduran immigrant from San Pedro Sula, settled in New Bedford in the early 2000s. Santos lived with six siblings in the family’s modest house on the city’s west side. Her mother ran a Spanish grocery store which she has owned for 20 years.

Some of her classmates fell into a life of crime or joined a gang. One of her peers became pregnant at 12 years old. Santos saw several of her friends fall into the web of substance abuse, and many were absent from school. A male friend who fell into depression later committed suicide.

Santos admitted she didn’t focus on academics as a teen.

“I didn't really see a purpose in school when I was 18,” she said. “I was … naive and immature.”

Fortunately, Santos met retired Lt. Col. Kevin McGovern, an advisor at her school’s JROTC program. McGovern acted as a mentor not only to Santos but to her siblings. He saw potential in Santos and encouraged her to enlist in the Army and leave New Bedford.

“He tried to keep me on the straight and narrow,” Santos said. “He always kept an eye on me [and] encouraged me to do better.”

After graduating from New Bedford High School in 2012, Santos saw the Army as a path out of her hometown.

Life change

Santos enlisted and received a job as a human resources specialist, and the Army assigned her to Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt, Germany. She found Schweinfurt to be a beautiful, vibrant city and a stark change from her life in New Bedford.

“It really opened my mind and showed me that there’s more to life out there,” she said.

An assignment at Fort Knox, Kentucky, followed her tour in Germany, where Santos met and married her daughter’s father. At Fort Knox, she weathered the most tumultuous period of her life from 2015 to 2016, when she went through a divorce and became a single mother.

Santos eventually adapted to raising her daughter alone while thriving as a Soldier. She had successful stints at Fort Meade, Maryland, as a drill instructor, and then in her current position at Army headquarters.

Santos took college courses sporadically in her first years in the Army, but at Fort Meade, 1st Sgt. James McKay encouraged her to dedicate herself fully to her studies. She later began exploring leadership opportunities, including warrant officer options and commissioning opportunities.

Becoming a mother also changed her, and she became fiercely protective of her daughter, a seven-year-old who loves swimming, karate and gymnastics. Santos even became PTA president at her daughter’s school.

She also excelled in her duties as a Soldier. At Fort Meade, her commander selected her to compete in the 53rd Signal Battalion’s Best Warrior Competition in October 2018.

For the competition Santos ran kettle bell runs, performed simulated first aid and competed against five male counterparts in wooded areas north of Baltimore.

Santos was selected by the Department of the Army for special duty as a drill sergeant at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, before her assignment at the Pentagon.

“The Army’s definitely helped me find direction in life,” Santos said. “It’s always given me a goal to work towards.”

Under her wing

In her first 11 years in the Army, Martinez made a name for herself as an energetic NCO, climbing through the enlisted ranks quickly.

Martinez and Santos’ careers converged in Washington in 2021, when Martinez was the assistant executive officer for Director of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, and Santos served as the executive assistant and human resources NCO.

Martinez saw a bit of herself in Santos during their time at the Pentagon. Like Santos, Martinez left home at 18 and eventually landed a position as a senator’s office manager on Capitol Hill. But later, Martinez divorced her husband and had to adopt to life as a single mother.

Martinez enlisted in the Army in 1995, eventually finding her niche as a career counselor. Then she reached a crossroads in her career. Martinez found she adapted well to the Army structure and lifestyle, but decided she could better serve the Army, and care for her family, as an officer. She commissioned in 2006.

Now in her 50s, Martinez took the younger Santos under her wing, teaching her the importance of working collectively in the Office of the Director of Army Staff.

Santos learned quickly. Working in the same building as the Army’s top general officers didn’t faze her, and she became a trusted assistant of Piatt. Santos never let her career aspirations interfere with her role at Army headquarters, often redoubling her efforts after taking time off.

“She just instinctively knew what she was doing,” Martinez said. “She was always polite; she was just ahead of the game.”

Santos saw how the bonds she formed with her mentors — officers and senior NCOs — influenced her career and her life. She remembered how Capt. Jason Selby, company commander, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 19th Engineer Battalion, shielded her from unnecessary hardships at Fort Knox.

And she recalled the efforts of Martinez and Lundy to encourage her to apply for the Green to Gold Program. She wants to do the same for another Soldier and hopes to one day become a company commander.

“Staff. Sgt. Santos is a dedicated Soldier who is talented and committed to service in the Army,” Piatt said. “She is example of selfless service, and it has been a pleasure having her serve on my team.”

“[Santos’] accomplishments and potential to lead our Soldiers has risen to the level that is characteristic of a commissioned officer,” said Deputy Undersecretary of the Army Mario Diaz, a former Army officer and West Point graduate. “I am confident she will continue to be successful.”

Story by: Carlos Cuebas, Fort Buchanan Public Affairs Officer

FORT BUCHANAN, PUERTO RICO- Service members, civilians, and family members conducted a road march around the perimeter road here on Sept. 9 as part of the Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, to honor the 9/11 victims by carrying non-perishable food on their rucksacks.

""This anniversary also serves as an opportunity to encourage citizens to pay tribute to the victims by participating in good deeds, contributing to food drives, helping refurbish homes in their communities, or doing something to support and honor veterans, soldiers, military families, and first responders. It is a time to remember by serving,"" said Col. Charles N. Moulton, Commander of Fort Buchanan, the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean region.

Before departing for the road march, Fort Buchanan Department of Emergency Services members conducted a bell ringing ceremony to honor the first responders and how their courage embodies the spirit and resilience of our nation.

Brig. Gen. Carlos Torres-Febus, Puerto Rico’s National Guard Land Component Commander, led the Puerto Rico National Guard formation during the road march.

""9/11 will live in our memories forever. However, some soldiers in this formation were very young that day. Others were not even born. That is why we cannot let this anniversary pass without reflecting on and teaching our children about what happened that fateful day and the freedom we still enjoy despite the terrorists' efforts,"" said Brig. Gen. Torres-Febus before the road march started.

At the end of the 4-mile road march, the service members quickly emptied their rucksacks into pre-established containers. Quickly, Maj. Joseph Okpe, and Staff Sgt. Juan Merced, from the Fort Buchanan Religious Support Office, led a convoy to deliver the recollected food to the Puerto Rico Food Bank in Carolina.

""This is a great way to honor the spirit of service of all those victims of 9/11. That is what we are doing here, remembering their sacrifice, and serving others,"" said Maj. Okpe.

According to the Puerto Rico Food Bank officials, the food collected during the road march will make a huge difference to many local families.

""You have just delivered over 2,600 pounds of food, equivalent to over 2,200 servings, that will feed over 177 families from Puerto Rico for a week. Thank you to the military personnel, civilians, and families at Fort Buchanan for this great donation,"" said Mari Jo Laborde, Executive Director of Puerto Rico Food Bank.

According to the Puerto Rico Statistics Institute, food insecurity is a social problem in Puerto Rico that prevails in many sectors of the population.

As the Department of the Army's center of gravity in the region, Fort Buchanan serves a diverse military community comprised of approximately 15,000 Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard soldiers, Marine Corps Reserve, and the Navy's Operational Support Center personnel."

CASERMA EDERLE, VICENZA, Italy –The Vicenza Health Clinic had the honor of hosting U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Raymond Scott Dingle on Sept. 12, 2023 for this second visit to Italy since taking command of U.S. Army Medical Command in 2020. Dingle, the 45th U.S. Army Surgeon General, and commanding general, U.S. Army Medical Command, toured the clinic and recognized exception staff during his visit.

The primary focus of his visit was to underscore the importance of teamwork within the medical community, particularly in light of the ongoing transition of medical treatment facilities from MEDCOM to Defense Health Agency, and the roll out of MHS Genesis, the military’s new U.S. military’s new electronic health record system.

In an interview with Ashleigh Fields in July, Dingle said, “The greatest lesson that I learned through my military journey has been the importance of teamwork. The success of any individual, organization, or team is based upon the collective synergy of them working together or with others.”

Dingle took a personal interest in addressing the staff's concerns about the transition process. He highlighted the close partnership between the Defense Health Agency and MEDCOM. The transfer of Army hospitals to the DHA is designed to create a more integrated health care system, improve patient outcomes, and enable the readiness of the Army to support the Joint Force. Teamwork is vital to provide excellent healthcare to our servicemen and women.

Dingle also took the opportunity to recognize excellence at the VHC. He issued well-deserved coins to both Soldiers and civilians, in acknowledgment of their outstanding contributions.

Mr. Del’Antony Campbell, patient advocate at the Army Health Care Center Vicenza, was instrumental in organizing Dingle’s latest visit, having been present during the previous visit in 2021. With Dingle's upcoming retirement, Campbell was able to express his gratitude before the departure.

“We extend our heartfelt thanks to Lt. Gen. Dingle for his invaluable service and dedication to the U.S. Army medical community,” said Campbell. “As he embarks on his well-deserved retirement, we wish him the very best in all his future endeavors.”

202,ALFS 24 planning underway in Zambia,https://www.army.mil/article/270300/alfs_24_planning_underway_in_zambia,"Military planners for U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF), visited several sites in Zambia Sep 18-22, 2023, for the African Land Forces Summit (ALFS) Initial Planning Event. The planning event is part of ongoing preparation for ALFS 24, scheduled for April 2024.

ALFS is a weeklong Chief of Staff of the Army event that hosts leaders from more than forty African countries for training and partnership-building with U.S. Army leaders. Last year ALFS took place in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. ALFS 24 marks the return of ALFS to southern Africa for the first time since 2019 when the event was held in Botswana.

The initial planning event sets the stage for SETAF-AF and Zambian planners to work together to build the event schedule, develop the ALFS 24 theme, and invite experts and leaders to present topics. In the months leading up to ALFS, planners will continue to meet with Zambian officials and businesses to tour potential venues, culturally significant locations, and other facilities to select locations for the training event. Planners gather information such as costs, building capacity, security, and connectivity capability.

International military engagements branch chief for SETAF-AF, Lt. Col. Robert Miller, is the lead planner for ALFS 24. Miller said that the event is the second of four planning meetings in Zambia to prepare for the summit. The first visit, the Pre-deployment Site Survey, took place in June.

""We are excited to have ALFS 24 in Zambia,” said Miller. “We were able to spend some time with our Zambian counterparts at ALFS 23 in Abidjan, and that allowed us to get to know our Zambian partners and start the planning process for ALFS 24.”

“Now that we are here on the ground in Zambia with our host partners, we are getting into the finite detailed planning for ALFS 24,” said Miller. “I know this is going to be a fantastic event.”

ALFS is hosted annually by SETAF-AF to bring together military leaders from the U.S. and Africa to discuss capabilities, build partnerships through face-to-face interaction, and discuss issues the partner forces face on the African continent.

(Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON ­­— Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo said that the Army has taken the next steps in the development of its signature modernization programs. While he didn't say whether the service could fulfill its pledge to deliver 24 of its priority systems in the hands of Soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2023, he added that the service has achieved significant momentum in reaching its goals.

“Ultimately, we’ll get to a point where we can see everything fully fielded,” said Camarillo, speaking during a conference in Arlington, Virginia on the afternoon of September 6. “We have an incredible track record of success … I really think we’re seeing a bit of a renaissance in terms of our ability to stick the landing on these programs.”

Camarillo said the service currently has entered the initial, low-rate production phase of the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle; formerly known as the Mobile Protected Fire Vehicle. The M10 Booker will help light combat forces identify enemy weapons systems from farther distances and provide greater survivability for Soldiers in combat brigades.

The Army awarded the $13 million contract for the M10 Booker to Indianapolis manufacturer Allison Transmission. The branch also announced Wednesday that it will move forward with the M1E3 Abrams Main Battle Tank modernization program which will be more agile and lethal than the previous Abrams tank model. Soldier feedback and years of testing contributed to the development of the M1E3.

In August, the Army announced that it awarded two contracts for the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle, formerly known as the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle. The agreement with Michigan-based companies American Rheinmetall Vehicles and General Dynamics Land Systems includes the design and prototype phases of the five-phase program. The XM30, which will eventually replace the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, provides greater maneuverability and survivability than the Bradleys.

In June, the Army successfully fired a Tomahawk missile from its mid-range capability system, showcasing the full operational capability of the MRC.

Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo said that Army Futures Command has made significant strides in changing requirements to achieve rapid prototyping for the Army's priority modernization programs. (Photo Credit: Screenshot image) VIEW ORIGINAL

As leaders build toward the Army of 2030, AFC commander Gen. Jim Rainey has also worked towards setting the foundation for the Army of 2040. Army leaders said in March that the service must foster a greater understanding of future threats and technological change to prepare for that initiative. Among those efforts will be exploring how artificial intelligence and robotics can be incorporated into the service’s infantry and armored brigade combat teams on the future battlefield.

During last year’s Project Convergence, the Army’s series of joint multi-domain experiments, participants used air and ground robotic vehicles during experiments at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. In one of the tests, engineers flew a pilotless UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter.

“We’re looking at our operating concept,” Camarillo said. “How does that guide and frame our thinking about how our units are designed and the capabilities they’ll employ in the future battle space? One example that [Rainey] talked a lot about is human and machine integration. How do we incorporate them more organically in ways that we haven’t quite thought of or experimented with?”

Camarillo added that AFC has explored how long-range precision fires, the Army’s top modernization priority, impacts requirements for Soldier protection in the future. He said that AFC will continue to search for ways to incorporate autonomous systems, including the Autonomous Vehicle Transport System. This system will allow U.S. forces to maintain a higher operational tempo while providing greater force protection and sustainment.

Army engineers at the Aviation and Missile Center at Redstone, Alabama built the Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher to navigate on rough terrain. The 36,000-pound vehicle can be operated remotely and will provide Soldiers added firepower and longer sustainment on the battlefield.

The Army plans on expanding the scope and scale in the 2024 iteration of Project Convergence. During the last series in October 2022, the Army included participation from allies Australia and the United Kingdom and employed multi-domain operations over greater distances than the previous iteration.

Earlier this year, Army Futures Command announced that it would schedule more experiments throughout the year instead of hosting a series of demonstrations once annually. The Army will host Project Convergence 4 in spring 2024.

Camarillo praised the efforts of Rainey, who has led the Army’s modernization efforts since succeeding acting AFC commander Lt. Gen. James Richardson in October 2022, as well as the progress of AFC.

“We’ve begun to develop momentum on the modernization side,” Camarillo said. “Whether it's programs that have gone from prototyping to production, or it's systems that are very quickly developing prototypes that we can put them in the hands of Soldiers.

“I give AFC a lot of credit for finding ways to work very effectively with the program executive offices … changing the requirements process … and enabling us to begin that rapid prototyping.”

The Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa held their annual 9/11 memorial ceremony to commemorate the lives lost during the tragedy and highlight the importance of keeping the memory of 9/11 alive on Sept. 11, 2023 at Camp Lemonnier.

More than 100 service members from across Camp Lemonnier stood in formation to pay tribute. Distinguished guests including Djibouti Mayor Said D. Muhommud and Mario Fernandez, U.S. Chargé D’Affaires to Djibouti, were also in attendance.

“We must never forget the legacy of that September day,” said U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Jami Shawley, CJTF-HOA commanding general. “And let us hope that the legacy of that day is of a world drawn together in a common cause for freedom and for peace.”

CJTF-HOA service members who lived in New York during the attacks were invited to speak about their experience of the attacks and the impact it made on their lives.

U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Tommy Trejo, CJTF-HOA communications senior enlisted leader, was a student in middle school when the Twin Towers fell. On that day he was inspired to join the military and his calling led him to eventually enlist in the New York National Guard in 2007.

Since the he’s supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and now CJTF-HOA, which was established in October 2002 to counter transnational terrorist threats in the Horn of Africa.

“This task force was a direct result of the September 11th attacks and I’m proud to be serving here as not only a soldier, but as a New Yorker,” said Trejo.

In August 2001, a month before the attacks, U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Matthew Blake, CJTF-HOA director of human intelligence and counterintelligence, got a job as a law enforcement officer in the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York City. When he first heard about the attacks, Blake was a firearms instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia over 800 miles away from his hometown.

“I'll never forget. I was out on the range when I got my first alert text. My initial thought was it was probably just some young pilot who accidentally clipped the tower trying to show off. After a couple of minutes my alert beeper went off again. That’s when I realized our country was under attack,” said Blake.

His initial reaction, like millions from around the nation and the world, was one of shock. Upon arriving home Blake, a fifth-generation New Yorker, saw law enforcement, civilians, and service members come together like he’d never experienced before.

“Every person working out there remembers the sights, the smells, the sounds. But we also remember the resilience of our New Yorkers, of our American citizens, and of our partners and allies from around the world,” said Blake.

Twenty years removed from the attacks this unity is still present. Blake made it his personal goal to do his part in never allowing the memory of 9/11 to die out, this goal has led him to CJTF-HOA.

“Here today, we have Americans from all parts of our beloved country, we have our partners and allies from many parts of the world, and no doubt we have folks standing among us that were not even born when 9/11 happened,” said Blake. “Together we stand here in solidarity, all doing our small part in never forgetting.”"

The exercise evaluated the installation's response to an active shooter situation at the 1st Mission Support Command headquarters, and a suspicious package at the Army and Airforce Exchange System. The exercise aimed to sustain the high level of readiness of emergency and safety personnel assigned to the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean.

Members of the Homeland Security Investigations agency participated in the exercise as advisors.

During the exercise, residents and visitors on and near Fort Buchanan heard warnings over the ""giant voice"" system, sirens, and detonations and saw emergency response vehicles and personnel in action.

""An active shooter attack can occur anywhere, and we must all be prepared. We all play a vital role in preventing these situations,"" said Hector Herrera, Army Counterterrorism Operations Specialist at Fort Buchanan.

The military command increased the Force Protection Condition Level (FPCON) to Delta level as part of the drill.

There are five levels of FPCON: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. The levels increase from Normal's lowest condition to Delta's highest and most restrictive condition. FPCON Delta led to the closure of all gates for a period of time.

""It is critical for the Fort Buchanan community to participate in exercises like this Antiterrorism drill to ensure we are prepared for any scenario at the only U.S. Army installation in the Caribbean. We hope it never happens, but we are prepared to deal with it quickly if it does. We thank every member of the Fort Buchanan community and the surrounding communities for their patience during the event,"" said Col. Charles N. Moulton, commander of Fort Buchanan.

As the Department of the Army's center of gravity in the region, Fort Buchanan serves a diverse military community comprised of approximately 15,000 Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard soldiers, Marine Corps Reserve, and the Navy's Operational Support Center personnel.

The installation also offers critical services to the civilian population of the Department of Defense, veterans, retirees, and their families, as well as more than 30 federal agencies located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden presented Larry Taylor, a Vietnam War Army helicopter pilot, with the Medal of Honor during a ceremony at the White House Sept. 5, 2023.

The president upgraded the Silver Star award that Taylor originally received for his heroic actions rescuing a four-person patrol team in 1968.

“When duty called, Larry did everything to answer,” Biden said. “Because of that, he rewrote the fate of four families for generations to come. That’s valor. That’s our nation at its very best.”

Taylor, a Chattanooga, Tennessee native, joined the Army to continue his family’s tradition of military service. His great-great-grandfather fought in the Civil War; his great-uncle fought in World War I; and his father and uncles fought in World War II.

He commissioned through the Army Reserve Officer Training Program at the University of Tennessee in 1966. He volunteered as an armor officer before quickly switching to be a pilot, flying some of the Army’s first AH-1G Cobra attack helicopters.

After qualifying as an Army aviator, he was sent to Vietnam in August 1967 to serve with D Troop (Air), 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 1st Infantry Division. A distress call came into his unit late at night, June 18, 1968. A long-range reconnaissance patrol team of four Soldiers was surrounded and in danger of being overrun.

Taylor and his co-pilot had two minutes to fire up their Cobra and head out into the darkness. They only knew the general direction of the team. They were unable use the lights on the helicopter because they would give away their position and the position of the patrol team.

“I didn’t think I was ever going to find them,” Taylor recalled.

The reconnaissance team was hunkered down behind a cart path. They were on a mission in southern Vietnam to track North Vietnamese troop movement when they noticed a large enemy force positioned around them. They tried to escape the same way they came but were quickly surrounded.

Their only option was to take cover and prepare for the fight they knew was coming, said Dave Hill, rear gunner on the patrol team.

The team radioed for air support, which arrived not long after. As Taylor and his co-pilot flew overhead, they made radio contact with the men on the ground.

Taylor asked the patrol team to mark their location with flares so he and another Cobra crew could differentiate them from the enemy.

“We knew we would be discovered at some point because we were surrounded,” Hill said. “We popped the flares, and all hell broke loose.”

Bullets and rocket-propelled grenades started flying, some hitting the embankment in front of the Soldiers while others flew over their heads. Seeing enemy muzzle fire, the two Cobra gunships started making attack runs using their mini-guns and aerial rockets. According to reports, both helicopters took on intense ground fire from the enemy.

Each member of the ground patrol team engaged the enemy force with more than 600 rounds of ammunition, claymore mines and grenades. The grenadier of the unit had 75 rounds for the M-79 grenade launcher. After 35 minutes of fighting, they were nearly tapped out.

Both Cobras were close to being out of ammunition as well and running low on fuel. Thinking quickly, Taylor radioed the patrol team with a rescue plan.

He told the other gunship to fire its remaining rounds along the eastern flank of the patrol team. He would fire his remaining rounds along the western flank and then use his landing lights to draw the enemy’s attention.

He told the patrol team to reposition their claymore mines to the northeast and southeast. When the two Cobras made their attack runs, Taylor instructed the reconnaissance team to fire the mines and run to the nearby rice paddy clearing.

“That will give 'Charlie' something to think about,” Taylor said recalling his plan.

They all executed, and the patrol team met Taylor’s helicopter at the extraction point. The gunship was a two-seat aircraft with no room for passengers. It touched down under intense fire, and the Soldiers climbed under the helicopter onto the rocket-pods and landing skids.

Taylor immediately took off and got the helicopter out of firing range. He then dropped the patrol team off at a nearby safe location. Before the Cobra took off again for its return flight to base, the four Soldiers looked up at Taylor and all saluted.

“[Taylor’s] innovation was well beyond the call [of duty], as was his courage,” Hill said. Asked what chance of survival the team had without Taylor’s actions, Hill responded empathically, “absolutely zero.”

Taylor served in Vietnam until August 1968, flying more than 2,000 combat missions and taking enemy fire 340 times. It wasn’t easy but throughout the war Taylor never lost a man, he said.

“You do whatever you can to save the lives of the people you’re trying to rescue,” he explained. “Today, I’ve become lifelong friends with several of these people.”

Hill is now one of those people. Having not seen each other since that fateful night in Vietnam, they finally met at a long-range reconnaissance patrol reunion in 1999. They’ve been friends ever since and take turns attending their respective unit reunions.

The eight soldiers involved in the battle received several awards, including a few Silver Stars. Hill and a several others thought Taylor had done more to distinguish himself that night.

""Larry not only did his job, he went way above and beyond his duty at great risk of life,” Hill said. ""It was a failure at the time to adequately recognize his valor, his courage, his dedication, and we were determined to turn that around.""

The group contacted a congressman in Tennessee and started the process for nominating Taylor for the Medal of Honor. After more than seven years of work, they finally proved, with witness statements not previously seen, that Taylor deserved the military’s highest honor for valor.

“That’s the ultimate,” Taylor said of receiving the Medal of Honor. “You can’t get any better than that. I’m thankful that we were able to get the [Soldiers] out that night, and all four of them became lifelong friends.”

During his time in the Army, Taylor received more than 50 combat decorations, including the Silver Star, 43 Air Medals, a Bronze Star and two Distinguished Flying Crosses. He finished his military career as a captain and returned home to Tennessee where he has lived ever since.

A Patriot’s Day parade is scheduled in Chattanooga to honor him, Sept. 17, 2023.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Army Special Operations Command welcomed Ellsworth “Al” Johnson, a 100-year-old World War II Army veteran, into the community by presenting him with an Army Special Forces’ tab and a Green Beret during a ceremony at an assisted living center in Zeeland, Michigan, Sept. 1.

Johnson was recognized for his contributions during the war while serving in an Office of Strategic Services’ operational group, a precursor to Army Special Operations, and became eligible for the honor after an update to the Army awards regulation in 2019.

“We honor Mr. Johnson today as we look back at our roots and legacy in Special Operations,” said Brig. Gen. Lawrence Ferguson, 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) commanding general. “We talk a lot about people and warfighting in the Army, and when you look at Mr. Johnson and his time, it’s clear to see that although many years have passed, those two concepts are still with us today.”

During WWII, the Office of Strategic Services was an intelligence agency for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The command formed several small self-sufficient groups composed primarily of Soldiers that would enter enemy territory to perform missions and gather intelligence.

Johnson, an Army medic, volunteered to join the command and was placed in the French operational group following training. His 25-man team parachuted into France behind enemy lines in August 1944, just prior to the Allied invasion of southern France.

Their mission was to capture a hydroelectric plant and harass the German army while gathering intelligence for the unit’s headquarters in London. The team, given the code name “Patrick,"" spent nearly a month in France working with a French underground group.

The unit successfully captured the plant and the nearby town of Eguzon. They continued to torment the German army as it retreated through southern France.

Following this tour, Johnson volunteered to serve in China where he provided medical care and trained Chinese troops in airborne capabilities. He served as an advisor to a Chinese commando unit and parachuted with them during an attack against a Japanese-held town.

Johnson survived the battle and returned home to Michigan at the end of the war in 1945. The Office of Strategic Services disbanded that October.

“[Johnson] laid the groundwork for what we are today,” said Maj. Gen. Patrick Roberson, U.S. Army Special Operations Command deputy commanding general. “Everything that he did in 1944 — we model ourselves on in our training and the operations that we conduct. It’s our origin story.”

During the Korean War, U.S. Army leaders wanted to create an unconventional warfare unit to deal with guerrilla forces. Rather than start from scratch, they used the operational groups of the OSS from WWII as a model for the new unit structure.

This structure carried over in the formation of Army Special Forces under the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Division in 1952.

Surrounded by his extended family, Johnson was honored nearly two months after his 100th birthday.

“I’m overcome by the emotion but proud to be here today,” he said.

UNDISCLOSED LOCATION, AFRICA– Dump trucks kick up bright orange soil as they rumble past termite mounds and low-lying shrubs. Dust plumes rise from an excavator as it fills up a long line of trucks. Some of the dirt will fill up barriers, other dirt will be used to fortify targets on a training range, and still, more of it is being relocated to provide drainage for rain.

After a long day, the Soldiers responsible for these tasks are covered in the same orange dust that marks their trucks, a testament to their hard work. They try their best not to track it into their tent, letting the wind carry the orange off their boots and wet wipes to knock the dirt off their skin.

The Soldiers are part of the 294th Engineer Support Company, Missouri National Guard, currently providing support to the Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa.

“If they need a new road cleared out, then we’re there. If they need some [barriers] to be built, then we got it,” said Spc. Jared Alverson, 294th ESC horizontal construction specialist. “Our responsibility here is just to be ready and get jobs done fast while being as available as possible for the larger mission.”

The 294th ESC provides construction and maintenance capabilities to outstations and remote locations across the continent, giving friendly forces a launching point wherever it may be needed.

Aircraft swiftly and discreetly drop 294th ESC Soldiers off at their target location with their tools and supplies, and then the teams get to work. Their horizontal construction team moves dirt and rocks to flatten areas in preparation for structure specialists. They can also build up barriers and control points to begin securing a location.

“We can do various earth-moving operations, such as extending outposts and building new structures,” said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Caleb Cantrell, 294th ESC horizontal team noncommissioned officer in charge of projects.

The Soldiers possess a wide range of skills, encompassing everything from electrical technicians to plumbers to heavy equipment operators. Many maintain active careers in carpentry or as skilled tradesmen in their civilian capability, bringing outside experience and skills to the mission. Depending on the needs of the location, they could be driving forklifts, filling sandbags, or building guard towers.

The ability to construct and maintain infrastructure at forward operating locations is critical to the success of CJTF-HOA operations in the Horn of Africa, where security may be required to support the goals of African partners and friendly forces.

“This is the hardest working crew I’ve ever had the pleasure of serving with over here,” said Cantrell. “Some days are 18-hour days, but they’re still willing to go the extra mile.”"

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait – United States Army Reserve unit, 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command, and U.S. Army unit, 13th Armored Corps Sustainment Command completed a successful handover of responsibilities that culminated with a Transfer of Authority ceremony following a transition period known as relief in place at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, on Sep. 2, 2023.

1st Theater Sustainment Command deputy commanding general, Brig. Gen. Maria A. Juarez, along with 143d ESC Command Sgt. Maj. Ricardo N. Saunders, officially cased the command colors and transferred the unit’s mission to the 13th ACSC. The color casing ceremony signifies the end of the unit’s mission to provide sustainment support for Operation Spartan Shield in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.

As Juarez and Saunders cased the 143d command colors, 143d ESC Higher Headquarters Company (HHC) command team, Capt. Marlena Janes and 1st Sgt. Jacob Webb, simultaneously cased the company guidon.

Upon the 143d ESC command team’s completion of casing its respective colors and guidon, the incoming 13th ACSC command team uncased the colors and guidon for their command.

In attendance were distinguished guests, the commanding general of 1st Theater Sustainment Command, Brig. Gen. Eric P. Shirley; senior enlisted advisor to 1TSC Command Sgt. Major Albert J. Richardson, Jr., U.S. Embassy- Kuwait, Charge d' Affaires James Holtsnider, Task Force Spartan command team, and the Area Support Group – Kuwait command team.

Shirley, reviewing officer of the ceremony, opened with congratulatory remarks to Juarez and the 143d ESC “Just as the 143d ESC epitomizes the continued and vital contributions of Army Reserve forces in support of our Warfighters in theater, the incoming 13th ACSC represents that seamless integration between our components. No longer is there any distinction drawn between Active, Guard and Reserve Soldiers when it comes to supporting the mission.”

Following the commanding general’s remarks, Juarez rose to speak. “In this ever-changing theater, our role as a sustainment force requires that we find a way to support the Warfighter, regardless of terrain or obstacles, wherever they operate. This is absolutely a ‘no fail’ mission,” she stated.

Juarez spoke of the many accomplishments of the 143d ESC and thanked each section for their resilience, commitment, and unwavering support in the mission's success.

13th ACSC commanding general, Brig. Gen. Sean P. Davis ended the ceremony with acknowledgments, “We have been training for this for over a year. I have the utmost confidence in our Soldiers’ abilities to excel during this mission.” He continued, “This was the best RIP/TOA I have seen in over 20 years, thanks to the 143d.”

The 13th ACSC, based in Ft. Cavazos, Texas, enables the III Armored Corps by serving as the primary sustainment headquarters for all sustainment efforts. On order, the 13th ACSC is prepared to deploy and provide command and control of multinational and joint theater distribution, theater opening, and reception, staging, and onward movement in a multi-domain battlefield in support of the full range of military operations. This will be the 13th ACSC’s third rotation in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility since 2014.

1st Theater Sustainment Command is America’s only permanently deployed Sustainment Command in the Middle East that works alongside host nation allies and regional security partners to provide Army, Joint, and multinational sustainment solutions in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to deliver predictive and precise joint logistics, human resources, finance, health service support, and contracting capabilities to set and sustain the theater for multi-domain operations in competition or crisis."

Soldiers endure discomfort and pain for many reasons. They may do so as part of their wartime duties, or in training. Everyone reaches a point where they choose to quit or drive on. Military awards – particularly badges – are earned, not given. Each course or task demands some level of sacrifice.

Many servicemembers particularly value the chance to earn a foreign award. No badge is worn by as many U.S. servicemembers though as the German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge – GAFPB.

My introduction to the badge came as a 19-year-old draftee serving in the German Air Force, Luftwaffe, after graduating from Berlin’s John F. Kennedy School. This opportunity presented itself to me courtesy of my German mother. My American father served as a U.S. Army JAG officer attached to the U.S. embassy to Germany at the time. I recall that the sewed on GAFPBs adorning my basic training instructor’s uniforms served as a symbol of their competence and professionalism. Everyone in my unit wanted a chance to prove themselves and receive the badge.

My understanding of this particular award would evolve over time. I would earn, and then encounter, this badge throughout my career.

The badge in German is formally called the, “Abzeichen für besondere Leistungen im Truppendienst.” This term more accurately translates as, “award for special performance in military service.” In U.S. military service, we refer to it as the German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge, but it is officially the German Armed Forces Efficiency Badge.

Army Regulation 600-8-22, Military Awards, stipulates that foreign decorations will only be presented by a designated representative from the awarding nation. As such we work with our German partners as part of each event, and they generate and sign award certificates. Army Regulation 600-8-22 also includes the German Armed Forces Efficiency Badge as a specifically named foreign badge specifically authorized for acceptance and wear by both enlisted personnel and officers.

A U.S. Army commander may also approve the wear of the foreign badge. Many units publish memorandums that authorize acceptance, retention and wear of the badge or use the DA Form 4187.

Events required to receive the GAFPB include completing various sport exercises including a shuttle run, flexed arm hang, and a one-kilometer run. Servicemembers must also pass a first aid exam and demonstrate proficiency in their chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protective equipment. Pistol marksmanship is also key, with shooters required to engage three targets using five rounds. Most events conclude with the required ruck march, or the challenging 100-meter swim and uniform doff.

German servicemembers wear the badge on the left breast pocket of their utility and service uniforms, while U.S. Soldiers may only wear it on their Army Service Uniform coat and shirt and Army Green Service Uniform coat. Soldiers may only wear one foreign badge on their uniforms, centered, or aligned with the right edge of unit awards or nameplate, above the right pocket and unit awards.

The West German Bundeswehr established the award in 1971 and servicemembers of all branches may earn the badge. It is an award of the Federal Republic of Germany’s Bundeswehr and available in three steps, or levels. Gold, silver and bronze. Interestingly, the German military places more value on gold than we do in the U.S. military. U.S. O-1 rank is gold across all services and branches, while O-2 is silver. German officer rank is silver, while all general officer ranks are gold. As such the gold GAFPB is more difficult to earn than the silver or bronze.

The badge prominently features the Bundesadler – the federal eagle - surrounded by a wreath. It’s interesting and relevant that Germany and the United States of America share an affinity for the same bird and use it as national symbols.

After I left the German military, I attended university in the U.S., enlisted in the Army Reserve, and then later commissioned as a Regular Army officer. During the Basic Officer Leaders Course, German liaison officers detailed to the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence offered another opportunity to earn the GAFPB. I witnessed hundreds of young U.S. Army military police 2nd Lt.’s earn their badges.

Some years later I was assigned as provost marshal to 2d Cavalry Regiment based in Vilseck, Germany. I again saw our formations regularly host German partners during various GAFPB events. Units and individual soldiers drew close to German units and servicemembers.

Last summer I served as officer in charge during a large GAFPB event held at Camp Shelby, Miss. We worked closely with German servicemembers assigned to the German Armed Forces Command in Reston, Va. and the defense attaché staff detailed to the Federal Republic of Germany’s embassy to the United States. We hosted over 300 servicemembers during the event.

Most recently I attended the 3d U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) GAFPB event. Historic Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall served as a backdrop for the competition. Abutting Arlington Cemetery and a stone’s throw from the Pentagon, the installation is also very close to the German embassy located in Washington D.C.’s Foxhall Village neighborhood close to Georgetown. The defense attaché staff again took time to run over 250 servicemembers through each event. This time I covered the event as a public affairs officer.

Supporting GAFPB events is both time consuming and expensive for German servicemembers and their commands. Each GAFPB event may take two or three days – not including travel. This takes leaders away from their missions and staffs out of their offices. We must acknowledge the sacrifices they make as well.

So why do we go through all this effort to earn a badge? Its great training. Each event builds teams and camaraderie. Individuals reach their limits – and push past them. The badge is a visible symbol of an enduring partnership.

Over the years I watched men and women fight through pain, fatigue and doubt. This year a young soldier marched the soles off his feet, his boots red with blood and skin sloughing off. He made it past the ruck march. I’ve watched well prepared swimmers cramp up in the pool, sink to the bottom, yet manage to remove their uniform blouse and trousers to complete the swim. I’ve seen senior leaders compete alongside their young soldiers, earning a badge - and respect - after over 25 years of service.

What I enjoyed seeing most though were the conversations and insights shared between allied servicemembers before, during and after a GAFPB event. The briefest conversations between the Germans and our troops sparked interests that led to much greater understanding.

German Navy Rear Adm. Axel Ristau, the German embassy’s defense attaché, emphasized both moral and physical fitness after the latest GAFPB. He also highlighted the alliance between the two countries. “It’s a visual sign of our outstanding bilateral cooperation, and we both, the Americans and German soldiers who earn this badge, can be very proud.”

Ristau earned his badge in 1987. He marveled at how this award binds two nations together - “It’s a sign of a transatlantic link. I wear, and my comrade here, wears the same badge on a military uniform.” He told me this as 213 U.S. servicemembers, their friends and families celebrated their achievement in Fort Myer’s Conmy Hall, its massive display screen showing enmeshed German and American flags braced by the gold, silver and bronze GAFPBs.

While not as far removed from earning my badge as Ristau, I also appreciate its importance and feel much the same way. What at first to me was a badge worn by my respected instructors and superiors in the German military, has now as a U.S. Army officer become that symbol of proficiency, and of true German-American partnership.

FORT BUCHANAN, PR — A pilot program, spearheaded in Puerto Rico, called Operation Connect the Dots provided Soldiers interested in increasing their general technical (GT) scores with two weeks of training on arithmetic reasoning, vocabulary, and paragraph comprehension, July 31 – August 11.

Around 45 Army Reserve Soldiers were the first to go through the program, part of the Army's more extensive Basic Skills Education Program — generally only available for those on active duty.

Sgt. 1st Class Nicholas Rice, 166th Regional Support Group's H2F System Manager, says the Basic Skills Education Program is designed to help soldiers who may have yet to obtain the ASVAB score they wanted upon entering the service.

However, with Operation Connect the Dots, Reservists now have access to the same education materials as their active duty counterparts, according to Connie Schauer, the 88th Readiness Division education services specialist.

""The Reserves Soldiers don't have the same opportunity as the active duty soldiers many times, and this gives them a chance to further their career,"" said Schauer.

Operation Connect the Dots was initially developed to fill crucial warrant officer slots; however, it became clear that other Soldiers could benefit from the training. The course was expanded to include Soldiers looking to become commissioned officers or reclassed to different military occupational specialties.

""It took me three years to get the program started,"" said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Taj Keeler, a property accounting technician with the 166th Regional Support Group. ""Readiness is usually based on metrics such as IWQ [individual weapons qualification] and collective training, but a shortage in retention and recruiting allowed us to showcase the talents we have organically in our division.""

Sgt. 1st Class Rice added that the course was established to further their education for the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery throughout the BSEP and provide them education through the Holistic Health and Fitness system.

""What we saw internally is that a lot of junior enlisted soldiers who took the test were in high school and may not have established strong English language skills, and therefore, the test isn't necessarily indicative of their current capabilities,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Rice. ""So, we wanted to align their current capabilities with future opportunities.""

The program was designed to follow the Holistic Health and Fitness system, which focuses on five domains to build the overall readiness of Soldiers. These domains include physical, mental, nutritional, spiritual, and sleep readiness.

""Using all five domains to build a basic foundation assists Soldiers in their learning and study habits,"" said Chief Keeler. ""This way, Soldiers are in the best state of mind and have ample time to study.""

Of the 45 students enrolled, 37 could increase their score above 110, and seven Soldiers increased their line scores to change their military occupational specialty.

""We saw incredible results; 82% of the Soldiers ended up getting a GT score of 110 or higher, and the overwhelming feedback from the Soldiers is that it helped change their life, said Sgt. 1st Class Rice. ""The H2F and BSEP made that possible.""

Several students shared their thoughts after the program.

""I saw this as an opportunity to do something better and to improve my score to get more opportunities,"" said Private 1st Class Jenifer Restos, 420th Quartermaster Company. ""I can be an officer, or I can reclass. I can do better with this higher score, and anything can come out of this.""

However, improving their scores was one of the many benefits of the course.

""I feel like I can do anything; whatever I put my mind to, I will accomplish it,"" said Spc. Jomar Gonzales, from the 215th Military Police Detachment. ""It feels great to be a part of this. I hope this happens more; this is going to help a lot of people.""

While the idea is, at the end of this course, each of the Soldiers would increase their GT score, Sgt. 1st Class Rice affirmed they would leave knowing the brigade cared about them and provided a system designed to improve them and their families.

Throughout the two weeks, the participants were encouraged to wear civilian clothes. Chief Keeler said this provided a more cohesive learning space where ranks were not a factor.

""So many Soldiers have barriers going into training; I wanted to appeal to their human side,"" said Chief Keeler. ""This way, they would be open to building better relationships with their classmates.""

The most crucial factor to consider is how this program can be viewed as a retention tool for the Reserves.

""These soldiers are the future and will help fill your ranks,"" said Schauer. ""If you don't challenge them, you'll lose them. If they're not being challenged, they're not going to stay. This is a way to help them jump-start their career.""

Chief Keeler estimates that at least 40 participants will be able to fill some of the critical slots in the unit. He says that by investing in them, they can see what they can achieve.

With Lt. Gen. Jody J. Daniels' focus on shaping tomorrow. Chief Keeler offers his perspective on the initiative.

""Shaping tomorrow by focusing on current soldiers,"" said Chief Keeler. ""These Soldiers will most likely be in front of the formation of incoming Soldiers in 2030. We need to continue to build them up so that the new Soldiers are coming into a safe environment, free of SHARP, EO incidents, and IG complaints. Giving them the tools to give back that's the overall goal of Operation Connect the Dots."""

JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, Va. — With family, friends and members of the Army’s Military Police Corps in attendance, Lt. Gen. Donna Martin, Army inspector general, awarded Capt. Luis R. Avila the Order of the Marechausse, silver, during a ceremony at the Memorial Chapel on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Aug. 23.

The award is one of the highest honors given to a military police member by the Military Police Regimental Association, and it recognizes a degree of professionalism, high standards of integrity and morality and esprit de corps.

“I can’t think of a more deserving Soldier and member of our regiment to receive this honor,” Martin said. “Today, we are here because the impossible was made possible with faith, family, courage and prayers.”

On his fifth combat deployment in December 2011, Avila was leading his company from the 720th Military Police Battalion on a search and rescue mission in Afghanistan when a 600-pound improvised explosive device detonated underneath his vehicle, splitting it in half, Martin explained.

The explosion killed three of Avila’s Soldiers and left him severely wounded. He lost his left leg, suffered two heart attacks and two strokes, and a lack of oxygen caused brain damage. The injuries he sustained left him almost completely paralyzed.

Two weeks after the attack, he arrived back in the U.S. in a coma and on life support. His family would stay by his side morning and night, continuing to have faith that he would recover. They prayed and started playing some of his favorite music in the hospital room.

“During those dark days, the family remained steady in their faith in God, and in Luis’ will to survive,” Martin explained. “When their faith was tested, they turned to music.”

Miraculously, Luis’ facial muscles began to twitch, and he eventually woke up from the coma after 40 days. However, he couldn’t eat, speak or see for more than three years.

Luis and his family never gave up hope, and they continued to play music. He even used music therapy as part of his rehabilitation.

“I think what has been very important going through my husband's road of recovery has been his courage and discipline to do things,” his wife Claudia said. “Since the day that he was capable of listening and understanding, he has been working on how to get better.”

He has taken on the challenge of recovery with the help of the medical team at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and the support system around him.

""It takes a strong family to endure hardship,"" Martin said. ""I can attest that the Avila family is the strongest family I've ever had the honor to know.""

With that support and through years of rehabilitation, Avila has regained some movement in his hands, leg and part of his speech. He now sings at many events throughout the National Capital Region.

He performed on television during the 28th National Memorial Day Concert at the U.S. Capitol in 2017 and during the Joint Chiefs of Staff change of command ceremony in 2019. He also sang twice during his Order of the Marechausse award ceremony.

“It's an extreme honor to receive this award, and I am extremely grateful for my [military police] brothers and sisters that have supported me along the way,” he said. “We really appreciate all you do for us, your service and sacrifice to our nation.”

The Military Police Regimental Association established the Order of the Marechausse in 2000 to recognize exceptional dedication, competence and contribution to the regiment. The award is presented in either gold, silver, bronze, or steel, based on the impact and years of service to the regiment.

Today, there are nearly 500 recipients of the silver medal.

“Capt. Avila is truly a role model for all Soldiers, peers and subordinates alike,” Martin said. “I know I speak for all of us here today when I say that the Military Police Corps Regiment is blessed to have you, Luis, as a member of our family.”

Avila continues to recover from his injuries. He has completed four Army Ten-Miler races on a bike with his son, finishing in first place in his category one year, and has won multiple gold and silver medals at the DOD Warrior Games.

She helped at least 70 enslaved people escape through the route of the Underground Railroad. (Courtesy Photo) (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — Harriet Tubman etched her place in history while traversing long distances and guiding runaway slaves to freedom.

But historians also credit the Maryland native as being the first female to lead a combat regiment when she spearheaded a Union Army raid during the Civil War.

To honor Tubman’s contributions to the U.S. military and her lifetime achievements, the Army Surgeon General and Army Chaplain Corps hosted a ceremony in Washington Wednesday to pay tribute to the woman who freed at least 70 slaves while making about 13 trips back to Maryland 170 years ago.

“When Harriet Tubman was making her mark on our world, people likely didn’t really see her,” said Maj. Gen. Deb Kotulich, Army Recruiting and Retention Task Force director. “She was able to slip in and out spaces often unseen because those around her didn’t expect her to have to ability to do anything out of the ordinary.”

“But she was … helping our military, saving lives and ultimately impacting the course of the U.S. Army’s fight against the Confederacy.”

On June 2, 1863, Tubman led 150 African American Union Soldiers in the Combahee Ferry Raid, an operation that rescued more than 700 slaves according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Wednesday’s ceremony celebrated the operation’s 160th anniversary this past summer, and next month will mark 174 years since Tubman made her escape to freedom.

Tubman served as a nurse and Union spy, using her navigation skills that she developed during her time travelling on the Underground Railroad. Tubman, already familiar with the terrain and clandestine activities in the region, helped the Union with raid planning and went on reconnaissance missions.

Tubman’s abilities helped educate future generations of Soldiers on the importance of battlefield sustainment. The Military Intelligence Corps inducted Tubman into its Hall of Fame in June 2021.

“She knew the field, she knew the environment, and she knew what was happening in the world where she conducted her operations,” said Maj. Gen. Heidi Hoyle, acting deputy chief of staff, logistics.

In 1865, the Army’s 12th Surgeon General, Joseph Barnes, appointed Tubman as nurse matron at Fort Monroe’s Colored Hospital in Hampton, Virginia. Tubman also travelled to Florida to treat and cure Union Soldiers with cases of dysentery, an infection of the intestines. Tubman used natural herbs to cure the Soldiers of the ailment, which became one of the leading causes of death during the Civil War.

A skilled cook, Tubman voluntarily baked goods to give Union troops energy while also preparing meals for the injured and the hospital staff. According to the Fort Sam Houston Museum, a young Tubman learned to bring food into the field while helping her father, an enslaved forester.

“I have no doubt that she heard all her life with a small stature and being a woman and an African American, what she could not do,” Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Scott Dingle said. “But Harriet did not let that stop her … because she knew based on the rooting and the word of God, that she had a mission in this world.”

Tubman earned a distinction for her field prowess before the Civil War began. After a June 1858 meeting in Niagara Falls, Ontario, abolitionist John Brown nicknamed her “General” Tubman, impressed by her bravery.

Tubman herself was born into bondage in Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Although she eventually escaped slavery on an arduous, 90-mile trek to Philadelphia, she returned to her home state again and again to liberate family members.

Although she stood only 5-foot-2 and suffered from headaches and narcolepsy, Tubman navigated her way through forests and rugged terrain to guide slaves to Northern states and Canada. While enslaved, an overseer threw a metal weight that landed on her head, causing her to suffer from hallucinations for the rest of her life.

During her night rescues of slaves, Tubman eluded men on horseback while traversing the countryside on foot.

“She was illiterate, so she couldn’t read the signs or which way to go,” Dingle said during a ceremony attended by Tubman’s great-great-great grandniece, Ernestine Wyatt. “But she had an invictus spirit.”

A devout Christian, Tubman turned to her faith to preserve through the most difficult times. Tubman managed to evade capture while leading slaves out of captivity said Col. Karen Meeker, MEDCOM command chaplain.

“Her faith was everything,” Meeker said. “It gave her the strength to overcome all the things that she faced in her life. It gave her a mission, a very high calling.”

Dingle said Tubman learned to overcome her small stature while cutting wood during her years in bondage.

“The physical labors prepared her to be the ‘Moses’ of the underground railroad – to lead in the harshest winter at times,” Dingle said.

In addition to her time at Fort Monroe, Tubman also served as a nurse in Washington D.C. and Beaufort, South Carolina. The Army lauded her Wednesday for her contributions to Army medicine, her missions as a Soldier and being a freedom fighter.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico – The 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, hosted this year’s largest Army counterintelligence exercise July 8-21, 2023 to increase proficiency through realistic scenario-based training.

Vigilant Defender 23 holds the distinction of being the first ever counterintelligence battalion echelon culminating training event conducted, and the largest counterintelligence focused exercise ever under U.S. Army Reserve Command. Approximately 200 personnel participated, of which about 120 were counterintelligence agents.

Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, and surrounding San Juan provided the perfect backdrop for the exercise. As the only federal military installation in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, the 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) leveraged locations and trained in an environment with deep Hispanic and Latin American cultural ties.

The unit’s training objectives included completing realistic, full spectrum counterintelligence operations in scenario-based exercises that replicated real world conditions. Planners focused the exercise design on notional support to theater level intelligence support. The unit tailored counterintelligence training around conducting operations in a true Spanish language environment. This allowed counterintelligence agents and analysts to work with interpreters and overcome language barriers which enhanced realism.

Lt. Col. Cope, 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) commander emphasized the importance of training in Puerto Rico. “The predominant language here is Spanish, it's good for our agents who do not speak Spanish to come here and try to operate and navigate through this area.” He believes that the realism will serve agents well. “This makes them more adaptable and resilient to different environments.”

The Army Reserve’s 1st Mission Support Command supported training. Aside from coordinating world-class facilities on the installation, their Soldiers served as exercise role players. 1st Mission Support Command is headquartered on Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.

Cope singled out Col. Carlos Caceres, commander of the 1st Mission Support Command. “Without his full support, I don't think this exercise would have been at this level.” Cope added that Caceres’ personal involvement proved invaluable. “He brought in all his local contacts with the state police, Army Reserve, National Guard, FBI. He invited whoever was out there to come meet with us to discuss our event.”

Vigilant Defender 23 tested and validated the battalion’s ability to operate in a multi-component and interagency environment. 18 units and organizations participated. Army units came from across all three components. Multiple federal partners also participated and provided input.

U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command supported the exercise with participants and evaluators. Leaders acknowledged the close and growing relationship between the 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) and U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command. The battalion leveraged Counterintelligence Command’s real-world expertise to enhance the exercise’s realism.

Maj. Dan Burnett, 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence) operations officer described the intricacies of coordinating such a complex event. “The real challenge in the reserve component is always conducting properly planned resourced and executed training. The Interrogation Group, and the Military Intelligence Readiness Command, all the way up to U.S. Army Reserve Command, did nothing but support this exercise.” He also acknowledged the Southeast Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center that dispatched numerous additional evaluators.

Burnett added that he believes all the effort was worth it. “We feel that this is a challenging exercise that is pushing the limits of our agents and analytic elements. And we really think that this is going to be a tremendous, memorable growth opportunity for all parties involved.”

The exercise task organization established field offices that reported to a regional headquarters. Each field office included a staff supporting a Special Agent in Charge (SAC) and military intelligence analyst support.

The robust exercise white cell scripted detailed scenarios designed to facilitate counterintelligence operations task training and evaluation. They also closely managed role players and coordinated observer controller – trainers. It took almost 8 months to write the scenarios, injects, and prepare supporting materials.

The 752nd Military Intelligence Battalion staff completed a staff exercise during Vigilant Defender 23 and received a 1st Army, U.S. Forces Command, external evaluation.

Col. Brent Stalder, Interrogation Group commander and Cmd. Sgt. Maj. Alexander McMillan, Interrogation Group command sergeant major, flew in to observe training and hosted a town hall July 14 in Fort Buchanan’s Ramos Hall.

Counterintelligence agents also conducted Threat Awareness and Reporting Program (TARP) training for individuals and units on Fort Buchanan. TARP is a counterintelligence agent led live-event annual training requirement for all Department of the Army personnel.

Many counterintelligence agents received a tier II certification in line with the Military Intelligence Training Strategy (MITS) through their participation in the exercise. Will-train Soldiers also received valuable experience as a precursor to the Counterintelligence Agent Course - CIAC.

Burnett sees the exercise as a model worth emulating. “We really hope that Vigilant Defender becomes the flagship counterintelligence event on an annual basis. We want to continue to partner and link together the active and reserve components for our mutual benefit.”

752nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Counterintelligence), Interrogation Group, Military Intelligence Readiness Command, is based at Fort Meade, Md. and supports U.S. Army Forces Command units, while providing support to U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command. Counterintelligence units are capable of detecting, identifying, neutralizing, and exploiting foreign intelligence activities, international terrorists, insider threats, and other foreign adversaries. The overall counterintelligence mission involves protecting the U.S. Army and DOD’s strategic advantages.

On a rainy Monday morning, 57 U.S. Army Soldiers started a weeklong journey in pursuit of a special honor.

For only the second time, the Army Reserve hosted an event for candidates of the Expert Soldier Badge, held Aug. 14-18, 2023, at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. Members of all three Army components (active duty, Army Reserve and National Guard) were invited to participate.

Earning this badge is no small feat. Soldiers must complete a variety of mental and physical challenges, and any slip up could mean going home.

Of the 57 candidates this year, only 16 remained at the end, standing tall as their shiny new badges were pinned to their uniform.

“I'm very happy,” said Spc. Dominic Chrisostomo, a member of the 1224th Engineer Company, part of the Guam National Guard, upon earning the badge. “I'm happy that I stayed in. I continued mission. I kept going and didn't let anything get me down, and I just kept moving forward.”

Throughout the week, these candidates had to complete tasks — 30 in total — related to weapon systems, medical and patrol knowledge. With only a single no-go allowed per day, the pressure was on.

Surprisingly, anticipation was one of the hardest parts of the event, according to Pfc. Tyson Clark, U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne).

“Especially when we're going through the lanes, the medical lanes, patrol lanes,” Clark said, “like trying to lay in bed at night, and you've got all these different tasks going through your head, and you can't sleep because you're stressed out.”

Clark was one of three Soldiers to earn the Straight Edge title, meaning he was perfect in every task.

“I guess I got lucky,” Clark said of the achievement. “I didn't mess up any of my tasks, but yeah, it was a wild ride.”

The ESB is open to all Soldiers (noncommissioned officers, warrant officers and officers) who are not serving in the infantry, special forces or medical branches and who demonstrate individual abilities to perform basic Soldier tasks.

Chrisostomo appreciated the chance to become reacquainted with those tasks after a couple years of focusing on his military occupational specialty.

“Being here, it kind of brings us back to pretty much our infantry side,” Chrisostomo said, “where we get tested upon this: patrols, the weapons, the medical. It brings back our level 10, and it ensures that we're still experts in our fields.”

More than just another decoration to wear on their uniforms, the badge represents the trials that candidates have overcome to show their expertise.

“It's a way to show other people the profession that we're in,” said Lt. Col. Joseph Proctor, 863rd Engineer Battalion commander. “When you're in any type of profession, you have to show other people what to aspire to. It's something that shows those who came before who's now and who's coming next.”

By earning this badge, Soldiers join an elite group and are then able to become graders at future events, passing on their knowledge and help to Soldiers.

When asked about coming back to help, Clark said he would be interested.

“I know it was very challenging for the graders, especially being here over a month,” Clark said, “even longer days than we had to endure. But I think it'd be a really cool experience to come back, train other Soldiers and help them experience the same thing and to also earn their badge.”

In addition to the tasks, Soldiers must also complete an Expert Physical Fitness Assessment, day and night land navigation, and a 12-mile ruck march. Failure to pass any of these requirements results in disqualification for the badge.

When asked if there was anything else to say, Proctor shared his appreciation for how the event was conducted.

“I think I did the math,” Proctor said, “and it was almost a one-to-one ratio of cadre and support staff to each one of us, if not more.”

Such individual attention is “a testament to what the U.S. Army is willing to put into the training that they did,” he continued, “and it's a testament of the Soldiers’ and staff's willingness to support our training. I wanted to say thank you to them.”"

U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael E. Langley, U.S. Africa Command commander, visited Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti on Aug. 16, 2023, as part of his official visit to the East Africa region.

During his visit, Langley patched Soldiers of the 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, South Carolina National Guard, to commemorate the unit's service in a combat zone in support of the Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa mission. After the patching ceremony, Langley shared some words of advice and encouragement with the Soldiers.

“Our service members are consummate professionals and perform incredibly well during their assignment here in the Horn of Africa,” Langley said. “Visits like this allow me to thank them for their service and physically show them that this command team supports their dedication to duty.”

The patching ceremony was just one part of Langley’s visit. He also met with Djiboutian President Guelleh to explore ways to enhance the partnership and cooperation between the United States and Djibouti.

The delegation went over a variety of topics, including economic development, regional defense and security, and the fight against terrorism.

“We discussed how we can work together to achieve our common security goals and expand our partnership,” said Langley. “Given our diplomatic, defense, and development engagements – what we call ‘Three Ds’ – in the region, the U.S. and Djibouti share aligned security and prosperity goals.”

Langley noted that Djibouti is a key U.S. partner and vital to regional development and establishing peace and stability.

“Solutions to these colossal problems must be a shared burden, with African nations at the helm of concerted international efforts and a U.S. whole-of-nation contribution that produces sustainable outcomes,” said Langley.

President Guelleh and Langley also talked about the numerous security challenges facing the region and about Djibouti’s various contributions throughout the region.

“Under the leadership of President Guelleh, Djibouti is playing an essential role in achieving peace and stability,” said Langley. “The country is contributing to peacekeeping and counterterrorism efforts in Somalia.”"

CHICAGO – The Chicago Cubs honored Capt. Michael Ariola, a public affairs officer assigned to the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, during their Military Salute at the Crosstown Series versus the Chicago White Sox, August 16, 2023, at Wrigley Field.

Ariola was born in Chicago and raised in south suburban Darien and Downers Grove. He credits his family’s tradition of serving in the Army with his decision to join the Army.

“Both of my grandfathers served in the Army during World War II,” he said. “My maternal grandfather served as an air traffic controller in the Army Air Corps in the European Theatre and my paternal grandfather served in the Armor Corps in the Pacific Theatre.”

When the time came to serve, Ariola enlisted as a commissioned officer candidate and attended Basic Combat Training and Officer Candidate School at Fort Moore, Georgia. He received his commission as an Armor officer.

“I decided to become an armor officer because I wanted to serve in combat arms. Being part of a tank crew was very appealing to me, “said Ariola. “Maneuvering in a tank during training is very exciting and in a combat scenario, an Abrams tank provides substantial protection and tremendous firepower.”

On active duty, Ariola was stationed at Camp Casey about 40 miles north of Seoul, South Korea for two years.

“I served as a tank platoon leader and executive officer with the 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Brigade Combat team,” said Ariola.

Ariola left active duty after sustaining an injury and transitioned into the Individual Ready Reserve. During that time, he worked on his master’s degree in international affairs at the University of California, San Diego.

“Near the end of my degree program, I received several phone calls from the Army Reserve asking if I would like to join an active Army Reserve unit. I missed the camaraderie of military life, so I accepted a public affairs position with the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command,” said Ariola.

A job he finds highly rewarding with the flexibility to serve part time while pursuing a full-time career.

“I enjoy being a public affairs officer because I find it very rewarding to tell the Army Reserve story. It’s an honor to highlight the accomplishments of the disciplined, motivated, and patriotic men and women of the United States Army Reserve, while helping to improve awareness of the Army’s presence, mission, and commitment to the American people,” said Ariola. “Being a public affairs officer allows me to work with diverse civic groups, local and national media organizations, sports teams, local governments and educational institutions.”"

WASHINGTON — The Army took its next step in bolstering its top modernization priority with a successful launch of the Tomahawk missile from its mid-range capability prototype system on June 27, showcasing the potential of its newest, ground-based missile launcher.

Soldiers from the 1st Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington and Sailors from the Navy Program Executive Office Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons Office took part in the joint, live-fire exercise that demonstrated the system’s full operational capability. Earlier this year, the Army fired an SM-6 missile from the mid-range capability. The launches occurred at undisclosed test sites.

The Navy uses the Tomahawk, an intermediate-range, subsonic, cruise missile to strike targets from 1,000 miles away and can switch destinations in mid-flight.

The Army eventually plans to field an MRC battery which will be assigned to a strategic fires battalion under a multi-domain task force. The battery’s prototype design consists of four launchers and a control center.

Soldiers contributed to the design and testing of the Mid-Range Capability weapon system, which the Army will use to augment its long-range, precision fires capability.

“From the start of the [Mid-Range Capability] program, Soldiers and Sailors have collaborated to provide the Army with this important capability,” wrote the Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. “Soldiers have consistently participated in each phase of the development, training and testing of the MRC and continue to provide useful feedback.”

The MRC system will eventually support the joint, multi-domain mission. The SM-6 missile can engage multiple threats including terminal ballistic missile defense, anti-air warfare and anti-ship strike roles.

Improvements by near peer adversaries in their long-range artillery systems present possible threats to U.S. forces. The Chinese military has leveraged unmanned aerial vehicles or UAV, to produce precision munitions and greater target acquisition.

The Army made long-range precision fires its top modernization priority to upgrade and bolster its artillery and missile systems while developing hypersonic weapons and long-range cannons.

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO CAMP BULLIS, Texas – U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers assigned to the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater), Military Intelligence Readiness Command, conducted a variety of military intelligence exercises and other training as part of Rapidly Engaged 23, July 8-28, 2023.

Exercise Rapidly Engaged 23 was the culmination of over a year of planning and preparation. It provided Soldiers the opportunity to refresh their military skills in a simulated deployed environment.

“This was a great opportunity for us to test our skills, work together, and learn in a safe but challenging environment,” said U.S. Army Reserve Col. Ronald Bahl, commander of the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “There are very real applications for all the training we conducted. It was important that we take this seriously and make the most of it.”

U.S. Army Reserve Col. Melissa Adamski, the Military Intelligence Readiness Command commander, visited Camp Bullis, Texas, where she was able to connect with Soldiers, engage, and review lessons learned with the participating units. It was a unique opportunity for the Military Intelligence Readiness Command to gather knowledge that will be used in planning future annual training events.

Bahl relinquished command of the brigade to U.S. Army Reserve Col. Frederick Turner at the conclusion of Rapidly Engaged. Col. Adamski presided over the change of command ceremony. “I am taking command of a great organization with great Soldiers ready to keep learning and improving their skills,” said Turner, incoming commander of the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater).

Turner has had a distinguished military career including both active duty and reserve time. He joins the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) after departing his previous post where he served as the chief of the Intelligence Security Cooperation and Engagement Division at U.S. Africa Command.

During the training exercise, Soldiers were put through various simulated situations. They had to perform their assigned duties to accomplish their mission. Soldiers were trained on intelligence tasks, maintenance operations, and combat casualty care.

Soldiers assigned to 383rd Military Intelligence Battalion (Theater Support) and Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) set up and maintained TROJAN based communications during the exercise. Working together, both units maximized their efforts and completed their mission objectives, giving them an edge for future training and real-world operations.

The realistic training environment facilitated the cooperation between the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater), U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), and the U.S. Army Northern Command (NORTHCOM) G2. Soldiers participated in synchronized intelligence, communications, and security operations intended to build future cooperative capabilities.

“It is incredible seeing the whole brigade coming together as one,” said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Broday Winton, a human resource specialist with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “Being able to function and operate as a team in an environment where you have multiple things going on at once and still completing all your tasks was a great feeling.”

A training highlight was the Combat Casualty Care Course (C4). 23 Soldiers participated and completed the 4-day long course.

“It was a great experience being able to get this quality training alongside my unit,” said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Ashley Bailey, a signals intelligence analyst assigned to the 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “I loved how everyone was so willing to help, teach and mentor me on a broad set of topics I didn’t know a lot about.” This was Bailey’s first battle assembly and annual training with a reserve unit after returning from her 7 month-long advanced individual training (AIT).

Besides intelligence and training operations, mechanics put in effort to boost the overall readiness of the brigade’s equipment. “It was amazing seeing our maintenance Soldiers at the motor pool working hard every day,” said U.S. Army Reserve Capt. Jose Lucio, commander of Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater). “These Soldiers completed over 100 work orders during the exercise and were able to exponentially increase our overall readiness for future operations.”

The 505th Military Intelligence Brigade (Theater) is a multi-component unit that provides information and intelligence support to Army and joint forces to support the range of military activities in Northern Command's area of operations."

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army combined the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center with the Australian Combat Training Centre for a one-of-a-kind collaboration during Talisman Sabre 23 in Townsville, Australia earlier this month.

The merged training center, led by Australia, tested nearly 10,000 troops from multiple partner nations during a 10-day field training exercise.

""Big exercises like this are where we can induce the fog and friction of stress,” said U.S. Army Col. Bryan Martin, Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center operations group commander. “[They are] the closest we can get to actual real combat on our respective combined forces, so that when that day comes, that they're trained and they're ready.""

The scenario called for the joint force to protect a chain of islands from an invading large hostile nation.

The enemy force, which was made up of service members from the participating countries, was given tasks and could make decisions to achieve their mission.

This allowed commanders to train their forces in a scenario and environment that could be encountered in the Pacific.

""This activity that's occurring here is just the richest, most immersive and most realistic, no-consequence training environment that we can possibly create,"" said Australian Army Col. Ben McLennan, Australian Defence Force's Combat Training Centre commander.

This was the first time the U.S. Army merged combat training centers with a partner nation.

Soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division combined with service members from Germany, Indonesia and Australia to form a task force under Australian command to expel the enemy force.

During the training, there was also a virtual portion. This allowed commanders to handle simulated battles, as well as having to deal with electronic warfare and cyberattacks.

“The Australian Army hasn’t participated in something of this magnitude since 1918,” McLennan said. “It’s energizing to be involved in an enterprise enabling the best of our teams to reach their highest performing potential.”

This was the third and final training rotation of the year for the JPMRC.

JPMRC was established nearly three years ago to provide realistic training opportunities for U.S. service members and partner nations in the Indo-Pacific. It’s the first new combat training center outside the continental U.S. in 50 years.

The center executes three training rotations annually, one in the terrains of the Hawaiian Islands, one in Alaska’s extremely cold weather, and one at a satellite location of an allied or partner nation in the region, such as Australia.

The rotations are run by the 196th Infantry Brigade, the training support brigade in the Indo-Pacific, with support from the 25th Infantry Division and the 11th Airborne Division. The training is a joint venture with participation from every U.S. military branch. There is also involvement from multinational partners including Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia.

Each exercise is built upon a multifaceted simulation. This system incorporates real-time feedback by employing virtual and constructive effects across multiple levels, which immerses participants in a comprehensive training environment.

“This allows us to keep trained and ready forces available and forward in the region,” said Gen. Charles Flynn, U.S. Army Pacific commander, during a media roundtable earlier this fiscal year. “It allows us to generate readiness in environments and in conditions that we’re most likely to operate in … It allows us to rehearse with a number of joint and multinational partners.”

Each fall, the team holds the first rotation of the year in Hawaii to train in jungle warfighting. They use the entire island chain with fictional battles taking place simultaneously in multiple locations.

The second rotation takes place in Alaska in the spring. This is an artic-focused training exercise. The final rotation is held in the summer at a satellite location like the one used during Talisman Sabre in Australia.

These joint service/multinational training rotations help strengthen partnerships and build on their combined defense capabilities.

""The landpower network is a key component in the security architecture that helps keep the Indo-Pacific region safe, free and open because it protects national sovereignty — something that’s very important to each of our allies and partners,” Flynn said. “The interoperability and close relationships we build while training together within the landpower network is a key advantage in competition and, if necessary, in conflict.”

CASS LAKE, Minn. - What started off as just another routine annual training event here quickly developed into something much more for one Army Reserve Soldier, who found herself on the front lines of saving lives in a real-world situation that she won’t soon forget.

“It was surreal, it was unexpected,” said U.S. Army Reserve Spc. Ana Baker, a healthcare specialist, assigned to the 399th Field Hospital, 803rd Hospital Center, 804th Medical Brigade, 3rd Medical Command.

Baker was here with her unit conducting a real-life medical assistance mission with the local civilian community providing no cost dental and medical care as part of an Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) mission. The IRT was part of Operation Walking Shield, a joint medical assistance operation with the Minnesota Army National Guard.

""The Innovative Readiness Training missions provide patient care to select communities within the United States,” said Capt. Jamie Eastman, company commander, 451st Medical Detachment, 405th Field Hospital. “They are not only a benefit to those communities in need, but also to the Soldiers who are involved in providing care by helping them to maintain proficiency in their medical skills.”

During the community mission, the Emergency Medical Services provider for the region offered ride-along shifts in their ambulances to the Soldiers who are healthcare specialists. This provided an opportunity for the Soldiers to gain civilian EMS experience in addition to performing their primary IRT mission.

“EMS ride-alongs and hospital clinical experiences are vital for ensuring proficiency of U.S. Army medical providers,” said Eastman. “Many National Guard and Reserve Soldiers have a civilian medical career to maintain proficiency, but not all have the capability. Training opportunities like this ensure Soldiers are ready to respond when the mission calls.”

It was on one of these ride-alongs that Baker’s otherwise normal day would quickly change into one filled with excitement and drama. “I was scheduled to go with the ambulance crew for a few hours that afternoon,” said Baker, who had never been in an ambulance before. “I had heard Soldiers who had gone earlier in the day talking about how it was boring and that nothing had happened, so I took a book to read expecting to have plenty of down time. About 20 minutes into the shift the EMTs (emergency medical technicians) got a call and they just said, ‘we gotta go’. I just thought, oh my goodness what is going on.”

Within moments the ambulance roared to life. With the siren blaring and emergency lights flashing, Baker and her EMS crew quickly made their way to the scene of a motor vehicle collision that had left a pregnant mother and her three young children in desperate need of emergency trauma care.

“I was riding in the back of the ambulance on the way there and I was nervous and excited and wondering what to expect,” said Baker. “I managed to put on my reflective vest and gloves and was just watching the EMTs and following their cues.

When we stopped, I could see a car that had ran off the road and had slammed into a tree backwards. There were several people already on the scene, and one of them, a bystander, handed me an 18-month-old boy, who had been involved in the collision. I took him into the back of the ambulance where I helped take his vital signs and assess him for injures.”

Soon another child from the accident would be brought into the ambulance as well. This time it was a two-year-old girl who had a large bump on her forehead.

Baker, who has a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications and psychology, spent the next hour on the scene with the children, doing her best to keep them calm and entertained while the responding emergency medical personnel called for a life-flight helicopter for the mother. Eventually the children would be treated and released to family members on the scene.

“It was an unfortunate situation, but it’s real life, and sometimes bad things happen in real life,” said Baker, a native of Jamaica. “I learned a lot from this experience. I saw how the EMTs approached the scene, how they interacted with the patients and young children and how they had a special approach to dealing with people in a situation like that to help them not only physically, but emotionally as well.”

Baker remembered how her Army medical training had helped prepare her for the stressful situation. “In our initial training we had a civilian instructor that would shout at us and really put a lot of added stress and pressure on us,” she said. “I see now why he did that. That added level of stress in my training helped me be calm during this real-life situation.”

Not only did those on the scene witness Baker’s calm demeanor and helpful medical expertise, but she also made an impression on her superiors.

""Spc. Baker is a passionate and motivated Soldier in our field hospital,” said Eastman. “Her drive and character were put to the challenge during this motor vehicle collision, where she was able to provide patient care in conjunction with the EMTs from the Leech Lake Ambulance. We are proud of her and the service she provided to the community.""

Looking to the future, Baker says she is hoping to get promoted soon, and is looking for an opportunity to deploy. “I want to deploy and see what that’s like,” she said. “While I’m serving in the Army Reserve I’ll continue to look forward to my annual training and just soak up as much information I can.”

She also plans to take additional classes to help her prepare for a future leadership role.

With her unit training complete and the incident now a memory, Baker reflects back on that incredible day. “I was in the right place at the right time,” she said. “It opened my eyes to a lot of things, and it’s an experience I’ll definitely remember for years to come.”"

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Army is working on a new Antiterrorism Strategic Plan that is scheduled to roll out this fiscal year.

The plan, which is being coordinated with the Department of Defense, will update policy, training, exercises and how the Army analyzes and shares information about terrorism.

“The threats we faced 20 years ago aren’t the threats we face today, nor are they the threats we will face in the future,” said Maj. Gen. Duane R. Miller, Army provost marshal general. “Our adversaries are constantly evolving with the use of technology to identify vulnerabilities. It’s through this strategic plan that we hope to address any vulnerabilities and any threats we may face in the future.”

The program will help put Army civilians, contractors, Soldiers and their families on common ground with the service’s antiterrorism goals and objectives moving forward, he added.

The Army’s Antiterrorism Division worked with multiple federal organizations, including the Department of Homeland Security, as they developed the antiterrorism program. This allowed them to share information on best practices and emerging technologies that could pose a threat.

Training, education and awareness remain the key elements in the service’s efforts to prevent terrorism at home and overseas, Miller said.

“The more aware our community members are, the more likely we are to obtain advanced warning to defend against terrorist attacks,” he said. “Constant vigilance, timely threat reporting, knowledge of antiterrorism prevention measures and Army leadership advocacy are vital to sustained prevention.”

August is dedicated as Antiterrorism Awareness Month to educate members of the Army on the threat and provide information on how to prevent acts of terrorism.

“Soldiers who are aware of the risks and who report concerning behavior can help prevent threats from impacting the local community,” he said. “Don’t be a bystander. Do your part as a member of the team.”

According to Miller, the fight against terrorism has shifted in recent years from terrorist groups overseas to individual domestic terrorists fueled by extremist ideologies.

To combat the evolving threat, the Army has updated the antiterrorism program and continues to look for ways to improve protection efforts. The service is continuing to field and expand the capability of the Joint Analytic Real-time Virtual Information Sharing System.

JARVISS is a desktop and mobile application that pulls information from more than 80,000 sources to give commanders real-time data on potential threats, so they can make informed decisions.

Along with advances in technology, the Army and the National Guard continue to conduct annual exercises to stay ready. The Ohio National Guard held their emergency response exercise in April with support from local emergency services.

The exercise evaluated how the responding agencies can affect control and containment of the situation as well as the effectiveness of the facilities’ response capabilities.

National Guard units from 12 states along with multiple federal and local agencies completed an emergency response exercise at the Anchorage Fire Department Fire Training Center in June. The training is designed to maintain readiness, validate response procedures and collaborate with partners.

These efforts, along with others throughout the service, allow the Army and local partners to stay vigilant in the fight against terrorism.

“We must understand the threat and be prepared to prevent any impact on Army readiness,” Miller said. “We’re confident the outcomes from implementing the strategy will align policy, training, doctrine, partnerships and information sharing to meet the challenges of terrorism over the horizon.”

Army personnel can report suspicious behavior to their chain of command or submit a report online through INSCOM's iSALUTE form.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than 30 U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group (NE-MARSG) and the Western Medical Area Readiness Support Group (WE-MARSG) downtrace units, Army Reserve Medical Command; have been sent to the National Capitol Region (NCR) in support of the NCR Low Density Medical Skills Sustainment Training, August 6-19, 2023. Additionally, a subset of U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers under 807th Medical Command (Deployment Support) and 3rd MCDS echelons have joined their AR-MEDCOM brethren to augment the mission.

Also known as the NCR 68-Series operation, the NCR LDMSST is a twelvefold and collaborative effort between the three aforesaid USAR medical commands to provide medical caregiver, laboratory, and logistical support to Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, the DiLorenzo Pentagon Health Center (DPHC) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).

""The mission of the AR-MEDCOM Soldiers is for them to backfill on shortages that the training facilities have, which is very large,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Master Sgt. Dexter Hilliman, the senior logistics noncommissioned officer of the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group (NE-MARSG), Staten Island, New York; and the coordinator/noncommissioned officer-in-charge of the National Capitol Region 68-Series operation. ""With all of these (Military Occupational Specialties) being available, and from the two or three training meetings that we have here, they gave us a list of MOSs and the amount of Soldiers that they help with. We were able to fill 80 percent of that on our first rotation, and we will fill over 90 percent on the second rotation because we have a lot more Soldiers that came in than the first rotation.""

U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Alex Steward, a combat medic assigned to the 7457th Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Richmond, Virginia, said that although he has civilian job experience in emergency room settings, the real-world training environment in the DPHC presented him with new insights.

""As a junior-enlisted Soldier, it helps humanize some of the upper-ranking people,"" Steward said. ""Before here, I had very little experience with high-ranking officers and high-ranking senior enlisted. So to be able to take care of them is a lot more helpful to make me be able to understand that they are also people. I mean, they have rank and they have been in the military longer than I've been alive, but it is good to be able to (get) experience and talk to them.""

In adherence with the ""tough, realistic training"" doctrinal mantra of the Army Reserve, training participants attain the dual benefit of working in real-world environments whilst improving upon their knowledge and skill sets.

""What I like to call this mission is the National Capitol Region's strategic partnership,"" said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Dominic Payne, the deputy commanding officer of the NE-MARSG. ""When you call it a strategic partnership, that means that both sides are getting everything done better. And when we talk about realistic training, you cannot get more realistic than actually working at an (Military Treatment Facility), at a warehouse, or at a clinic providing support in whatever area that it might be to all of the components and probably the civilian or retiree personnel that go through those facilities.""

""That's as real world as it gets, and with the possibility of a large-scale military operation where we will probably be integrating with a lot of MTFs across the board, this type of partnership is going to be critical for us to be able to operate efficiently because we are going to get the most up-to-date training from MHS Genesis, and they'll be able to work those systems as well as any other logisitics systems that they have out there in order to do their mission,"" said Payne.

Despite the short-term duration of the Army Reserve medical Soldiers at the NCR training sites, their presence has nonetheless been a significant force multiplier to Active Component service members.

""This is 100 percent important for them to be here to look at our equipment and do maintenance on our equipment because without them, we cannot do anything,"" said U.S. Army Sgt. Cynthia Jarvi, an animal care specialist of WRAIR, Army Futures Command. ""We're going to be deadlined basically... and the animals would be in danger and the people would be in danger, so it is 100 percent important to have the (medical logistics specialists) around so we can get this equipment maintained and serviced properly. With them doing what they just did, that 100 percent makes our mission become even better.""

Lastly, Hilliman attributes a large portion of the mission actualization to AR-MEDCOM's Operations, Plans and Training (G-3/5/7).

""I have to thank the AR-MEDCOM G-3/5/7 for putting this together,"" Hilliman said. ""I will mention Maj. Quentin Stewart and 1st Lt. Knakita Cruz, as they were very, very instrumental in making this a success. No way that myself or my co-leader, Sgt. 1st Class Alexander Jordan, would have been able to do this on our own.""

The next rotation of the NCR LDMSST is slated to provide coverage at the training sites from August 20 to September 2, 2023."

“Contact! Contact!” Soldiers yell out to each other as they begin to take simulated fire from up the hill.

It is was part of a week-long training event for the 204th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade at Camp Williams, Utah. They call it “annual training,” but this is hardly routine. More than 250 Soldiers are involved to help get the 204th MEB ready for an upcoming mobilization to Africa.

To be ready, they have to get back to basics. That means lots of review and practice of squad tactics and individual Soldier skills.

“The Army identifies when you get mobilized what they want you to accomplish,” said Capt. Timothy Klase, the training officer for the 204th. “It's what we call the army warrior tasks and battle drills and that’s what we needed to do.”

Each Soldier had to complete around 70 individual tasks. They included operating a radio, applying a tourniquet, land navigation, and tactical movements. Soldiers participated in small group instruction, then demonstrated their ability to perform each task individually during the first two days of training.

“Then you compile all of those warrior tasks into battle drills that progress and build on each other,” said Klase. “You might start filling (programming) an individual radio on your own, then it will progress to utilizing that radio in a squad formation that's under attack.”

During training, the Soldiers encamped in an area called the “One Station Unit Trainer” (OSUT). The OSUT has a half a dozen classrooms, a bivouac area, and lanes to test Soldiers on their skills.

One of the lanes required squads to react to a near ambush. Lane observers gave each squad an order. Then the squad would organize and plan the mission according to what they had learned in the classes.

Most of the Soldiers participated last week to conduct five days and nights of intense training. The event, however, had been building for months.

“We started setting up six to eight months ago in order to develop the scheme of what the commander wanted,” said Sgt. 1st Class Ian Moffat.

Moffatt is a construction engineer with 189th Combat Arms Training Brigade, First Army. It’s an active duty unit based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord whose job is to train other units getting ready for deployment.

“The commander tells us exactly what his priority mission-essential tasks are and then we align that with the actual mission that the unit is going to do,” said Moffatt. “Once the commander agrees to it, we design training for the unit.”

In addition to classes for all of the individual tasks, the final plan included four combat scenarios, night driving, and land navigation.

During the land navigation lane, Soldiers were given a map and a compass and had to locate four unique points spread out across several square kilometers. They had to do it once in the daytime, and once again at night with low visibility.

Klase and Moffatt were part of a small team to develop the plan in its early stages. That team grew as the training date approached.

By the time of the training event there were around 70 Soldiers in support of those getting trained. Those getting ready to deploy were grouped into 15 squads, each with an officer and a noncommissioned officer in charge.

Every Soldier, regardless of rank, role, or experience, had to complete the same training before they can mobilize. It’s a way, say leaders, to ensure that everyone has mastered the basics.

“You just don't know what type of battle we're going to be in, so you have to really prepare for really anything and everything that comes your way,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Garrett Whatcott.

Whatcott is currently serving as the command sergeant major for the 625th Military Police Battalion, which is part of the 204th. He has deployed twice but said it’s always good for Soldiers to refresh their battle skills.

“These are perishable skills,” said Klase. “Some soldiers may have just done this last month at basic training but others of us haven't deployed in a while so it may have been 10 years since we last did this.”

Pvt. 1st Class Adan Patino is one of those Soldiers who had recently done it. A signal operations specialist assigned to the 217th Brigade Signal Company, he is only a few months out of basic training.

“Even though we are all assigned different [jobs] it's still important for us to know how to maneuver through any situation. So, we have to keep good skills in case we're needed out on the field,” he said.

The 217th is a subordinate unit of the brigade and will be deploying too.

“We’ll probably have to [set up retransmission stations] for our antenna out away from the base so it's important for us to know how to how to maneuver,” added Patino.

The 204th will join with Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), headquartered in the Republic of Djibouti.

“At the very bottom line we are Soldiers,” said 1st Lt. Laura Roberts, a cyber warfare officer assigned to the 204th. “If things hit the wall, then you know we will have to revert back to some of these basic tactics.”

Roberts was a squad leader during the week-long annual training.

“We might not be doing these specific things during our mobilization but it's good to know that we can support each other and be prepared to support the mission,” she said.

The brigade’s mission in Africa includes operations to enhance partner nation capacity, promote regional stability, and dissuade conflict.

CJTF-HOA is critical to U.S. Africa Command's efforts to build partner capacity to counter violent extremists and address other regional security partnerships, according to the task force website.

“The point of this is is when we go downrange the Army trusts that we're Soldiers first and that we can execute basic soldier tasks,” said Klase.

For many of the Soldiers, the battle training is as much about team building as anything else.

“These warrior tasks build the team so you can better prepare yourself to react to any type of situation that you may have,” said Whatcott.

While they were not in classes or on the training lanes getting evaluated, Soldiers spent time with their squads rehearsing movements and getting to know each other better.

“It’s just fantastic bonding,” said Roberts. “You know these people are going to be at your left and right downrange. “I couldn't have had a better squad so honestly they led themselves for the most part.”

“It's been a really good experience. It’s been a lot of one-on-one conversations a lot of training everyday just to prepare for when we're actually getting graded,” said Patino.

“Ultimately I want to be a member of a team too,” added Klase. “After I spent so much time on the training plan I had to hand it off to someone else to execute so I could be that member of the 15-man squad actually operating on the ground,” he said.

“It's a great team-building experience. We need this before we get deployed to build that team cohesion,” said Whatcott.

The 204th will continue training specific to the requirements of the Africa mission until the deploy next Spring."

FORT BUCHANAN, Puerto Rico – The readiness of soldiers is essential to not only the unit but the U.S. Army Reserve as a whole.

Special events arranged by the 1st Mission Support Command help soldiers remain seasoned in their respective Military Occupational Specialty.

Lt. Col Heath Dickinson, Staff Sgt. Darian Vigo and Sgt. 1st Class Marangelie Ramos discuss the ""Operation Trazando Camino"" and why it is essential in the talent retention mission.

Staff Sgt. Vigo explained that the event targets all personnel wanting to further their careers. However, it focuses on those in excess positions in the unit manning report of their respective units.

""The purpose, first and foremost, is to provide career enhancement opportunities for soldiers in excess positions that don't have a clear career path,"" said Lt. Col. Dickinson. ""We're offering MOS reclassification opportunities to enable them to move into a MOS with upward mobility, and that they can pursue promotions.""

According to Lt. Col. Dickinson, the operation broadens noncommissioned officers' experiences by also offering broadening opportunities such as to become a drill sergeant, instructor, or controller trainer.

As Sgt. 1st Class Ramos stated, these broadening opportunities can provide other enhancement skill sets that will set soldiers up for success.

""We hope that it will lead them to consider broadening assignments, which helps them develop,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Ramos.

Lt. Col. Dickinson reveals that this will benefit the talent retention mission since they have one of the highest levels of volunteerism in the Army Reserves."

VICENZA, Italy – Over 150 children participated in U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa (SETAF-AF) “Bring your Lion Cubs to Work Day” at Caserma Del Din Aug. 10, 2023.

“There were 30 ‘cubs’ who participated in our physical training formation as early as 7:30 a.m.,” said U.S. Army Maj. Sam Sistare, executive officer of Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion (HHBn), SETAF-AF.

The SETAF-AF motto is “Lions Lead” and the Lion of Saint Mark is the prominent feature on the unit’s patch and heraldry.

Workouts included in-cadence preparatory drills, medicine ball relays, sprint-drags of 25-pound plates, as well as a spirited game of sharks and minnows. It ended with cool-down exercises and stretching.

The event was organized by SETAF-AF in collaboration with U.S. Army Garrison Italy and community partners such as the Red Cross, Army Community Services, teams from Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention, the Military and Family Life Counseling Program and the United Services Organizations.

The Sgt. Morales Club also assisted with kid-friendly events. This local club is the U.S. Army Europe and Africa equivalent of the Sgt. Audie Murphy Club as both organizations encourage members to be active in the community.

“SETAF-AF increased family resiliency and community connectedness over this morning's activities,” added Sistare.

Multiple service organizations brought their pop-up tents and offered yard games that entertained and informed Vicenza military community families with hand-outs explaining available resources.

“The U.S.O. was gracious enough to provide fruit snacks and drinks for kids and parents,” said Sistare.

Highlights of the day included rides in light medium tactical vehicles. Multiple volunteers assisted with the rides, helping ensure safety in troop carriers while informing kids of vehicle specifications.

SETAF-AF Soldiers also led weapons demonstrations and weapons safety for both parents and kids, teaching proper handling techniques as participants looked through sight apertures at simulated targets.

“Another highlight for the kids was Vegas and Bico, a couple of our military working dogs,” said Sistare. “They put on a show and took down an ‘unknown criminal’ wearing a big blue over-garment. He was definitely up to no good. This is a crowd-pleaser every year!”

Other events included a robotics demonstration with the hands-on challenge of remotely driving vehicles around an obstacle course. Additionally, children were able to view fire trucks and many different military vehicle displays.

With military life often preventing the discussion of specific missions with family members due to operational security concerns, today’s event offered a unique family-bonding opportunity.

“Overall, today’s mission was a success,” said Sistare. “Those who participated greatly appreciated the morning spent together.”

WASHINGTON — The Army unveiled an engraving that honored the efforts of a Vietnam War veteran who led an inexperienced, outnumbered South Vietnamese company to victory nearly 60 years ago.

The service added Col. Paris Davis to the granite wall bearing the names of fellow Medal of Honor recipients at the National Museum of the U.S Army Wednesday.

“I am overwhelmed by what has happened today,” Davis said after the ceremony.

Davis’ actions in June 1965 not only assured U.S. forces a pivotal victory but prevented three American Soldiers from being captured.

President Joe Biden awarded Davis the Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony on March 3 and the Defense Department later inducted Davis into its Hall of Heroes March 6.

“It’s from your life … that this nation remembers you, honors you and owes you,” said Army Director of Staff, Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, who hosted the ceremony. “By making history, you have given peace to a nation that did not appreciate you nor appreciate the Vietnam War and from an Army that often did not see you as equal. And inside you weren’t equal; you were better.”

June 18, 1965, Davis, three Special Forces troops and a South Vietnamese company faced a large North Vietnamese force near Bong Son, Binh Dinh Province. Despite suffering several injuries, the 5th Special Forces Group armor officer continued to fire upon the enemy and engage in hand-to-hand combat.

Amid enemy rounds, then-Captain Davis rescued three injured U.S. Soldiers from enemy fire. Davis then refused medical evacuation and instead oversaw the transportation of the wounded troops.

“Throughout the day Paris Davis distinguished himself with bravery above and beyond what is humanly possible,” Piatt said. “Paris simply would not allow the enemy to win. He refused to fall and refused to let his team fall.”

Davis, one of the first Black Special Forces officers in the Army, continued to direct air and artillery fire upon the enemy. Davis’ efforts helped stop the South Vietnamese force from being overrun.

Davis thanked his friends, fellow veterans and family who stood by him until he received the nation’s highest military honor. The Army previously awarded him a Silver Star and Purple Heart.

“The power to do what you did is hard for even other Soldiers to understand,” Piatt said. “We admire your actions. The world has benefited from your deeds.”

In his remarks, Davis emphasized the importance of showing kindness and empathy to those who cannot help themselves or may be physically limited such as the disabled.

A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Davis attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He commissioned into the Army in 1959 and graduated from the service’s ranger and airborne schools in 1960.

Davis deployed first to Korea and then Vietnam in 1962 before being selected for Vietnam again in 1965. Davis went on to serve 26 years before retiring from the Army in 1985.

After the ceremony, Davis, his daughter, Regan Davis-Hopper, and his friends and family walked the garden grounds and looked upon his name and other recipients on the plaque.

232,Army SHARP professionals enhance skill sets at national training conference,https://www.army.mil/article/268985/army_sharp_professionals_enhance_skill_sets_at_national_training_conference,"The U.S Army Reserve’s 85th Support Command and First Army’s Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocates pause for a photo on Chartres Street during the 49th Annual National Organization for Victim Assistance training conference, July 31 – August 3, 2023, in New Orleans, Louisiana. This year’s NOVA conference consisted of nearly 100 different workshops where Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program professionals heard firsthand from subject matter experts who shared lessons learned and best practices.

NEW ORLEANS, La. – “This type of training conference is important for Army SHARP professionals because it expands our network and resources on a national level. When assisting Soldiers serving on active duty, in the reserve, and in the National Guard they are not always in one location,” said Sgt. 1st Class Joel Perkins, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, 157th Infantry Brigade. So being able to call upon a network of advocates whom we have met at the conference to help us in times of need is of great benefit to us.”

The Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program is designed to prevent the occurrence of sexual harassment and assault, provide victim advocacy to ensure prompt and sensitive care for victims, and encourage reporting of all occurrences by providing reporting options.

Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocates from across the U.S. Army attended an annual training conference hosted by the National Organization for Victim Assistance in New Orleans, July 31 – August 3, 2023.

NOVA is a nonprofit organization committed to the recognition and implementation of victim rights and services. In 2003 NOVA established the National Advocate Credentialing Program. Army SHARP professionals receive training certified by the NACP and are credentialed through the DOD Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program.

SARCs serve as a point of contact to coordinate sexual assault victim care. They track the services provided to victims starting from the initial report of a sexual assault and ensure that victims receive appropriate and compassionate care to overcome trauma.

The VA provides essential support and care to the victim to include providing non-clinical information on available options and resources to assist the victim in making informed decisions as they progress through resolution and healing. The VA maintains communications and contact with victim as needed for continued victim support.

“As Victim Advocates, we walk the victims through the process and ensure they have access to the resources they need. We put them on a path to feel like themselves again, and reclaim their voice,” said Sgt. 1st Class Stephanique Jones, Victim Advocate, 2-364th Training Support Battalion, 5th Armored Brigade.

Army SHARP professionals expressed the value of networking with the other approximately 2,000 victim assistance professionals in attendance at the event.

Staff Sgt. Chastity Caldwell, Victim Advocate, 3-313th Logistics Support Battalion, 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, shared her thoughts on the value of the NOVA event.

“Attending this event allows us to meet with other professionals outside of the military who have had experiences that we might not normally encounter in our organizations. Connecting with those individuals provides us with knowledge that we might not have been taught in the Army schoolhouse and better prepares us to assist Soldiers in navigating them through those situations,” said Caldwell.

This year’s NOVA conference consisted of nearly 100 different workshops where Army SHARP professionals heard firsthand from subject matter experts who shared lessons learned and best practices.

“The face-to-face interaction with the presenters during the sessions has been fantastic. There is so much knowledge to draw upon, across a wide spectrum of topics, such as advocacy and trauma care,” said Sgt. 1st Class Leticia Rodriguez, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, First Army, Division West. “A venue like this gives you the opportunity to tailor your training to fit your interests and role. This training helps you build your knowledge base to be a better advocate and then teach others what you have learned here.”

Throughout the four-day training conference, Army SARCs and VAs emphasized the importance of seeking help for those who have been victimized.

“For Soldiers that have been sexually assaulted, more than anything else, seek council,” said Master Sgt. Alaine Latoya Gilpin, Victim Advocate, 4-409th Brigade Support Battalion, 4th Cavalry Multi-Functional Training Brigade. “Find the grit and courage to get the services you need. Do what feels most comfortable to you. For instance, the Army gives victims the option of restricted or unrestricted reporting. Some Soldiers do not feel comfortable informing their chain of command and having an unrestricted case, so Soldiers should use the options they feel are the best fit for them.”

Filing a restricted report allows Soldiers to confidentially disclose a sexual assault to a SARC or VA without notifying the command or law enforcement. Soldiers can change a restricted report to an unrestricted report at any time.

Filing an unrestricted report allows for an official investigation, command notification, and reporting to law enforcement. An unrestricted report can be made to a SARC, VA, law enforcement official, a commander or health care personnel.

Throughout the event, Army SHARP professionals further stressed that victims of sexual harassment and assault in the military have options for seeking help.

“Understand that you have the option go to any Sexual Assault Response Coordinator or Victim Advocate within the Department of Defense to get help. It does not matter what service the SHARP professional is with. We are all credentialed the same and we will take those reports and get the servicemembers the help that they need,” said Sgt. 1st Class John Sydnor, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, First Army, Division East. “If you don’t feel comfortable with the people where you are, then you can go to another place.”

If you are a victim of sexual assault in the military and need assistance, call the DoD Safe Helpline: 877-995-5247."

WASHINGTON — While on his way to Australia for exercise Talisman Sabre 23, 1st Lt. Jared McCully, transportation officer with the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary), found out he was invited to a local black-tie charity event.

He, alongside a few other U.S. service members and an Australian counterpart, were to be guests at the mayor’s annual banquet.

The team had not come prepared for such an event.

“Of course, when you’re limited to what you can pack in your duffel bag, a tuxedo isn’t what you anticipate bringing,” he said with a laugh. ‘We didn’t want to offend anyone by declining the invitation because we realized we were the only ones to get the guest of honor invite.”

In the small coastal town of Bowen in northeast Australia, finding appropriate attire for everyone invited would prove challenging. That’s why McCully’s commander left it to him.

I’m known as the guy who deals with the unique challenges, he acknowledged.

He went to work and found out the closest place to rent what they needed was almost three hours away. With no time to lose, he and a few other Soldiers hopped in a car and made the successful journey.

Not long after, he was sporting his tuxedo and meeting members of the community.

“It’s one of those things, where you don’t think while doing a mission in a small town in Australia that you’ll get sent to the black-tie charity event,” he said.

This was just one event in what turned out to be an action-packed exercise that he won’t soon forget.

After graduating from the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps at Gettysburg College, Pennsylvania in 2019, the Canton, Ohio native knew he wanted to work with Army watercraft. This capability allows combat forces to move equipment and sustainment supplies from sea to shore.

He specifically sought out the 7th Transportation Brigade and has worked there since joining the Army. For the last year, he has been in the role of port location analyst.

He goes to desired training locations months in advance and scouts to see if the area’s infrastructure and community support are compatible for joint logistics over-the-shore.

JLOTS is an operation that allows vehicles and equipment to move from sea to shore in remote environments that don’t offer port access. It gives the Department of Defense a way to continuously provide support and sustainment for troops over a long period of time.

“I see logistics over-the-shore as being a very essential program for the DOD,” McCully said. “This is going to be one of those tool sets that provides us with the adaptability to access places that not many other forces in the world have access to and to also sustain ourselves.”

Planning for the JLOTS operation at Talisman Sabre 23 started almost 14 months ago. After working with the Australian Defence Force, talking with subject matter experts, and having U.S. Army divers survey the possible locations, the team received approval to conduct operations at Kings Beach in Bowen.

McCully and the team working JLOTS arrived in Australia weeks before the kickoff of the exercise. They quickly started setting things up.

JLOTS is a 24/7 operation with the crews working in 12-hour shifts. Much of the work is done at sea when weather permits. The team must receive the equipment, label it and prep it for the move.

“There is a lot of work being done behind the scenes,” he said.

Being one of the senior members of the operation, McCully, who is also the JLOTS project manager, is often tasked with helping solve problems as they arise. He is also the one who gets to brief and escort distinguished visitors to explain the operational capabilities.

“Most people don’t know what Army watercraft are,” he said. “Trying to get stakeholder buy-in and support from external organizations has been one of my key focuses during this exercise.”

He met with community leaders, U.S. and Australian senior military leaders, congressional staff and Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth.

Prior to the secretary's arrival, McCully learned he would be promoting to captain and saw the dates would coincide with the visit. He connected with her team to see if she would lead the ceremony for him and other service members promoting or reenlisting.

She agreed, and they worked it in as the culminating event of her time at JLOTS.

“It’s one of those fun stories that I’ll get to tell for the rest of my life,” he said.

McCully not only engaged with senior leaders during the exercise, but also with the local community. U.S. service members participated in several community engagement events while in Australia.

They visited local schools, community job fairs and attended the occasional banquet. These engagements provided opportunities to build strong bonds with the community and Australian partners.

“This has probably been one of the best training areas we have ever been to,” he explained. “I want [the community] to have a positive impression of us. We’re not here to take advantage of the resources. We’re here to call this a second home for a little while, even if it’s just for a few months.”

McCully said he made lasting memories while exploring Australia and working with his teammates to display the JLOTS capability.

After more than a month of preparation and days of execution during the exercise, the team was able to bring equipment ashore using a causeway ferry. The harsh weather conditions prevented the team from using their preferred method of a trident pier, an 1,800-foot floating bridge that connects ship to shore.

“It’s not every day the mission you’re doing is arguably the most important mission in the Army,” he said. “Expeditionary logistics is not designed to be easy, but we are here with our partners to take on a mission many would shy away from.”

That event was the culmination of more than a year of planning and weeks of work for McCully and the team. The job he accomplished during that time did not go unnoticed by those around him.

“Jared was instrumental to the success of the JLOTS mission across a variety of facets,” said Col. Samuel Miller, commander, 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary). “From the early stages of operational planning, to coordinating with stakeholders on numerous key leader visits, Jared took the initiative far beyond what you would expect of a junior officer.”

Now, as the exercise ends, planning will start for the next JLOTS in the Indo-Pacific in 2024.

CAMP ATTERBURY, Ind. — Approximately 160 U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from the 7212nd Medical Support Unit, Rochester, Minnesota; the 7215th Medical Support Unit, St. Louis, Missouri; and the 7405th Troop Medical Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota performed medical and dental validation for active duty, National Guard, and Reserve component Soldiers that took part in Mobilization Exercise Level III, or MOBEX III, as part of Operation Pershing Strike 2023 in Camp Atterbury, Indiana, July 10 to August 5, 2023.

MOBEXs are annual training exercise of varying levels to assess all Mobilization Force Generation Installations and their capabilities in deploying troops en masse.

""What we are training for currently is for in case we have a large-scale mobilization operation, or LSMO,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Arvie Webster, a family nurse practitioner assigned to the 7453rd Medical Operational Readiness Unit, Mesa, Arizona, and the officer-in-charge of the Army Reserve medical task force.

""So, if we have to deploy a bunch of forces all at once, we got to make sure that they are medically cleared as well as hitting these other training points, whether it is training that they going to do when they are deployed and also getting them ready and their families ready,"" said Webster.

Despite just three days of reception, staging, onward movement and integration, Soldiers from both MSUs and the TMC processed and supported the large-scale influx of active duty, Guard and Reserve Soldiers prior to and during their MOBEX III engagements.

""We also got 1,500 Soldiers through the soldier readiness processing portion, medically and dentally ready,"" Webster said. ""The troop medical clinic also saw over 275 Soldiers. What (U.S. Army Medical Command's) standard is that they want to make sure that we can get at least 40 Soldiers in an hour through soldier readiness processing, but what we've actually done in this exercise is we exceeded that goal.""

Eric J. Holcomb, 51st Governor of the State of Indiana, officially recognized the 7212nd MSU's prodigious efforts in exceeding that standard.

""Some of the units were so impressed with the care that we provided that actually the unit was awarded the Indiana Commendation Medal,"" Webster said. ""So it was a huge success, this whole entire exercise.""

During periods of downtime, many of the medical Soldiers pursued cross-training opportunities and other learning experiences.

""When we only had one or two patients in the TMC, we would also do training with the providers for the different specialties that they had so we could get specialized training, and everybody loved it,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Ariel Yuzenko, a combat medic assigned to the 7239th MSU, Chattanooga, Tennessee and cross-level augmentee for the 7405th TMC.

""We did sutures one day, we did different types of IV on another day, and then different draws and injections. It was constant learning, and it made a big difference on how everybody here in the TMC enjoyed being here,"" said Yuzenko. ""At the same time, we were making the best of it and making sure that everybody has optimal training and the best experience and be able to get the most knowledge out of this mission.""

Although the medical task force is comprised of Soldiers indigenous to their units as well as cross-level augmentees, they nonetheless established and maintained unit cohesion throughout MOBEX III.

""For the most part, everybody worked well together,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Alicia Wheat, an automated logistical specialist assigned to the 7215th MSU. ""We were able to do all stations like dental, (automated neuropsychological assessment metrics), the medical portion, labs, immunization and periodic health assessments.""

Due to her positive experience in working with Army Reserve medical Soldiers, Wheat said that she is inspired to pursue military occupational specialty reclass into a practical nursing specialist.

""It's been honestly really wonderful to be here and actually have this experience and see how it works and see what I have in store once I actually reclass,"" Wheat said.

Lastly, Webster said that the rapid-fire transition between the walk-crawl-run phases would have not been possible without the groundwork laid by Active Guard Reserve, or AGR, Soldiers involved in the planning and development process.

""A large component of this is our AGR Soldiers that are consistent for us, so even though leadership may change during yearlong planning, those AGR Soldiers are a constant and gave us the whole entire backbone to make this a successful operation,"" Webster said. ""AGR Soldiers should have a huge shout-out to how much of an intricate role they play and how they lay the foundation work for us so we're able to go in and do our jobs.""

""If you think about all of those different Soldiers from all different areas, and how they were able to flow together and make such a successful mission, it's amazing. It just shows the dedication and professionalism and the subject matter experts and knowledge that they bring with them,"" Webster said."

WASHINGTON — A panel of Army senior leaders will select 12 Soldiers and civilians to learn the intricacies of cyber strategy and policymaking.

As part of the service’s broader effort to retain and recruit its top talent, the first annual Secretary of the Army’s Cyber Strategic Seminar will give participants the rare opportunity to receive exposure to top Army and government leaders.

The proposed activities in the nine-month session include meetings with officials from across the federal government, industry and academia, and practical exercises with Army senior leadership. The dozen finalists will also brief Army senior leaders at the conclusion of the program.

The seminar, jointly administered by Army Principal Cyber Advisor Michael Sulmeyer and Army Cyber Command commander, Lt. Gen. Maria Barrett, will also help identify and train the Army’s top talent in cyber security.

“What we're looking for is to develop leaders who have a particular aptitude for cyber-related issues,” Sulmeyer said. “And hopefully, they will use this program to increase their awareness and creativity around how cyber operations fit into multi-domain operations, [and] how cyber operations can inform operations in other domains.”

As the Army competes for top talent in cyber security, the seminar will showcase career opportunities in the field.

The Soldiers and Army civilians will discuss topics that include weapons systems security, intelligence support to cyber functions, the defense industrial base and acquisition support to cyber operations. Participants will gain an understanding of partnerships with foreign allies to defend and secure critical data, as well as meet with leaders in cyber security across government, the private sector, and academia.

The dozen selectees will include Soldiers in the grades of sergeant to sergeant first class, warrant officer 1 through chief warrant officer 3, and first lieutenant to major, and civilians GS-9 through GS-13. Finalists must have a minimum secret clearance and be available to attend all sessions of the seminar.

The group will meet monthly for a different activity planned by Army Cyber Command. The application period began last month and ends Aug. 11. The participants will be announced at the Association of the U.S. Army annual meeting in October, with the seminar set to begin shortly after.

The search will not be limited to individuals in cyber or tech-related positions. Soldiers and civilians in all military occupational specialties and career fields can apply.

“What we wanted to do is to identify the Army's top talent across enlisted [Soldiers], warrant officers and civilians and provide a way to broaden their exposure to strategic policymaking, to be able to take them to different venues,” said Sulmeyer, who previously served as senior policy advisor for U.S. Cyber Command. “Our hope is that [the seminar] is a tool not just to develop their careers and make them into even stronger Army leaders, but also to retain them in the force.”

Cyber and data centricity have increasingly become important factors in multi-domain operations. Secretary Wormuth has prioritized recruiting Soldiers with expertise in the field.

“[Secretary Wormuth] has placed such a premium on strategic recruitment and retention,” Sulmeyer said. “[The seminar] was a way that she thought the Army could lead in identifying our top talent and giving them exposure to strategic cyber issues.”

Interested Soldiers and civilians can apply at the Secretary of the Army's Cyber Strategic Seminar SharePoint. Candidates must self-nominate to apply but will need a supervisor endorsement if they are selected for an interview. Finalists will be selected based on an interview and written application.

By Capt. Carl Amolat, 1st TSC-OCP Safety Officer

During the 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command’s deployment in Kuwait, the Safety Office of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command Operational Command Post noted an uptick in sports-related injuries.

Several sports injuries involved overly ambitious physical training goals and wildly ambitious strength and conditioning plans as root causes. The saying “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” readily springs to mind.

Prior planning is that preventative measure. What goes into it is a realistic understanding of one’s capabilities, limitations, and environmental and work conditions. Factors such as age, injury history, sleep schedule/hygiene, acclimatization, and physical training history all play into developing the starting point.

Having established this starting point and knowing the desired goal makes planning for said desired goal a lot more accurate. This is where consistent and balanced effort over time comes into play. Sgt. Maj. Shannon Thornbury, 143d ESC Support Operations Sergeant Major, a kinesiologist in civilian life, has these focal points for balanced strength and conditioning plans:

Aerobic. The core of any fitness program should include some form of continuous movement. Examples include swimming, running, and dancing.

Strength. These exercises help increase muscle power and strength. Examples include resistance training, plyometrics, weightlifting, and sprinting.

Calisthenics. These moves are usually performed without gym equipment using large muscle groups. They’re done at a medium aerobic pace. Examples include lunges, situps, pushups, and pull-ups.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT). This type of exercise includes repetitions of short bursts of high-intensity activity followed by low-intensity exercises or rest periods.

Boot camps. These are timed-based, high-intensity circuits that combine aerobic and resistance exercises.

Balance or Stability. These exercises are designed to strengthen muscles and improve body coordination. Examples include Pilates, tai chi poses, and core-strengthening exercises.

Flexibility. These exercises help muscle recovery, maintain range of motion, and prevent injuries. Examples include yoga or individual muscle-stretch movements.

It is possible to combine one or more of these areas in a training session, i.e., purely aerobic work such as 10-20 minutes of swimming following a strength training session without overstraining. However, This requires some experience and being aware of one’s limitations.

It seems contradictory to intentionally look away from the type A personality impulse to precisely do that. However, an injury that either sends a Soldier home early or puts that Soldier on a limited duty profile for a lengthy period is ultimately not a prudent risk.

It may be frustrating, and daresay discouraging, to watch younger, stronger, and fitter Soldiers move heavier weights, run faster, and play harder on the sports pitch. However, bear in mind it took a fair amount of consistency on their part to get to that point.

Suppose one is starting from a previously sedentary lifestyle before mobilization. In that case, it will be a recipe for injury to copy training programs used by the more athletic Soldiers previously mentioned.

It requires a certain degree of self-discipline to train consistently, day in and day out, and trust the training process without a bit of envy of more physically capable peers. But consistency gets sustainable results and avoids or mitigates injuries. Small, continuous improvements add up over time."

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait -- “Maximum disclosure, minimum delay.” Like a prize fighter sparring in the gym, this is something that is pounded into service members studying to become public affairs mass communication specialists at the Defense Information School to remind themselves to provide the American public unclassified information about the U.S. Military and its activities. Aiding the public affairs office, unit public affairs representatives (UPAR) are non-public affairs Soldiers identified to increase public affairs (PA) capability across the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility (USCENTCOM AOR). On July 25, 2023, U.S. Army Central (USARCENT) public affairs Sgt. Maj. Jeremy Bunkley held a UPAR Brief to inform UPARs of their responsibilities and capabilities, at Camp Buehring, Kuwait.

“Due to the distributed nature of forces throughout the CENTCOM AOR, the role of the UPAR is imperative in assisting higher echelon PA in telling the holistic public affairs and CENTCOM story,” said Bunkley. “Public affairs officers (PAOs) and noncommissioned officers (NCOs) are assigned at the brigade level and higher. Because of this, the role of the UPARs is extremely important at the battalion level and lower, as they serve closely with battalion commanders as lower-level subject matter experts on PA plans and policies, gather video and photography to create public affairs communication products, and conducting media opportunities at the battalion level.”

Army Regulation 360-1 defines the PA Program as the guide to conducting public communication strategy for information, command information, leader engagements, and community outreach activities directed toward both the external and internal publics with interest in the Department of Defense. PA policies and principles apply across the range of military and peacetime operations and states the guidelines for UPARs.

UPARs serve closely with battalion commanders as lower-level subject matter experts on PA plans and policies on embedding the media, engaging the local media, and conducting media opportunities at the battalion level. Commanders appoint a UPAR to any unit that is not supported by a designated public affairs officer.

“During my time in public affairs, our field has constantly been understrength,” said California Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Lani Pascual, the public affairs operations NCO, assigned to 40th Infantry Division, Task Force Spartan. “UPARs make a huge impact by augmenting our collective efforts. They are the on-ground experts who are embedded and can cover their unit's missions.”

Pascual added that the PA mission is information-based and to be successful they must connect to Soldiers and glean their stories. UPARs can share the experiences of the Soldiers they serve with that the public affairs office may not have the opportunity to know.

Prior to being appointed a UPAR with 642nd ASB, Spc. Courtney Scholl, a human resources specialist and UPAR, assigned to HSC, 642nd Aviation Support Battalion, had not used a professional camera but was happy with the opportunity and personal growth that she found.

“I had never done something like this before,” said Scholl. “This was my first time using a professional camera and taking photos. I soon began to enjoy this extra duty that I had along with my everyday tasks. As the UPAR for my battalion I hope to broadcast all that Soldiers are doing in hopes for other people to understand what Soldiers do, their impact on the mission and the Army as a whole.”

Army Reserve 1st Lt. Larry Subramanian, a transportation officer assigned to 382nd Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, wanted to attend UPAR training because he wanted to share the experiences of his unit with like-minded Soldiers.

“I witness great work achieved by the CSSB team to support our units daily,” said Subramanian. “UPARs give us an opportunity to provide to our higher commands, allies, families, friends and the American taxpayer exposure to our day-to-day work and we are appreciative of what they do.”

USARCENT operates under the values that people, partnerships, readiness, and innovation are the best way to sustain and improve the operational practicality that leads to mission success.

“Ultimately, teamwork and information sharing are key,” said Bunkley. “…especially for the Soldiers who are new to the UPAR responsibilities. We wanted to bring them together to share the USARCENT commander’s public affairs campaign plan and discuss the ways in which they can best support that and their own commander’s communications objectives. This is an important additional duty, and we want them to know that as public affairs practitioners, we are here to help them succeed… this was a great turnout, and it shows how important winning in the information environment is to our commanders across the USARCENT footprint.”"

CAMP ATTERBURY, Ind. – It’s a recipe for cooperation when active Army, Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers train together in a challenging environment. Add some Indiana heat and you have Pershing Strike.

“Pershing Strike is a yearly exercise that’s led by U.S. Forces Command and executed by First Army. It’s really to test the Mobilization Force Generation Installation’s ability to conduct large scale mobilization operations in support of large-scale combat operations, “said Col. Troy Mills, Commander, 157th Infantry Brigade, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “The active and reserve component bring in expertise in their fields based on Military Occupational Specialty or branch, as well as being the subject matter expertise for that MOS. We provide that relevant training to the National Guard and reserve component units as they come through Camp Atterbury.”

One of those units is the Kentucky National Guard’s 2113th Transportation Company based in Paducah, Kentucky.

“We made it through the train ups and evaluations here at Camp Atterbury as a more cohesive team,” said 1st Lt. Hope Smith, Company Commander, 2113th Transportation Company, Paducah, Kentucky. “Probably the most effective training the unit received was the convoy training.”

Convoy training was one of the training opportunities Soldiers conducted and were evaluated on, under the watchful eyes of the observer coach/trainers.

“We will be checking on safety. Making sure everything is safe,” said Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Nicodemus, OC/T, 1-290th Transportation Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “One of the biggest things is that Soldiers know how to conduct proper reporting procedures and make sure they have the correct protective equipment before they go on the convoy.”

Before the convoy left, Nicodemus checked on communications between the trucks.

“If they don’t have communications, that’s a concern to me,” he said.

Part of the training focused on dealing with civilian protestors.

A Soldier who participated in the convoy, Staff Sgt. Brent Cope, 88 Mike, Truck Driver, 2113th Transportation Company, Paducah, Kentucky, said the training provided Soldiers with a shift in thinking about how to react to protestors that they might encounter.

“One of the key factors is everybody has the mindset that we’re still in Iraq and Afghanistan. When we were briefed on the convoy, we were told to treat the protestors like civilians,” said Cope. “Be kind and polite and treat them like neighbors, not (threats). Know the country you are going to be in. Customs and courtesies go a long way.”

“It’s all about getting (repetitions) and sets before they get into theater. The Soldiers are getting the opportunity to haul supplies,” said Col. Timothy Starke, G-3, Kentucky National Guard, Paducah, Kentucky. “It’s great to be able to do it at Camp Atterbury. We see Pershing Strike as a great opportunity for our unit to be validated here. As part of the foundations of training, the most important units are led by staff sergeants. They need reps on communications and Soldier skills. We must be able to operate de-centralized.”

Helping Soldiers identify areas for improvement and maintain good practices is the job of the OC/T.

“We are not here to point out their flaws. We are here to have them self-identify. What we mean by self-identify is to learn how to do better and succeed in the mission,” said Staff Sgt. Jessica Ecker, OC/T, 2-338th Training Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “It’s also to identify what they did well and continue to include that in the mission.”

Ecker, a medical logistics Soldier with 14 years of Army Reserve service, values her role as an OC/T.

“I like being an OC/T because I’m integrated with so many different military occupational specialties. It helps me grow as a Soldier,” Ecker said.

Army Reserve Soldiers assigned to the 157th Infantry Brigade conducted annual training while operating as support elements to Pershing Strike. They practiced skills such as firing the 50 Caliber machine gun.

“I’m firing the 50-caliber machine gun for the first time,” said Sgt. Devon Diel, 25 uniform, Systems Support Specialist, 3-411th Logistics Support Battalion, Camp Atterbury, Indiana. “I’m working with my assistant gunner who lets me know where the targets are and how to adjust my weapon.”

Spc. George Cooper, 91 Bravo, Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic, 3-411th, (LSBN) Camp Atterbury, Indiana helped feed the ammunition and assisted Diel with targeting.

“It’s fun to shoot. The range instructors give us guidance on how far out the target is and how to adjust fire,” said Cooper, who served four years on active duty and is completing his first year as an Army Reserve Soldier.

“It’s an adjustment being an Army Reserve Soldier compared to active duty,” Cooper said.

Soldiers also practiced land navigation using a magnetic compass.

“It’s good Soldier training. It’s a relief from paperwork and meetings. It’s nice to do something fundamental,” said Capt. Robert Duncanson, Assistant S-3, 3-338th Transportation Support Battalion, Blacklick, Ohio. “As an OC/T unit, it is essential to be solid in the fundamentals in order to give good feedback to the units we are training.”

Duncanson, a public affairs student at Ohio State University, touched on what his service is like in the Army Reserve.

“What I really appreciate is the camaraderie and professionalism of the Army Reserve Soldiers that I work with,” said Duncanson. “It’s reassuring to have so many leaders who can work independently and accomplish a task on short notice.”"

MADISON, Wis. - More than 250 Soldiers from the Wisconsin Army National Guard’s 157th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade returned to Wisconsin after a nine-month deployment to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti to support Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa.

A large gathering of family and friends — many fighting back tears while holding signs, pictures of their deployed loved ones, and flowers — welcomed the Soldiers upon their arrival at Dane County Regional Airport. Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, Wisconsin’s adjutant general, and other senior Wisconsin National Guard leaders were the first to welcome the members of the 157th MEB.

“When we met before your deployment last September, I told you that deployments were bittersweet,” Knapp said during a brief ceremony for the returning troops at the Wisconsin Air National Guard’s 115th Fighter Wing base at Truax Field. “You embark on a journey that takes you away from your family and friends for months to serve your nation, to show the country and the world what it means to be a member of the Wisconsin National Guard.

“Your return today is only sweetness,” Knapp continued, “because you come home to loved ones that have been counting the days until your return.”

The 157th MEB is the first Wisconsin Army National Guard brigade-level unit to deploy to Africa. Members performed a headquarters staff mission for CJTF-HOA — ensuring strategic partnerships with Djibouti and other partner nations, responding to crises, and enhancing stability and peace in the region by acting as a headquarters support unit to coordinate and facilitate mission accomplishment.

Col. Eric Leckel, 157th MEB commander, praised the returning Guardsmen as the “finest Soldiers in the United States Army” for their achievements while deployed as part of the only standing task force on the African continent.

“They left a lasting impact on the citizens of Africa, and their commitment has ensured that U.S. interests are better postured for the future,” Leckel said. He said the 157th MEB’s commitment and tenacity strengthened strategic influence, ensuring the United States as “a partner of choice in one of the most key pieces of terrain in the world.”

Members of the 157th MEB worked hand-in-hand with their Djibouti counterparts and other partner nations on integrated security tactics, mobility and functional methods. They supported efforts to counter Al Shabaab and other regional terror organizations, respond to emergencies throughout the continent, and evacuate the U.S. embassy in Sudan during that nation’s civil war.

“I am extremely proud of our Soldiers and their actions in Africa,” Leckel said. “Day after day, I witnessed our troops work with partner organizations to ensure that our time in Africa was a success. Their selfless acts and exceptional service helped shape destinies, promote peace and create a better future for all.”

Leckel and Knapp thanked the families for supporting their loved ones throughout the deployment.

“We cannot serve our state and country without your support,” Knapp said.

Gen. Ronald Blanck, left, pins on brigadier general rank on Mack Hill, center, during a promotion ceremony.

WASHINGTON — More than 50 years ago, former Surgeon General Ronald Blanck received a harrowing introduction to the Army.

Then a young military physician, he deployed to the central highlands of Vietnam in September 1968, treating Soldiers on the front lines.

Blanck, like many of his peers at the time, volunteered for the mission in the days before the U.S. military began drafting young men to serve in the Vietnam War. During the conflict, Blanck focused primarily on preventative care: immunizations and vaccinations.

“Vietnam kind of shaped my view of the military,” said Blanck, 81. “That loyalty, selfless service … it really meshed with the way I wanted to practice medicine.”

For 14 months Blanck treated Soldiers, sometimes tending to the wounded in the field in the Vietnamese towns of An Khê and Buôn Ma Thuột. He often had to adapt to the challenges of the environment.

Blanck, one of the first doctors of osteopathic medicine to serve in the Army, recalled one instance when members of a firing battery became ill from drinking contaminated water. He built a makeshift medical bay in the dining facility, setting up beds and inserting IVs into the arms of the Soldiers. He also treated the Vietnamese people for bubonic plague.

After Vietnam, Blanck completed his medical residency, that included time researching tropical diseases in Malaysia. Now board certified in internal medicine, Blanck decided in 1973 that he wanted to make the Army a career.

In the three decades that followed, the native of Ephrata, Pennsylvania would rise to numerous leadership positions including commanding Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and eventually becoming the Army’s 39th Surgeon General from 1996-2000.

Blanck, who retired as a lieutenant general in 2000, recently reflected on the evolution of the Army Medical Corps, which celebrated its 248th anniversary Thursday. He said that the Corps has shifted from a physician-centric focus to an emphasis on the collective efforts of the nurses, medical technicians, pharmacists and social workers. The Army Medical Corps includes 4,000 physicians that specialize in various disciplines in clinical, research and operational medicine.

“The physician is critical to most of the care provided, but does so now as a contributing part of the team, listening to others in the team, and together coming up with the best solution for a patient,” Blanck said. “That's the evolution going from a medical corps being physician centric to now much more of a team effort. Someone once told me, medical care today is a team sport.”

While the Army’s Medical Corps and military medicine cover trauma, orthopedics, and intensive care, one aspect of its services often gets overlooked. Blanck said preventative care, like the services Blanck provided to Soldiers in Vietnam, plays a critical role in disease prevention.

“Trying to keep Soldiers … healthy to fight is the first and foremost and part of our job,” he said. “And it’s to take care of those who are injured or wounded. So it’s evolved into something that really takes all of use working together.”

At Walter Reed, one of the nation’s largest military medical facilities, Blanck founded a Gulf War veteran’s treatment center built in 1993 specifically to treat Gulf War Syndrome, an unknown illness that causes muscle and joint pain, dizziness and memory lapses. The facility later became a deployment health center.

“We would work with people and say, ‘Hey, we know you're sick; we acknowledge it; we don't know what it is. Now, let us help you deal with your symptoms, pass the PT test,” Blanck said. “That was a monumental effort and meant a lot of people could continue to function instead of having depression, sitting at home or being discharged from the military.”

Blanck became the first assistant dean of students at Bethesda’s Uniformed Services University, an institution chartered by Congress, and he also held teaching positions at Georgetown, George Washington and the Howard School of Medicine.

As chief of Army Medicine at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, where each of the medical residents he trained successfully passed their board exams. In addition to serving as a resident at Walter Reed, Blanck also commanded both the U.S. Army Berlin Hospital and the Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center.

After his appointment as the Army’s highest ranking medical officer, Blanck instituted changes that still influence Army medicine today. He made education and medical training a higher priority and assured that qualified physicians and doctors were appointed to critical positions in the field. During Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, the Army saw even greater emphasis on readiness and training.

Blanck redefined the area of responsibility of the Office of the Surgeon General and opened the position to more career fields, allowing nurses and others the opportunity to eventually serve as surgeons general. In 2012, then-Lt. Gen. Patricia Horoho became the first nurse and first woman to serve as surgeon general.

Blanck also started what would become an eight-year process for the then 91B combat medics to become 68W combat medic specialists, resulting in better trained and highly skilled medics. Under the new military occupational specialty, all 68W medics qualify as emergency medical technicians and received training in advanced airway skills. Combat medic specialists now must recertify every two years to keep themselves MOS-qualified.

Retired Army Medical Command Sgt. Maj. Walt Scott said Blanck created a welcome workplace during his time as surgeon general. Blanck approved an enlisted master’s program, allowing senior non-commissioned officers the opportunity to attend graduate school.

“Lt. Gen. Blanck is a leader that was always forward-thinking, approachable, has a wildly great sense of humor, and [was] a professional that always has time for you,” Scott wrote. “Lt. Gen. Blanck created an environment where Soldiers and employees would run to him, not away.”

Blanck closed some hospitals while retaining the same number of staff, he said. Blanck added more medical personnel to larger hospitals including what is now Fort Liberty, North Carolina and Fort Moore, Georgia.

“We were running hospitals where they should have been clinics, and we were running clinics where there was no justification for having … care available,” Blanck said. “So I closed some hospitals, downsized some others, not people, I kept the same number of people.”

“You need to have patients coming into our facilities for us to take care of them, which is how we stay current; how we continue to practice and [be] ready for deployment,” he said. “And if you don't have those patients, then you're not training for deployment. You're not emphasizing readiness.”

During his tenure as Army surgeon general, Blanck worked closely with the surgeons general of the Navy and the Air Force and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs to establish lifetime TRICARE for veterans, including those over 65.

Blanck said that he remains against reductions in military medical care. He said cutting services at Army and military hospitals and treatment centers has sometimes sent patients to civilian care. Patients should be brought back to the direct care system, Blanck added.

Since 2009, Blanck has served as chairman of Martin, Blanck and Associates, whose offices sits on the south side of the District of Columbia suburb, Alexandria, Virginia. The company provides assistance to firms in federal, state and nonprofit sectors and has an expertise in federal healthcare systems and policy.

Although he retired from the Army 23 years ago, Blanck still has kept his medical license for five decades and occasionally will take appointments at clinics.

And sometimes, he makes house calls.

For this occasion, the official party consisted of Maj. Gen. Robert D. Harter, the 81st Readiness Division commanding general, Col. Carlos M. Caceres, the 1st MSC outgoing commander; and Col. Carlos E. Gorbea, the 1st MSC incoming commander.

Once the sound of Ruffles and Flourishes was completed, Chaplain Capt. Farlin Reynoso led the invocation, bringing people of different faiths into a moment of reflection—afterward, the master of ceremony, Maj. Kathryne Iaccuzi recognized the devotion and loyal support of the 1st Mission Support Command soldiers and their families.

With ceremonial precision, 1st Sgt. Osvaldo Morales marched forward and requested permission to post the colors, to which Col. Caceres loudly responded: Post the colors!

With the color guard marching in perfect unison, the master of ceremony narrated the history of the 1st Mission Support Command, reminding the audience of the rich legacy of the federal organization.

Consequently, the official party stepped forward and rearranged themselves to initiate the transfer of authority. Command Sgt. Maj. Michael P. Meunier II passed the colors to Col. Caceres as his last official act as his command sergeant major.

In the same manner, Col. Caceres presented the colors to Maj. Gen. Harter relinquishing his command and showing gratitude for the opportunity to lead and serve the soldiers of the 1st MSC.

Finally, Maj. Gen. Harter passed the colors to Col. Gorbea, entrusting him with the responsibility and care of the command as the new commanding officer for the 1st MSC.

""By authority of paragraph 2-2D, AR 600-20, the undersigned assumes command of the 1st Mission Support Command, effective July 30, 2023,"" declared Maj. Iaccuzi. ""Signed, Carlos E. Gorbea, colonel, United States Army Reserve, commanding.""

The colors, now under Col. Gorbea's care, were passed back to Command Sgt. Maj. Meunier as a symbol of trust as he will now serve as the senior enlisted leader and advisor to him.

As the transfer of authority was completed, Maj. Harter approached the podium to deliver his remarks. He emphasized the milestone and relevance of the Army Reserve organization in the region.

""What do we have in the 1st Mission Support Command?"" Maj. Harter asked. ""Around 71 units, thousands of soldiers spread across Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands not only providing warfighting support in defense of the Nation but also, providing support during emergencies and natural disasters.""

Afterwards, Col. Caceres delivered his farewell speech, reflecting on the shared accomplishments and expressing profound admiration towards the 1st Mission Support Command and its members.

""Commanding the 1st Mission Support Command has been an amazing experience, and it is hard to say goodbye,"" said Col. Caceres. ""As the saying goes, times fly when you are having fun, and for Sonia (Col. Caceres' wife) and I, it truly feels like it was yesterday since we arrived because it has been a gratifying experience.""

Col. Caceres, a military intelligence officer, assumed authority of the 1st Mission Support Command on October 16, 2021. His awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary and Service Medal. He is married to Sonia Caceres and has two daughters, Veronica and Valerie.

Lastly, Col. Gorbea gratefully accepted the responsibility of leading the organization, highlighting his vision and commitment to fulfilling his commanding officer role.

""The 1st Mission Support Command has an honorable legacy hence moving on to the future, I would like to maintain its ability to provide combat-ready soldiers to deploy across the world,"" said Col. Gorbea. ""I believe the 1st Mission Support Command has much to offer the world.""

Col. Gorbea is married to Andrea Hermann, and they have two children, Stella and Rafael Gorbea. He was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He graduated from Princeton University in 1998 with a Bachelor Degree in Mechanical and Aerospatiale Engineering. He possesses a Master of Business Administration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Doctoral Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Munich Technical University.

WASHINGTON — Only 43 days separate the creations of the Continental Army that was formed by the original 13 American colonies and the Army Medical Corps. That short period of time speaks to the importance the corps plays in the mission of the Army.

Several current and former Medical Corps officers shared their thoughts on the corps, their careers and providing health care.

“Military medicine is invaluable to the security of this nation,” said retired Maj. Gen. Jeff Clark, former chief of the Medical Corps. “We in the Medical Corps are a part of an overall team that together is able to provide world-class health care.”

Since July 27, 1775, Medical Corps officers, previously referred to as surgeons, have provided a continuity of care to veterans, military members and their families.

Today, more than 4,000 physicians form a corps of 40 specialties in three main areas: operational, clinical and research medicine. These Soldiers do everything from surgery to vaccine research to delivering babies.

Helping service members bring new life into the world is where Lt. Col. Haroon Samar, family physician, got his start.

As a resident at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center on Fort Cavazos, he helped a young military family during the pregnancy of their first child. The couple trusted him so much they asked him again to help deliver their second son a year later.

“It was really an important time for me to be truly appreciative of the opportunity to be a part of such big moments in their lives,” he said. “I think those moments left an impression on me because I realized just how much trust these young families and these Soldiers put in me. I did my best to learn and grow from that and be as good a doctor as I could be.”

Army physicians go through years of medical school and training to take care of patients. The amount of work can be demanding, but can also fuel their passion.

“I loved everything about it,” said Lt. Col. Elizabeth Polfer of her time on surgery rotation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “The long hours didn’t bother me because I enjoyed everything I was doing.”

Medical Corps officers enter service at the rank of captain and can take many paths in their careers. They can stay in a specialty field or bounce around between different areas.

Clinical medicine provides care on military installations. Operational medicine supports Soldiers in the field, while academic and research medicine focuses on education, training and research at Army medical centers and laboratories.

This flexibility to pursue different avenues allows Medical Corps officers to gain valuable experience.

“I think that is what the Army continues to do and probably does better than any other job, is to just enrich you with job opportunities for growth development and leadership,” Samar said.

Medical Corps officers have made significant impacts on health care throughout history.

Maj. Jonathan Letterman started the first Ambulance Corps to help wounded Soldiers on the battlefield during the Civil War. Maj. Walter Reed led experiments in the early 1900s that discovered the link between mosquitos and yellow fever. During WWI and WWII, Maj. Gen. Norman T. Kirk organized new treatments for amputees.

In the early 2000s, retired Lt. Gen. James Peake led a study to improve battlefield survivability. The study showed most patients were dying before they reached a hospital from either blood loss or compromised airways.

The study led to increased general training and the creation of the Combat Lifesaver Course where Soldiers learn how to apply tourniquets and insert a common airway.

“Soldiers who receive CLS training are better equipped to provide critical medical care when it’s needed,” said retired Maj. Gen. George Weightman, former chief of the Medical Corps Branch. “Commanders can rest assured that their troops are prepared for any situation that arises.”

While advances in medicine and ways to treat patients continue to evolve, the basic function of the Medical Corps remains the same.

“The privilege of serving two professions simultaneously — arms and medicine — being patient-focused, knowing that’s why we are important to the team, does not change even though the world around us changes and what the Army is asked to do changes,” Clark said. “I think those fundamentals are enduring.”

The Army Medical Department consists of the Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, Medical Specialist Corps, Veterinary Corps, Army Nurse Corps, Army Dental Corps and the Civilian Corps.

These groups, along with Enlisted Medical Corps, work together as a team to deliver care to patients around the world.

“I came to Army Medicine because the Army gave me a chance to pursue a dream to be a doctor,” Samar said. “I’ve stayed for as long as I have because I got the chance to a part of a wonderful team. That has kept me in this long and I’ll continue serving because the Army continues to surround me with awesome people.”

The Army recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of TRADOC and FORSCOM. (Photo Credit: Courtesy photo) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — This year marks 50 years since the founding of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and U.S. Army Forces Command.

“TRADOC today is not exactly like the TRADOC established in 1973, but throughout that time, the command has persevered as an organization and fulfilled its numerous missions — especially training” said Britt McCarley, TRADOC chief historian, who has been with the organization since 1988.

TRADOC and FORSCOM were founded during World War II as one organization known as the Army Ground Forces. When formed in 1942, the Army Ground Forces was the largest training organization ever established in the U.S. with 780,000 troops, which peaked at 12.2 million Soldiers by July 1, 1943.

After several reorganizations, Army Ground Forces finally settled into the two organizations they are today: TRADOC and FORSCOM. TRADOC and FORSCOM’s split 50 years ago came from a need to support two separate missions.

“TRADOC recruits and trains the next generation of Soldiers — develops adaptive leaders, helps modernize the force and shapes the culture of the Army. TRADOC was born out of innovation and that is still our mission today,” said Gen. Gary M. Brito, commanding general, TRADOC. Brito added that TRADOC provides institutional training throughout a Soldier’s career.

“TRADOC is improving our Army’s ability to fight and win large scale combat operations through the conduct of multi-domain operations.”

In addition to recruiting, training and education, TRADOC also establishes standards and drives improvement in the Army wherever it can. Whereas FORSCOM’s mission is to train and prepare the force to be globally responsive to build and sustain readiness for commander requirements.

“For me, the most rewarding part [of working for TRADOC] is the chance to be part of an organization that contributes to the common good of the United States,” McCarley said. “Defense of the nation is fundamental to the life of any country, and the opportunity to contribute to the larger American defense mission is the most rewarding part of my civilian service.”

On average, TRADOC trains more than 750,000 Soldiers and service members every year in its 32 Army training centers.

“I could not be more honored to serve with the dedicated team of civilian and military members, who support our Army mission every day,” Brito said. “But this 50-year anniversary isn’t TRADOC’s alone — it carries added significance to the Army as it is also the anniversary of U.S. Army Forces Command and the all-volunteer force. I look forward to our next 50 years and what the future has in store for our great Army.”

Orlando, Fla.- Nearly 30 intelligence Soldiers from various units within the 377th Theater Sustainment Command attended the first of what will be the future of intelligence training using the Army Foundation Intelligence Training Program. The 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command organized the event, which included trainers from the Southeastern Army Reserve Intel Support Center (SEARISC), the 377th TSC, and the U.S. Army Reserve Command. The Foundry program, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at fostering innovation and accelerating the development of the intelligence community, has emerged as a driving force behind the modernization of military capabilities.

""The goal of this training was to give the 377th TSC's intelligence community the chance to train as many Soldiers as possible and, of course, to network. We can piggyback off each other since this is a low-density MOS by joining forces,"" Captain Kelli Gleiser, G2 Operations Officer, 377th TSC, stated.

This program operates on the principles of collaboration and agility, allowing intelligence Soldiers to tackle complex challenges with speed and efficiency. By leveraging the expertise and resources of multiple stakeholders. The program has created a unique ecosystem that provides creative problem-solving and a rapid transition from ideas to operational solutions.

Over the course of five days, the training focused on providing intelligence Soldiers the opportunity to undertake a step-by-step mission analysis using tactical instructions prepared for US Army Reserve Command Collective Training Exercise (CTEP) events. Attendees received formal training in the S-2 baseline fundamentals, Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield and Battlespace (IPB), becoming familiar with the conference educated attendees on the risks associated with modern technology and empowered them with tools to safeguard their Decisive Action Training Environment (DATE) or similar operating environment and threat set built for their exercise, as well as developing relevant intelligence products to assist their commands in determining the best courses of action for mission accomplishment.

""It's important for the intelligence soldiers to know that they are not forgotten, and commands have military intelligence. Soldiers assigned to sustainment commands are not being properly sourced, and there are a lot that don't know what their role is or how they can support sustainment from the military intelligence perspective,"" said Sergeant First Class Jan Quinones, Intel NCOIC, 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command.

This training taught the integration of intelligence by soldiers within sustainment commands, which brings numerous benefits. One of the key advantages is the enhanced ability to detect and counter potential threats along the logistics chain. With their expertise in threat assessment and analysis, these Soldiers can provide invaluable insights into the risks associated with transportation routes, supply depots, and distribution networks. By identifying vulnerabilities and anticipating threats on the battlefield, intelligence Soldiers can help develop proactive security measures, fortify supply lines, and safeguard critical resources by conducting ongoing training for assigned intel Soldiers.

Traditionally, intelligence Soldiers conducted training outside their realm of expertise; Foundry training allows military leaders to make better use of intelligence Soldiers beyond traditional security clearance monitoring. Commanders gain access to real-time intelligence, analysis, and predictive capabilities, enabling them to make informed decisions and respond swiftly to dynamic operational environments.

“Events like this enable networking, collaboration, and joint creation”, according to Quinones.

With increased threats from cyber attackers, intelligence officers are becoming more aware of the need to be proactive about security and privacy protection. The conference educated attendees on the risks associated with modern technology and empowered them with the tools to safeguard their networks. Attendees left feeling empowered and prepared to tackle any challenges they may face in protecting information from malicious actors. By coming together for this event, intelligence personnel can stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments and be better equipped to safeguard their networks.

According to Mr. Joel Harbaugh, G2 Operations Training Support, U.S. Army Reserve Command, ""First of all, it's really important because when you deploy, especially in the anticipated types of conflicts that we're looking at today, with large-scale combat operations and a multidomain, very complex operating environment, there's no safe place anymore.""

The integration of intelligence Soldiers into sustainment commands is increasingly recognized as a force multiplier, providing a strategic advantage in an ever evolving and complex operational landscape.

As the military continues to adapt to emerging challenges, the integration of intelligence Soldiers within sustainment commands is set to become standard practice. The symbiotic relationship between intelligence and logistics functions ensures that military forces are well-prepared, agile, and resilient. By leveraging the analytical prowess and situational awareness of intelligence Soldiers, logistical units can navigate an increasingly complex global environment while delivering critical information."

GEORGETOWN, Guyana – As the Caribbean-focused multinational exercise, TRADEWINDS 23, hits full stride in Guyana, a team of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and Dominican Republic instructors traveled by land and sea to various training sites to speak about humanitarian law, human rights and Women, Peace and Security (WPS).

SOUTHCOM Human Rights Coordinator, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jose Rodriguez said the promotion of human rights is a major objective of TRADEWINDS and the principles that the team covered was a crucial aspect to interoperability.

“Respect for human rights is consistent with democratic values, so we promote those values that unite us and strengthen our partnerships,” said Rodriguez. “We have common threats in our [region] and we have to face them bilaterally and multilaterally. Respect for human rights is a part of that interoperability.”

More than just a human rights training, TRADEWINDS is an annual SOUTHCOM sponsored, joint, combined, multinational and interagency exercise designed to strengthen partnerships and interoperability, increase all participants' training capacity and capability to mitigate, plan for and respond to regional crises and security threats.

Dominican Republic army Col. Juan Perez Richiez, instructor at the Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law School in the Dominican Republic, said in order to achieve these training objectives, it is necessary to have a mutual understanding of how to legally and ethically operate during peacetime and war.

“When we are talking about international humanitarian law, we are talking about the law of armed conflict, and that is something every soldier needs to know and needs to learn during peacetime,” exclaimed Perez. “So then, when he or she is at war, in combat, they know what they can or can’t do.”

Perez went on to say that he has been working in the field of human rights for over 20 years all across Central and South America and the Caribbean and said he has seen a positive change in the preservation of human rights.

“I really think teaching human rights is not only my obligation, but it’s one of the best things I could do with my life,” admitted Perez. “I’ve seen that many armed forces had no or very little prior knowledge of human rights, and after these trainings,…human rights have been preserved at another level.”

A common theme throughout the training was that equality is a crucial aspect of human rights, and the WPS initiative works to promote gender equality and increase the meaningful participation of women to prevent conflict and maintain peace.

SOUTHCOM’s Gender Advisor, Jennifer Typrowicz, said gender integration in defense forces is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do.

“The SOUTHCOM WPS initiative is a priority, and we implement some sort of WPS training in everything that we do,” affirmed Typrowicz. “We have seen [defense] forces in [the SOUTHCOM] area of responsibility start to include more women.”

Typrowicz came to Guyana for TRADEWINDS 21 to instruct WPS training for its inaugural inclusion in the exercise, and she has observed an increased awareness and effort from the Guyana Defense Force (GDF) to integrate women into more roles in their military.

“When I was here in 2021, I walked around and not many people knew what WPS was, and since then we’ve seen them change policies,” claimed Typrowicz. “They now have women that are able to serve at the border which wasn’t something that was happening in 2021.”

Typrowicz said she believes the leadership support is imperative to accomplish change, and the GDF Chief of Staff, Brigadier Omar Khan, confirmed his endorsement for more women involvement in the force.

Khan requested that SOUTHCOM hold a WPS training for the GDF senior leaders in the days before TRADEWINDS 23.

“Military leaders have to take a lead in women’s integration in the whole spectrum of governance, including the security force,” said Khan. “The WPS initiative has a correlation in that the more we behave as responsible men and shape our male youth, we will have a better society, and part of that is respecting women, understanding their needs, and how we need them whether in the public sector, the private sector or the security sector.”

TRADEWINDS 23 is the 38th iteration of the exercise and with over 1,500 participants from 21 countries training in the ground, air, sea and cyber domains in various locations across Guyana from July 15-28."

WASHINGTON — The Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, along with the Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office and industry partners, completed a four-week demonstration in June at U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.

The event was to test solutions for defeating one-way small aircraft systems that are preprogrammed with a target and don’t require an operator after launching. The team chose to test this emerging threat following a capability gap analysis.

This UAS variant creates additional challenges for countering the system, said Col. Mike Parent, chief of the JCO’s acquisition and resources division. The demonstration allows the team to test solutions that could potentially help the operational force close that gap.

During this event, the team worked with industry partners to develop five solutions, including laser-guided missiles and high-powered microwaves.

Each capability was tested during the demonstration against an attacking UAS from a range of 2.5 miles or more. The systems engaged a single UAS weighing between 55-1,320 pounds at low altitude and then one at high altitude.

The combination of the attacking aircraft and the distance to engage the target proved to be a challenge for all the solutions, but the team was satisfied with how they performed, Parent said.

The JCO will post a detailed report of the results from the demonstration later this month. The team will deliver that report along with the cost of the solutions to each U.S. military branch and partner nations for consideration moving forward.

This event was the fourth demonstration the team has performed with industry partners since 2021. These events evaluate emerging technologies, close capability gaps, inform requirements and promote innovation. Each one focuses on a particular problem.

The first event, completed in collaboration with the Air Force, concentrated on low collateral effects interceptor capabilities. These autonomous aircraft track and shoot down enemy piloted UAS.

The second demonstration looked at ground launched systems without inflight terminal guidance, while the third event featured high-powered microwave ground-based aerial denial systems. These capabilities use focused electromagnetic pulses from ground locations to destroy airborne small UAS.

Following each event, a solution was purchased for prototype, operational testing or further development by one of the services/partners.

“The [UAS] threat is evolving,” Parent explained. “…These demonstrations aren’t just JCO demonstrations, they’re really demonstrations going on with all the services, partners and allies. That synchronizes our efforts across the services, across DOD, with our partners and really looks at what we can do to get after that threat … because it will continue to evolve.”

The JCO is planning another demonstration next year. After conducting a capability gap analysis, the team will select a focus area and engage with industry partners as they continue to look at ways to counter the UAS threat.

“The participation of more than 1,500 service members this year exemplifies the shared commitment to one another as we strengthen our partnerships and remain united to share responsibilities as defenders of our common values,” said U.S. Army South Commanding General, Maj. Gen. William Thigpen. “TW23 is key to leveraging the capabilities of like-minded countries to reach common goals and strengthen regional stability.”

Tradewinds is a U.S. Southern Command-sponsored annual exercise designed to strengthen partnerships and interoperability, promote human rights, as well as increase all participants' training capacity and capability to mitigate, plan for and respond to regional crises and security threats.

TW23 is the 38th iteration of the exercise and will see participants from 21 countries training in the ground, air, sea and cyber domains in various locations across Guyana from July 15-28.

According to Guyana Defense Force Maj. Jaime Castello, lead planner for TW23, this is the second time in three years that Guyana has hosted Tradewinds and there was a great national, regional and international effort put into ensuring the exercise came to fruition.

“Now, after months of planning, extensive coordination and tireless organizing we have finally arrived at this momentous occasion,” said Castello. “The planning committees, logistical teams and those involved have worked tirelessly to produce a plan … and design realistic scenarios that will challenge, inspire and foster growth among the participants.”

These plans will achieve the goals of the exercise as well as improve interagency interoperability according to the U.S. Ambassador to Guyana, the Honorable Sarah-Ann Lynch.

“The goal of this exercise is to improve the security responses of participating Caribbean nations and focus on skills building in interdiction, security and interagency cooperation,” said Lynch. “Participation of intergovernmental organizations such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Regional Security System, the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security, and Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency are especially crucial to the success of this exercise.”

The Tradewinds exercise has been held annually since 1984, only missing one year in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the goals of enhancing the collective ability of participating nations’ defense forces to counter regional threats and conduct humanitarian aid/disaster relief operations while developing strong relationships and reinforcing human rights awareness."

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait – On June 15, 2023, Soldiers with Charlie Company (C Co.), 142nd Division Sustainment Support Battalion (DSSB), a unit subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade, conducted convoy training at Camp Buehring, Kuwait, utilizing a Reconfigurable Vehicle Tactical Trainer (RVTT).

RVTT is a system that enables, using electronic vehicles and weapons, within a simulated environment with a 360-degree virtual landscape. It allows Soldiers to interact with the simulated environment by utilizing electronic vehicles and weapons such as a .50-caliber machine gun and a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV), which the C Co. 142nd DSSB Soldiers utilized during their training.

Crews of three Soldiers—with one evaluator occupying the fourth seat in the HMMWV—utilized two available RVTT trailers to conduct the training while 1st Lt. Christopher Niarchos, commanding officer of C Co. 142nd DSSB, and Staff Sgt. Gregory Schwartz, the senior gunner with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 382nd Combat Support Sustainment Battalion, provided radio communications inside a nearby trailer simulating an operations center.

Niarchos served as the mission commander in the simulation, asserting that the training significantly honed his radio communications skills. He also expressed confidence in his company’s increased adaptability and readiness for future vehicle-related missions.

However, he was quick to credit Schwartz for significantly enhancing the effectiveness of the training program.

“Units need supplies, and transportation Soldiers are responsible for delivering those supplies,” Niarchos said. “If you are moving supplies, you need to be able to protect those supplies, and so it’s great to have help from someone with extensive experience in gunnery to help with training.”

Schwartz gave directions via radio to truck commanders, who then relayed the direction to the driver of the electronic vehicle.

Strong sergeants like Schwartz lead their teams toward mission success by instilling a culture that shuns the concept of failure.

Pvt. Brianna Meza, a motor transport operator with C Co. 142d DSSB, who served as a gunner during this exercise, said that the leadership at the training helped her emerge from the new experience of convoy gunnery with confidence in her ability to communicate effectively with her crew and protect the convoy.

Guidance was not solely confined to the ranks of the mission commander and senior gunner but resonated through all team levels.

Leadership and mentorship extended to the participating Soldiers long before the gunnery training.

Staff Sgt. Michael Barrientos, a motor transport noncommissioned officer with C Co. 142nd DSSB, who served as his crew’s truck commander, recounted his mentorship of a junior Soldier in his unit, Pvt. Shane Merrigan.

Barrientos played an instrumental role in guiding Merrigan toward a more collaborative approach to his tasks. This evolution unfolded gradually, with Merrigan’s transformation becoming increasingly evident throughout the training.

During this specific exercise, Barrientos observed a notable change in Merrigan’s approach. Merrigan embraced collaboration and emerged as an integral part of the crew, a testament to his growth and Barrientos’ successful mentorship.

Strong sergeants, such as Barrientos, prioritize comprehensive readiness, encompassing not only their troops’ physical and mental well-being but also their gradual development into collaborative team players through dedicated mentorship and guidance.

Strong sergeants, of course, make strong Soldiers.

Merrigan articulated the core tenets of leadership intrinsic to his role as a gunner, emphasizing that his top priority is to ensure the safety of his crew and the convoy.

“I need to make sure that whatever cargo we are delivering, or whatever personnel we are delivering, is safe,” Merrigan said. “And so it is my job to keep my eyes open—stay alert, stay awake and keep everyone safe.”"

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait -- The 369th Sustainment Brigade (SB), Task Force Hellfighter, cased their colors, and the 371st Sustainment Brigade (SB) uncased their colors during a transfer of authority (TOA) ceremony at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, July 3, 2023.

The ceremony signified the end of the duties and responsibilities of the 369th SB, New York Army National Guard, commanded by U.S. Army Col. Seth Morgulas, and the assumption of those duties and responsibilities by the 371st SB, Ohio Army National Guard, commanded by Col. Michael Burgett.

In attendance were distinguished guests U.S. Army Reserve Brig. Gen. Maria Juarez, deputy commanding general of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command - Operational Command Post and Command Sgt. Maj. Ricardo Saunders, command sergeant major of the 143rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command.

Juarez, conducted the transfer of authority ceremony.

Juarez said that Morgulas and Command Sgt. Maj. Curtis Moss, the senior enlisted advisor of the 369th SB, achieved repeated mission success in the complex United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) area of responsibility with successful command of 2,800 Soldiers spread across 32 locations.

“The Hellfighters significant achievements and numerous and seemingly endless showcase of an impressive skillset and endless dedication will without question have a lasting impact on the future of our partners in securing their borders, deterring aggression and stabilizing the region,” Juarez said.

The 369th SB provided command and control of five direct reporting battalions, achieving mission success while running dynamic distributed mission command in support of Combined Joint Task Forces - Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Spartan Shield.

Morgulas said that while the Hellfighter Soldiers who served in Kuwait from late 2022-2023 did not endure combat conditions comparable to the original Hellfighters—where Sgt. Henry Johnson fought against a German raiding party during World War I—but none the less planned, coordinated and executed missions that made history.

“I’ve been assigned to many units and worked with many great teams during my 31 years of service, but I’ve never worked with as amazing a group of Soldiers as the Harlem Hellfighters,” Morgulas said. “Hellfighters, your dedication and ability to rise to any challenge has been truly inspiring.”

The 369th SB cased their colors, and their subordinate units—the 369th Special Troops Battalion, Headquarters and Headquarters Company 369th SB, 187th Signal Company—did the same.

Casing and uncasing colors is a military tradition that originated centuries ago so Soldiers could recognize and follow their units into battle.

The 371st SB, and their subordinate units, uncased their colors as they began their new mission.

Burgett kept his remarks brief. He thanked the Hellfighters for making the transition easy and said the 371st SB Sustainment Warriors would carry on the sustainment mission."

Sheila Baxter poses for a photo. Baxter served for 30 years in the Army's Medical Service Corps before transitioning to a civilian role as a staff chaplain with Veterans Affairs.

WASHINGTON — Following her retirement from three decades of Army service, Sheila Baxter provided veterans with spiritual counseling as a staff chaplain at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

This job was important to her, she said, because it was another way she could give back and make an impact on people’s lives.

One day, she received a call from a psychologist telling her there was a patient that could use her help. He was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

The Marine veteran struggled with the guilt of losing three men during a firefight overseas years ago. The anguish was taking a toll on him and his family. It even got to a point where he couldn’t keep a job.

Baxter called him to set up a meeting, and the two quickly bonded over their shared military experience.

“I was grateful to God that we were able to connect,” Baxter said. “Marines are tough. Sometimes they don’t open up like that, especially to a woman.”

They started meeting twice a month as they charted a path to improve his spiritual life. He slowly started making progress.

During their talks, Baxter learned he was holding so much pain inside because he never mourned the men he lost. He had pushed everything down and tried to forget. She knew he needed closure and asked if he wanted to hold a special ceremony in their honor.

He agreed.

During the memorial, he cried and called out their names.

“After that, I saw a change in him,” Baxter said. “It was a release. He was finally able to honor them.”

Seeing him find peace gave her joy. That was because service was her passion and she had been doing it all her life.

Coming from the small town of Franklin, Virginia, just southwest of Norfolk, she always had a sense of community. She grew up with her four siblings and several cousins who lived in the neighborhood.

Her father, an Army veteran who fought in the Korean War, was always helping people. He was a local contractor and owned an oil truck business with his brothers. He would help people with their rent or anything else they needed.

“He would give the clothes off his back to help you,” she said. “My parents always taught us the value of God, family and public service.”

She also learned teamwork and discipline early on by playing basketball with her siblings and cousins in her aunt’s backyard. She would take the skills she learned there all the way to Virginia State University where she became the first female basketball player to score 1,000 career points.

During her junior year, she would go with her cousin to visit her husband, an Army logistics officer stationed at Fort Bragg, now called Fort Liberty. He would take them around the base to show them different aspects of the Army.

While they were visiting, a feeling came over her.

“It was my light bulb moment,” she explained. “This is what I want to do, I want to lead troops.”

She saw the Army as a team sport like basketball with everyone working together toward a common goal. A week later, she went to the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps at her school and signed up.

She commissioned in 1978 as a Medical Service Corps officer after earning her bachelor’s degree in health and physical education. She chose the service corps because of the variety of jobs it presented and the chance it gave her to help people.

“I’m a people person,” she explained. “If you love people, your life is never boring.”

Throughout her career, mentors played a critical role in setting her up for success.

As a young medical logistics officer at her first assignment, her battalion commander asked her to give him a 20-year plan for her career.

She looked at him and said “Sir, I don’t know what I want to do in 20 minutes, and you want me to map out my career?”

That was exactly what he wanted her to do. She had to show him in five-year increments where she wanted to be and what goals she had. She went home that weekend and thought about it.

The next week, she told him she wanted to lead troops and be like him.

He helped her map it out and told her what she had to focus on to get there.

“That was a turning point early on in my career,” she said. “He really was a great mentor.”

She took his advice and steadily progressed in her career as she was promoted to major a year earlier than her peers.

Things didn’t always go to plan, however. While she was the logistics lead for a medical group, she dealt with a verbally abusive boss that would often curse at his staff. This behavior didn’t sit well with her.

After leaving a meeting one day, she thought she had enough and was ready to quit the Army. At that moment, she heard a voice within her say, “No you’re not, you’re going to hang in there.”

She prayed for her boss. With the help of her pastor, she was able to take her focus off him and put it on God. She changed her perspective and instead leaned on the positive things in her life like her staff.

""I learned everything isn't going to be peaches and cream, but you've got to hang in there because it's making you who you should be,” she explained. “Sometimes we have to have a little resistance in order to understand you can overcome the situation. You just have to change your perspective.""

She carried the lessons she learned throughout her career and tried to pass them on to those around her, just as the officers and noncommissioned officers had done in her life.

As she continued down her career path, she became the commander of the 226th Medical Battalion in Germany. Even after reaching this milestone, she knew she needed to continue to rely on those around her.

“If you don’t listen to your mentors, you are doing yourself a disservice because mentors can see in you what you cannot see in yourself,” she said.

Listening to the advice of one mentor, Brig Gen. Richard Ursone, she invited the lieutenant general in her chain of command for a visit to the battalion. Three weeks later, he stopped by.

During the visit, Baxter let her NCOs and civilians lead the briefs.

“It’s about highlighting the people that work with you and giving them a voice,” she said.

The general was impressed.

A year later, she received a call from the Army surgeon general saying she was selected to brigadier general.

“He must’ve thought I dropped the phone because I couldn’t speak, I was so blown away,” she recalled. “It was such a surprise, but I was humbled and grateful for the opportunity.”

She became the first female chief of the Medical Service Corps, leading more than 9,000 officers across the Army Medical Department. Her vision for the corps was competence, courage and compassion. She wanted them to be the best they could be and to help others along the way, just as she was helped.

“I am extremely proud to be a Medical Service Corps officer,” she said. “When I look back at our history, we just keep going to higher levels because of the quality of Soldiers and leaders that we have.”

Throughout her time as chief, she traveled around the Army listening to the troops and hoping to inspire them.

As she went through a dining facility on one of her visits, a young private first class ran up to her and told her she was going back to school so she could be like her.

“The promotion to brigadier general wasn’t about me, it was for other people to see that if God could do it for me, he could do it for them,” she said. “I told her ‘thank you, please do that because you can make it.’”

After 30 years of service, she retired from the Army but not from helping others. She couldn’t just sit and relax following her years of being around Soldiers. She wanted to continue with her passion of service. So, she applied for the Clinical Pastoral Education Program through the Veterans Affairs in Atlanta.

This program eventually led her to a full-time chaplain position where she helped veterans with their spiritual care for another 10 years.

“When I think about why I continue to give back, I believe it’s in my DNA,” she said. “It’s something that makes me proud in terms of giving my life meaning and purpose. Service gives me joy; gives me passion.”

Baxter retired from the VA in 2021 to pursue her doctorate in ministry, which she will complete next year. She continues to give back and goes out every Sunday to help homeless women and men.

CHICAGO – The rock group Boson has a phrase ‘It’s been such a long time’ in their 1976 song titled Long Time. And it could not be truer for a man who began his military career as a student at Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida.

On June 21, 2023, 19,000 baseball fans cheered for U.S. Army Reserve Lt. Col. Brian Dunn, at the Chicago White Sox stadium, on a night that recognized Dunn, along with U.S. Navy Veteran Monica Urbieta who was honored as the “Hero of the Game’ for her service on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. George Washington in the Persian Gulf.

“So that was pretty impactful,” said a clearly elated Dunn. “(What an honor) by the White Sox organization, with my family here on Pride night with my husband, Mike. And to have someone that I served with come up and say hi filled me with a lot of gratitude.”

Before walking to the mound, Dunn exchanged greetings with fellow Army officer, retired Maj. Kelvin Pickens, whom he worked with at Fort Sheridan. Pickens currently works instant replay for the Chicago White Sox.

“When I joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. in 1993 there was an outright ban on service members that identified as (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning),” said Dunn. “Now 30 years later, the military has full support of our LGBTQ service members. The military’s view of our LGBTQ service members has come a long way. I’m very proud to wear my uniform and to be honored here for my military service on Pride night.”

Dunn’s husband, Mike Graves, was equally proud watching from his seat.

“It was a surprise but it’s a great thing. He really deserves it,” said Graves, a Navy veteran who served four years as a Torpedoman’s Mate on a ballistic missile submarine. “He’s a great representative for the Army. He is providing a service above and beyond and he does it happily.”

Ron Skarbek of Wilmette, Illinois, and a White Sox fan, said “It brought chills to me,” as he watched Dunn being applauded by the fans.

Like Dunn, Skarbek started out in ROTC at college and served as an Army officer from 1972 to 1976.

“I was a military police officer. Most of my time was stateside at Fort Gordon, Fort Benning and the Presidio,” said Skarbek.

Throughout history, LGBTQ Soldiers and civilians have bravely served and defended the country, often despite personal challenges and barriers to service.

Before he was assassinated, President John F. Kennedy spoke about diversity during a commencement speech at American University on June 10th, 1963.

“Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal,” he said.”"

Military Intelligence Readiness Command Soldiers and family members attended a Building Strong and Ready Teams event held June 23 – 25.

Building Strong and Ready Teams is a command directed, chaplain led, community partnered effort that strengthens spiritual readiness for Soldiers of all ranks and their families. This program was previously known as Strong Bonds.

The MIRC’s event took place over a weekend which allowed entire families to attend.

Chaplain (1st. Lt.) Carlos Joel Venezario served as an event organizer and presented materials in many of the small group settings. “The Army’s goal here is to provide tools and resources to build ready teams by maintaining the support that Soldiers have back at home. Being able to feed that and strengthen that is what's very important.”

Venezario explained that while the program has a spiritual component, no sessions are mandatory.

He also touched on what others believe they know about Building Strong and Ready Teams events. “I definitely like to address the stigmas people may have about these weekends. A lot of people think that these events are for people with broken marriages, or broken families. And that is not the case. Sure, people may need some help, or maybe need some resources coming in. But the majority of people coming here, they're not broken. They're people who want tools to better themselves.”

Venezario’s wife, Kendra Adams-Venezario, also helped lead the event. “This program contributes to the longevity of careers and the resiliency of families. You know, the military has one of the highest divorce rates in the country. The struggle that comes with moving so often and being separated from your support group and, all of that, it's trying on anybody.”

Adams-Venezario is working on a master’s degree in dispute resolution and has received training from the Army. This was the second time Adams-Venezario assisted in leading an event.

Her background and experiences as a military spouse informed her perspective and enhanced implementation of the program. “We're teaching active choices. That's all rooted in psychology. The course was written by a licensed psychologist and Family Therapist, the information that's included in it is all supported by psychological and scientific research. We talk about the impact of these things on marriage and the types of tools that work, the things that you do that harm your marriage and the things you can do that heal it.”

Nine couples attended the event. The program also included hotel lodging, childcare and meals. Venezario-Adams touted the event design. “Being able to provide that kind of support for families, and to give them the opportunity to spend time together, and to improve their relationships with one another, I think, is really beneficial.”

Spc. Anna Negm, a budget analyst working in the MIRC G8, attended with her husband Mike and young son. Negm agreed that the event provided value for her family. “It's a perfect setup, because as a lot of people who are here, we are also busy. This is a great way for us to spend our weekend while we do something for us as a couple. And yet we have our child here who's having a great time with his friends. And then we reunite and still have that family time during the weekend. It's perfect.”

Mike added, “We were able to check so many boxes, and attend this training really for a happier, healthier home. It's going to benefit all of us. We wouldn't have been able to attend without the childcare provided.”"

CHICAGO – The Chicago Sky Women's National Basketball Association team honored U.S. Army Reserve Maj. Tiesha Stephens for her military service during their Juneteenth observance home game verses the Indiana Fever at Wintrust Arena, June 15, 2023, in Chicago.

Stephens, who serves as a human resources officer for the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, received a plaque by the team mascot “Sky Guy” during the “Military Moment of the Game” for her outstanding commitment and service to the country.

Following her on-court recognition in front of thousands of roaring spectators, Stephens reflected on being publicly honored at the game.

“It was a great honor to be recognized during the Chicago Sky’s Juneteenth Game with my daughter present,” said Stephens. “Representing the Army during this holiday was a heartfelt privilege, and we truly enjoyed the experience.”

Juneteenth National Independence Day commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. While the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Lincoln, legally freed slaves throughout the Confederate States on January 1, 1863, Texas resisted for two years until U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger led an advance force of 1,800 men from the XIII Corps to the port city of Galveston, Texas.

Granger assumed command over the Military District of Texas, and issued General Order No. 3 on June 19, 1865, formally enforcing provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas for the first time. Juneteenth is celebrated on the anniversary of the order and derives its name from combining June and nineteenth. Juneteenth officially became the eleventh United States federal holiday in 2021.

Stephens, joined the Army in 1997 and received her commission through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. She has mobilized in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

Stephens’ awards include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Army Achievement Medal, among many other awards, throughout her years of service."

JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST, N.J. — Reserve members from the U.S. Army and Air Force spent the last week training at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey for the 2023 Inter-Allied Confederation of Reserve Officers, or CIOR, military competition being held in Helsinki, Finland.

The competition, known as Milcomp, is a pentathlon designed to challenge reserve members from across the alliance physically with a focus on military skills, according to the CIOR website. The categories

include pistol and rifle shooting, an obstacle course, utility swimming (with obstacles), and military orienteering often referred to as land navigation.

“Those five skills translate to a regular Soldier and how a Soldier in everyday life can succeed,” said Staff Sgt. Daniel Kelley, international marksmanship coach and Olympic orienteering coach for the team. “We have young people here learning very valuable life-skills.”

Kelley added that this week was all about getting the competitors in the right mindset while becoming proficient in each category.

“This week has been long and hard,” said 1st Lt. Brianna Mirmina, a first-year competitor and Bethany, Connecticut native. “It’s been challenging but a great experience.”

Many members of the Army Reserve began training in early May, while trials week started June 12 and ended June 17 with individuals being placed on their respective teams.

“It has been super busy and a lot of hard work,” said Staff Sgt. Gavin Hopler, from St. Louis, Missouri and CIOR Milcomp rookie. “I think it’s really helped us hone our skills and set us up for success.”

Next stop is Sweden for one more week of training, then to Finland for the three-day competition.

“I expect them to represent the United States very well,"" said Command Sgt. Maj. Russell Moore, CIOR pistol coach. “They’ve put a lot of effort into it, and hopefully they can translate that into a good outcome.”"

WEST POINT, N.Y. -- U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers from both the Army Reserve Medical Command and the 3rd Medical Command (Deployment Support) were dispatched to the U.S. Military Academy to provide real-world medical support and advisement during the Summer Leadership Experience 2023 here, June 3-9 and June 10-16, 2023.

Held twice every year at the prestigious West Point academy, SLE delegates cadets into the role as cadre and support staff to lead and guide potential cadet candidates throughout the course.

""The Summer Leadership Experience is a program led by the Directorate of Admissions where we send in 1,100 rising high school seniors and give them a one-week exposure to the U.S. Military Academy in academics, physical training and military training,"" said U.S. Army Col. Peter Mack, Directorate of Admissions Medical Officer at West Point. ""It allows them to see if the academy life would be like for them.""

To ensure minimal hospitalization and attrition reduction of cadet candidates due to injuries and illnesses, West Point leadership always incorporate Army Reserve medical Soldiers and equipment for every SLE session.

The pilot program for Army Reserve medical support during SLE resulted in over a 90 percent decrease in hospitalization for cadet candidates.

""We went from sending 110 cadet candidates to the hospital for simple things such as headaches, sprains, bumps, bruises, and contusions,"" Mack said. ""When medics started treating that, that number dropped that we sent to the hospital from 110 down to 10. Afterward, we expanded the program to bring nurses and medical providers.""

According to U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Francis Deravens, a combat medic assigned to the Northeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group, Staten Island, N.Y., him and other Soldiers work tirelessly and expeditiously to maintain the status quo.

""Overall, we are a Level 1 real-world clinic just providing simple aid,"" Deravens said. ""Anything from dehydration to if someone needs to get transported to the hospital. As of (five days into the SLE events), we have seen around 60 individuals - a mix between candidates, cadets and also staff. At the end, we typically see about 100 people in the end of one week for various reasons.""

Aside from the benefit of the partnership between West Point and the Army Reserve, this experience has also been conducive to medical Soldiers in the upkeep of their skill sets and aptitude.

""It has been a really good experience, as this is the first time that I've done any true medical coverage since Advanced Individual Training,"" said U.S. Army Reserve Pfc. Zachary Epstein, a combat medic assigned to 451st Medical Detachment, a 3rd MCDS unit out of Hartford, Connecticut. ""We've seen all sorts of different injuries and illnesses, from bumps and bruises to twisted ankles to anxiety effects. So it has been good, especially working closely with the providers.""

Furthermore, cadet candidates obtain a greater understanding of what medical Soldiers can provide in both the training and operational environment.

""The exposure to the Army Medical Department is incredible, no matter what branch that they go into; whether it is Combat Arms, Combat Support or Combat Service Support, they are going to be dealing with medical in any operation that they do,"" Mack said. ""So they get to see this firsthand, and can see what the medics can do to keep their Soldiers in the fight rather than evacuating them to a higher role of care and losing them for training and for any military operation. It enhances the mission, and it is a force multipler and this has been an incredible experience for them.""

The next iterations of SLE are currently slated for June 1-7/June 8-14, 2024. Nonetheless, Army Reserve medical support will remain an integral component of SLE preplanning and execution.

""We can't live without Army Reserve medical support,"" Mack said. ""It makes this program safe, it makes it run very smoothly, and it also helps enhance the training because we can keep Soldiers in the fight and allow them to continue training without them going to the hospital."""

U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade conducted a relationship-building, information-sharing dialogue that commenced on May 31, 2023.

The dialogue signified a historic milestone. For the first time, U.S. and Israeli forces came together to share knowledge and respect for the handling of fallen warriors.

This successful convoy allowed the U.S. Army to set up the Mobile Integrated Remains Collection System (MIRCS) in Israel, showcasing its capabilities and presenting a robust, streamlined and dignified system for handling fallen warriors.

According to U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Yensy Carty, 673rd Quartermaster (QM) Company mortuary affairs team noncommissioned officer in charge, the MIRCS provides a solution to the challenging task of adequately collecting, preserving and transporting the remains of fallen warriors on the battlefield.

The system offers a respectful way to manage remains through state-of-the-art preservation technology, advanced collection equipment, identification and documentation, the preservation of personal effects, tracking and reporting, as well as religious sensitivity.

The 673rd QM, an Army Reserve unit based out of Delaware, demonstrated the solemn and meticulously choreographed ritual, known as dignified transfer, to the Israeli military personnel. It is a process filled with respect and honor, symbolizing the U.S. military’s gratitude for the ultimate sacrifice made by fallen warriors from the U.S. and those from partner nations.

U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Gabriel Montalvo, with the mortuary affairs team, said it is a real honor to demonstrate the values associated with the ritual given to each fallen warrior and show allies that this is the respect their service members receive.

“What my team and I provide is a respectful preparation for the last goodbye of a family to their fallen warrior,” Montalvo said. “The process allows a family to have closure with their service member.”

The Israeli military personnel shared information about burial traditions with U.S. Army personnel by showing a traditional, kosher wood casket.

According to Jewish tradition, man is created equal. Therefore, he is equal in death, which is why Rabbinic authorities recommend using simple caskets that reflect this democracy and prevent the unnecessary expense of elaborately adorned coffins.

The sharing of burial traditions between Israeli and U.S. military personnel was more than an exchange of customs. It revealed mutual respect and understanding for every individual’s equality and inherent dignity, both in life and death. This recognition extends beyond burial rituals, influencing a broader cooperative relationship between the two nations because allies and partners enable strategic readiness.

Capt. Amanda Longoria, the officer in charge of the 673d QM mortuary affairs team, said it was essential to learn about Israel’s needs regarding interacting with U.S. mortuary affairs.

“The U.S. and Israel are going to work more together in the future,” Longoria said.

“I feel honor, empathy and compassion for what I do,” Montalvo said. “And I feel honored sharing what I do, and I would gladly share my experience with partner nations again.”"

U.S. Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers subordinate to the 369th Sustainment Brigade conducted a convoy to Israel on May 30, 2023, to participate in a mortuary affairs subject matter exchange with the Israeli Defense Forces.

Spanning hundreds of miles with challenges such as heat temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the journey of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command into Israel ensured that a new chapter of collaboration and mutual learning unfolded.

The convoy centered around the transport of the Mobile Integrated Remains Collection System, a crucial tool for handling mortuary affairs on the battlefield, which rested on the M1075 Palletized Load System, a truck-based logistics platform.

Louisiana National Guard Spc. Emmanuel Moore, a wheeled vehicle mechanic with the 3673rd Support Maintenance Company, stressed the importance of this exercise.

“Transporting the MIRCS allows us to check our movement processes,” Moore said. “Moreover, carrying out this operation with Israel strengthens our relationships and mutual understanding.”

Allies and partners enable strategic readiness—the Army’s ability to mobilize, deploy and sustain forces in large-scale combat operations.

According to Fleet Master Chief Derrick Walters, Senior Enlisted Leader, there are currently 21 countries under the purview of U.S. Central Command—with Israel being the most recent addition.

“It’s a growing process as we envelop Israel in USCENTCOM as a regional partner,” Walters said. “This is critically important for regional security and stability.”

Indeed, external readiness constitutes a crucial factor in the success of these operations. Collaboration with allies like Israel is instrumental in accomplishing a mission’s immediate objectives and laying the groundwork for strengthened international relations and future joint efforts.

This exercise also demonstrated the importance of interoperability between the U.S. and its allies. The smooth transition of the MIRCS into Israeli territory, and the subsequent discussions around mortuary affairs, were made possible by clear communication, understanding of respective military protocols and mutual respect between the U.S. and Israeli forces.

Without clear communication and shared readiness, the complexities of border crossings and customs procedures could have led to challenges and misunderstandings of customs procedures.

The result could be an investigation or confiscation of essential items, causing substantial mission delays or even loss of crucial supplies hindering the actual setup of the MIRCS, and potentially altering the course and outcomes of the mission.

Due to the cooperation, understanding and respecting custom regulations, these challenges were prevented."

JORDAN — On a remote air base in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility, signal officers recall, over dinner, the progress their team has made in establishing a near-complete communication system.

The signal team on-ground comprised of U.S Army Reserve Soldiers from the 143rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command, Capt. Devin Lajoie, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Matthew Morgan and South Carolina National Guard Soldiers from the 151st Expeditionary Signal Battalion.

Together, these Soldiers belong to the 1st Theater Sustainment Command Operational Command Post and are responsible for the mission of providing reliable communication throughout the 1st TSC Alternate Command Post, an air base designed to serve as an alternate location for the 1st TSC OCP to function and service an influx of personnel at any given moment.

This mission, which began almost six months prior, required them to fall in on what the exiting unit had already established and make whatever changes or upgrades to bring the communications network up. Now approaching completion, the 143rd ESC will hand the responsibilities over to the team’s replacements — a subordinate unit within the 1st TSC OCP.

“When we first got here, all of the operations, as far communications go, was basically functioning out of one room,” said Lajoie. “Now we’re at almost 30 workstations, with another 130 potential workstations throughout the entire building wired out and ready to go.”

Before the team arrived, the air base ran off a tactical secure internet protocol router/non-secure internet protocol router access point system. This system only provided connection speeds of 20 megabits per second. “That doesn’t provide a lot of bandwidth for a lot of users,” said Lajoie.

The team can now boast the implementation of Starlink terminals, which has increased bandwidth ten-fold across the base. “It’s a commercial solution that provides a larger bandwidth for our strategic services on-site,” said Lajoie.

“Our main mission here, initially, was really just to support the tactical satellite links,” Morgan added, “but Capt. Lajoie has done a good job at making partnerships with the 151st command team. So now, this is the second or third time to do these huge surge efforts to just run thousands and thousands of feet of [fiber-optic] cable.”

Investing in the Army’s people, reorganizing forces, developing new equipment and adopting new concepts on how to fight allows the organization to maintain superiority over any potential adversary.

The Army’s modernization efforts require partnerships between joint force entities, research and development entities, partners in industry, academia and the tech sector.

Morgan emphasized that for the signal team to carry out their mission at the air base, coordination is also required signal teams from U.S. Army Central Command, 1TSC-OCP, 1TSC-Main Command Post at Fort Knox, Kentucky, Area Support Group-Kuwait, and Regional Cyber Center-Southwest Asia.

“Malleability,” stated Lajoie. “I think that’s kind of a good way to define what we’re trying to do here. What we’re trying to do is be malleable and set up a network backbone that will allow for whatever mission a unit decides to have on-site.”

Establishing an efficient communications network in remote areas will successfully posture the Army of 2030 to win in a multi-domain operating environment."

Brig. Gen. Vance Kuhner, deputy commanding general (support) for the 200th MP CMD, was charged with overseeing the command during the exercise. According to Kuhner, the three top areas of focus for the unit were deployability, alliance and partnership, and the rule of law.

“Our staff exercised their ability to talk to our allies and partners along with our higher headquarters [during this CPX],” said Kuhner. “In doing so, the staff learned a lot about itself. We learned some new areas that we must focus more on, but we also learned that we could do it. We are ready, we're relevant, and we're ready for the future.”

Since many soldiers in the command work in policing in their civilian lives, the transition to a military police mission was somewhat seamless. This exercise included planning considerations of law enforcement, rear area security, and detainee operations missions. Furthermore, the exercise challenged the command to integrate functional skills from medical, chemical, engineer, information operations, public affairs, to civil affairs.

“This gave our headquarters staff as well as one of our subordinate brigades (300th MP BDE) the opportunity to come and participate in a larger exercise that included our multinational partners, as well as U.S. Army Europe and Africa staff, and to inject ourselves into not only the planning process, but the execution of working as a theater level military police command,” said Col. John Dunn, chief of staff of the command.

“This was the first opportunity that we had, as a military police command, to participate in a command post exercise of this level,” added Dunn. “It really gave us the opportunity to exercise our staff functionality, with higher headquarters as well as our subordinate units, our sister units to our left and right, and our multinational partners.”

Kuhner told the command staff during the exercise as a teaching moment that it’s not enough to do just policing anymore. On the battlefield, a variety of scenarios may play out at any time, and the command must be ready to step up. The CPX was an opportunity to train for a variety of possible real-world scenarios.

""We worked first on getting the [battle drills] right, and once we got it right, we worked on speed,” said Kuhner. “Our ability to get the products out, get the coordination done, work with our down trace brigades, making sure that they're doing what needs to be done to support to the [Combined Forces Land Component Commander], I really saw nothing negative. I saw really nothing that I would say we weren't ready to do. We're ready to do all of it.""

Sgt. Maj. Anthony Kresta is the operations noncomissioned officer in charge for the command. He called enlisted personnel “the glue that holds the staff together,” ensuring continuity between staff sections.

“Having the opportunity to come here to the European theater to train with our U.S. counterparts, as well as our multinational partners, has been one like I've never experienced in my nearly 40-year career,” said Kresta. “This unique opportunity has given us the ability to train as staff, and especially from the perspective of our enlisted soldiers and our noncommissioned officer corps, an ability to demonstrate to our staff officer members of the team that we are full force multiplier when it comes to the operations of our command post.”

The CPX, part of DEFENDER 23, was a computer-assisted exercise designed to build V Corps’ ability to conduct operations throughout Europe in a multi-corps, multi-national and multi-domain environment. This exercise took place June 5 to 14 and included approximately 2,000 personnel from USAEUR-AF, V Corps, as well as 1,000 multi-national personnel from five allied and partner countries that include Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, Netherlands and Romania.

DEFENDER 23 is a U.S. European Command directed multi-national, joint exercise designed to build readiness and interoperability between U.S. and NATO Allies and partners.

DEFENDER 23 includes more than 7,800 U.S. and 15,000 multi-national service members from 26 Allied and partner nations, including Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech (Czechia), Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States."

MARTINSBURG, W.Va. - Three West Virginia National Guardsmen participated in the Women in Strategic Intelligence Seminar in Doha, Qatar, May 14-18.

Maj. Taylar Belfield and Tech. Sgt. Victoria Bagley, both assigned to the 167th Operations Support Squadron, and 1st Lt. Abbey Welborn, 111th Engineer Brigade, joined servicemembers and civilians from the Qatar Armed Forces, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Army Central and U.S. Air Forces Central for the event.

The three women presented information in their respective areas of expertise at the seminar.

Supporting the Department of Defense Women, Peace, and Security Strategic Framework and Implementation Plan, the seminar increased understanding of how strategy drives intelligence gathering, analysis, product development and decision making.

The seminar also provided an opportunity to build relationships between the West Virginia National Guard and the Qatari Armed Forces, partnered through the National Guard Bureau’s State Partnership Program.

The first day of the seminar focused on topics specific to women in, and working in support of, the military. The next three days, participants discussed intelligence topics, followed by a practical exercise on the final day.

“The experience of meeting these ladies who are trailblazers in their country, they’re very impressive women, it was the best all-around [temporary duty assignment],” Belfield said of engaging with the nearly 30 Qatari women who support the Ministry of Defense as civilian intelligence analysts.

The biggest takeaway for Bagley was the common ground they found with their Qatari counterparts as discussions bounced between personal and professional topics.

“We think we are so different based on culture, but there are so many similarities, especially when you’re focusing on gender. As soon as kids or family is mentioned, everyone wants to share their personal experiences,” Bagley said.

She noted the support the Qatari women have from their male coworkers, who recognize their value and see the unique perspective they bring to intelligence analysis.

“Qatar is forward-leaning in the Middle East when it comes to women and the workplace, and I think there’s so much value in having them as a state partner,” Belfield said.

The West Virginia National Guard and Qatar have partnered since 2018 through the Department of Defense National Guard Bureau State Partnership Program. West Virginia Guard members helped their Qatari military partners prepare for and execute the FIFA World Cup in 2022. Most recently, West Virginia National Guard and Qatari military leaders met in Doha for a State Partnership Program engagement in March.

The 268th Inland Cargo Transportation Company, from the 1st Mission Support Command, undergoes extensive training for an upcoming deployment. Since 9/11, nearly 100% of the Army Reserve units in Puerto Rico have mobilized and deployed as a member of the Joint Force.

Recently, the transportation unit completed Operation Tin Man at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, where the soldiers were responsible for managing equipment at the Central Receiving Shipping Point and moving it to the Gulfport by operating tactical vehicles.

Here at Camp Shelby, the CRSP yard is divided into three areas of operation the storage, holding, and ready line.

""As an 88H, a cargo specialist, my duty was to load and unload 20-foot containers from platforms with the RT240 at the CRSP yard,"" said Spc. Hector Martinez.

The Kalmar RT240 Rough Terrain Container Handler is one of the many tactical vehicles used in the armed forces to handle standard shipping containers and is considered the backbone of military logistics.

The 88Hs performed single stacks of the containers at the designated ready line. Then the Palletized Load System cargo transfer team unloaded the container to the PLS so the 88Ms could transport it to the final destination, explained Spc. Martinez.

The 88Ms is the military occupational code for motor transport operators, according to Sgt. Jonathan Collazo, performing real-life missions during annual training, enables the Army Reserve soldiers to train on different aspects of transportation.

The motor transport operators conducted convoy operations, equipment movement, preventive maintenance checks, and inventories.

""The mission was an opportunity for the soldiers to gain more experience and proficiency in their MOS,"" said Sgt. Collazo.

The Army Reserve soldiers fostered a culture of learning among each other, enabling the young soldiers to build their expertise; consequently, the transportation team could safely move over 400 containers, concluded Sgt. Collazo.

Operation Tin Man enabled the Army Reserve soldiers to be mission ready as they managed and transported the equipment, ensuring delivery was made on time and in good condition.

The Army Reserve forces in Puerto Rico have become an essential part of the total force, with streamlined, deployable forces and citizen Soldiers who embody the warrior mindset and spirit."

Travel is a routine part of the 787th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion’s training, but this time the journey will take it overseas.

The Army Reserve unit, based in Dothan, Ala., departed its headquarters Sunday morning, June 4, 2023. A handful of family members and friends said their farewells outside the building as their Soldiers loaded on buses to leave at dawn.

The battalion had prepared for its European deployment since before November. Command Sgt. Maj. Clint Halstead, the unit’s senior NCO, said morale rose when the unit learned its new missions would mainly involve convoys and moving supplies – reflecting its normal transportation work.

“It was intensely motivating,” he said. “When a mission set is put in front of you, all that training is more inspiring because you’re going to a real place.”

The initial trip on June 4 took the unit to Fort Cavazos, Texas, for the pre-deployment process. From there, the 787 CSSB will travel to support Operation European Assure, Deter, Reinforce. Many of the Soldiers have never served outside the United States before; those who did shared their personal experiences and advice with the others as they prepared for departure.

Sgt. 1st Class Phillip Rogers, the first sergeant, has deployed three times to various countries – Iraq, Afghanistan and Jordan. He said it will be important for the troops to keep in contact with their friends and families, maintain their finances, keep in touch with their personal spirituality and communicate with their leadership.

“If they don’t do it, they end up keeping to themselves,” Rogers said concerning communication. “They end up in a place where they’re in a rough spot … We can’t help them when we don’t know.”

This will be the first deployment for Staff Sgt. Devon Fields, a petroleum supply NCO, who said he was excited to finally go overseas.

“It’s been a long time coming,” he said. “It’s not easy leaving my family for this amount of time, but my wife understands this is a requirement and has the support she needs.”

Fields has a form of support he’s taking with him – his twin brother, Staff Sgt. Tyawan Fields. The brothers joined the Army together and went to basic together. Now they serve in the same unit and will be able to experience Europe at the same time.

Previously, they both tried to get on multiple deployments, but Tyawan, a transportation management coordinator, managed to go first and was sent in 2021 to Kuwait. While they talked by phone throughout that time, both agreed being there for each other in person will be an improvement.

“Going through it together makes it easier,” Tyawan said.

His wife, Jakelia “GeGe” Fields, said even though he just got back last year, she is now better prepared for the family hardships that come with a deployment – such as him missing the milestones their children will go through during the year.

“I think it’s going to be a little easier,” she said. “I know what to expect and what not to expect.”

Some Soldiers felt the same way. Spc. Jose Martinez, a communications specialist, previously deployed to Kuwait and Iraq. He said he was more relaxed about deploying this time and was glad he was going with the 787 CSSB.

He said his fellow troops have a sense of pride about using their skills for the missions they’ll be conducting.

“Being able to apply it for the Army overseas gives you a sense of accomplishment,” Martinez said. “A lot of them are excited for it – doing their job on the daily.”

The unit itself has a long history of doing its job and has been in Dothan in various forms since 1968. It went to Afghanistan in 2003 and supported Operation Inherent Resolve with a deployment to Iraq and Syria in 2018.

Maj. Hugh Carswell, the battalion executive officer, led a farewell ceremony the day before the unit left. He expressed confidence in the troop’s abilities, noting that the experienced Soldiers will help the newer ones.

“I think we have leadership in each section to fulfill the mission,” he said. “They know what their role is and they know what they’re doing. They have the confidence to get the job done.”

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait - U.S. Army sustainers with the 1st Theater Sustainment Command’s Operational Command Post provided logistics support to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility during the bilateral military exercise held between the U.S. and Israel militaries known as Juniper Caracal 2023, held in May 2023.

The Juniper exercise series, including Juniper Oak 23-2, and Juniper Falcon 23-2 which were completed in earlier this year, are designed to enhance interoperability between both nations’ militaries and ensure U.S. and Israeli forces are ready and prepared to respond to any contingency, particularly those involving ballistic missile defense or crisis response.

Col. Gerry L. Jackson, 1st TSC alternate command post director, explained how this exercise demonstrates the long-standing commitment and cooperation between Israel and the United States.

“Our partnership with Israel is key. The Juniper Caracal exercise helps strengthen our partnership and our working relationship with Israel,” said Jackson.

The exercise was planned by members of both the 1st TSC and IDF and consisted of participants from the 673d Quartermaster Company mortuary affairs team and the 730th Quartermaster Company transportation team. These teams conducted a convoy operation and a demonstration of combat readiness by showcasing the capabilities of a mobile integrated remains collection system.

The MIRCS is a self-contained shelter with four main areas: a receiving and processing area, a refrigerated storage area for remains, an administrative area, and a storage section for operational supplies. It consists of all components necessary to deploy, move and operate in support of a full spectrum of military and peacetime disaster support. It can be transported via land or by air.

Sgt. Maj. Lachelle Wiggins, the Juniper Caracal noncommissioned officer in charge, said that she was pleased with the success of the exercise.

“As we build our partnership with the IDF, it is these positive interactions that generate readiness and build trust in our capabilities as technically and tactically proficient professionals,” stated Wiggins.

The Juniper exercise series serves as an opportunity for U.S. military personnel and the IDF to exercise together and to learn from one another. JC23 represents another step in the deliberate and strategic relationship between the U.S. and Israel and contributes to overall regional stability."

Story by Lt. Col. Brian Dunn

CHICAGO – Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs honored U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. Amrit Sandhu, of the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command, during a Memorial Day home game versus the Tampa Bay Rays at Wrigley Field in Chicago, May 29, 2023.

A nationally televised game with 38,163 in attendance, Sandhu was publicly honored on the field for the game’s “Military Salute”. He was presented with an official game ball by the Cubs organization and received a standing ovation from tens of thousands of spectators.

Recognition for Sandhu came in conjunction with multiple Memorial Day honors at Wrigley Field, including the unfurling of a large American flag that covered the outfield section, a moment of silence for our nation’s fallen heroes, and a spotlight honor to a “Gold Star” Marine family.

Sandhu was joined by his two sons, Timur (12) and Edward (8). It was their first MLB baseball game.

Sandhu immigrated to the United States from Gurdaspur, Punjab, India in 2008. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve in September 2015 as a Financial Management Technician, and in January of 2017 Sandhu was sworn in as a United States citizen. He is currently serving as Budget Analyst for the 85th USARSC, headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois, outside Chicago.

Reflecting on his 8-year career in the Army Reserve, Sandhu noted he “loves to wear the uniform, and to be a part of a strong team in the U.S. Army.”

“I plan to extend my contract – I’ll feel like I’m missing something if I don’t,” said Sandhu.

Sandhu also elaborated on the feeling of receiving the honor at the game.

“Here today at Wrigley, it feels very special to be supported and respected by the crowd. I appreciate the opportunity to be honored on this special day – Memorial Day,” Sandhu said. “My boys will have a unique memory for the rest of their lives. Every kid wants to be out on that field, and they made it out there.”

Sandhu took the field, along the 3rd base line in the second inning, just prior to the Cubs batting. As Sandhu appeared on the Wrigley jumbotron in left field, and broadcast nationwide, Timur and Edward remarked “It feels pretty cool to see dad get cheered by the crowd, and to see him up on the big screen”.

From his vantage position a few feet from the Chicago Cubs dugout, Edward later noted “I bet I’m better at baseball than they are”. Edward plays grade school baseball.

Many spectators were displaying their support for members of the military during the Memorial Day game at Wrigley. One spectator, John, wearing a camouflage Army baseball cap and dog tags, said he was honoring his parents – both World War II Army veterans that served in hospitals and treated Soldiers coming back from the Pacific.

“It’s incredible to see the Cubs honor Sergeant Sandhu on the field,” said John.

As the game neared its end, Timur said he wanted to play baseball with his dad when they got home. While enjoying a ballpark hotdog a few feet from Chicago Cubs’ Miles Mastrobuoni’s 3rd base position, when asked if he was going to play with the baseball the Cubs gave him, Timur remarked “No, I’m saving that”.

The Chicago Cubs defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 1-0 in the 9th inning."

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. – Soldiers assigned to the 85th U.S Army Reserve Support Command joined their local communities to honor service during the Memorial Day weekend, May 27-29, 2023.

The Rolling Meadows Memorial Day parade brought together veterans, local residents, first responders and military personnel to share in the remembrance of fallen heroes.

As in many communities across America, residents and veterans young and old stood silently to listen to Lt. Col. Brian Dunn, Assistant Chief of Staff G-1, 85th USARSC, speak at the Veterans Memorial Carillon Monument on the cost of freedom and what Memorial Day means.

“Since the founding of our Nation, more than 42 million Americans have stepped forward to serve this country, and more than a million have died so their children and future generations could live freely,” said Dunn.

“They came from across our nation and every walk of life. Each different, each an individual who made a choice, yet all shared the same dream of freedom that gave birth to our nation and carried the light of liberty to millions across the globe.”

Marine Pfc. Walter Sanojca of Chicago was one of them. Killed during fierce fighting at the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945.

A loss felt to this day by his niece, Lara Sanoica, Mayor, Rolling Meadows, who reflected on the meaning of Memorial Day.

“For me, personally, (Memorial Day means) my great uncle, Walter Sanojca, who died in the Battle of Okinawa,” she said. “It impacts families for generations. It’s very important we have this day. I continue to serve by running for office. I want to make sure his sacrifice is not forgotten.”

While Rolling Meadows paid homage to fallen service members, the Chicago Cubs baseball team held a recognition during their Saturday evening game, later that night, to honor military service through local serving service members. A cheering crowd of more than 36 thousand Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball fans honored Brig. Gen. Richard Corner, Commanding General, 85th USARSC, during the second inning of their game with the Cincinnati Reds.

“It was an awesome experience,” said Corner. “The crowd and the gratitude people have.”

Cubs’ fans enjoyed watching him too.

“I think it’s fabulous. Our nephew is in the Army at Fort Bragg, North Carolina,” said Michelle Dixon of West Dundee and a Cubs spectator. “To see the general (Corner) honored is great. To see that he is having a successful career and serving his country.”

On Monday, area residents watched the 104th Annual Memorial Day Parade and Ceremony in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

Corner and retired Sgt. Maj. Dennis Koski participated in the parade waving to the crowd as they passed by in an Army style jeep. Following the parade, Corner delivered the keynote speech for the ceremony.

“We can never replace our fallen heroes. We can never repay them. But we can always remember. Words cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage,” Corner said. “We only hope that every day we can prove worthy not only of their sacrifice and service, but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones that they left behind.”

The local mayor added a new discovery on a fallen veteran from the community.

“Arlington Heights is a very special place especially on Memorial Day,” said Mayor Tom Hayes, mayor of Arlington Heights, Illinois. “Our 59th hero is Private John Sieburg.”

It was only recently discovered Sieburg was one of Arlington Heights fallen heroes dating back to the Civil War.

Private Sieburg served with the 8th Illinois Cavalry Regiment as a dispatch rider carrying critical messages between military commanders.

He was shot through his hip, knocked from his horse and died October 12, 1863.

Nadine Lussman traveled from her home in Switzerland to pay tribute to her great granduncle.

“It’s very moving for us that John Sieburg now has a place in Memorial Park in Arlington Heights, his ancestral home,” she told the Daily Herald newspaper. “He’s come home in a way.”

Katie Stack, the widow of Marine Lance Cpl. James Stack who served with 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, reflected on the memory of her husband. He was killed by a sniper in Sangin, Afghanistan back in 2010.

“I want my husband to be remembered as this goofy, loving, charismatic man who loved his daughter and me beyond anything in this world,"" said Stack. ""Every single moment he came home he was so excited to see her and sit next to us from all the time he was away. He loved his job. We came first, but his job came second. I want him to be remembered as a hero who fought for this country.”"

Missions are not always executed with full capabilities. As a result, commanders will often accept prudent risk where necessary to ensure the mission is completed. When gaps need to be filled, commanders may choose to exercise talent management from within their ranks. That happened to be the case with the generator subject matter expert, Spc. Alexander Darrow.

Darrow, a deployed Reserve Soldier and the only tactical power generation specialist assigned to 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command, works on a power generation system in Jordan with purpose and passion.

As a tactical power generation specialist, Darrow has supplied the power needed to run virtually every aspect of activity on the air base. In addition, Darrow’s job supports the unit by providing power for equipment that is required to accomplish the mission. The power supply provides the air base with electricity, heat, and air-conditioning, allowing the alternate command post to communicate with the operational command post.

Darrow has worked on power generation supplies for almost three years in the Army. However, he began working on wheel bearings with his grandfather around the age of 8, leading to his knack for fixing things. His prior maintenance experience and advanced individual training from the Army make him a true subject matter expert.

Since arriving in Jordan, Darrow has performed maintenance and repairs on transmissions, small engines, small all-terrain utility vehicles, skid-steer loaders, power-generation equipment, and associated equipment in mobile and stationary power plants.

“I’ve been working on prime equipment since I’ve been out here,” said Darrow, explaining how the tasks are outside his military occupational specialty. “But in actuality, a generator is a generator. So I’m just really happy to be out here supporting the mission. I feel like I’m making a difference.”

143d ESC Headquarters & Headquarters Company Commander Capt. Marlena Janes said, “Sending a junior Soldier to a pretty remote area to run the generators without a noncommissioned officer is a risk.” However, sending Darrow on the solo mission led to successful operations on a remote air base because of the amount of equipment he could troubleshoot, order parts for, and fix as parts came in. “I would absolutely do it again.”

Commanders’ ability to accept risk and empower junior leaders such as Darrow provide real-world scenarios for Reserve Soldiers to hone skill sets in a mobilized environment. These opportunities encourage not only professional development but leadership through empowerment. As a result, leadership, training, and experience gained through military service are second-to-none."

As an Army Reserve Soldier and an Army Civilian, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Christopher Mondi embodies the limitless possibilities of the Army slogan, “Be All You Can Be,” by bringing skill sets from both worlds to a deployed environment.

Mondi serves as a food service technician, deployed with the 143d Expeditionary Sustainment Command in Jordan, and an Army Civilian logistics management specialist for a quartermaster company. His training has led to opportunities to travel, experience other cultures, and serve a greater purpose abroad.

“What brought me here was taking accountability of the property on base, visiting the first field fielding team in theater and making sure everything is going alright with them, as well as key leader engagements with the Jordanians,” Mondi said.

Previously, field feeding teams did not come into the theater. “The mission has changed, as far as the requirements,” Mondi states.

In 2015, the Combined Arms Support Command unveiled a consolidated field feeding company concept, where food service specialists are consolidated into a single company within sustainment brigades.

In doing so, units can request a field feeding capability to support operational requirements, much like they do with other sustainment requests and other combat service support functions, if required.

The 564th Quartermaster Company is the first field feeding team to report to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. “They are their own team. They don’t have a first sergeant and a commander. They are all they have, and they fall in under a sustainment brigade for support,” said Mondi.

“It’s great to be here and be able to work with these young Soldiers. As [the Army] has gone through the years, we haven’t always had 92Gs that were cooking. So it’s nice to see them out in the field and doing the job that they came to join the Army for.""

The U.S. Army is committed to building high-performing and cohesive teams in an inclusive environment to accomplish its mission. Soldiers like Mondi continue to demonstrate that the Army builds leaders and provides them the opportunities to be influential advisors to peers and leaders around the world."

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait – Charlie Company 2nd Battalion (Combined Arms), 116th Calvary Regiment (C Co. 2-116th CAB) emerges victorious in the grueling U.S. Army Central Best Squad Competition held in Camp Buehring and Camp Arifjan from May 7-11, 2023.

Fourteen U.S. Army Central (ARCENT) squads went head-to-head in the intense competition. Each squad, composed of five soldiers, faced a series of difficult warrior tasks and battle drills that evaluated their technical and tactical proficiency, testing both physical and mental abilities.

For 5-days, the squads endured a multitude of mental and physical challenges, including the six-event Army Combat Fitness Test, an obstacle course, weapon ranges, stress shoot exercises, Expert Soldier Badge tasks, day and night land navigation, squad missions, a nearly nine-mile foot march, “intangible” scenario lanes and a culminating squad board.

“This competition produces strong sergeants that make strong Soldiers and strong Soldiers make strong squads,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Jacinto Garza, the Senior Enlisted Leader for ARCENT. “And strong squads are responsible for winning our nation’s wars.”

While teams got eliminated throughout the competition, only six squads remained on the fifth and final day, earning the title of the “Super Six.”

Staff Sgt. Kyle Marquez, squad leader for Squad 1 and an infantryman with 1st battalion, 160th Infantry Regiment's Crisis Response Task Force, said the squad’s pre-competition ruck marches and their dedication to maintaining physical fitness helped them compete.

In addition to the “Super Six” squads, the other teams showcased resilience and determination as they navigated the rigorous tests despite falling short of securing a place among the finalists.

Sgt. Somaney Keo, squad leader for Squad 9 and a signal support noncommissioned officer with the 90th Human Resources Company, 369th Sustainment Brigade, said the competition helped him learn more about leadership and what it takes to lead a squad.

“Being precise and calm is critical to being a squad leader,” Keo said.

The five-day competition placed the squads in realistic and challenging scenarios that required them to operate as organized teams.

The victorious Squad 3 will move on to represent ARCENT in the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) Best Squad Competition in August 2023.

Staff Sgt. Joshua D. Hutchings, squad leader for the winning squad and infantryman, said, ""At C Co. 2-116th CAB, we spend a lot of time training hard, and we excel because of it—this competition is an opportunity for us to show that our unit is a unit that trains hard.”

Garza expressed confidence in the squad’s abilities, recalling that the previous year’s ARCENT-winning squad secured second place at the FORSCOM competition.

“I believe this year at the FORSCOM competition, our winning ARCENT squad will take first place,” Garza said."

FORT POLK, La. — The United States and Colombian armies are continually looking for ways to further strengthen the already rich partnership they share. The latest example of this comes as an infantry company from the Colombian Army was embedded with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, alongside U.S. Soldiers from the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade, during a recent Joint Readiness Training Center rotation at Fort Polk, Louisiana.

“The importance of this JRTC Rotation with the Colombian Army is two-fold; it helps the Colombian Army understand a new operational environment including how to operate in large scale combat operations and it builds readiness for the U.S. Army,” said U.S. Army Maj. Joseph Macchiarella, U.S. Army South Colombia foreign area officer. “3rd Brigade, along with the 1st SFAB, were able to train on their critical task to integrate allies and partner nation forces into operations as well as identify gaps in capabilities which will need to be addressed in the near future.”

When asked about the importance of military partnerships like that between the U.S. and Colombian armies, Col. Richard Taylor, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division commander, discussed how strategic friendships and partnerships are the bedrock of any large organization.

“We know that the U.S. Army does not operate alone; every opportunity to serve alongside our partner forces is a chance to strengthen bonds and establish trust,” he said. “Both traits are crucial for interoperability and ultimately allows us to jump, fight and win on the hardest day of ground combat.”

Taylor also commended the professionalism demonstrated throughout the rotation saying, “The soldiers and leaders of the Columbian army are disciplined, lethal and highly competent. Our paratroopers gained knowledge from serving with them throughout the rotation.”

Though there are several challenges presented anytime two nations’ armies operate alongside one another. Consistent, realistic training builds an understanding that can ease those concerns should this partnership be put to the test in a real-world operation.

“There are still many challenges to achieve interoperability, but combat training center rotations are the perfect scenario to identify shortfalls and work to find an immediate solution,” said Macchiarella at the conclusion of the rotation. “There were many lessons learned by all participants, and now the challenge remains on how to improve before the next big event.”

The military partnership between the U.S. and Colombia has been longstanding and in recent years the two nations began working together toward a common, more optimistic goal.

“Since 2021 the U.S. and Colombia have had a process of preparation and training a unit from the army with the goal of working up to a battalion level in order to improve and achieve true interoperability,” explained Colombian Maj. Gen. Alvaro Vicente Perez, deputy commander of the Colombian Army. “We started in 2021 working together at the platoon level and during this JRTC rotation we trained together at the company level.”

Training at the company level as opposed to the individual squad or platoon level provided a greater understanding of each other’s capabilities and tactics during a large-scale combat operations type of environment.

“The most important thing about training like this, after talking with our soldiers, is the opportunity to interact, train with, and understand the capabilities of other armies like the United States and see operations from another point of view,” continued Perez.

In addition to this U.S.-hosted JRTC training rotation, Colombia played host last fall to U.S. Soldiers from both the Illinois and Georgia Army National Guard during Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 which was a two-week training exercise at Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia. The exercise included a Women Peace and Security panel discussion during which senior leaders from both armies shared experiences and ideas on furthering the roles of women in security efforts in their respective countries."

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – On a bitterly cold, desert morning at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, U.S. Army South Soldier, Sgt. Aaron Thomas, a geospatial plans and analysis team leader in the 512th Engineer Detachment, stood nervously on the starting line of the Bataan Memorial Death March on March 19, 2023.

“I knew it was gonna be challenging, and I didn't want to fail,” Thomas said with uncertainty. “But hearing stories about how bad it was for other people, you know, I kind of let that weigh on me. The furthest I had rucked during my training was only 10 miles.”

According to The Bataan Memorial Death March website, the event is a 26.2-mile ruck march to remember the roughly 75,000 U.S. and Filipino service members who became prisoners of war (POW) in the Philippines during World War II and were forced to march approximately 65 miles through the jungle to confinement camps by their Japanese captors.

Thomas held his detachment’s guidon, but a friend suggested he put it in his 35 pound ruck sack. Instead, he chose the challenge of carrying it the distance and listened to the memory of his older brother’s voice telling him not to take the easy route.

“Whatever it is that I’m doing, it’s the memory of my older brother’s voice telling me not to quit that has always been there to get me through the tough times and tough decisions,” he admired.

Thomas, from Las Vegas, New Mexico, is no stranger to long journeys carrying either a mental or physical weight, or both. Though his family members all found various levels of success in life, through determination and resilience he was the first to earn his high school diploma.

Thomas noted that he was held back a grade twice in high school and enrolled in a dual credit program in order to graduate on time, forcing him to attend night classes at a community college just outside of town. This challenging time of his life was compounded when he broke his foot in a skateboarding accident and was forced to use crutches to get around. One night during class, a blizzard rolled in, his phone died and he was unable to call for a ride home.

“I just started walking with my toes exposed out the end of my cast,” recounted Thomas. “The snow was so bad that I couldn’t see the light poles, I fell a couple of times, I had to hop a cattle fence, and I kept thinking I needed to move faster because if I kept shoveling all this snow into my cast, I’m going to get frostbite. It was the worst three miles of my life.”

Thomas said he reminded himself why he was going to school in order to keep motivating him to keep moving forward: to set an example for his younger siblings.

“Walking back through that snow, I was thinking, like, why am I suffering,” he remarked. “But I thought that if I didn’t change something, my little brothers and my little sister were just going to live the same sad story and drop out. I wanted to break that cycle.”

Thomas pushed through the snow that night and moved on to graduate, even achieving an associate's degree and a certificate in welding. His younger siblings moved on to graduate as well, with one of his brothers getting two degrees and becoming a pastor, his other brother joining the U.S. Navy and his sister becoming a sous-chef.

Thomas thought back to that turbulent, stormy night during the cold morning of the Bataan Memorial Death March and was enkindled.

“I thought about how I had already walked through a blizzard, and that was way worse than the morning of the march,” he claimed.

Even with his previous experiences and the training for the march, Thomas said he had doubts and reflected on the few people who doubted his ability to complete the 26.2-mile course. But he looked at the other competitors and listened to the story of the Bataan POWs who marched more than double that amount with a determination to finish.

The event began and Thomas stepped off on the long trek, befriending a fellow Soldier and finding motivation in his age.

“The first several miles were uphill and I walked with a 57 year old Army Lieutenant Colonel who had served 11 years in the Marine Corps before switching to the Army,” he said. “Seeing him out there gave me a lot of inspiration, because if he can do it at his age, I can do it at 33 years old.”

He used that inspiration when fatigue set in around the halfway mark of the course.

“I definitely reached muscle failure a few times, just every muscle wanting to give up,” he revealed. “Being out there alone at times was the biggest challenge though, but I met a lot of cool people along the way. Some stranger even gave me a shot of pickle juice which helped me a lot with cramping.”

Thomas said his favorite part of the event was the views of the mountains, hills and desert, but they were starkly different from the views during his past marches as a civilian. He found more influence from other times he had to carry heavy weight on long marches with dreary city views.

After he earned his welding certificate, he found a welding job in Los Angeles, bought a car and moved out to California. But an unfortunate event led him to seek change.

“I invited my friend to come visit me out in California, and one night I lent him my car,” he remembered. “He parked it on the street during a street sweeping day and it got towed and impounded.”

Thomas said he found himself on a five mile walk everyday to and from work, but this time he carried a heavy load.

“I didn’t have a secure place to keep my tools or welder at the job site, so I put all my tools in a backpack and carried my welder,” he remarked. “It sucked, and it dawned on me that I could be getting paid to do this and have other benefits in the Army. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Thomas said he took inventory of what he was fighting for in his life: a meager wage, a tiny apartment and a job with no benefits. He knew he was cut out for something different and decided to enlist in the Army as a geospatial engineer.

Back on the Bataan Memorial Death March course, as his muscles failed him and his hands swelled, he remembered the contrast between his past and his present. He also remembered he was trying to set an example as a leader for the Soldiers he was leading back at his unit.

“They may not be my little brothers and sisters, but I treat them like they are and I lead by example,” he said with gratification. “I feel like if I can do stuff like the Bataan at 33 years old, it should be a walk in the park for some of these younger Soldiers.”

Thomas ran the last few miles, fighting to the very end. As he approached the finish line, he was surprised to see a couple faces he recognized.

“I was thinking, that old guy over there looks familiar,” he said with a grin. “ It was my dad and then I saw my mom. My dad was still hooked up to his oxygen tank, so I knew his journey to the finish line was probably a lot worse than mine. That moment made me really appreciate the people that I have in my life.”

His dad, Keith Thomas, a disabled Navy veteran whose service was cut short when he was struck by a tractor-trailer, claimed that it was a challenge to make it to the event, and it almost didn't happen because of icy roads.

“We wanted to surprise him and cheer him on, but we had some severe weather come through,” said his dad wearily. “We told him we wanted to come down there but because of the weather, things had changed. He had no idea we were going to be there, and we were in the perfect spot as he was coming around the corner to the finish.”

His dad expressed that it was an absolute joy to see his son cross the finish line.

“It was an apex moment in my life to see him and see what he had accomplished, because it was a grueling course,” his father said with warmth in his voice. “Some of the things he has done in the Army give me a whole new respect for his service and for the Army.”

The pride his parents feel for their son’s accomplishments carry over to Thomas as a feeling of self-assurance.

“I don't think there's anything that I can't do, and I haven't failed myself yet,” he said with satisfaction. “Maybe one day I'll get to that point where my body fails me, I mean, I can't say that'll never happen. It just hasn't happened yet, and I don’t expect it to happen any time soon.”

Thomas said he did a 12-mile ruck march with his Soldiers less than a week after completing the Bataan Memorial Death March in preparation for the Norwegian foot march later this month."

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — After more than five months of planning, U.S. Army South hosted their inaugural Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Symposium in downtown San Antonio, Texas on Feb. 22 and 23, 2023. Representatives from 16 Central and South American and Caribbean partner nations participated in panel discussions, question and answer sessions, senior leader discussions, and a presentation on the overall WPS framework.

“The United States Women, Peace, and Security strategy is a whole of government approach that guides our departments in implementing strategies that focus on the effects of armed conflict on women and girls,” said U.S. Army South Command Sergeant Major, Ronald Graves. “Symposiums such as this help to build and foster diverse teams of professionals and enable the opportunity for women to serve in leadership positions at all echelons.”

With each of the countries in attendance at varying levels of gender equality in their militaries, this forum served as a space to exchange ideas and best practices that have worked for each respective nation. During the discussions leaders vocalized the small wins that have gradually contributed to impactful changes.

“While this is the inaugural symposium, we are looking for more forums like this where military personnel from the region can get together and highlight WPS initiatives and the critical roles women in our militaries are playing,” said Cmdr. Judy-Ann Neil, Acting Inspector General of the Jamaica Defense Force. “Events like this give you an opportunity to hear from women in other militaries in the region and learn that despite the geographical and language barriers our challenges as being women in the military are really the same.”

One of the female leader’s attendees had the opportunity to hear from was retired Lt. Gen. Nadja West, 44th U.S. Army Surgeon General, who served on the panel centered on what it takes to build cohesive teams. During West’s panel she was asked how other countries can improve teamwork and ensure their voices are heard within their own militaries.

“The advice I gave was that actions speak louder than words, and if you’re seen to be able to do your job just as well as the Soldier next you, no matter what their gender is or whatever type of identifier that they have, that’s one way of breaking down those barriers and concerns about being a valuable member of the team,” West said.

West also took time to listen and appreciate what other women in the room had faced in their careers and how they overcame their own unique obstacles as women in leadership.

“It was really great to see women from other countries leading and serving in their militaries and coming together to try to determine how they can bring some of the lessons back to improve teamwork within their own militaries and their own countries,” she explained.

One thing that was evident throughout all the discussions was the common theme that the Department of Defense’s WPS Framework and Implementation Plan cannot be headed solely by women. Instead, it takes partnering with men in the profession of arms who are willing to lean forward, be open minded, and help implement positive changes that lead to stronger and more diverse organizations.

“I had the opportunity to hear the experiences of women who are pioneers in their countries' military services sharing experiences on the development of leaders,” said Brazilian Army Lt. Col. David Alencar who serves on the Brazilian Army Commander’s Personal Staff. “The experiences that were discussed make us reflect on the subject and drive us to want to implement these policies in our countries.”

Overall, everyone in attendance agreed that opportunities to discuss and further WPS strategies should happen more frequently.

“The decision the U.S. Army and participating armies have taken to have an event like this is great because these spaces give us the opportunity to continue enriching the subject of how to integrate women into security and defense,” said Ecuadorian Cpt. Elizabeth Munoz, Chief of Security and Accident Prevention for Army Signal. “I hope we can continue having these spaces so we can continue to have more and more women and men participate.”"

In 2000, the United Nations developed the Women’s Peace and Security (WPS) initiative fully recognizing the need for women to be included as a critical factor in achieving sustainable international peace and security. In full support of WPS, the Colombian army hosted a WPS panel discussion alongside U.S. Soldiers on Nov. 16, 2022 at the conclusion of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 at Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia.

Colombian army Sgt. Maj. Astrid Rubio Acosta, senior enlisted panel member and first female to hold the rank of sergeant major to serve in the Colombian army, used her opening remarks to provide words of encouragement to those in attendance speaking to the importance of setting goals and not allowing gender to get in the way of achieving those goals.

“Today, you must be fully convinced that you can do whatever it is you set out to do in your life,” she said. “It’s up to you to pave your own way and take your goals and find ways to achieve these goals.”

U.S. Army Maj. Kyle Ullmark, executive officer for the Illinois National Guard’s 2nd Battalion, 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, followed this by speaking to the importance leaders have in empowering their junior leaders and raising their confidence level to help them succeed both during their time in service as well as when they decide to move on to a new career outside of the military.

Colombian Women’s Day, which was celebrated just two days prior to the panel, is an annual celebration of women’s achievements in the country and recognizing women who serve as inspirations to the public. Commander of the Colombian National Army, Maj. Gen. Luis Mauricio Ospina Gutiérrez took a moment during his panel remarks to acknowledge one of his inspirations to continue serving.

“Sergeant Major Rubio, who is sitting on this panel with me, is one of the main examples that has been able to break the taboo of women serving in leadership roles as she is the first female to serve as a sergeant major in our army,” said Ospina. “It is because of her setting the example that new students at the NCO academy know now more than ever that anything is possible in their career.”

Leaders such Rubio and Lieutenant Katherine Romero, the Colombian army’s first female Huey II pilot who served as an aviation leader throughout Exercise Southern Vanguard 23, are certain to inspire soldiers for generations to come which many women did not have in the past.

U.S. Army Lt. Col. Michelle Martinez, Commander of U.S. Army South’s Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, recalled how her journey in the Army started with her having a small selection of female leaders to look up to.

“When I joined the Army 25 years ago, I did not think I would make to the position that I am,” she said. “Out of ten lieutenant colonels approximately four are selected for battalion command and of those four maybe one is a female but now the times have changed and the doors are open.”

Martinez continued by acknowledging how U.S. Southern Command’s Commanding General, Gen. Laura Richardson, is an inspiration and is paving the way for females serving in the Army today, including herself, to know that they can truly achieve anything they set their heart and mind to.

With more than 100 countries throughout the world including many who are not U.N. member nations currently having an implemented National Action Plan the importance of WPS on a global level cannot be overlooked and this panel is a small event that had a big impact on everyone in attendance."

With this iteration’s focus on modernization and leader development, 30 students and observers from both the Colombian and Mexican armies attended briefings from senior enlisted advisors from U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Defense Intelligence Agency, Women’s Peace and Security, Inter-American Defense College, Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation and other military organizations.

During the program, the class visited the Pentagon, the National Defense University, Special Operations Command South, Joint Interagency Task Force South, U.S. Southern Command and several other military facilities.

The impression this iteration of PISAJ has left on attendees will further progress their personal military development as well as the modernization of their militaries overall, said Colombian Army Sgt. Maj. Eli Mosquera Cruz.

“This experience with the U.S. Army has helped me better understand the role a sergeant major plays in developing individual soldiers and the army as an institution,” said Mosquera. “The wisdom gained and success we have achieved here is not only for the individuals attending but also for the sergeants major who will serve after us.”

One of the four female senior NCOs attending this iteration of PISAJ is the first female Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of Joint Chief of Staff of the Colombian military forces, Command Sgt. Maj. Consuelo Díaz Álvarez. She said every day her soldiers strengthen the capabilities of the Colombian NCO corps.

“Our sergeants major are leaving here stronger with wisdom and experience that will empower them to be better people and better leaders,” said Díaz. “Every day of PISAJ, we shared doctrine, reinforced our capabilities and learned lessons that will make us better advisors to the commanders of the Colombian army, and I know they will implement what they learned here to make our army stronger.”

Sgt. Maj. of the Colombian Army Mauricio Páez Acosta said the experiences and lessons learned during PISAJ are invaluable in providing a level of critical thinking necessary to lead soldiers.

“When a sergeant major comes to this program, they carry with them a different vision of how to lead their soldiers, facilitate the commander as well as how to influence the Colombian NCO corps,” said Páez. “As an advisor to the commander, we see things from a different perspective and we shine an opportunistic light on challenges he or she may face.”

Both Páez and Graves envision the expansion of involvement and planning from partner nations with a greater focus on joint and combined operations.

“We want to amplify PISAJ and provide an opportunity for other components and our partner nations to participate in order to strengthen the program, all the NCOs who attend and their military forces,” said Páez.

The next iteration of PISAJ is in the planning process and will take place in the Spring of 2023."

Soldiers from the Illinois and Georgia National guard stood side by side with their Colombian Army counterparts one last time on the parade field of Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia during the closing ceremony of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23) on Nov. 16, 2022.

“I thank you for your professionalism, full dedication, and focused engagement throughout the week,” said U.S. Army South Commanding General, Maj. Gen. William Thigpen, as he spoke to the formation of more than 400 U.S. and Colombian Soldiers. “Our U.S. Soldiers participating from Georgia and Illinois National Guard were able to coordinate logistics, experience the rigors of Colombian Army’s training, and hone their squad and platoon level skills in Colombia’s challenging jungle terrain.”

Thigpen also took time to acknowledge Colombian Army’s Counternarcotics and Transnational Threats Command who trained alongside the U.S. Soldiers stating, “Your entire organization’s professionalism, tactical prowess, and enthusiastic approach to planning and executing this exercise was commendable.” He continued by saying, “I know your Army relies on your organization to conduct real-world missions every day, in a high-threat environment and the U.S. Army truly appreciates the opportunity to train with some of the finest Soldiers in this western hemisphere.”

Throughout the two-week exercise, U.S. and Colombian Army Soldiers used their previous training and experiences to collaborate and execute various situational training lanes including movement to contact, patrolling in dense jungle terrain, reacting to direct and indirect fire and medical treatment and evacuation techniques.

During the final day of training, Soldiers from both Armies put all they had learned to the test as the conducted a final combined assault operation which included an air insertion and navigating at night through the jungle during a torrential downpour.

Commander of the Colombian National Army, Maj. Gen. Luis Mauricio Ospina Gutiérrez spoke about the unique experience many of the Soldiers on the field had throughout the past two weeks and regarded the importance of the partnership that was further strengthened during ExSV23.

“I thank God allowing us to share this experience that enriches both of our nations capabilities,” he said. “The defense integration alliance with the United States of America is acknowledged as one of the most successful in the region and this training has helped to increase the level of training and interoperability of our Armies.”

The ever-increasing ability for the U.S. and Colombian Armies to work together through challenges was established during the Korean war and has garnered an increased level of interest in recent years.

“We have been developing this exercise annually alternating the headquarters between both countries,” he said. “It began in 2019 with the presence of a platoon from the South Carolina National Guard who trained alongside a platoon from the counter narcotics and trafficking brigade at this same facility and continued in 2021 when the counter narcotics and trafficking brigade conducted an exercise with the South Carolina National Guard at Fort Polk, Louisiana.”

The shared experience and insights that ExSV23 has provided for both Armies proves that this exercise was a success meeting all the training objectives laid out throughout the numerous planning conferences that led up to the past two weeks of execution.

Both Thigpen and Ospina concluded their remarks highlighting their eagerness to continue working together in the future at all levels and further building upon the already strong partnership the two Armies have established."

CAMP SMITH TRAINING SITE, N.Y. – Forty-six 101st Expeditionary Signal Battalion Soldiers spent Oct. 24 to Nov. 7 ensuring their communications gear will keep Army command posts talking to each other when they deploy to the Middle East in 2023.

The Yonkers-based New York Army National Guard signal battalion will mobilize 344 Soldiers to deploy to Kuwait to support the Army’s Task Force Spartan Shield in August.

Before mobilizing, they had to ensure that the satellite communications equipment and other components of the battalion’s Warrior Information Network-Tactical system were working properly, according to Lt. Col. Paul Mulligan, battalion commander.

Mulligan said the 46 Soldiers who volunteered for the additional annual training spent two weeks identifying component and equipment shortages, updating software systems, ordering parts, and submitting work orders for items they could not fix.

“This event was crucial in identifying equipment issues so we can request resources to fix them,” Mulligan said.

The Soldiers worked on 126 pieces of equipment, including the communications systems, vehicles and generators.

The Warrior Information Network-Tactical system, or WIN-T, is the Army communication system of transmitters, receivers, routers, switches, modems and cables that allows Army units to securely transmit voice, data, text, video and graphic data.

Mulligan said the 101st can deploy 30 teams and equipment to link command posts from the battalion up to the theater level.

Along with making sure the equipment is working, the training also gave Soldiers a chance to learn more about the equipment, said 1st Lt. Manuel Baltazar from the battalion operations staff.

“This training is crucial to increasing our Soldiers’ readiness as operators for their equipment,” said Baltazar, a former enlisted Soldier who is deploying as the battalion plans officer. “They’re doing cross-training on equipment they have never operated before, so it’s helping really increase the unit’s knowledge overall.”

Army Spc. Domingo Perez, a New York City police officer in civilian life, said he appreciated the chance to learn more about the battalion’s systems while troubleshooting them.

Perez, a multichannel transmission systems operator and maintainer, said he was learning a lot about the Phoenix satellite terminals used to communicate over vast areas by digging into the technical manual, or TM.

“The TM is your best friend,” Perez said. “Go into it and learn the Phoenix, learn how to troubleshoot it. It is very productive.”

Pfc. Janaiya Alexander, a wheeled vehicle mechanic in the battalion’s Alpha Company, appreciated the opportunity to work on vehicles for an extended period.

“It’s great to have more than a weekend to work on the trucks and Humvees,“ Alexander said.

Mulligan said the next step for his Soldiers would be installing the parts that were ordered.

That gear will be used for the battalion’s pre-mobilization training and then packaged and shipped to Kuwait.

The Georgia Army National Guard’s Fort Benning-based Team 6120, Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 54th Security Forces Brigade, 648th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade deployed Oct. 30 to Nov. 18, 2022, to Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia to support and participate in Exercise Southern Vanguard 23.

Southern Vanguard 23 is an annual exercise conducted by U.S. Army South within the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility which trains units at the operational and tactical levels to increase coordination between the U.S. and Western Hemisphere forces, in this instance, Colombia.

A Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB) is a specialized United States Army unit formed to conduct security force assistance (SFA) missions: to conduct advise, support, liaise, assess operations at echelon to enable operations with allied and partner nations. SFABs are intended to reduce the burden of such operations on U.S. Special Forces organizations after extensive SFA missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, allowing them to focus on training and operating with allied and partner national elite units.

“Team 6120’s focus for Southern Vanguard is to increase Colombian Army’s capability and capacity to conduct mission command at the Battalion operational and tactical level,” said Maj. Chris Dumais, commander and team leader, Team 6120. “Our Advisor’s developed a Combined Staff training plan focusing on the NATO Seven-Step operational planning process and direct support during a Combined Task-Force exercise.”

As a result of the Advisor’s security force assistance effort to build the institutional knowledge for the Colombian Army to support future multinational, regional and combined/joint interoperability at the tactical level between Colombian allies and partner nations. Overall, in accordance with the Integrated Country Strategy of the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, the goal of Team 6120 is that U.S. forces are the partner of choice in future training and potential operations for the Colombian Army.

SFAB Team 6120 is a 12-Soldier team comprised of experts in maneuver, fires, intelligence, explosive hazards, and support who are embedded with the Colombian Army to increase their ability to work with U.S., NATO, and partner nations.

The primary focus of the SFAB’s during the exercise is to assist the Colombian’s ability to perform command and control duties of their force conducting operations throughout the exercise.

“Our combined level of experience working in forward environments and our level of training provide the Colombians with subject matter experts which improve their ability to focus their forces,” said Sgt. 1st Class Hector Umaña, operations noncommissioned officer, Team 6120.”

Additionally, the SFAB are validating the Colombian soldier’s communication plan at the tactical-level and utilizing new command and control devices such as the CivTak (Civilian Tactical Awareness Kit) to improve situational awareness of the platoon and squad leaders. The ability to understand and anticipate the operational picture assists leaders in understanding the operational picture and can exercise disciplined initiative in the absence of orders from higher.

“The ability to utilize the CivTak and validate their communication procedures ensure commanders at all levels have the proper information,” said Sgt. 1st Class Thomas Davant, fires support advisor, Team 6120. “It ensures they have a common operating picture.”

The partnership between the U.S. and Colombian Army dates back almost 70 years ago to the Korean War when the Colombian Battalion, (an infantry battalion of the Colombian Army that served under United Nations Command during the Korean War from 1951 to 1954) the first Colombian military unit to serve in Asia, was attached to the U.S. 7th Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Divisions under 8th Army. There we fought and sacrificed to defend the freedom of our ally. The Colombian Battalion suffered 163 killed in action, 448 wounded, 60 missing, and 30 captured over the course of the conflict.

One of the most important missions of Team 6120 is ensuring partnerships at the tactical level and improving relationships between the U.S. military and Colombian forces. Team 6120 has inserted members at the team-level of the Colombian Army to accomplish this.

“Colombian Soldiers are definitely interested in our operational experiences over the last twenty years, and we are learning how they operate in decentralized environments at the tactical level,” said Staff Sgt. Jose Hernandez, explosive hazards advisor, Team 6120. “They are some of the most professional and dedicated partner forces I’ve had the pleasure to work with.”"

Bilateral exercises are an important part of building relationships between nations and enhancing the abilities of partner nation armies to work together through various missions and problem sets. Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23), currently taking place at Tolemaida Military Base in Colombia, is U.S. Army South’s premier training exercise designed to accomplish these goals.

“The interoperability, opportunities and experiences for me and my guys can’t be understated,” said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Nate Myers, a squad leader assigned to 2nd Battalion, 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Illinois Army National Guard said when asked about the exercise. “An example of what we have learned is that here in the jungle terrain we have learned a lot from the Colombians on how to conduct operations from a different tactical formation than we normally do.”

Reciprocally, the Colombian Soldiers are taking full advantage of this learning opportunity ensuring they learn everything they can from their U.S. Army counterparts.

“The importance for us in this exercise is to have the opportunity to exchange knowledge with our partners in the U.S. Army,” said Colombian Army 1st Lt. Simon Mosquera who is working as an Observer, Controller and Trainer throughout ExSV23. “It also allows us to improve in our capabilities in order to save lives and defend our country.

The ability to share best practices for military operations between armies is invaluable for everyone involved but it is not the only thing taking place of value. The friendships and memories being made at the lowest levels are something that will be remembered far into the future.

Colombian Army Staff Sgt. Octavio Munoz, a platoon sergeant assigned to the BRNCA 1 Special Anti-Drug Brigade and Staff Sgt. Myers direct counterpart, talked about the friendships being made at the barracks when the Soldiers are resting from a long day of training. He said, “we have the opportunity to share with each other about our families including our parents, wives and kids.”

Munoz also talked about the U.S. Soldiers learning the traditional Colombian game “Rana” which involves tossing metal rings or coins into the mouths of frog statues from a short distance away. “At first they were not very good but each day they are playing with us in the barracks area and continue to get better,” he said.

“So far it’s been an excellent experience and everyone has been extremely welcoming and friendly,” explained Myers. “I think I can speak for the entire platoon when I say that since getting on the ground we have had the most friendly and welcoming environment and it has greatly contributed to our experience as well as our ability to train here together.”

When the Soldiers assigned to the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team eventually depart back to their home state of Illinois they will take with them knowledge, experiences and friendships that will last a lifetime with many of the Soldiers exchanging email address and have plans to stay in touch through social media in the future."

More than 300 U.S. and Colombian soldiers stood tall in formation on the parade field of Tolemaida Military Base, Colombia, during the opening ceremony of Exercise Southern Vanguard 23 (ExSV23). Exercise Southern Vanguard is U.S. Army South's premier annual training exercise taking place at the operational and tactical levels intended to increase interoperability between the United States and Western Hemisphere forces.

“Your role here in this exercise is the single-most important phase of building partnerships between nations.” said Brig. Gen. Rodney Boyd, Assistant Adjutant General for the Illinois Army National Guard, during his opening remarks at the ceremony. “Your work is what makes our militaries interoperable.”

He went on to explain some of what the Soldiers assigned to the 130th Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Illinois Army National Guard and the 1st Battalion, 54th Security Force Assistance Brigade, Georgia Army National Guard can expect to experience working alongside their Colombian Army partners.

“Over the next week, the junior NCOs and company-grade officers will take the baton and develop the relationship between our two countries at the tactical level,” he said. “You will build deep personal connections as you conduct combined, company-level tactical operations.”

Brig. Gen. Fredy Coy, Colombian Army Chief of Staff of Operations, emphasized the relationship between the armies of the United States and Colombia and the history of their interoperability dating back more than 50 years ago.

“This relationship started a long time ago when we responded in Korea and conducted operations together,” he said during his remarks. “In Korea, this was the first time we were interoperable with our partner nations.”

While combined training exercises such as ExSV23 build upon the lethality, effectiveness and interoperability of all armies involved, the lasting friendships are equally important.

Boyd recalled his experience as a battalion commander training alongside the Ghanaian Army explaining that among his fondest memories are the friendships he made working alongside his Ghanian partners.

“To this day, I am in contact with a member of the Ghanian Army that I met during that exercise,” said Boyd. “Hopefully, you all will build similar memories over the course of the next week.”

Coy concluded his remarks by thanking the planners from both countries for developing and planning the exercise and by professing his hope that ExSV23 will be a great exercise for everyone involved.

As the ceremony ended, Soldiers from both Armies, instead of going their separate ways, lingered to discuss the training that lies ahead of them throughout the duration of the exercise."

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — As she sat in her office reminiscing about her life journey to becoming a U.S. Army Soldier, Master Sgt. Kathryan Torres, U.S. Army South lead sexual assault response coordinator, shed a tear thinking about the recent passing of her father.

“My dad was the most inspirational person for me even though we didn’t always see eye to eye,” Torres said emotionally. “He came to California from Puerto Rico as a young man, barely able to speak English, to pursue his dreams.”

Her father’s adventuristic nature rubbed off on Torres who is the middle child of three sisters.

From Fajardo, Puerto Rico, Torres was interested in sports and being outdoors while her sisters were more concerned with making friends and going out.

“I just wanted to be outside, climbing trees, playing sports and getting dirty,” she said with a childish grin.

Between her father’s wanderlust and her mother’s stability, Torres had great yet opposite role models even though her parents divorced at a young age.

Her mother raised her and her sisters as a single parent and worked nights at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station while her daughters slept and as her mother slept during the day, Torres stepped in the caretaker role for her younger sister.

“My older sister went to live with our grandmother, so my younger sister sees me a lot like her second mother,” Torres said proudly. “I did a lot of the housework, yard work and by age seven I could cook a full course meal.”

Her parents put a huge focus on education in and out of the home. Her mother pushed for her daughters to speak proper English at home and her father pushed them to achieve a university education.

Torres graduated high school at 17 years old and got a scholarship for a university in Puerto Rico, but her father encouraged her to attend Mount Saint Mary’s University in California where he worked.

“Making the choice to leave behind everything and everyone that I knew and loved was very difficult, and I was very overwhelmed by the college culture,” said Torres. “It definitely was not what I expected, so I was there for about a semester before going back to Puerto Rico.”

When she returned to Fajardo, she found herself alone. Her sisters had moved, her mother had joined the Navy Reserves and relocated to Florida, and she had no other blood relatives in her hometown.

She began practicing cosmetology at a local barber shop and working as a manager of a grocery store, but after a few years she was unsatisfied with where her journey had taken her.

“Being back home, I wasn’t hanging around a good crowd,” she said. “People I knew and grew up with were getting locked up for drugs or crime or even getting killed. It was one of those moments where I looked around and said, ‘I have so much more to offer, so what am I doing here?’”

Torres said she always wanted to be an agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Drug Enforcement Agency or serve in the military. The fastest way for her to escape the bad situation she was in was to join the Army.

She enlisted as an Ammunition Specialist in September 2005, and shipped off to Basic Combat Training, or BCT, as soon as she could.

“After I graduated from BCT and Advanced Individual Training, my first duty station was Fort Carson, Colorado, and I got there in February,” Torres said anxiously. “I had never experienced winter, so I left Puerto Rico in a tank top, shorts and flip flops. Right before we landed, the pilot said it was nine degrees in Colorado Springs.”

Torres said she was blessed with patient leadership that gave her time to acclimate to the new climate and although it took her some time to get used to the very different weather from Puerto Rico, Torres quickly adapted to the military lifestyle.

Torres deployed to Iraq October of 2006 and then again June 2010, both in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Those deployments taught her a lot about the people she surrounded herself with.

“What I learned the most was that the people you need behind you in battle and in life are always going to be there whether it’s family or battle buddies,” she said. “You have to learn how to lean on them.”

Torres said her first deployment was very different from her second due to the arrival of her son.

“My first deployment I was on a forward operating base in southeast Baghdad, and my parents kept telling me, ‘Please don't go over there and be a hero,’ because they knew that is who I am as a person,” she said. “The second, I was on a personal security detachment so I was on the road a lot, but my son wasn't even two years old. So being away from him was really hard.”

Her son’s father was also deployed in Iraq at the time and contracted a severe case of meningitis. Due to security concerns in the region, she was not able to receive updates on his status.

“It was a lot to deal with on top of the stress of completing the mission,” Torres expressed. “I did a lot of meditating during that deployment, because I was the rear vehicle commander and when we went out the gates, my team needed me to be focused. I learned I could handle a lot more stress than I could have ever imagined and still perform under the pressure of combat.”

After her deployments, Torres went through the U.S. Army Drill Sergeant Academy in Fort Jackson, South Carolina to help transform civilian volunteers to become Combat Engineers.

During her time at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, she noticed something wasn’t right with her daughter.

“I was supposed to get stationed in Hawaii, but my daughter, who was about one year old, began regressing in her development,” she said. “I thought she might be autistic, and there was an opening at Army South on Joint Base San Antonio - Fort Sam Houston which is the main post for medical across all branches. So, I took the position, arrived here, and ultimately she was diagnosed with autism.”

Fortunately, she was able to get all the medical treatment her daughter needed, but Torres needed the support of her family once again as her mission required her to travel often. Her mother assisted with childcare as she traveled all over Central and South America and the Caribbean.

Torres was able to receive a compassionate assignment into her current position to allow for continued medical treatment for her daughter.

Through all of her assignments, deployments and missions, Torres attributes her triumphs and successes to the support of her family, friends and battle buddies. Specifically, her mother, Tammy, and her two sisters, Jennifer and Tamara, who stepped up to care for her children throughout the years and always pushed her to be the leader she was meant to be.

“I've always had an amazing support system back home from my family and friends and in the military as well,” Torres said with a smile. “When you have that, it makes all this pretty easy. I mean 17 years in the Army has gone by pretty quick, and the rest of my story is still being written.”"

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO - FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – The smell of food, sounds of music and traditional dancing were on display as the Soldiers and civilians assigned to United States Army South (ARSOUTH) officially kicked off National Hispanic Heritage Month on the morning of Sept. 16, 2022 with a celebration of culture in front of the headquarters building.

National Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated annually from Sept. 15 – Oct. 15 since it was expanded from its original week-long celebration by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. The mid-month start and end dates are significant to Hispanic heritage with five countries celebrating their independence on Sept. 15 along with numerous others throughout the date range.

“It’s important to celebrate all history and culture and our Army would not be what it is today with the contributions and successes of Hispanic Americans,” explained Sgt. 1st Class James Davis, U.S. Army South’s Equal Opportunity Advisor and National Hispanic Heritage Month celebration event coordinator. “Their contributions throughout history are found throughout the Army including right here at Army South, which can be seen in our Hall of Honor where we inducted retired Lieutenant General Marc Cisneros earlier this year.”

During his service, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Cisneros served as the commanding general of ARSOUTH and Joint Task Force Panama during Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 and 1990 which led to the successful capture of Gen. Manuel Noriega.

The theme of this year’s celebration is Unidos – Inclusivity for a Stronger Nation. According to the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) website, Unidos can be translated to mean “united,” “connected” or “close.”

“We are a multicultural Army made up of Soldiers from all backgrounds and walks of life, so I believe Unidos is a great word to sum up the celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month,” said Davis. “Throughout our Army and throughout Army South this concept is an important aspect of who we are, and it truly makes us a stronger more cohesive unit.”

Dr. Hector Martinez, guest speaker for the event said, “Hispanic cultures around the world are unique in their own ways but share a common core of similarities; a certain inner-pride in what it means to be Hispanic.”

He continued his remarks by recognizing two Hispanic American leaders, Medal of Honor recipient Master Sgt. Leroy Petry and community activist Lizzie Vasquez, and by challenging those in attendance to follow their lead and make a difference in their community whether they are Hispanic American or not.

With a month dedicated to celebrating the achievements, histories, contributions and cultures of Americans with Hispanic ancestry, ARSOUTH will benefit greatly by having a more profound understanding of the partner nations they work with on a regular, sometimes daily, basis.

ARSOUTH’s area of responsibility encompasses 31 nations and 15 areas of special sovereignty with almost 500 million people speaking over 100 different languages. Soldiers and civilians assigned to the command regularly travel throughout the region building and strengthening relationships with many of these countries promoting unity and cooperation throughout the Western Hemisphere.

“It’s good for non-Latin American U.S. citizens to know what their neighbors are like, what their culture and backgrounds are and to understand that the fusion of our culture brings about something beautiful,” explained Mexican American Maj. Teddy Villasenorloya, one of ARSOUTH’s Foreign Area Officers. “Whether it’s professional engagements or military engagements, we can go out there and make friends with everybody since we know each other’s backgrounds.”

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Representatives from U.S. Army South traveled to Honduras to lead a Central American Working Group meeting during a three-day event held from September 7-9, 2022.

The CENTAM Working Group includes armies from three Latin American nations: El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The event marked the third time all participating nations gathered to continue coordinating efforts for 2023 and proposing future events for 2024 through 2027.

Honduran Gen. Jose Luis Sauceda Sierra, Commander of Joint Doctrine and Military Education, welcomed all participating nations to the country and emphasized the importance of working together to increase capabilities.

“With this we become more efficient and perform better in all of the exercises, this way we would have better results allowing us to improve our capabilities to support our force and improve their professionalism,” said Sauceda Sierra.

Lt. Col Miguel A. Gonzalez, International Military Affairs Chief for Army South Security and Cooperation Division and the head of the delegation for the U.S. Army, thanked Honduras for their hospitality and highlighted the importance of the meeting.

“The purpose of the CENTAM Working Group is to strengthen the bilateral and multilateral relationship and develop capabilities of mutual interest to counter the proliferation of threat networks and respond to crises that threaten regional stability,” said Gonzalez.

After introductions, each army provided a brief overview of their operations and explained challenges they have faced during the previous year. In addition to the overviews, the working group discussed lessons learned from CENTAM Guardian 22 to help with the success of CENTAM Guardian 2023.

CENTAM Guardian is a multinational exercise designed to increase rapid response, security operations and strengthen hemispheric cooperation and collaboration, explained Marco V. Rosito, CENTAM desk officer in Security and Cooperation Division for Army South.

“We realize there are common issues affecting the region and if we address them together we would be more effective than addressing them as individual countries,” said Rosito.

The three-day working group closed with proposals, objectives and activities for support from now until 2027, and finished with the signing of the minutes signaling the commitment for the armies to continue cooperating.

“Through this event we support and cooperate with our regional partners to improve our border security efforts,” closed Gonzalez.

The next CENTAM Working Group meeting is the gathering of principals where they will review and approve the staff work and activities coordinated for the next year."

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — Summer is here and it’s a busy time for U.S. Army personnel and families as they move to their next assignment. Despite domestic improvements regarding COVID-19, the pandemic still proves problematic in other parts of the world and continues to affect the shipping industry.

In response, the U.S. Transportation Command, U.S. Army and the Army Sustainment Command are working hard to continuously improve the permanent change of station process for its customers and family members.

“The pandemic has impacted all sectors of the global market. Ports, port agents, customs, trucking, rail and shipping are all part of those sectors that have been impacted by the pandemic, and they continue to see shortfalls in labor, drivers, material, fuel, increased operating costs as well as other operational resources,” said Col. Courtney Abraham.

Abraham serves as the director of the Army Personal Property Lead Element — or APPLE — and commander of ASC’s Joint Personal Property Shipping Offices-Mid Atlantic, or JPPSO-MA.

Located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, APPLE is the Army’s lead integrating organization in the Defense Personal Property Program and the collective Joint Enterprise. Its mission is to plan, manage and provide technical oversight to Army Personal Property Shipping and Processing Offices globally.

APPLE maintains operational control of both JPPSOs located at Fort Belvoir and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. JPPSO-MA is one of six Army-led shipping offices. This organization executes personal property movement services to authorized personnel within a specified area of responsibility. The JPPSO-MA supports shipments within portions of 12 states, including the Washington, D.C. area.

This PCS season brings many improvements compared to previous years, said Abraham. USTRANSCOM has adjusted domestic and international transit times to provide better predictability and expectation management for Soldiers and families for delivery of their household goods, he said.

“All overseas PCS locations could be impacted, no one greater than another,” Abraham said. “The Personal Property enterprise continues to monitor changes in the global supply chain closely and continually communicates with our industry partners in order to implement the best business practices to support our Soldiers and families.”

In late 2020, ASC began equipping units with tablets specifically to aid quality assurance inspectors in the field. “Quality assurance inspectors can perform operations and reporting while on the road, utilizing their WiFi-enabled tablets, mobile devices or hotspots,” Abraham explained.

Tablets allow inspectors to reach more customers in the duty day, as well as to immediately provide customers with resources, handouts and report findings into the USTRANSCOM system of record without having to return to a traditional office.

Additionally, the Army has a 75% onsite physical inspection standard by quality assurance personnel, surpassing the Defense Transportation Regulation standard of 50%. The Army currently has an 87% physical inspection rate, meaning an inspector has provided in-person representation at time of pack, pickup or delivery.

Abraham detailed the following changes to the overall PCS process that have been implemented since May 2021:

Improving inventories : “We are working with the moving companies to shift from paper copies of inventories and use electronic inventories to the greatest extent possible. This will provide an improved record of the household goods pack-out and the condition they were in when packed. This effort is to accelerate the inventory and accountability process of household goods, eliminate paper copy exchanges, and enable digital transmission and storage of the inventory records offering better services to members and families when moving. Electronic inventories will be mandatory in 2023.”

Also known as ‘spread dates,’ this refers to the seven-day window during which your moving company is required to pick up your shipment. This policy is designed to give you more control over requesting a specific date range to schedule your move.”

: “The moving company will identify points of contact and email the Soldier/family with that information to facilitate better communication before, during and after the move, improving the overall PCS experience.” Simplifying claims : “Created a standardized form to simplify filing an inconvenience claim across the DOD. Additionally, military claims offices will be able to declare a catastrophic loss of a shipment regardless of the percent of inventory items lost, damaged or destroyed. In the past, the threshold was 60% of the total shipment.”

: “Moving companies are already required to place seals on containers, but we’re adding a requirement that customers be notified if any seals are broken, that seals be replaced, and that these actions and communications are noted in the record.” Better communication : “Increased service provider availability by phone – added Saturday customer support requirement during peak of the relocation period; provider must return calls on same business day and wait times cannot exceed 20 minutes. Additionally, movers are required to provide customers a 24-hour notice of delivery and make two attempts to contact the customer, with each attempt at least six hours apart, before transferring the customer’s shipment to storage-in-transit.”

Additionally, movers are required to provide customers a 24-hour notice of delivery and make two attempts to contact the customer, with each attempt at least six hours apart, before transferring the customer’s shipment to storage-in-transit.” More control and choice for customer : “More time to file a claim — was 75 days, now 180 days. Simplified convenience claims processing; improved in-transit visibility; single point of contact with moving companies; and have choice to repair or receive repair costs for damages, including full replacement cost.”

: “Reimbursement up to seven days of per diem and incidentals when a moving company fails to pick-up or deliver as agreed.” SmartVoucher process reduces travel payments to less than two days.

process reduces travel payments to less than two days. The Basic Allowance for Housing rate is in effect at all 40 on-base Intercontinental Hotel Groups Army Hotel locations in the U.S. through the end of fiscal 2022.

IHGs have agreed to only charge Soldiers at their BAH rate when they must stay in temporary lodging for extended periods of time due to housing or household good delivery challenges.

MILPER Message 22-0045 (CAC-enabled): Allows commanders the flexibility to change report dates by 30 days either before or after the initial report date, or up to 60-day deferment working with the Installation Directorate of Human Resources to get approval.

Despite all these improvements and bearing aforementioned challenges in mind, Abraham said the Soldier still has much input regarding how successful a PCS can be. He recommended Soldiers always do the following to ensure their PCS goes as smooth as possible:

Once orders are received, visit the installation transportation office immediately to receive household goods counseling and complete shipment application(s).

Communicate challenges with chain of command early, so they can assist and work with the installation transportation office to identify all possible options to support the Soldier and their family; there are several choices available to Soldiers and families to support challenges during their PCS Move.

Provide feedback via the Customer Satisfaction Survey. As of May 15, all customers are now asked to complete a brief survey via text message regarding various milestones throughout their move — entitlement counseling, pack/pickup, delivery and claims.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas – U.S. Army South hosted component planners and military representatives from seven Caribbean and South American countries for PANAMAX 2022 Planning in Crisis (PIC) training here from 6-10 June, 2022.

PANAMAX 2022 is a U.S. Southern Command-sponsored, multinational annual exercise scheduled for 1-12 August, 2022 with a purpose of strengthening partnerships, enhancing readiness and improving interoperability between U.S. Armed Forces and partner nations. This planning event served as an opportunity to build upon the combined capabilities of planning and executing complex operations during the upcoming exercise.

“One of our number one priorities is always partnership,” said Maj. Gen. William Thigpen, commanding general of U.S. Army South and PANAMAX 2022 commanding general of multinational forces. “Although we come from different countries, different services and we speak different languages we’ve got to develop a very common framework and sight picture on how we see our planning process.”

Chilean Army Logistics Division Commander and Deputy Commanding General of Multinational Forces for PANAMAX 2022, Maj. Gen. Ricardo Stangher, said the PIC is an opportunity for all of the military branches of partner nation forces to practice the planning process and procedures together as well as share common doctrine.

“During this exercise, we have been able to engage with partner nations and their staff to exchange views and establish professional bonds which will carry forward in a future scenario that will require a multinational response,” said Stangher. “Training together in this PIC exercise brings us closer to having a greater certainty regarding the efficiency of the joint planning procedures that could eventually be applied in a situation that affects regional security.”"

It was February 2022 when Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Grinston announced that in conjunction with the annual U.S. Army Best Warrior competition the Army would also conduct the inaugural U.S. Army Best Squad Competition.

Throughout the Army, squads immediately began training hoping to be selected to represent their division in September with the goal of being recognized as the best squad in the Army.

For Staff Sgt. Reycel Dasher, an infantryman serving as one of the many noncommissioned officers on the U.S. Army South staff, this opportunity presented an additional challenge in order to compete, he didn’t have a squad to lead.

“I had very little time to prepare once I had identified my squad but the second I identified them we started training on EIB and ESB tasks,” he said as he explained that U.S. Army South doesn’t work in traditional infantry squads. “I immediately started doing PT with them and asking them general knowledge and it was different because they came from different backgrounds as far as how long they have been in the Army.”

Leading a squad is something Dasher has done in the past, so his experience helped gear his training and boost his confidence even though the squad was assembled from different sections of U.S. Army South.

“It was difficult because it was short notice,” explained Dasher. “I’m also the only infantryman in our squad and the rest of them are geospatial engineers that I don’t really work with.”

He further explained that working with new Soldiers happens regularly in a traditional infantry squad as Soldiers are promoted or are moved for various reasons. While working with newly assigned Soldiers wasn’t new to Dasher, this type of competition was new.

Not knowing what to expect in a squad-oriented competition made the first day a bit of a shock when the teams arrived and immediately took a written exam as individuals.

“Next time I will put a little more focus on practicing board questions since that is how this competition started out with a written test,” he said. “It had a lot of general knowledge but things you may not have thought about in a long time.”

Once his team got in the swing of competing, he felt better about the chances his squad had of not only competing well but potentially winning.

“So far, I think our squad is doing really good. It looks like we are killing it out there and at least with the ACFT I know we had a good squad average,” Dasher explained at the end of the first full day of competition.

With the rest of the competition remaining unknown he had one final thing to say when asked about how he was feeling.

“I’m just taking it as it comes and not trying to fatigue my body too much and I’m definitely having fun and I will definitely try to do this again in the future as a squad leader.”"

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — It has been less than a year since Sgt. Ester White’s mom passed away. She credits her fellow Soldiers with helping her get through the difficult time by letting her know she was an integral part of the team.

“If I was a civilian at the same timeframe my mom passed away, I would’ve acted out way differently than I would have now,” said White, an automated logistics specialist assigned to U.S. Army South. “As a civilian, I would have just not gone back to work at all. But with the military, while I was on leave people were texting me, ‘when are you coming back? We need help!’”

White was born in Korea where she spent most of her childhood. Oftentimes, she has been mistaken as Pacific Islander, but she was born to a Korean mom and a dad of Black and Native American descent.

“I grew up in an Asian household,” said White. “Even though my dad was American, he speaks Korean.”

In 2012, White joined the Army National Guard at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania. In 2016 she began serving active duty and was stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Carson, Colorado; U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, South Korea; and completed a nine-month rotation in Europe.

“In Korea, all of my Soldiers were straight out of [advanced individual training] and never left their barracks, so I found ways to get them out, and I was their tour guide,” said White. “It felt good to do something like that because it reminds me of my mom who was like that. She was always happy and always helping people. So It makes my day when I know I’m able to help my Soldiers.”

White, whose goal is to become a warrant officer or a first sergeant, said being in the Army has given her purpose and drive and has taught her resiliency. She plans to serve every day carrying on her mother’s legacy and following in her footsteps.

“Even though my mom was really tiny, she has really big shoes to fill,” said White. “I feel like my mom was the perfect person, and people can’t be perfect. But, when everyone says the same thing about my mom and how she impacted so many people in her life, I want to do things for people the way she did.”"

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (May 23, 2022) - In recent years, Latin America and Caribbean countries have suffered major environmental disasters whether by torrential hurricanes or catastrophic earthquakes in the region, causing floods and landslides that left thousands of people displaced and a high human death toll. During a two-week period in 2020, Guatemala and Honduras were slammed by Hurricanes Eta and Iota which led U.S. Army South to deploy Soldiers to the region to assist in humanitarian assistance efforts.

As part of Army South’s mission to respond and be ready in disaster situations, the command facilitated the first-ever CENTAM GUARDIAN exercise held May 1-20, to build readiness, resilience and confidence across the Central American region.

“This exercise is an important opportunity to build the capacity of our armies and critical civilian support organizations,” said Col. Chip Karels, Army South G3/7 director of training and exercises (TREX). “Each of the three phases of the exercise were designed to build both capability and capacity from the tactical, Soldier skills level to multi-national disaster response.”

G7 TREX planners led the planning effort for CENTAM GUARDIAN 22, but Karels mentioned creating the exercise was an Army South team effort across the command with planners from other directorates providing crucial support in their areas of expertise.

Divided into three phases, CENTAM GUARDIAN consisted of a field training exercise (FTX), a humanitarian assistance and disaster response table-top exercise (TTX) and an operational command post exercise.

The FTX involved U.S. Soldiers from 7th Special Forces Group, Puerto Rico Army National Guard, and 60 Soldiers from the Salvadorian Army. The FTX consisted of basic Soldier skills including first aid, movement, land navigation, and basic rifle marksmanship.

“The multi-national nature of CENTAM GUARDIAN inevitably led to challenges based on competing requirements and the diverse areas of training within each event,” Karels said. “The support from the partner nations was excellent and it was only through their significant efforts that the exercise was able to succeed.”

Prior to the TTX, the participants received two days of academic classes to review their basic knowledge of urban search and rescue methodologies to prepare them for the disaster scenario.

“It’s not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’” said Jesus Escalona, Costa Rica Red Cross director of operations, expressing the reality of natural disasters which takes place in the region. For the TTX, the scenario involved an earthquake causing major damage in El Salvador; to include building collapses, trapped survivors and landslides.

“We’re evaluating the process for El Salvador to see how well they will do when their resources come to an end because of the damage,” Escalona said. “We want to see how they can get resources from Honduras and Guatemala, but in real life, it may be any other country that comes to their aid.”

He emphasized the responders must have interoperability between their nations when requesting for resources and quickly be able to navigate around “the bureaucracy and red tape” in order to get aid, equipment and other resources they need.

During the After Action Review several agencies noted deficiencies with plans, processes, and authorities within their organizations. They agreed to work the issues and test them at next year’s CENTAM GUARDIAN 23 exercise.

Evaluation from the academics portion and the table-top exercise provided Hernan Ramos, group leader, Search and Rescue Unit, Permanent Contingency Commission (COPECO) of Honduras, to reevaluate his organization’s practices on urban search and rescue.

COPECO is part of a Central American network of government disaster relief agencies known as the Coordination Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters in Central America.

“We are able to look at our current standard operating procedures, the equipment we have, and examine how we jointly work with another country in the event we would have to have a multinational response,” Ramos said. “An earthquake that happens in Honduras, for example, could have devastating impacts on our neighboring countries as well. This exercise allows for all the responders to speak the same language.”

With new members as part of the COPECO team, Ramos saw the TTX as an opportunity to stress those newcomers who have not yet participated in a real-life crisis.

“The objective is to give them a better understanding and some experience here, so when a real disaster happens, they’ll have some knowledge on the systems to react,” he said. “Those of us with more experience also get a chance to refresh and recollect best practices; and share our experiences with our new team members.”

According to Karels, the CPX was designed to develop collaboration and information sharing opportunities to combat against transnational organized threats. Honduras and Guatemala participated with brigade headquarters elements, with El Salvador worked at the battalion level.

The CPX was structured around a coordination cell manned by liaison officers from all three partner nation armies. Events were injected into a national headquarters, processed and then passed to the coordination cell. The coordination cell turned the data into information and passed it to the appropriate national headquarters to process for action.

The CPX and HA/DR TTX were supported by Soldiers from the 321st Civil Affairs Brigade and the 54th Security Forces Assistance Brigade.

During the closing ceremony, Brig. Gen. Lynn M. Heng, Army South deputy commanding general, praised the Salvadorans for hosting the exercise and highlighted the significance of the training.

“I thank our El Salvadoran hosts and everyone who has worked so hard bringing this exercise to life – it was truly a tremendous training event,” Heng said. “The importance of this cannot be overstated since most humanitarian missions occur on short notice and we simply never know when we could find ourselves working together in the future. Our ability to coordinate and respond collectively as a region to facilitate the timely arrival of humanitarian assistance will certainly support the effort to save lives and alleviate suffering.”

With the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season on the horizon, Ramos mentioned he was appreciative of the U.S. Army for coordinating CENTAM GUARDIAN 22. As he prepared for departing El Salvador back to Honduras, he felt his team benefitted from the training scenarios would be ready “if and when” a natural disaster strike.

“Having the U.S. Army coordinate this exercise is great, coming from a technical and economic stance, because the regional countries don’t have a lot of support,” Ramos said. “For us, having an ally that has the technical capability, financial power and experience in the field is a great help for us to strengthen our national capacity in terms of emergency management.”"

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — “In traditional military operations we need to be able to shoot, move and communicate. We need to identify key positions, know the terrain and know enemy capabilities. Cybersecurity is the same concept,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Luis D. Nieves, a U.S. Army cyber defender assigned to the U.S. Army 915th Cyber Warfare Battalion. Nieves was chosen as an Army expert during a recent cyber defense subject matter expertise exchange between the U.S. and Argentine armies.

Personnel from U.S. Army South coordinated this three-day exchange with the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Directorate to share how U.S. Army cyber defense plays a role in military operations and defense of the nation.

“We had U.S. Soldiers engaging with the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Division personnel at all echelons from strategic leadership, action officer to the analyst level,” said Sgt. Maj. Albert Dernberger, Army South Fires and Effects Directorate senior enlisted advisor. “It is a very collaborative environment when we talk about cyber and trying to figure out how the adversary maneuvers in that space, so we learn a lot from each other.”

Dernberger explained that we look at cyber partnerships as key players in developing a holistic defensive posture.

“Other countries see similar threats, together we can identify tactics, techniques and procedures of the adversary, and use those things to bolster our security, and in return we are providing that information back through various mechanisms so our partners can bolster their security as well,” he said.

Col. Luis P. Guimpel, director of the Argentine Army Cyber Defense Division led the Argentine army during the exchange and will also serve as the cyber operations cell lead during the annual PANAMAX exercise taking place at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, in August 2022. PANAMAX is a multinational exercise that provides training opportunities for nations to work together and build the capability to plan and conduct complex multinational operations.

“We have always been partners, and these events continue to build that partnership,” said Guimpel.

U.S. Army South has a long-lasting relationship with partner nation armies’ cyber communities of interest and work with cyber professionals in the region to build cybersecurity capacities and capabilities through exchanges, offering opportunities to participate in international cyber conferences and participation in cyber cells during multinational and bilateral exercises.

“We learned a lot about the Argentine army’s challenges with defending their military networks from cyber attacks, and we were able to discuss some of the shared challenges such as talent retention and organizational development,” said Dernberger.

As the exchange came to a close, Guimpel shared knowledge from one of his military professors during his time as a young army lieutenant.

“No one person or organization can know everything,” he said. “That piece of information holds true today, over 30 years later. It is imperative that we continue to come together and share information so we can continue strengthening our defenses.”"

SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras – U.S. Army South finished a contingency command post (CCP) deployment exercise here on May 19, to increase readiness for upcoming contingencies in the U.S. Southern Command’s (SOUTHCOM) area of operations.

During the nine-day forward exercise, over 60 Soldiers from Army South, 470th Military Intelligence Brigade, 410th Contracting Support Brigade (410th CSB), and 56th Signal Battalion set up the CCP tactical operations center, tactical satellite communications, and participated in several operations and intelligence briefs with Army South, U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) and 410th CSB to rehearse their staff function as SOUTHCOM’s command and control element during contingency operations.

“There were metrics that [the CCP team] had to meet to ensure that they could deploy and be an operational command post in an austere environment,” said Brig. Gen. Lynn Heng, Army South deputy commanding general. “In the future, we will build upon that and bring in some more entities and organizations to build out our capabilities.”

Contingency operations are large-scale and require a coordinated U.S. government response, and training like this is key to ensuring that all participants are prepared in case a real-world crisis takes place.

The CCP will support SOUTHCOM, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), other federal agencies and non-governmental organizations during humanitarian crises, natural disasters and other contingency operations in the Caribbean, Central and South America.

“The BHA is the lead federal coordinator of international humanitarian response, and that means USAID has the mandate to assume that leadership position and determine the strategy and approach for U.S. government response of pulling in the relevant interagency support if required.” said Kaitlyn Neuberger, USAID’s humanitarian assistance advisor to the military at SOUTHCOM. “In order for the military to get involved the Department of Defense (DoD) must provide a unique capability or service that can’t be provided by civilian organizations.”

Neuberger went on to say unique and rapid DoD capabilities like air traffic control, transportation and civil engineering are most commonly necessary during natural disasters like the 2010 Haiti earthquake and Hurricanes Matthew and Iota.

Contingency operations are multifaceted, which is why the CCP trains and rehearses to deploy expeditiously. Maj. Sean Buchanan, CCP operations officer in charge, said there are communication and logistical requirements to accomplish mission success during humanitarian or disaster relief.

“This size element hasn’t deployed since the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and a lot of internal and external logistical coordination went into getting here and back for this deployment exercise, so it was a balancing act between the movement of equipment and personnel,” said Buchanan. “Once we were on the ground, we were able to integrate as a staff to get everything set up and establish communications within just over 24 hours of arrival.”

Setting up communications enables the joint task force commander to have situational awareness of what is happening on the ground and relay that information to all other entities involved.

Chief Warrant Officer Morgan McCarty, CCP network operations chief, said without having efficient communication between all agencies involved in a mission, they would not be able to have coordinated operations.

“We were able to set up many different levels and types of communications, such as commercial internet, virtual teleconferencing, radio, telephone and several others to provide communication between everyone involved in the operation,” said McCarty. “Our team did a great job of stress testing our network capabilities, rapidly troubleshooting and fixing any issues that arose during this expeditionary exercise, so we can successfully execute a contingency mission in the future.”

Another operational piece is logistics. In order to get DoD personnel and equipment to a contingency operation takes a lot of combined effort.

Lt. Col. Michelle Martinez, Army South G4 sustainment division chief, said the logistical requirements depend on the mission and what capabilities are already established at the location.

“A lot of what we need to logistically consider is based on where we are going and what type of logistical support is required, but we need to ensure all classes of supplies are provided, to include material handling equipment, air/ground transport, contract support, waste management, etc.” said Martinez. “We also work with engineers to get building material needed for building, establishing a secure perimeter, or other projects that may need to be executed during a natural disaster.”

Army South also coordinated with Army Support Activity (ASA) Soto Cano personnel to provide sustainment for the CCP staff.

“Our teams worked closely together to ensure access to facilities and support logistics,” said Col. Carl Hennemann, ASA Soto Cano garrison commander. “Events just like this help improve readiness and ensure, when requested, both teams are ready for a wide array of support to include disaster relief response.”

The teamwork involved in an operation of this nature reflects Army South’s enduring commitment to its partners and the importance of collective readiness when contingencies such as humanitarian crises, natural disasters and other destabilizing factors arise.

DAVENPORT, Iowa – As legendary poet laureate/pop artist Bob Dylan sang early in his career in the mid-sixties, “The Times They Are A-Changin’” and so agrees the U.S. Army Sustainment Command leadership regarding where its personnel may be going to work.

But what will the 21st century workplace look like at ASC, headquartered in Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois? Twenty-two years into this century, that question has not been definitively answered quite yet. But, with forward-thinking and knowing it can’t stay the same, ASC leaders are now exploring for possible answers.

Up until March 2020, the look and function of the workplace predominantly looked the same as the 20th century, except for newer high-tech equipment. That all changed, however, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the majority of workforce to telework.

Previously, only a few Civilians teleworked Army-wide. Telework was typically approved by management on a case-by-case basis, based on unique employee circumstances. What many thought would be a temporary change unfolded into Civilian and military personnel working from home full time. Only now, two years later, with COVID-19 deaths lessening, the workforce is being told it’s time to start coming back.

But, come back to what?

With that in mind, ASC personnel consisting of Matt Sannito, deputy to the commanding general, ASC; Col. Scott Kindberg, ASC chief of staff; Lee Hansen, ASC deputy chief of staff, G1 (Human Resource Management); and, Shannon Nielsen, general engineer, ASC, recently met with Rena Gainey, owner and creator of opportunities, of coworkqc, at her business office located in downtown Davenport, Iowa.

Gainey has nearly 30 years of experience as an executive coach and trainer in corporate leadership development with Deere & Company.

She is in the business of helping companies embrace the possibilities of how the 21st century can meet the needs of the current and future workforce in order to recruit and retain the best talent.

Coworkqc is a shared workspace and community center for entrepreneurs, freelancers, remote workers and startups. The motto of the business is “Work, Create, Collaborate.”

One thing is for sure, the ASC workforce will not continue to do business the way it did prior to the pandemic. A shared workspace in some form may be a good alternative to working full time inside the headquarter’s office space at the arsenal.

“We are a global business. Our personnel work in all corners of the world. Not a single Army Field Support Brigade is on Rock Island Arsenal,” Hansen pointed out. “In essence, this makes all of our AFSBs remote workers with Rock Island as their ‘home’ headquarters. Some will never set foot on Rock Island Arsenal, yet, they are able to accomplish the mission without being physically confined to Rock Island Arsenal.”

Hansen added that a distributed workforce is not a new concept. “We just need to take advantage of the opportunities the pandemic gave us and to move forward,” he said.

“The pandemic only accelerated the evolution by demonstrating, very rapidly, to a large number of supervisors, that teleworkers can sometimes be more productive than a worker confined to a legacy brick and mortar office,” Hansen explained. “The employees also realized a greater work/life balance can be achieved creating a win-win for both the employee and the headquarters. Even small quick tasks like being available to accept Amazon packages or walking [their] kids to/from the bus stop can go a long way in improving work/life balance.”

According to various internet sources, shared workspace or coworking is the situation in which several workers from different companies share an office space, allowing cost savings and convenience through the use of common infrastructure, such as equipment, utilities, receptionist and custodial services.

It is also similar to a flexible office space, which is a type of workspace designed to provide employees with a variety of different places and ways to work.

Unlike traditional offices with fixed and assigned desk positions, workers in a flexible office space can choose the area of the office that best suits the type of work they need to do at that moment.

Flexible workspaces can be easily rearranged to accommodate changing business objectives, or quickly scaled up and down to fit teams of different sizes. These kinds of dynamic office spaces are typically designed to be used in conjunction with flexible working arrangements to provide teams with the freedom to work where, when, and how they want, various internet sources stated.

There is also flexible working , which is a term used to describe any working pattern that falls outside of traditional office hours or locations. That can mean working in different spots around the same office, working from home, at a remote desk or working part-time or staggered hours.

Consequently, workers don’t have to stick to normal business hours or endure busy commutes. Instead they can manage their time and energy resulting in more creative work, as well as being happier and more productive than their office-bound colleagues, internet sources stated.

Flexible working gives the workforce the opportunity to work how they want and where they want, fostering a healthy work-life balance in the process. By choosing their own schedules, employees can work around obligations such as medical appointments and school drop-offs, while avoiding rush-hour traffic and packed buses and trains.

Kindberg said he wants ASC to be able to hire the best talent, which often is restricted because of the limited employee pool in the Quad Cities or hesitation to move to the area. For instance, Kindberg said he would like the ability to hire someone from New York City, but have them work remotely if that person desires and the mission supports it.

“We must evolve in our remote and telework posture in order to attract a greater depth of talent, and a diverse workforce moving forward,” Kindberg said.

“Overall as an organizational headquarters within the Army, we need to adapt and embrace our ability to mission command remotely, and this type of facility/environment is the way of the future,” he said.

“The global pandemic hastened employer’s willingness to embrace a distributed workforce and this two-year experiment proved to be a successful business model,” said Sannito, a member of the Senior Executive Service. “If we are going to continue to succeed in our missions and attract/retain the best workforce, we must embrace our changed business processes to match the new culture of the organization by offering a variety of working environments that ensures all employees thrive in the best setting for themselves.”

Hansen said he is aware that in order to compete with private businesses who have embraced more progressive work policies, ASC must adapt as well.

“ASC has already lost personnel to other units who have a more aggressive telework/remote work program. We will continue to lose personnel and will find it become increasingly difficult to hire replacement personnel if we are unwilling to fully support policies more in-line with other industries,” he said.

Nielsen, the general engineer, has a different perspective on changes to where and how the workforce may work.

“We have gotten creative in how we create relationships with our teams and our customers over the last two years. I see a collaboration working environment as a new tool for the workforce to use to continue to build on our skillsets,” Nielsen said.

“There is hard-fast criteria outlined in existing Army regulations on space allowances, as well as dynamic considerations -- like in union agreements -- that will need to be considered and incorporated into such a plan. When the time comes to create the product, it will be crucial to have a defined plan in order to meet the intent of the concept.”

Nielsen said from a space perspective, ASC must find what actions can be taken to be the most beneficial for employees to do their best work, what flexibilities can be offered, how to introduce these ideas to existing employees, and how those concepts can be incorporated into a plan that meets facility criteria codes/expectations.

As any ASC Civilian or Soldier knows, the parking lot is still pretty empty for the most part. But what does that mean regarding infrastructure of ASC’s headquarters?

“Workplace features, like chairs, furniture, and office equipment, are not currently being used to their maximum utility,” Nielsen pointed out. “By using shared spaces, like team rooms for groups coming to the office to collaborate on a hot project, we will foster those personal relationships in addition to saving money by occupying a smaller footprint.”

Nielsen added there are many base operation services that are currently underutilized, such as running the heat for an unoccupied floor or paying for janitorial services that are unnecessary in vacant areas.

“If we are to continue the trend of a hybrid work model by being in the office less than 40 hours per week, we can find financial savings in Army-provided utilities and lifecycle management,” she said.

Hansen explained that a shared workspace concept is no different than a college student occupying a study desk/space in the university library.

“The student would occupy a study table, study desk or meeting room based on their immediate needs. As their needs change throughout the day, so can their study/work location. The same thing can occur with our employees,” Hansen said.

While much discussion will be needed before anything takes root, Sannito said that change is inevitable.

“I am an absolute champion for a new framework that allows greater access to talent, lower costs, higher productivity and enhanced work-life balances by trusting our workforce to get the job accomplished,” Sannito said. “We can and need to be the leader regarding where work gets done.”

SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras — U.S. Army South Soldiers arrived here yesterday for a nine-day deployment exercise with more than 60 Soldiers to set up a contingency command post (CCP) in preparation for future forward operations in the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) area of responsibility.

A CCP is a rapidly deployable headquarters capable of providing Joint Task Force support designed to plan and conduct small-scale contingency operations.

“Our standard operating procedure is to go forward with wheels up within 96 hours of the initial deployment notification and be operational within 48 hours of landing in the country,” said Maj. Sean Buchanan, Army South CCP operations officer. “Once operational, we will work with the United States Agency for International Development and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance to provide situational awareness for the commander.”

This exercise was designed to rehearse the transportation of Army South equipment and personnel as well as test their capability to rapidly deploy the CCP in support of emergent SOUTHCOM requirements.

Buchanan said he is pleased with his team's performance so far.

“We have a lot of Soldiers who are new to Army South and the CCP, so there was some learning and discovery yesterday during the setup of the main tent,” said Buchanan. “But everything is going very well so far and we are ahead of schedule.”

Army South Soldiers will test and establish communications with Army South headquarters and SOUTHCOM.

Staff Sgt. Patricia Kimbrough, CCP communications and signal non-commissioned officer in charge, said her Soldiers remain prepared for CCP deployments.

“We train on setting up our terminals and testing our signals and communications once a month,” said Kimbrough. “So this exercise is an opportunity to validate our operations and troubleshooting.”

Kimbrough’s team can set up signal terminals and establish communications within two hours of landing in the country.

Preparation for a deployment of the CCP is an ongoing process. The CCP is a response team that reacts to several categories of contingencies, such as humanitarian missions and natural disasters.

1st Sgt. Richard Sosa, of the CCP mayor cell responsible for logistics and unit readiness, was able to get the unit administratively prepared to support the exercise. Sosa said previous exercises and rehearsals assisted in the successful execution of this exercise.

Over the last several months, Army South has conducted level 1 and 2 deployment readiness exercises (DRE) and a staff exercises (STAFFEX) to enhance and hone in on readiness and maneuverability of mission essential assets.

“We have to be ready and engaged at all times to respond to any contingency operations in our area of operation,” said Sosa. “The level 1 and 2 DREs helped us identify Soldier readiness, and previous STAFFEX helped us create a battle rhythm on how to approach the sustainment and logistics piece of this exercise,” said Sosa.

One of the Army South CCP’s most high profile deployments was in support of Operation Unified Response as part of Joint Task Force-Haiti following the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake that destroyed vast areas of the capital and left over two million people homeless on Jan. 12, 2010.

The efforts of Joint Task Force-Haiti contributed immensely to international relief efforts in the largest disaster response mission in modern U.S. military history, earning U.S. Army South the Joint Meritorious Unit award.

Army South and their assigned units consistently work to increase skills, abilities, and readiness to operate as a cohesive Army Service Component Command team in support of U.S. Southern Command."

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Zoe Marie Kimbell Tompkins smiles and laughs before knife-handing her Soldiers into formation during a change of responsibility rehearsal on JBSA Lackland Air Force Base, March 17, 2022.

Kimbell, the operations non-commissioned officer in charge at 470th Military Intelligence Brigade, is originally from China. She does not know exactly where she is from because her parents abandoned her due to China's one-child policy. She said she was lucky to survive.

“In Chinese culture, males are favored because they carry on the family name and they stay at home and take care of the parents, and the female usually gets married and lives with the husband's family,” said Kimbell.

Thankfully, the infant Kimbell was found and taken to an orphanage where she spent the first year of her life. She then moved into the foster care system before finally being adopted by an American family at 18 months old.

“I was a lucky kid growing up because not everybody had the familial support I had,” said Kimbell. “My parents put in a lot of effort just to have me, and there was never any point where I felt that I was not a part of a family.”

Even with the love and support of her parents, Kimbell still struggled with her own identity. She identified more with her parents' Italian and Czechoslovakian heritage than her Chinese ancestry.

“The biggest thing that I struggled with was my own identity because, by DNA, I am Chinese, but I don't identify with that culture,” she said. “I was the only Asian kid at my school until high school.”

Despite this internal conflict, Kimbell did well in school and had several options set before her at graduation. Her only challenge was choosing a direction to take her life.

“When I grew up, I was a theater nerd, but I just wanted to do it for fun because I didn’t think it would be a sustainable career,” said Kimbell. “I realized I could go to community college and get my general education out of the way, but I didn’t have a major that I really enjoyed. Then, someone jokingly brought up joining the military, and I realized that was not a bad idea.”

Kimbell counted her blessings as she reflected on her life and decided she wanted to give back to her adopted country in any way possible. During her senior year of high school, she enlisted in the U.S. Army as a signal intelligence analyst.

As she climbed the ranks, Kimbell developed as a leader and was inducted into the Sgt. Audie Murphy Club, or SAMC, on Aug. 13, 2021. The SAMC recognizes non-commissioned officers for exemplary performance and leadership. Soldiers are nominated by company leadership to compete, followed by boards, essays and written exams testing Army regulations and leadership decisions.

“The whole process of competing for the SAMC was a learning [experience],” said Kimbell. “The biggest lesson I learned was that it doesn’t matter what your rank is or how long you have been a Soldier; being a good leader is about knowing your Soldiers and doing everything you can to help them grow and succeed.”

One of the most impactful things about leadership Kimbell has learned is her own self-awareness.

“Before I joined the Army, no one told me you don't always have to be the one talking,” she said. “Early on in my Army career, I thought one of my mentors was a jerk because he would always tell me to stop talking, but at one point, he told me, ‘You've got to calm down. We hear you, but you need to bring your energy down to your audience.’”

Kimbell said she learned from that mentor that a leader needs to be able to hold up a mirror, not just from a social standpoint, but also a leadership standpoint and make an honest — sometimes brutal — self-assessment.

As Kimbell continues to excel in her Army career, she attributes her success to her family.

“I had a come-to-God moment, where I realized that I got a pretty solid deal in that I have an amazing family with all the love and support that I could imagine,” she said. “In a way, serving my country was my way of saying thank you to my parents and the country that gave me a second chance.”"

FORT BENNING, Georgia – The U.S. Army South led “Programa Integral para Suboficiales de Alta Jerarquía”, or PISAJ, concluded yesterday after 11 days of training, tactical demonstrations and cultural outings here on base.

“Over the past two weeks, our partner nation sergeants major have focused on building senior leader competencies and the necessity of joint operations in our complex world,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Ronald J. Graves, the senior enlisted advisor at Army South. “I challenge this class to take what they learned here to make our partnership stronger and all of our non-commissioned officers better.”

PISAJ is a military-to-military engagement conducted semi-annually with the Colombian army and other invited participants as a part of a biannual agreed-to-action between the U.S. and Colombia focused on NCOs and designed to increase the capacity and regional collaboration between both militaries.

With this year's focus in mind, students attended briefings on equal opportunity, sexual harassment/assault response and prevention, gender integration, human resources, as well as Joint Forces briefings from U.S. Southern Command and its components, Inter-American Air Forces Academy and the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.

The class also visited several schools and training centers on Fort Benning including the Security Forces Assistance Brigade.

The 43 Colombian, three Brazilian and one Mexican NCOs were pleased with the content of this iteration as it will assist with their personal military development as well as the development of their military overall.

“One lesson that I want to take back is the level of confidence that leaders have in their subordinates to perform their duties and accomplish the mission, and in turn, subordinates will have confidence in their leader,” said Mexican army soldier, 1st Sgt. Alvaro Lobato Juárez. “I have attended WHINSEC before, and I thought I had learned all I could from the U.S. Army but I realize there is a lot more.”

One of the four female senior NCOs attending this iteration of PISAJ, Colombian army soldier, Sgt. Maj. Olga Lucía Velasco Carabali, was grateful for the support of the U.S. Armed Forces through partner nation collaborative activities like this and said this experience was invaluable.

“I gained a lot of experience, knowledge and motivation from PISAJ 16,” said Velasco. “My key takeaway from this experience was how to give the knowledge and capabilities to my subordinates in order to help our commander and our soldiers. This has been a very positive experience and this is going to be a very important tool we can use in our units back home.”

While the experiences and lessons learned have been invaluable, Graves envisions the expansion of involvement and planning from our partners with a greater focus on joint operations.

“Our goal is to continue participation with Colombia, Brazil and Mexico, yet attract additional partners from other Caribbean, Central and South American forces of all branches of military,” said Graves. “We have asked Sgt. Maj. of the Colombian Army, William Cuellar Duarte, to give us five priorities in where he wants to continue developing his NCO corps and senior enlisted sergeants major. Then we will focus our briefings, discussions and, for the first time, introduce working groups while having U.S. and partner nation sergeants major working together to develop courses.”"

This semi-annual, military-to-military engagement with the Colombian army is part of a biannual agreed-to-action between the U.S. and Colombia and is designed to increase the capacity and regional collaboration between both militaries. This year's focus is to build upon senior leader competencies and instill the necessity of joint operations in a complex world.

So far, 47 senior non-commissioned officers from Colombia, Brazil and Mexico participated in command briefs with senior enlisted leaders from U.S. Southern Command components and took part in training focused on equal opportunity, sexual harassment/assault response and prevention and gender integration.

“They have a similar gender integration program and they are trying to figure out how our program operates and what changes they want to make toward improving,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Ronald J. Graves, senior enlisted advisor for Army South. “They asked great questions, and I’m extremely impressed with the discussions that took place.”

Sgt. Maj. of the Colombian Army, William Cuellar Duarte, said the engagement is valuable when it comes to building capacity.

“This is a great opportunity and our enlisted leaders are privileged to come here and receive all of this training,” said Cuellar. “When they return to Colombia, they can pass on this knowledge to their soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers.”

Graves also encouraged Cuellar and other participants to come together in planning and possibly hosting future iterations of PISAJ in Colombia.

“We want them to take the lead on their professional military education and explain to us how we can help them move forward,” said Graves.

Cuellar said this new level of involvement in the planning of PISAJ will be a big step in the strengthening of the U.S. and Colombian military partnership.

“We are going to analyze, plan and then meet with Command Sgt. Maj. Graves about how we can develop this program so Colombia can host it in the future,” said Cuellar. “This is a big step in Colombia for our sergeant major and non-commissioned officer development.”

PISAJ 16 will continue with additional training, visits to the U.S. Army Armor School, a security forces assistance brigade, and a basic combat training graduation."

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District has delivered an additional secure home for part of the Israeli Air Force’s fleet of F-35 fighter jets, with a small ceremony marking the completion of another Hardened Hangar project on site earlier this year in March.

The United States has partnered with Israel for several years on its F-35 program through the Foreign Military Finance, or FMF, program where the two nations partner on construction of strategic facilities.

“This project is a key element of the US-Israeli partnership to deliver a unique set of hardened hangars and operations facilities to house a squadron of F-35’s for the Israeli Air Force,” said U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District Commander Col. Patrick Dagon.

The project was the result of close partnership and coordination from beginning to end, with the Israeli Ministry of Defense providing the designs as well as local quality assurance specialists to complement the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contract and project management efforts.

The ability to resist against a variety of threats is a key component of this project. The project team worked closely with a blast designer to account for site conditions and other concerns to ensure every component of the facility, including utilities, storage, life support and more are designed to highest, state-of-the-art standards for rugged survivability against any threat.

In addition to security, functionality is key with the site enabling for the rapid deployment F-35’s at a moment’s notice as well as interconnectivity with similar facilities the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also working on in the country.

Israeli Air Force technicians began installing a secure communications network concurrent to final construction efforts so the site could be occupied immediately and begin supporting missions right away.

“Every Israeli Ministry of Defense and Air Force leader who speaks about this project explains how this is not a theoretical and potential need - but rather an immediate and critical part of their duty to provide protection to the citizens of their country against the constant threat from enemies in the region,” said Contracting Officer’s Representative Ben Diamond with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Israel Area South Resident Office. “When they speak I feel a sense of genuine pride in the outcome and appreciation for our efforts to deliver this asset to their security and defense and I feel humbled to be able to make such an impact.”

The work is part of a larger partnership between Israel and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that has been in place for decades, beginning in 1979 after the Camp David Accords. That historic agreement called for the U.S. to support construction of new Israeli facilities to replace its Sinai airbases abandoned as part of the agreement and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led that construction effort.

Since then the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has partnered with Israel on billions of dollars in construction efforts both through the Foreign Military Finance program as well as in support of similar agreements like the Wye River Memorandum geared toward encouraging peace in the region.

“Europe District is proud to continue supporting our allies in Israel through this strategic partnership of building facilities supporting regional security goals,” Dagon said. “These projects enable Israel to improve their defense capabilities and work toward common security goals while cementing cooperative bilateral military relationships.”

This latest F-35 project completed in Israel is not the first such hardened hangar project the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has helped deliver in Israel in support of the F-35 program and it won’t be the last. Work is already underway for multiple additional similar facilities to be constructed in the coming years as well as facilities to ensure their connectivity going forward.

Diamond looks forward to continuing to support the program as long as his assignment in Israel continues.

“There’s nothing as loud and motivational as the constant roar of the F-35’s taking off to remind the team on the ground the purpose of our dedication to the success of this project.”"

WASHINGTON -- Thanksgiving is going to look a lot different for just about everyone this year thanks to the global pandemic. Unfortunately, that includes our service members stationed overseas.

Large group gatherings in dining facilities used to be the standard for our deployed men and women when it came to celebrating Thanksgiving. This year, that setup will likely look more like grab-and-go style takeout instead.

But no matter what, the Defense Logistics Agency said it's making sure all our warfighters have a home-cooked meal with all the trimmings this holiday. And in case you thought cooking a huge turkey for your family was a lot, try doing it for tens of thousands of hungry troops!

This year, the DLA has shipped out the following quantities of food:

9,000 whole turkeys

51,000 pounds of roasted turkeys

74,000 pounds of beef

21,000 pounds of ham

67,000 pounds of shrimp

16,000 pounds of sweet potatoes

19,000 pounds of pies and cakes

7,000 gallons of eggnog

That doesn't even include all the other fixings that go into the meal!

Months of Effort

It's no easy feat to get all that food prepared and shipped to service members across the globe.

DLA Troop Support started planning and preparing for this year's meal as early as March. A lot of the ingredients are at prime vendor locations by September, while the high-volume items, such as the turkeys and 131 tons of trimmings, start arriving overseas in October.

""The holidays will look quite different this year for everyone,"" said Army Brig. Gen. Gavin Lawrence, DLA's Troop Support commander. ""I'm proud that our workforce is doing everything possible to make sure our warfighters get a proper holiday meal, especially since many of us will not be able to be with our family and friends. We want to make sure they get that taste of home no matter where they are in the world.""

It's a mission the DLA has provided to field kitchens, dining facilities and galleys all over the world for more than 50 years.

""Our supply chain takes the holidays very seriously,"" said Army Col. Eric McCoy, DLA's Troop Support subsistence director. ""Our troops are far away from home, and they definitely look forward to this meal. Disappointing them is not an option.""

McCoy said most overseas locations received their supplies for the meals by mid-November.

DLA Troop Support supplies America's armed forces with $19 billion annually in food, uniforms, protective equipment and other vital items. A well-prepared Thanksgiving meal during a tough time of year is definitely something our troops can be thankful for!

WASHINGTON -- The Army plans to adjust how it promotes its noncommissioned officers that could impact Soldiers who are serving in combat, starting a family, or attending the non-resident Sergeants Major Course, said the Army’s top enlisted Soldier.

Starting Jan. 1, NCOs unable to complete the required professional military education, or PME, courses may qualify to be temporarily promoted from sergeant through sergeant major, said Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston during a media briefing Monday.

The temporary promotions aim to help an array of Soldiers who are either deployed, are pregnant or during postpartum, or attending the non-resident Sergeants Major Couse, Grinston said.

The promotions include both the pay and benefits expected from ranking up and will be in place until the rank is either permanent or expires, whichever comes first, he said.

The new policy will impact NCOs across the board, with changes starting in the January promotion cycle for all Army components.

Depending on the component, the fine print is different. For example, Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers must already be selected for or serving in the next higher-graded position vacancy to qualify.

All Soldiers, regardless of component, must also meet or exceed the cutoff score and sequence number for their respective ranks, according to a memo signed by Lt. Gen. Gary M. Brito, the Army’s G-1. In addition, they must be next in line on an approved order of merit list during fiscal year 2021.

Active-duty and full-time reservists will have no later than one year to complete their education upon redeployment. Traditional reservists will have 36 months from their redeployment date to complete their education.

The timeframe to complete PME is also extended for pregnancy and postpartum circumstances. Active-duty Soldiers and full-time reservists will have 24 months, and traditional reservists will have 36 months from the end date of their pregnancy-based profile.

“With this new temporary promotion [policy], we have the ability to have Soldiers starting a family being given the opportunity to be promoted with their peers and still get their professional military education after they complete their postpartum profile,” said Sgt. Maj. Mark Clark, the G-1 sergeant major.

Before the new policy, deployed Soldiers often had to request time-consuming exceptions to be considered for promotion without the required PME.

“This new policy doesn’t make [temporary promotions] an exception -- it makes it a standard,” Grinston said. “Those Soldiers, who are otherwise fully qualified, will be temporarily promoted with their peers. Everything will be streamlined.”

To understand the scope, around 300 deployment-related exceptions were approved in 2019, Clark said. But under the new policy, deployed Soldiers are no longer forced to deal with paper shuffling that may keep them from being promoted.

Those few hundred requests are based on a smaller operational tempo overseas. If the ops tempo grew back up to 100,000 or so deployed troops, Grinston said, “the requests for deployment-based promotions would be a lot higher.”

For pregnancy and postpartum circumstances, no such requests existed before.

In addition to deployments and pregnancy-related profiles, the policy also benefits senior NCOs enrolled in the non-resident Sergeants Major Academy, Grinston said. “So now non-resident master sergeants won’t have to wait to be promoted with their peers.”

Under the new policy, temporary promotions for senior NCOs will be based on non-resident course enrollment through graduation, following graduation of the resident course, to ensure they are eligible for promotion alongside their peers.

This will allow non-resident master sergeants to complete their course, while remaining eligible for promotion.

If a Soldier promoted with a temporary promotion is unable to attain their PME, like the Basic Leader Course, by the specified date indicated on their promotion order by either not attending or failing altogether, then they will be reduced to their former grade, he said.

If a Soldier is reduced to their previous grade, it doesn’t mean they will owe all the pay netted during their temporary promotion, Clark said. Their former rank will be restored with their original date of rank and effective date.

The updated policy is consistent with previously established changes for deployed Soldiers in the sergeant first class and master sergeant ranks, who, like with the latest changes, can be promoted if fully qualified on a fiscal 2021 order of merit list but lack the required PME.

Although the change comes amid an increasing number of new recruits, the SMA said, the change is less about keeping pace with a growing Army and more in-line with its top priority of placing people first.

At the end of the day, Grinston said, the temporary promotions are another way to “have the policies in place to allow our people to progress” through the ranks.

WASHINGTON -- Lily Palfrey knows her father's job is to look after his Soldiers, and she wanted to help him do just that.

Her father, Army 1st Sgt. Frank Palfrey, is the senior enlisted advisor for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade.

A year before her father deployed, Lily began planning to send care packages to each of the Soldiers in her father's company as part of a 4-H project (4-H is a youth development organization.)

Starting in September 2019, Lily collected donations, raised funds for shipping, held packing events, created 154 packages (24 more than her original goal), completed customs forms and created shipping labels with each Soldier's name on it.

Frank Palfrey who is the senior enlisted advisor for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, organized 154 care packages to be sent to her father's deployed unit.

She had to work with various people and organizations to get enough to send to all the Soldiers. When she found out some items couldn't be shipped, she donated them to veteran homeless shelters in her local area.

When the COVID-19 pandemic arose, Lily was forced to create a COVID-19 mitigation plan. This plan included a virtual presentation, which included videos from other military kids talking about what it was like to have a parent deployed.

Soldiers received the packages at their various locations in the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade's area of operations in the Middle East in October.

HHC mailroom clerks were awarded challenge coins for their efforts sorting and distributing all the packages to Headquarters and Headquarters Company Soldiers.

WASHINGTON -- The Army Talent Management Task Force will conduct a prototype of the Sergeants Major Assessment Program (SMAP) from November 14 – 18, 2020 at Fort Knox, Ky.

In conjunction with the Battalion Commander Assessment Program (BCAP) for Fiscal Year 2022, 32 sergeants major will participate in the prototype program.

The participants are under consideration in the Command Sergeant Major/Sergeant Major Evaluation Board for selection to battalion command sergeant major positions. The prototype program is voluntary and the results are non-binding.

BCAP FY21, which debuted earlier this year, assessed 750 officers who were competing for battalion command and key billets. The program incorporated a series of assessments, peer and subordinate feedback, an interview with an operational psychologist, and a double-blind panel interview. The results of BCAP helped the Army determine which officers demonstrated readiness for battalion command.

The sergeant major participants will take a series of assessments in line with the officer experience during the Command Assessment Program. This includes the collection of self, peer, and subordinate feedback, an APFT, cognitive and non-cognitive assessments, and an interview with an operational psychologist. The prototype will culminate in a double-blind interview between sergeants major participants and a panel consisting of nominative command sergeants major and senior commissioned officers.

BCAP FY22, is set to select officers for battalion command and key lieutenant colonel billets in fiscal year 2022. This is the second BCAP and comes two months after the Army’s first Colonels Command Assessment Program which selected officers who will command brigades and fill key general staff positions.

By the end of BCAP FY22, more than 1,800 majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels will have gone through one of the three command assessment programs. This year, BCAP will include officers from the Army Acquisition Corps. The Air Force and the Navy will also send officers to the program to help determine the suitability of a command assessment program for their respective services.

The Army Talent Management Task Force held the first Battalion Commander Assessment Program at Fort Knox in January 2020. The principals identified through the BCAP represent officers who possess higher potential for continued service and are more physically fit, better communicators and less toxic. A board of senior officers, brigadier generals and colonels, determined whether each officer was ready for command or not yet ready. During the first BCAP, 90 officers were determined not yet ready for command and 660 officers were slated as principals and alternates.

An officer’s selection as a principal or alternate for battalion command is based on the Centralized Selection List board ranking and their performance at the BCAP. When compared to the legacy Centralized Select List process, the BCAP resulted in a 34 percent change in officers chosen for command and key billets. Out of the 436 officers chosen for command and key billets, 26 legacy principals declined to participate in BCAP, 25 legacy principals were found not ready for command, and 99 legacy alternates moved up to become principals.

In September 2020, the Army conducted the first Colonels Command Assessment Program (CCAP) to determine readiness for command and strategic potential among officers eligible for O-6 level command and general staff positions. Results from the CCAP are forthcoming.

Since the Army began adopting transformational changes to the management of the Officers Corps, there has been a demand to apply lessons learned to new talent management programs for the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps. Other talent management initiatives in the preliminary stages of development for NCOs include the Army Talent Alignment Process and the First Sergeant Talent Alignment Assessment.

Dominate the information environment with weaponized truth

FORT HOOD, Texas -- In an overview into the contested information environment in Iraq and Syria, Col. Myles B. Caggins III will lead a Warrior’s Corner discussion with questions and answers at this year’s virtual Association of the United States Army 2020 Annual Meeting and Exposition Oct. 15, 1:15 p.m.

Caggins, who just returned to Texas from serving as the spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve, will discuss the information challenges faced by the 77-nation Coalition fighting to destroy ISIS, from not just terrorist organizations and state sponsors of terror, but major powers and occasionally, allies.

“It’s about relentless engagement,” said Caggins. “Dominate the information environment with weaponized truth. I want our adversaries to react to what we are doing.”

Caggins will also discuss some of the techniques developed by CJTF-OIR to cut through language and technological barriers and combat active enemy influence and disinformation operations.

To connect with audiences, the U.S.-led Coalition worked with security partner spokespersons in Iraq and Syria and often conducted press conferences and engagements in Northeastern Syria, Suleimani, Erbil, Kirkuk, Al Asad, and many other locations, working with Arabic, Kurdish, and Western media.

“The core audience was those who were affected by ISIS, and those threatened by ISIS or security forces fighting ISIS,” said Caggins. “We tried to inform and inspire, without offending anyone.”

The discussion includes critical questions for military leaders on the culture of communication, training, resourcing, and competing to win in the public information environment.

Maj. Gabriela S. Thompson, past Coalition media outreach officer, will participate in the discussion.

Those interested in participating in the discussion need to register with AUSA.

WASHINGTON -- Based on the current conditions in Afghanistan, the Defense Department expects there will be fewer than 5,000 U.S. military service members in that country by the end of November, said David F. Helvey, who is currently performing the duties of assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs.

""We've long maintained that our force presence in Afghanistan is conditions-based,"" said Helvey during testimony today before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, national security subcommittee. ""This August, the president [decided] that the conditions of Afghanistan were sufficient to reduce our force presence to between 4,000 and 5,000 by the end of November 2020.""

At that force level, Helvey said, the U.S. maintains an ability to conduct the core aspects of its existing missions in Afghanistan. One of those missions is to participate in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission, which is focused on training, advising and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. The U.S. also conducts a counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan that works with partners to mitigate terrorist threats there.

Right now, there are no orders to reduce the force presence any further, Helvey said, though there is planning to draw down to zero troops in Afghanistan by May 2021. But those plans can't be implemented unless the conditions of an agreement with the Taliban are met, he said.

""As [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo] said in Doha, the Taliban must uphold their counterterrorism guarantees to the United States,"" Helvey said. ""We also expect the Taliban to meaningfully participate in Afghan peace negotiations, and to do their part in preventing outside actors from negatively impacting the peace process.""

In late February of this year, the U.S. and the Taliban signed an agreement that includes, eventually, the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Since the signing of that agreement, the U.S. has reduced forces to 8,600. Part of that agreement also requires the Taliban to agree to no longer allow its members, or other groups, to use Afghanistan as a location from which to threaten the security of the United States or its allies.

Since the signing of that agreement on February 29, Helvey said, no U.S. military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan.

""Ultimately, what we want to be able to see in Afghanistan, is an enduring peace,"" Helvey said. ""In that type of environment ... the terrorist organizations, terrorist groups, will not be able to operate, will not be able to plan, will not be present. That's the focus, and we're looking to get the Taliban to adhere to its commitments.""

WASHINGTON -- Americans regard the National Guard as a United States-based force, but, in truth, it's hard to go anywhere in the world and not see a soldier wearing an Army National Guard patch.

Over the past few months, there were 77,000 Army Guardsmen and over 100,000 National Guardsmen on duty, Army Lt. Gen. Jon A. Jensen, director of the Army National Guard, said during an interview.

There are 335,000 Army National Guard soldiers in the 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia. Today, there are more than 22,000 Army National Guardsmen deployed as part of the warfighting mission for the joint force. This has been consistent since the early 2000s, the general said. ""As you look into the future, you know, we're going to continue to do that as the combat reserve of the Army and as an operational reserve,"" he said. ""But we'll also simultaneously always be that response back home, as well.""

The National Guard has personnel deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, Djibouti, Europe, the Pacific, Guantanamo and many other countries. State guardsmen also maintain contacts with many foreign militaries under the State Partnership Program.

But over the past months of this year, the National Guard has been ubiquitous: helping medical authorities combat COVID-19; working with civilian authorities to fight fires throughout the West; helping communities hit by weather events; and helping calm areas wracked by violence.

Early on, the guard was used to help civil authorities against COVID-19. ""We've still got over 18,500 Guardsmen in support of COVID-19 response with more than 15,000 of them from the Army Guard,"" Jensen said. ""I think we'll continue to do that mission, obviously, until the pandemic's over.""

To date, guardsmen have administered more than 8 million COVID-19 tests. They're also helping in long-term care facilities.

""Our logistics effort has been amazing, as well, with over 350 million meals that have been delivered and 12,000 tons of bulk food,"" he said.

When the virus first hit, there were concerns about medical facility space. Guardsmen worked with the Army Corps of Engineers to create alternate care facilities in major cities. ""Ultimately, we built a 15,000-bed capability that didn't exist prior to the pandemic,"" Jensen said.

The Guard has also been involved in contact tracing. That is, identifying those positive for COVID-19, then contacting those who had been in close proximity of the person with the positive case.

These missions will continue, and the guard will probably be called upon to help once a vaccine is developed and deemed safe. Jensen was clear that the guard has not been asked to do anything yet, but prudent planning requires consideration. The guard, with its all-terrain vehicles and helicopter assets, could help transport the vaccine to hard-to-reach places. Guard personnel could also help with the actual administration of the vaccine, if called upon.

""We all know that the key to this thing is going to be getting a vaccine and then getting the vaccine out to the population,"" the general said. ""We will be ready to do whatever is asked.""

And the guard is doing all sorts of other missions to support fellow citizens. The Army National Guard is actively engaged in fighting 76 wildfires in the West. This year is on track to be the worst fire season since 2003, officials said. In California alone, more than 900 National Guard personnel are helping state authorities and firefighting crews. Guard aviators rescued 159 civilians and are battling 23 fires that have burned nearly 2 million acres.

Guardsmen are also helping in Colorado, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Idaho and Utah. They are working on 53 fires that have charred over 830,000 acres.

The year is tough. In fiscal 2018, guardsmen helped with wildland fire suppression operations for 26 fires. Last year, it was for 12 fires.

The hurricane season is also at its height. There are still more than 3,000 soldiers in Louisiana and Texas helping the states recover from Hurricane Laura. Now, Hurricane Sally is threatening the Gulf Coast.

The guard also has about 2,000 soldiers supporting the Southwest border mission. ""And that mission will grow,"" Jensen said.

The National Guard was also called upon to help in the disturbances following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Jensen — who was the adjutant general of Minnesota before taking his current job — said he also noticed the calming effect of the guardsmen. ""I think the National Guard has gained a tremendous amount of public trust and confidence due to our overseas deployments,"" he said.

Tyrone Williams) VIEW ORIGINAL

He also noted that guardsmen have been prominent in the COVID-19 response and other high-profile civil support missions dating to Hurricane Katrina. ""Whether it's hurricanes or wildfires or ice storms or COVID-19, I think there is just a great amount of awareness and appreciation for what the guard has been doing since 9-11, and what the guard has continued to do,"" Jensen said.

The final piece of that puzzle is the guard as part of the communities they serve. ""We're in over 2,600 communities across the country,"" he said. ""In Minnesota … our little motto [is] 'We live here. We work here. We serve here.' There's just a very strong community connection to the National Guard, and that when we come, we arrive in a non-threatening way. And I think I think that has been appreciated. And I think people have responded to that.""

WASHINGTON -- The June 3 revision of Army Regulation 600-8-10, which covers leaves and passes, is part of the largest update to Army military leave policy in more than a decade, said Larry Lock, chief of Compensation and Entitlements for the Army’s G-1 office.

“The new regulation encompasses recent changes in leave and passes, rearranges the sections to make it more user friendly, clarifies policy, and covers the new leave forms,” he said. “It also aligns the terminology more closely with” Defense Department Instruction 1327.06, or Leave and Liberty Policy and Procedures.

The result is a regulation that is more comprehensive and will reduce confusion, especially for Soldiers working in joint environments, he said.

The DOD Instruction covers leave and liberty procedures and sets a blueprint so the Army can be uniform with the other military services. Based on input from Soldiers, the Army took the opportunity to improve the Department of Army Form 31, or Request and Authority for Leave, and the DA Form 4179, or Leave Log.

“We’re an all-volunteer force since 1973, and to sustain our force we want to take care of our people,” Lock said. “One way to do that is to streamline the process for requesting leave, and enhance morale by encouraging Soldiers to take time off.”

Updated leave forms

Last updated in 1993, the time to update the leave form had come, he said, especially with so many changes to the regulation.

“To be a more usable form given changes in the types of leave, the Army updated the DA Form 31 to make sure commanders and Soldiers clearly understand what type of leave was chargeable and what type was non-chargeable,” Lock said. “Soldiers, Army leaders and commanders need to keep track of leave, for personnel reasons and for audit purposes.”

In other words, depending on the types of absence Soldiers request, they can now more clearly distinguish it as chargeable or non-chargeable on the leave form. Soldier feedback resulted in larger Leave Address, Remarks and Organizational Address fields. While it is not required by regulation, Soldiers can now enter three or more addresses where they expect to stay while on leave.

“We now have an improved process, and that has improved the DA Form 31,” Lock said.

The DA Form 4179, Leave Log, was also updated to help personnelists track the absences requested, approved or disapproved for Soldiers in their organizations.

Both the new DA Form 31 and the new DA Form 4179 are available on the Army Publishing Division website. All Soldiers are encouraged to always download the latest versions of the forms as improvements will continue to be made.

Parental leave

While new parents have been able to take advantage of the military parental leave policy, or MPLP, since last year. The revised AR 600-8-10 includes the MPLP, and further explains the policy. The leave policy associated with childbirth can be somewhat confusing, and the revised regulation helps Soldiers navigate through the different leaves, Lock said.

There are three different types of leave associated with the birth of a child: maternity convalescent leave, primary caregiver leave, and secondary caregiver leave.

New birthparents are authorized 42 days of maternity convalescent leave upon release from the hospital or birthing center. As this is convalescent leave, it is non-chargeable.

The primary caregiver, as designated by the Soldier, is authorized 42 days of non-chargeable primary caregiver leave that must be taken within 12 months of qualifying birth events, but it does not all have to be taken in a continuous block.

The secondary caregiver is authorized 21 days of non-chargeable secondary caregiver leave, which also needs to be used within 12 months of the qualifying birth and is not required to be taken in a continuous block. The regulation has full details and covers exceptions to the normal leaves.

Much of the MPLP was already in place and has not changed since last year’s policy, Lock said.

The Army is striving to help troops better understand their benefits, especially the young Soldiers who make up the majority of new Army parents, he added.

Previously, a parental leave of only 10 non-chargeable days was available for non-birthparents, and had to be used within 45 days after the birth. Now, secondary caregivers leave is a very significant leave change in support of family quality of life.

Other leave issues

Soldiers may request a non-chargeable absence to assist at major events for Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and similar groups. This was previously authorized by AR 600-8-10, but it now falls under an umbrella category that supports participants in competitive sporting and other events.

“The military is pretty arduous duty. Soldiers earn 30 days of paid leave per year, beginning with their first year on the job. No other American industry out there comes close to that,” Lock said. He suggests that all Soldiers should often check their leave balance.

“Every month Soldiers have the personal responsibility to verify the accuracy of their leave and earnings statements, which shows their balance, the amount of leave they used during the current fiscal year, and the number of leave days they will lose if they don't take it before the end of the fiscal year,” he said.

For eligible Soldiers, the Remarks section, beginning on Oct. 31 will state the maximum leave they can carry over at the end of the fiscal year, and when the ability to carry more than 60 days will expire. This should be checked every month, because leave usage affects the carry-over amount. Soldiers should not rely on Special Leave Accrual, which is restricted to a very limited number of cases and review at the Department of the Army level.

One of the biggest leave problems, Lock said, is getting Soldiers to take their leave.

“Soldiers are very dedicated to their jobs, to the point that they are reluctant to take leave,” he said. “It is good to know that they are really dedicated, but they also need to make their own well-being and their Families a priority. This will contribute to improved performance and increased motivation when back at work.

“At the end of the day, it’s up to Soldiers to track their leave,” he added. “It is a commander’s role to grant time off, when possible, but it is still the responsibility of every Soldier to manage their own leave.”

Commanders are responsible for having an effective annual leave program that provides Soldiers with the opportunity to take leave, to include an extended leave, during the year, operational requirements permitting.

AL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar (AFNS) --In a joint endeavor to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces and the people of Lebanon after a deadly explosion in Beirut, U.S. Airmen and Soldiers stationed in Qatar worked to load the first U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III with humanitarian aid, Aug. 6.

Personnel from the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, Air Mobility Command’s 8th Expeditionary Air Mobility Squadron and 816th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron on Al Udeid Air Base, and the Area Support Group-Qatar from Camp As Sayliyah worked to palletize food, water and medical supplies delivered to Beirut later that day.

“Support of this magnitude at such speed wouldn’t be possible without the joint effort of all members of Al Udeid Air Base, our U.S. Army counterparts at Camp As Sayliyah and our gracious Qatari partners,” said Brig. Gen. Daniel Tulley, 379th Air Expeditionary Wing commander. “In the wake of tragedy, it truly takes a combined effort to make the mission happen. We do this every day in Qatar, and that’s exactly what we are doing in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces.”

Soldiers from the ASG-Qatar at Camp As Sayliyah packed and loaded 11 pallets of humanitarian aid, which contained more than 28,800 military field rations, known as MRE or meals ready to eat, 11,520 bottles of water and two pallets of medical supplies and transported them to Al Udeid Air Base with support of a local Qatari transport company.

“In short notice, ASG-Qatar assembled Soldiers and limited contract support to quickly palletize 11 pallets to be flight-worthy; consisting of water, MREs and medical supplies,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Pura, ASG-Qatar director of logistics. “(I’m) truly grateful to the Soldiers and civilians who stepped up to support the mission. I appreciate our Air Force personnel support from AUAB, it’s nice to see a combined effort from all.”

Upon their arrival to Al Udeid, the pallets were received by Airmen from the 8th EAMS, and processed for loading onto a C-17 bound for Beirut.

“At a moment’s notice, our mobility Airmen and the global air mobility support system stand ready to take action in tough situations like the explosion in Beirut,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Nicholas Lee, 8th EAMS commander. “The 8th EAMS is proud to be able to answer the call to support the Lebanese Armed Forces and help those in need of supplies with rapid global mobility.”

(Photo Credit: Courtesy Photo, Defense Commissary Agency) VIEW ORIGINAL

FORT LEE, Va. – Commissaries worldwide are now selling reusable and disposable protective masks, the Defense Commissary Agency’s director of sales announced.

Two brands of masks, one reusable and the other disposable, became available to most stores worldwide in late June, said Tracie Russ, the agency’s director of sales. Commissaries in Hawaii are selling a reusable mask from a local supplier.

“The safety of our customers and employees is a top priority for the commissaries,” Russ said. “Providing these masks for purchase is one of many protective measures we’re taking to help reduce exposure to COVID-19.”

The following brands and types of masks are available for purchase in commissaries:

Hanes: 10-pack, reusable, adult size, 3-ply 100-percent cotton, washable up to 20 times

Midwesttrading: KN95 1-pack disposable mask and a 10-pack, 4-ply mask, fit adjustable, inner layer contains air filter

Puna Noni: (available only in Hawaii commissaries), reusable, 3-ply cotton/poly shell, removable felt filter

“Commissaries are selling masks to meet our customers’ needs, especially during this pandemic,” said LaRue Smith, a category manager. “We don’t want our customers taking an extra shopping trip for something they can get in their commissary and at a lower price.

“There is an expectation that the supplies will be plentiful in the future,” Smith said, “but at this time we ask our customers to limit their purchase to only what they will need so that the supply will be available for all of our customers.”

Since April 6, commissaries have required some form of face covering for their store employees, to comply with the April 5 Department of Defense directive mandating that standard for anyone entering military facilities.

By April 10, commissaries expanded the face covering requirement to include customers or anyone else entering a commissary. The DeCA guidance does not supersede the existing installation policies. It applies to all agency stores and other facilities worldwide where no local directive has yet been issued.

Since the start of the outbreak, most retail stores experienced a run on anything resembling personal protective equipment. In those days, the closest that agency stores had for PPE were disposable gloves.

Through May, glove sales increased by nearly 32 percent. In addition to sales of masks, commissaries have also increased its volume of disposable gloves and hand sanitizers.

Army Lt. Col. Angela Parham, DeCA’s director of health and safety, reminds customers that wearing PPE is only one part of the preventive measures required to help combat COVID-19.

“DOD’s face covering mandate aligns with CDC guidance to help prevent asymptomatic people, who may not know they’re infected, from spreading the virus to others,” Parham said. “Even when you wear a mask or other face covering, it is still important to practice good hand hygiene, social distancing and refrain from touching your face.”

Commissary customers should continue to refer to the federal government’s response to coronavirus, COVID-19 website and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Coronavirus site for updates and guidance regarding this virus. Updates related to the commissaries can be found on DeCA’s Coronavirus page.

Not rain, snow, sleet, extreme heat or even COVID-19 can stop the mail.

""There are 58 mailrooms here on [Camp] Arifjan alone,"" Army Staff Sgt. Robert Harris, the mail operations noncommissioned officer in charge for Task Force Spartan, said. ""We alone are responsible for 1,300 people.""

Harris and his team start their day at 8 a.m. and play a critical role in getting the mail to service members and civilians who serve Task Force Spartan, among other organizations.

""We start our day picking up the mail from the main mailroom,"" Harris said. ""The main mailroom sorts things out by the smaller mailrooms we have on post. Then we come and pick it up to sort it out by person.""

""When we arrive to pick up the mail, we never know how much there will be — could be just a few packages or over 200 packages,"" he continued. ""There was a short time when COVID really started shutting things down, and we didn't see much coming in, but that was a very short time.""

COVID-19 has affected the world and changed the way many businesses operate, so it comes as no surprise that it would affect mail delivery also.

""COVID only slowed down mail for a short time, maybe a week or so,"" Harris said. ""Getting mail to service members and contractors is of the utmost importance, especially during these times when people look forward to packages from home or something they've ordered like a book to help pass downtime.""

Receiving mail can help boost morale not only for service members and civilians overseas, but also for friends and family members who get mail from loved ones abroad.

""Sorting the amount of mail we receive sometimes can become overwhelming,"" Harris said. ""We have had to shut down the mailroom twice since being here. We never want to make that call, but when we get over five or six bins full of mail, it can be very difficult to get it sorted in time for pickup that day.""

There can be many reasons for mail to be delayed, especially due to the restrictions during a worldwide pandemic.

""Mail may be delayed sometimes, but my team and I make sure that when we get things in, we process it and update the roster as quickly as possible,"" Harris said. ""With so many things closed down because of COVID-19, mail is one of the few morale-boosting things left.""

Harris and his team work hard every day to make sure service members and civilians get their mail.

""At the end of the day, we are here to make sure people are getting their mail with as little delay as possible,"" Harris said. ""For some getting a letter or package from home can turn a bad day or week around.""

The soldiers of Task Force Spartan are being led by the New York Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division. The mission is a unique, multi-component organization, made up of active Army and National Guard units, rounded out by Army Reserve support units.

Through Operation Spartan Shield, Task Force Spartan maintains a U.S. military posture in Southwest Asia sufficient to strengthen defense relationships and build partner capacity.

WASHINGTON -- More than 200 enlisted Soldiers serving throughout the Middle East and Africa were slated to travel to Kuwait for the Army's Basic Leader Course in March. Then the military banned nonessential travel in response to the increasing threat of COVID-19.

""I found out I wasn't going to BLC the day I was leaving,"" said Army Sgt. Robert M. Raitano, the noncommissioned officer in charge of intelligence with the 207th Regional Support Group. ""My bags were packed.""

The three-week course is crucial for young Soldiers. It is the first official step in learning how to be a noncommissioned officer, and the class is required before they can be promoted to sergeant. Even if personnel can get a waiver while on deployment, they still are required to attend the school when they return to the United States.

Some Soldiers had waited for years for the opportunity to take the course. Army Sgt. Aquenda R. Roundtree, the operations noncommissioned officer in charge with the 248th Area Support Medical Company, said she had been trying to go to the school since 2017, but her transfers among various Georgia National Guard units derailed those efforts. The latest cancellation promised another long delay.

""I was, like, 'Wow – again?'"" she said, ""because they kept pushing it back.""

In April, the NCO Leadership Center of Excellence delivered a solution: an online version of the class supplemented by instructors stationed at each base. Despite the course being primarily online, the students were still required to lead physical fitness training while maintaining social distancing requirements.

The students' units provided the assistant instructors. At Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, the 207th Regional Support Group and the 248th Area Support Medical Company combined efforts to create a class for five students. Army Staff Sgt. Heather Bojarski, a small group leader with the U.S. Central Command NCO Academy at Camp Buehring, said other participants were spread throughout more than a half-dozen countries – all reporting back to the school in Kuwait.

The assistant instructors at Al Asad attempted to recreate a school environment as much as possible. They reserved a meeting room and had internet connections installed so the students could train together. The NCOs scheduled physical training sessions in the morning prior to classes and had the students march to meals together to practice drill and ceremonies.

""I was thinking we'd just be sitting there online all the time,"" Roundtree said. ""I didn't expect everything that happened.""

During class hours, students regularly responded to questions and reacted to each other's discussion points using their laptops. Outside of class, they had to prepare written papers and a public speaking presentation. Roundtree, who was the first student to serve as class leader, helped ingrain the standards and common procedures their group followed throughout.

""We always tried to stay ahead of the game,"" she said. ""Everyone was held accountable so nobody fell behind.""

Raitano, who said he originally joined the military five years ago with no specific goals in mind, said the class helped him clarify his understanding of leadership, followership and what kind of person he wants to be. He zeroed in on servant leadership, particularly after helping classmates with the required school tasks.

""It took constant hours of practice and preparation,"" he said. ""Being able to see results from that was very inspiring.""

Teamwork became essential as the students aided each other in their studies and practices for the practical exams. Students gathered after class hours to work on drills.

""We never really had a moment where we feuded or didn't agree with each other,"" Raitano said. ""We came together fairly well.""

Both Raitano and Roundtree, similar to others in their class, received their promotion to sergeant shortly after graduating.

""There were a lot of things I didn't know,"" Raitano said of the lessons he learned from the classes. ""There are things I will pick up and use in my day-to-day life.""

From her office in Kuwait, Bojarski said the remote class program has continued to be successful. According to the school, out of 201 students in the first class, 193 graduated in May. The second class started in June.

""I liked the challenge,"" she said of the emergency BLC. ""I liked that it tapped our resiliency….and it pushed me to think outside the box.""

The unique situation has led to the innovative use of technology in some cases. When one of the students was having trouble passing their physical resilience training drills, the assistant instructor used a video call to contact Bojarski and let her watch for issues.

""I could actually see what the sergeant was doing,"" she said.

Likewise, in subsequent BLC classes the school increased its use of the online Defense Collaboration System, which has increased the small-group leaders' ability to communicate with remote students every day.

""It made me more accessible to them,"" she said, noting it allowed them to problem solve together. ""That's what we're here for.""

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait -- Even a pandemic like COVID-19 cannot stop the Army from developing and training its future enlisted leaders, and the Emergency Basic Leaders Course in Kuwait made sure of that.

Deployed Soldiers in the next generation of Army enlisted leaders were able to complete the Basic Leaders Course in Kuwait without having to go back to the United States for classes or delay their promotion eligibility.

The newest graduating class included more than 40 Soldiers from Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, with about 120 more from throughout the U.S. Army Central Command area of responsibility.

""This is your first developmental class; hopefully, you'll have plenty more,"" Army Maj. Gen. Steven Ferrari, the commander of Task Force Spartan Shield and the Infantry Division, told the latest graduates.

Enlisted Soldiers must take many courses as they progress through the Army's ranks. Completing the Basic Leaders Course is the first step in that progression, and it gives future enlisted leaders a glimpse at what it takes to become a noncommissioned officer and what it takes to lead other Soldiers properly.

""As you progress through your career, you will go to many courses, but none will be as unique as this one,"" Ferrari said. ""It gives you an overview on how to lead, but everyone will develop their own style in how to lead. What you must do in order to become successful in this military is you must be a leader of character, competence and commitment.""

ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. – For many Soldiers and their Families, spring and summer bring not just warmer weather, but new orders and permanent change of station moves. Although COVID-19 concerns have temporarily halted many but the most essential military moves, now is a good time to think about how to keep your current or future residence healthy and minimize housing hazard risks like lead or mold exposure.

“Residents should frequently inspect their homes and report or repair small issues and minor damages before they become major issues and large repairs,” said Vickie Hawkins, an industrial hygienist and chief of the Army Pubic Health Center Industrial Hygiene Field Services Division.

Hawkins and her APHC team provide installation housing managers with support in conducting inspections of Army Family housing, and remotely provide industrial hygiene consultation, report review, sampling interpretation, guidance and support for mold, lead, asbestos, and radon concerns.

Hawkins said the greatest risk for lead hazards in the home are lead paint in pre-1978 housing or if the parent has a hobby or job that involves lead.

Installations and Residential Communities Initiative property landlords must inform all new tenants of Army Family housing what is known about lead-based paint and lead hazards in their units. Installations must also provide residents with the EPA pamphlet Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home.

“In general, lead present in intact paint is not a hazard,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins recommends immediately reporting any paint damage or deterioration for repair. Paint on impact surfaces (windows, window sills, doors) and hand rails have the greatest potential to chip, flake, or create dust.

“Frequently wipe down these surfaces with a wet cloth and clean floors to reduce the potential of exposure to lead in the paint,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins explains paint can also be found on the exterior of the house and in soil around the home.

""Remove shoes or wipe soil off shoes before entering your house if you have concerns over lead in the outside,"" said Hawkins.

If a parent works or is involved in a hobby where they are exposed to lead, change out clothes and shoes before coming into the home, said Hawkins.

“Children are especially susceptible to lead exposure,” said Hawkins. “Talk to your medical provider about blood lead level testing if you have any concerns.”

Residents concerned about mold should focus on controlling moisture, which is the key factor in reducing mold exposure risks, said Hawkins.

“Frequently check your home for signs of leaks and water damage especially around plumbing, doorways, windows, and ceilings,” said Hawkins. “Also inspect your roof for damage. It is important to find the source of any leak or water damage and to make repairs immediately.”

If wet or damp materials are dried within 24-48 hours after a leak or spill happens, mold will not grow in most cases, said Hawkins. Regularly clear exterior drains and gutters on the home to prevent blockages that could cause water to enter the home. Ensure the drain spouts are extended 4 feet away from the house and the ground cover is graded/sloped so that water runs away from the house foundation. Keep air conditioning drip pans clean. When showering, run the bathroom fan or open a window. Use exhaust fans or vent appliances that produce moisture (stoves, dishwashers, clothes dryers, etc.).

For regional areas that may have more humidity or moisture in the air, Hawkins recommends using air conditioners and de-humidifiers when needed.

“It may be tempting to turn off your air conditioning while you are out of the house or on vacation, but in warm humid climates the air conditioning helps keep the humidity down inside your home, which reduces the risk of mold growth,” said Hawkins. “Address any visible mold growth promptly and speak with your medical provider if you are concerned that something in your home is making you sick or otherwise impacting your or your child’s health.”

Hawkins also has a few general recommendations, some of which come from her experience inspecting Army Family housing.

“During inspections, many homes were observed with the clothes dryer vent blocked with debris at the back of the dryer inside the home and at the outside exhaust pipe opening,” said Hawkins.

Hawkins recommends keeping the dryer exhaust free from any debris, including the pest-proofing screens covering these openings. Failure to keep these free from any lint or debris is a potential fire hazard and an efficiency destroyer. Residents should report any conditions related to clogged dryer vents to their housing management office.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recommends housing residents cover electric sockets, childproof cabinets and drawers, and put up gates or close doors where fall hazards are present. Store household chemicals and poisons out of reach of children and away from food, and frequently wipe down and clean children’s toys. Ensuring smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are properly installed is also important.

The APHC has webpages with resources and tips for homeowners in dealing with mold and lead in the home:

The APHC has also created the Housing Environmental Health Response Registry for residents who have any concerns about Army Family housing or related health concerns. They can contact the registry telephone number (1-800-984-8523; overseas DSN: (312) 421-3700) for more information on housing environmental health hazards, assistance seeking medical care for housing-related illnesses and concerns, and to have the U.S. Army Medical Command share their concerns with Army leadership. Contact care representatives are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. More information on the registry can be found at the Housing Environmental Health Response Registry site.

The Army Public Health Center enhances Army readiness by identifying and assessing current and emerging health threats, developing and communicating public health solutions, and assuring the quality and effectiveness of the Army’s Public Health Enterprise.

WASHINGTON -- Soldiers now have an added incentive to choose the personally-procured move, or PPM option, when moving to their next duty stations this summer.

Aside from limiting exposure to COVID-19, a revision to the Defense Department’s Joint Travel Regulations has increased the monetary payment to Soldiers who choose to move their household goods.

From May 26 through Dec. 31, Soldiers using the PPM program can receive a payment equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost the government would pay to move their items. When Soldiers choose the option, they shoulder the cost and responsibility of packing and moving their belongings themselves and the payment compensates them for those expenses.

The PPM program gives Soldiers an alternative to a traditional permanent-change-of-station move, where a government-contracted moving company ships their household goods to their new duty station.

With more Soldiers expected to make PCS moves during the latter part of the peak moving season, an updated policy couldn’t have come at a more opportune time, said Larry Lock, Army compensation and entitlements chief G-1.

While much of the country remains under COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, making a PPM might be the more practical option for some Soldiers and their families, he said. Safety restrictions vary by state and commercial movers will be heavily tasked, he added.

The change could help increase the number of PCS moves in what the Army’s G-4 predicts will be a busier moving season. Moving more Soldiers to their new duty stations helps the Army maintain readiness and meet its global force requirements, said Derrick Candler, chief of Transportation Policy Division, G-4.

“Industry may face challenges to support this huge increase during the summer season,” Candler said. “This initiative can help increase the number of moves to ensure our people can get to their next duty station as quickly as possible. This will have positive effects on the entire Army and DOD. The PPM also reduces the strain on families and moving companies.”

As part of the continued efforts to improve quality of life for its military families, the Defense Travel Management Office had pursued the change to ease the burden of families who prefer the PPM over a traditional move, Lock said. He added that PPM moves typically result in a cost savings for the government and the policy update will pass those savings onto the families.

In April, the DOD signed a $7.2 billion contract with a single company, New Jersey-based American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier Group, to move household goods for the military.

After Dec. 31, Candler said the policy will be re-evaluated in conjunction with each military branch on whether the reimbursable costs will remain at 100 percent or return to 95 percent.

The DOD has made monetary allowance payments of 95 percent for PPMs since 1998 when it bumped the sum up from 80 percent. Candler said that each service must collectively agree to make the change permanent.

“Now, we're hoping based on this change and the moves that take place during the summer, that we can justify continuing this,” he said. “All the services benefit from this increase.”

Lock said typically younger, single Soldiers, or young couples with no children choose the PPM option. Soldiers with more time in service and those with larger families often choose to have their household items shipped by a government contractor.

Also possibly boosting the number of moves this summer is a change to granting exceptions to policy for the COVID-19 stop-move order. Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy delegated approval authority for PCS moves, temporary-duty assignments, and military leave to the first brigadier general or Senior Executive Service officer in a Soldier’s chain of command.

Approval authorities may grant exceptions for Soldiers determined to be mission essential, for changes necessary for humanitarian purposes, and for extreme hardship.

Soldiers who fall under an exception must travel with printed copies of the approved exception to policy. Soldiers exempt from travel restrictions will be required to carry a memorandum signed by their supervisor that states the reason for exemption.

Soldiers and civilians enrolled in military education programs qualify as exempt from travel restrictions and do not require an exception to policy. These programs include officer training and education programs, non-commissioned officer professional development and specialty training programs and civilian training, education and development programs.

WASHINGTON -- Despite some delays in fielding necessary equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Army’s top enlisted leader believes the service will still successfully implement its new Army Combat Fitness Test.

Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael A. Grinston said Thursday he remains optimistic that most units will have the necessary equipment for the test by June, despite the impact of the virus.

Grinston said he has spoken to representatives at U.S. Army Materiel Command and the fielding process remains on schedule.

He also reminded Soldiers to continue physical training sessions from home.

There’s “no excuse not to do PT. And it's always a great opportunity,” he said during an online event, hosted by the Association of the U.S. Army.

Grinston said the ACFT is better suited for physical distancing than its predecessor, the Army Physical Fitness Test, as most of the exercises are done while safely distanced from others.

During the 2-mile run, for instance, a limited number of lanes can be made available to runners and the event does not need to be done in large groups. The hand-release pushups test requires another individual to properly count repetitions, but the tracking person can count at a 6-foot distance.

As of now, both ACFT and APFT requirements are suspended, pending further guidance. Soldiers can use their last APFT score to remain promotion eligible, and the Army extended the expiration dates of previous APFT scores.

When Soldiers eventually take the APFT again, large groups will also be prohibited from running the 2-mile run together. Soldiers counting repetitions on pushups during the APFT must also remain 6 feet apart. While taking the situps test, Soldiers can now use a heavy bar to hold their feet down instead of having another Soldier hold their knees, Grinston said.

“Do I think we're confident when we start the ACFT that we can do it given the conditions of a COVID-19 environment? Absolutely,” Grinston said.

Soldiers will also be required to wipe down each piece of exercise equipment with sanitizer after completing the corresponding test.

“If you touch the bar for your max deadlift, you wipe the bar down and then you move on to the next station,” Grinston said.

Virtual transition

Grinston lauded the efforts of Army recruiters who have turned to using online tools to contact potential recruits. He said recruiters have used tools that include FaceTime to secure contracts and commitments from recruits. He said that he still expects the service to meet its end-strength goals by the end of the fiscal year.

The Army started changing its recruiting strategy by loosening restrictions on social media use for recruiters and establishing an esports team. The service also established virtual recruiting stations. Grinston said many recruiters have adapted to using the virtual space so well, that he expects recruiters to continue to use online tools after the pandemic has passed.

“We really got ahead of this about a year ago when we started doing different marketing or doing things in the digital space that really led us up to [COVID-19 stay-at-home orders],” Grinston said. “And so when we did the brick and mortar closures, we already had some of the digital recruiting going on. Some of the recruiters just really took off.”

(Photo Credit: Sgt. Steven Lewis) VIEW ORIGINAL

POINT MUGU, Calif. -- The Army is hunting for top talent to fill the ranks of specialized units for multi-domain operations, following the first one standing up last year in Washington state.

In 2019, a mixture of the Army’s space, cyber, and electronic warfare capabilities was activated as a cohesive unit called the Intelligence, Information, Cyber, Electronic Warfare, and Space Battalion -- or simply I2CEWS.

The battalion has become “the centerpiece of the Multi-Domain Task Force,” Gen. John M. Murray, commander of U.S. Army Futures Command, said Tuesday during the Association of Old Crows virtual EMS Summit.

Located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, the battalion combines non-lethal Army capabilities with kinetic capabilities, such as missile defense. The I2CEWS operates in support of U.S. Army Pacific, and AFC has “plans to stand up more as we begin to experiment with this formation,” Murray said.

The Multi-Domain Task Force is a model of how the Army envisions joint-warfighting on future battlefields against near-peer competitors, like Russia and China. Before the Army activates additional formations, though, Murray said it will first need the right talent to fill the ranks.

“The No. 1 thing is finding talent, and I'm convinced we have some of that talent already in our ranks,” Murray said. “And we're going to have to go into our recruiting pools to find some of that talent. The Army is already beginning to explore innovative ways in talent management.”

Some innovative talent management programs include the Assignment Interactive Module 2.0, or AIM 2.0. The information system is a way for officers to build detailed resumes and take part in a market-style hiring system for their next assignments as organizations post specific positions they are looking to fill.

Talent management will also be part of the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army, or IPPS-A, a web-based human resources system already adopted by the National Guard, that will soon integrate the Army's personnel, pay and talent management functions into one secure web-based application.

Much like how traditional battlefields will change under the information age, the Army will also recruit talent differently. For example, Murray explained, “Thirty-eight years ago, when I was offered a four-year Army ROTC scholarship, they couldn’t care less what I majored in.

“So, I picked the easiest major I could find,” he admitted. But today “we’re offering [cadets] a six-year scholarship to come out with a degree the Army needs, and if they can’t meet our requirements, then they’re not going to join the Army.”

Carson, CO and Sg.t Carl Higgins of the Intelligence, Information, Cyber, Electronic Warfare and Space, or I2CEWS, formation from Joint Base Lewis McCord, WA, detect and mitigate adversarial radio signals during Cyber Blitz 19.

The Army has taken other steps to attract and keep cyber talent, such as hosting cyber hackathons, boosting pay and incentives, and direct commissioning.

But “the most attractive way to retain our cyber warriors is the thrill of the mission. To be honest, [cyber warriors] are doing things they could not do outside the Army without spending time in jail,” Murray said, regarding cyber warfare missions.

Cyber warriors direct and conduct integrated electronic warfare, information, and cyberspace actions. They are responsible for the aggressive defense of Army networks, data infrastructure, and cyber weapons systems.

For Murray, who is responsible for leading a team of more than 24,000 Soldiers and civilians in the Army's modernization enterprise, helping shape the Army’s future force is personal.

The four-star talked about his eight grandchildren, especially one granddaughter who, he believes, will one day be ""an infantry commander wearing airborne and Ranger tabs."" It’s her generation he’s working for, he said, not “old Soldiers like me.”

Murray wasn’t the only one with that mindset.

“I use some of the same equipment my father used, and my nephews are now flying some of the same equipment that I flew,” said Lt. Gen. Neil Thurgood, director of hypersonics, directed energy, space, and rapid acquisition.

“We need our grandchildren to fly new and modernized equipment as we continue to go forward,” Thurgood added. “So to those of us that have aged a little bit in the process of our careers, it is personal, because we spent that time with our Soldiers, and we spent that time with our families.”

In the end, that's really what AFC and “the whole team, to include our acquisition partners, brings to our Army, delivering solutions that our Soldiers need when they need it,” Murray said.

“This is about our kids and our grandkids that will defend this great nation going into the future,” he added. “That's really what personalizes this mission for me, and that's a heavy rucksack to carry.”

FORT MEADE, Md. -- Security force assistance brigade Soldiers from the first-ever team to operate in Africa spoke of their recent mission Wednesday in training Senegalese soldiers on logistics support.

The discussion was part of a recruiting push to add more qualified Soldiers to the Army’s six SFABs, which are still hiring using virtual assessments and bonuses worth nearly $60,000 for in-demand career fields.

SFABs have previously deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, the latter of which is where the 4th SFAB will deploy this fall to replace the 3rd SFAB.

Upcoming missions will also include counter-narcotics advising in the U.S. Southern Command region, as well as others in the Indo-Pacific region and back to Africa, said Lt. Col. Kevin Field, the SFAB recruiting team lead, during a livestream on Facebook.

The SFAB mission is a re-focused train, assist and advise strategy that envisioned the specialized units in hotspots around the world.

Since they serve as permanent organizations, the units provide a more concerted effort than previous ad hoc advise and train formations, while also freeing up conventional brigade combat teams and Special Forces units.

“With the Army standing up the SFABs, it allows us to professionalize the delivery of the security assistance mission, because we have a dedicated force,” Field said. “That’s all they do. It also helps us preserve the readiness of our BCTs to respond to worldwide contingencies.”

African mission

In the first mission outside U.S. Central Command, the 1st SFAB’s Logistics Advisor Team 1610 traveled to Senegal in March to instruct its military personnel in preventative maintenance, vehicle recovery and motor pool operations.

While the training went well, team members said, the location still presented them with an unusual work environment.

Due to the reduced U.S. military presence in Africa, the team had limited tactical communications and quality medical facilities available to them, while they also had to work out of a hotel for three weeks.

“A deployment on the continent of Africa is much different than what most of us have experienced through deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq and brings about different challenges, especially for a small team,” said Maj. Michael Pachucki, the team leader.

One of the highlights for Staff Sgt. Braxton Pernice, the team’s maintenance advisor, was the vehicle recovery portion of the training.

It allowed the Senegalese soldiers “to put hands on their equipment and get familiar with how to utilize their recovery trucks,” he said. “Overall, it was a great training event and we learned a lot from them as well as they learned a lot from us.”

Pachucki, who also deployed with the 1st SFAB to Afghanistan in 2018, said his assignment with the brigade has been one of his most rewarding in his 15-year career.

“What I will promise you if you come to an SFAB,” he said, “is the opportunity to grow personally and professionally, work with great people, and receive individual and professional training opportunities not often seen in other units.”

Promotions, bonuses

Not only do SFABs have a unique mission, they also had higher promotion rates than other Army units last year, Field said.

Enlisted promotion rates from sergeant first class through sergeant major at SFABs ranged from 33% to 65%, compared to about 17% to 41% across the Army. On the officer side, promotion rates from major through colonel at SFABs ranged from 79% to 89%, compared to 21% to 67%.

“I will tell you that most of those individuals, they’re going to be promoted with or without SFAB in their files, because we are hiring highly-qualified individuals,” Field said. “That’s also another way the SFAB helps you get promoted, because you are being exposed to some of the top NCOs and officers in our Army from various [military occupational specialties].”

Some of the slots that SFABs are currently looking to fill include: military intelligence (35 series); unit supply specialist (92Y), fire support specialist (13F), signal (25 series); and combat engineer (12B).

As much as $58,300 is also being offered in selective retention bonuses for specialists through staff sergeants in the 35 series, as well as for information technology specialist (25B); military police (31B); and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialist (74D).

Even if an enlisted Soldier does not qualify for a bonus that Soldier can still receive a $5,000 assignment incentive pay.

Positions in the SFAB also count as a broadening assignment, providing tactical options for NCOs other than being a recruiter or drill sergeant.

“This gives you the same credit as doing one of those jobs, except that you get to stay and work within your MOS and be exposed to some of that same equipment,” Field said. “So, by time your time in the SFAB is complete and you’re rotating back to your BCT, you don’t need to be re-greened. You’ve been working in your MOS with Soldiers out there.”

WASHINGTON – The Army launched a new survey which allows Soldiers to voice their concerns directly and anonymously to Army leadership.

The Department of the Army Career Engagement Survey (DACES) is a survey for all Active Duty Soldiers. DACES replaces earlier exit surveys which were only given to Soldiers as they departed the Active Army.

DACES is a customized survey, with questions tailored to the individual Soldier based on their responses to previous questions. This reduces the amount of time required to take the survey by eliminating unnecessary questions. Although the current version of DACES takes around fifteen minutes to complete, future versions will take even less time, as DACES will ask more specific questions based on an individual’s demographics. During the survey, Soldiers will also be provided a chance to request more information about career opportunities or to be contacted for additional information.

Starting in May, Soldiers will receive a link in their email inbox during their birth month directing them to the DACES web page. In addition to an annual birth month survey, all Soldiers will be required to complete the survey as part of their out-processing requirements when they depart the Army.

The Army will use the results of DACES to inform retention efforts. DACES will help the Army create retention incentives and quality of life programs in order to retain talent. DACES will not share the results of the survey with a Soldier’s chain of command or personnel manager, allowing Soldiers to share information candidly.

The first surveys have already been sent. Users may only take DACES if they are using a DOD-furnished computer on a DOD network, if they are connected to a DOD network through a VPN, or if they are using CITRIX.

For more information, contact the DACES support team at: usarmy.pentagon.hqda-dcs-g-1.mbx.daces-survey-support@mail.mil

FORT CARSON, Colo. -- In a rare virtual ceremony, the Army’s latest security force assistance brigade to stand up officially activated Tuesday as it prepares to deploy to Afghanistan this fall.

The 4th SFAB, based at Fort Carson, is the fifth of six similar units to stand up after the Army activated the first one in 2018, as part of a re-focused train, assist and advise strategy that envisioned the specialized units in hotspots around the world.

The SFABs serve as permanent organizations that provide a more concerted effort than previous ad hoc formations, such as military transition teams or security force assistance advisory teams.

To create the previous units, the Army pulled from conventional brigade combat teams that then reduced their effectiveness.

“And though necessary at the time, all of this had a long-term, negative impact on total force readiness,” said Gen. Michael Garrett, commander of U.S. Army Forces Command. “Back then, we treated security force assistance as a peripheral task when, in fact, it is central to the National Defense Strategy and our Army’s mission.”

Since 2018, SFABs have deployed to assist foreign partners in Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Members of an SFAB train, deploy and redeploy together as part of an enduring group. After some time resetting back at home, the teams in that same brigade deploy again.

Security force assistance is far from a new concept, the general said, as today’s heritage can be traced back to the Military Assistance Command-Vietnam created in the 1960s for the war.

The general said there is now an increasing need for combat advisors, which free up BCTs to better prepare for large-scale ground combat with near-peer adversaries.

“They are Soldiers who can build teams, solve complex problems and succeed in uncertain environments,” he said.

The newest combat advisors have already learned specialized skills from the Military Advisor Training Academy, as well as advanced medical training; survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training; and foreign weapons training.

In June, the 4th SFAB is slated to conduct the next rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center in Fort Polk, Louisiana.

It will be “the first one out of the chute as we work to figure out how we maintain readiness as we adjust to the new normal,” Garrett said.

Brig. Gen. Mark Landes, commander of the Security Force Assistance Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, dialed in via videoconference for the ceremony, which had Garrett and a few others spaced 6 feet apart with the unit’s guidon inside a large conference room.

Landes called the ceremony “historic and atypical,” but noted that while the ongoing threat from the virus has changed how the Army operates, it has not changed its essence.

“COVID-19 has allowed us another opportunity to showcase our character, our capability and our adaptability,” he said.

The ceremony signified 4th SFAB’s transformation into a trained and deployable formation, he said, adding he was impressed with how much it grew since January 2019.

“Every person in the unity and victory formation was selected and relocated to the unit,” Landes said, referring to the unit’s motto. “Every pencil and piece of paper had to be obtained using systems and processes that also had to be developed and incorporated.”

The 5th SFAB, out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, will be the last SFAB to stand up, slated for this summer. The 54th SFAB, a collection of National Guard Soldiers from several states, activated in March.

With about 800 Soldiers, the 4th SFAB is scheduled to replace the 3rd SFAB to continue the mission in Afghanistan.

“These SFABs are advising, assisting and developing professional organized militaries that can fight for themselves,” Landes said.

Its commander, Col. James Dooghan, said he was confident that each advisor is fully trained and equipped with the best tools to tackle the challenge.

“We selected the right people in the right positions to be ready and effective in assessing, advising, mentoring and assisting our international partners,” he said. “We’re proud to officially announce our activation and we look forward to this mission.”

WASHINGTON -- Army researchers are working to rapidly develop and test experimental vaccines to combat COVID-19, Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy said.

The Army is also collaborating with the private sector and other government entities on 24 vaccine candidates, some of which are headed for human testing after having been tested on animals, McCarthy told reporters at a recent Pentagon news conference.

If history is any indicator of future success, there is reason to be hopeful. Being at the forefront of medical breakthroughs is nothing new for Army researchers:

Fighting Malaria

Due to their ability to carry and spread diseases such as malaria, mosquitoes are one of the deadliest insects in the world, killing an average of 725,000 people a year, said. Army Col. (Dr.) Deydre Teyhen, commander of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. That surpasses the combined annual number of deaths from combat (475,000), deadly snakebites (50,000), crocodile attacks (1,000) and shark attacks (10).

To reduce deaths caused by mosquitoes, WRAIR has acted on several fronts, she said: providing proactive medical diplomacy, delivering vaccines and vector control, and leading the world in malaria drug and vaccine development.

Fighting Multidrug-Resistant Infections

An antibiotic drug developed by Army researchers several years ago is now available to treat service members who have life-threatening, multidrug-resistant, or MDR, bacterial infections.

Arbekacin is a new antibiotic treatment for MDR infections. Those types of infections may complicate wounds suffered by soldiers in combat, said Army Col. (Dr.) Michael Zapor, an infectious diseases physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

""Of all the bacterial species found on the planet, relatively few are intrinsically multidrug-resistant pathogens,"" Zapor said. ""In Iraq and Afghanistan, the bacterium known as acinetobacter is one such MDR bacterium that has caused problems in our patient population.""

cinetobacter is commonly found in the water and soil of regions such as Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. Although it's intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, it's not especially virulent and generally not problematic in humans unless their immune system has been severely compromised or the bacterium is inoculated deep into macerated tissue, as would occur with massive open wounds resulting from battle injuries.

Infections caused by the bacterium were prevalent during the Vietnam War, he said. But at the time, antibiotics were usually successful in eradicating acinetobacter infections. However, over time, resistance emerged and antibiotics became less effective against many pathogenic bacteria, including acinetobacter.

Fighting Yellow Fever

A lot of service members were taken out of the fight in 1898 during the Spanish-American War due to yellow fever.

The Army created the Yellow Fever Commission, led by Army Maj. (Dr.) Walter Reed, which determined that mosquitoes were the carriers of the disease. The commission developed effective control programs to eradicate the mosquitoes.

Fighting Adenovirus

Acute respiratory diseases were fairly common among service members in the early 1950s. Maurice Hilleman, a microbiologist with the Army Medical Center's Department of Respiratory Diseases, discovered that the adenovirus was the culprit.

WRAIR created an adenovirus vaccine in 1956, just three years after its discovery.

WASHINGTON – The Army has resumed shipping recruits to basic combat training following a two-week pause to enact necessary COVID-19 mitigation efforts. More than 950 future Soldiers will begin pouring into initial training centers this week.

“We’re not changing, we’re adjusting, and continually adapting in the environment no matter where we are, because we need to train, fight, and win,” said Gen. Paul Funk, the commanding general of Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, regarding new BCT policies.

As hundreds of new recruits begin pouring into training bases around the force, health and safety measures are in place, officials said. For example, BCT and One-Station Unit Training are implementing social-distancing practices and plan to train “at reduced capacity,” officials said.

This means smaller elements, Funk explained. “That way if we have a [coronavirus] breakout, we can control it and move the smallest elements forward and continue to progress people through the training pipeline.”

Several other protocols and procedures are in place from the time recruits leave their hometowns to the moment they step foot on training soil.

For two weeks prior to their ship date, future Soldiers are screened for symptoms of, and possible exposure to, COVID-19 by their recruiters and then by Military Entrance Processing Station personnel, Funk said. Also, during this time recruits will isolate themselves at home to limit exposure to the airborne virus.

Once recruits show up to their assigned training center, they are screened again, Funk said.

Then for the first two-weeks after arrival, recruits take part in a modified training curriculum and have their health gauged daily.

Much of this time is classroom-based, held outside when possible, and recruits remain six feet apart. After 14 days – and if they are healthy – for the additional eight weeks of the 10-week schedule, recruits “hit the ground running,” Funk said.

The controlled monitoring phase will be a series of classes, which is an introduction to Army techniques that are normally scheduled anyway, he said. Classes include customs and courtesies, recognizing military rank, and preventing sexual assault.

The Army is also cautious about where future Soldiers arrive. Individuals from “low-risk” areas will ship to initial training bases, but “those who are in high-risk areas will be rescheduled for future dates,” according to a news release.

All four Army training centers have implemented these procedures “and they perform their conditions on the established procedures so when the recruits come in, we're making sure that we can form the safety bubbles necessary to get us through the training,” Funk said.

“We owe that kind of due diligence and commitment to our Soldiers and their parents, who send those same Soldiers to us each year to wear the cloth of our great nation,” he added.

These BCT changes are an example of how the Army is “adapting to the current environment, and adjusting the way it operates,” Funk explained. “Every day to fight our nation's wars, one of our greatest strengths has always been our ability to learn and adapt.”

Travel restrictions made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Defense Department providing leave leniency for service members who accrue too much leave and might otherwise lose it.

Each year, active-duty service members are granted 30 days of leave, but at the end of each fiscal year, they normally lose any unused leave exceeding 60 days. With the leniency granted due to the pandemic travel restrictions, service members can now accrue a leave balance of up to 120 days until Sept. 30, 2023.

Matthew Donovan, undersecretary of personnel and readiness, signed the authorization for that change April 16.

DOD encourages service members to take leave whenever possible; however, it's not always possible due to deployments and operational commitments, Pentagon officials said, though some extensions have been granted due to long deployments.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit service members particularly hard because many are not allowed to travel to see friends and loved ones who live many miles away — a big incentive for taking leave, Donovan said. Therefore, he continued, the restriction on the leave balance ceiling was relaxed.

""The department's actions to stem the spread of COVID-19 have significantly limited the ability of service members to take leave during this national emergency, and we know that leave is vital to the health and welfare of our force,"" Donovan stated in his memorandum.

For DOD's civilian workforce, Office of Personnel Management policy already makes allowances for leave accrual under exigent circumstances, such as COVID-19. All restored annual leave must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year ending two years from the year the annual leave was earned after the termination of the current emergency. The normal leave balance service members may carry over each year is 240 hours. However, more hours may be carried over during the current emergency.

Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper signed a memorandum today restricting all DOD uniformed and civilian personnel and their families from traveling to, from or through places identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's travel health notices as Level 3 COVID locations.

The memo is in effect until June 30, though that could change because reviews are taking place every 15 days based on CDC guidance.

The travel restrictions include permanent changes of station and all other official travel, as well as personal leave. Also, flights to or from non-Level 3 countries cannot transit through Level 3 nations.

As of today, the CDC website listed Germany, Italy, Qatar, Afghanistan, South Korea and Japan — countries where large numbers of service members are stationed — as Level 3 locations. Many other countries also are at Level 3.

Numerous exceptions to the travel ban have been made on a case-by-case basis, Donovan said at an April 18 Pentagon news conference, citing exemptions for medical treatment, personal hardship, separation and retirement.

""The coronavirus disease continues to present significant risk to our forces as the DOD considers domestic and overseas personnel travel,"" Esper stated in his memorandum. ""These movements present the threat of spreading COVID-19 within our ranks and communities. My priorities remain protecting our service members, DOD civilians and families; safeguarding our national security capabilities; and supporting the whole-of-nation response.""

This is not the first time extensions have been granted, officials noted. Special leave accrual of up to 75 days was granted during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, due to long or multiple deployments.

ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. – Following mandated stay-at-home and social distancing rules during the COVID-19 crisis is creating unique challenges for many individuals who are managing work, family and personal needs while still trying to stay healthy and not stress out or get too stir crazy. Health and nutrition experts at the Army Public Health Center have a number of recommendations to help keep you and your family on track.

Lt. Col. Leslie Roberson, a clinical psychologist and APHC behavioral health specialist, recognizes the challenges.

“Our family is spending more time together than usual due to COVID-19,” said Roberson. “Being together in close quarters can be challenging. Did I mention we are also sharing the internet with four teenagers and the internet is required for telework?”

Roberson recommends discussing daily work plans, especially when online meetings are occurring, so others in the household know when they need to be quiet.

“We have a freshman in the home and both my husband and I are teleworking,” said Sgt. 1st Class Sue Ellen Brown, the non-commissioned officer in charge of Pregnancy Postpartum Physical Training for Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. “A good strategy that has worked for us is to maintain a schedule and enforcing our timelines for workout, personal hygiene, lunch, break, and also balancing when our dog Elle wants attention and love.

Sgt. 1st Class Jonathan K. Settle, APHC Health Promotion and Wellness Directorate NCOIC, is adapting well to telework.

“Teleworking has made it possible to spend more time with the family. I am able to pause for short moments to regroup,” said Settle. “I still work the required hours but am able to space my time out through the day leading to a better quality of life.”

APHC experts say another strategy for maintaining good general health and managing stress while working from home is to maintain physical fitness levels. Personal physical training should include a balance of cardiorespiratory (endurance) exercise and resistance training. And you don’t need a gym to get it done. For example, the Army physical readiness training app also provides two weeks of PRT sessions that can be done with or without equipment. These resources can be found on the ACFT website at https://www.army.mil/acft/.

“Each morning before work begins, I try to incorporate walking the family dogs 15 minutes, and I also try and spend 15 minutes walking the dogs during lunch,” said Roberson. “I use a fitness tracker daily to monitor steps I've taken to make me be accountable. If I have less than 10,000 steps a day, I try not to go to bed until that goal has been met.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend that adults engage in 150 minutes per week of moderate activity (i.e. brisk walking, bike riding 10 to 12 mph) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week (jogging at 6 mph or biking at 14 to 16 mph) or a combination of both.

These workouts can also be conducted while following recommended social distancing guidelines, according to APHC experts. Cardiorespiratory training can be performed indoors on a treadmill, stationary bike, or stairs, or outside by going on a walk, run, or bike around the neighborhood. Large empty parking lots at a neighborhood school, church or shopping center may allow one to walk/run without any close contact with others. Make sure to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) at all times. If walking or running on trails, try to go during times when it is less crowded.

Brown also has a good workout routine.

“We are working out in the mornings with our teenagers; which relieves a lot of stress,” said Brown. “I also workout on Fridays with our P3T Soldiers via Facebook live, which has been a learning experience within itself.”

Another critical part of staying healthy is good nutrition, which is one leg of the Army Performance Triad of sleep, activity and nutrition. Staying healthy during “stay-at-home” requirements involve three key considerations: Eating a rainbow of eight servings of fruits and vegetables, eat a balanced plate, and hydrate with water throughout the day.

“We have made a conscious effort not to buy junk food and only keep healthy or semi-healthy food at the house,” said Brown. “We’re also cooking food at home to keep it healthy and attempting not to order out.”

The Army P3 nutrition webpage offers more ideas for creating the rainbow.

“The best thing to boost your immune system is to regularly eat a variety of foods with a focus on fruits and vegetables,” said Joanna Reagan, APHC registered dietitian. “Fruits and vegetables are extremely beneficial in disease prevention, making them nutritional powerhouses.”

Settle says he avoids stress eating by keeping healthy snacks around the house.

“We've never had many snacks in the house and when we do have snacks they usually consist of frozen grapes and chips,” said Settle. “When eating chips no one is allowed to eat out of the bag. All snacks are served in bowls to avoid eating the entire bag at one sitting.”

Eating a balanced plate is good for your immune system, said Reagan. She recommends focusing on nutrient rich foods while eating three balanced meals a day with healthy snacks. Key nutrients to help with immunity include Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, probiotic-rich foods, and omega 3-rich foods. Check out this P3 web page on supporting your immune system.

Staying hydrated throughout the day can also help boost immunity. This is also pretty easy to do when hydrating is as easy as a trip to the fridge.

“Set a reoccurring alarm on your phone to remind you to drink water at regular intervals,” said Reagan. “Add lemon or lime slices and fresh fruit to increase flavor.”

The last pillar of P3 is sleep. This can be especially challenging during this stressful time, but it’s important for a fit body and mind. Sleep experts recommend seven or more hours of sleep a night.

“Skimping on sleep could adversely affect your immune system, leaving you susceptible to illness, while sleeping longer may help you resist infections” said Dr. Sara Alger, a sleep research scientist in the Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. “Additionally, your brain and body require sleep to process what you have learned and experienced during the day and to aid post-workout muscle recovery. Also, getting a good night’s sleep helps with emotion regulation, which is important during this stressful time.”

Alger recommends setting a consistent bed and wake time and avoiding caffeine at least six hours before going to bed.

The final challenge of mandatory stay-at-home orders is in the name – social distancing. Plus, you’re stuck in your house alone, with family or maybe a roommate. How do you keep it fun and also stay connected with friends and family, whether across the country or a few miles away?

“I keep telling myself to stay in some type of shape mentally and physically because this will not last forever,” said Brown. “For my mental/spiritual state we are still attending church via Facebook Live, working out and keeping a routine at home. I also have personal time and family time.”

The internet makes it easier to stay connected, said Dr. Anna Courie, an APHC nurse and project officer.

“We maintain social connections by talking to friends on Facebook,” said Roberson. “We also make sure we call family and close friends weekly. For the upcoming Easter Holiday, we will FaceTime or Skype with family located in other states to wish them a happy holiday.”

Courie is also a big advocate for military families taking control of their needs and accessing those resources available in their communities.

“Army communities have a ton of resources available to support military families during difficult times,” said Courie. “You can access those resources via the Army Community Resource Guide.”

All Army families can download the CRG app via the iTunes/Google Play stores or access it at https://crg.amedd.army.mil.

Another resource promoting and sustaining healthy lifestyles during this time is the Army Wellness Center. AWCs offer a crucial link for health resources to the broader Army community. Local AWCs are providing a variety of services in an online format to continue their support of the health and wellbeing of active-duty service members, adult family members, retirees, and Department of the Army civilians. Services are free and this web page lists all AWC locations.

Settle says he likes doing puzzles with his daughter, playing card games, taking daily walks outside and listening to podcasts while doing mundane household chores.

“I lead a very boring and simple life but it makes me happy,” said Settle.

For more tips and strategies and maintaining your distance, but also your health, check out the Performance Triad Trending Topics page.

The Army Public Health Center focuses on promoting healthy people, communities, animals and workplaces through the prevention of disease, injury and disability of Soldiers, military retirees, their families, veterans, Army civilian employees, and animals through population-based monitoring, investigations, and technical consultations.

FORT MEADE, Md. -- To help slow the spread of coronavirus, the Army will halt the movement of new recruits to basic combat training for at least two weeks, service leaders said Monday. New recruits may also be eligible to receive up to $6,000 of delayed shipping incentive pay added to any existing bonuses, depending on the length of delay.

About 220 recruits scheduled to ship from April 6-20 will be rescheduled. However, basic training that has already begun and advanced individual training will continue in a limited capacity to maintain readiness, said Gen. Paul Funk II, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command commander.

""We are focusing on the health and safety of our force right now,” said Maj. Gen. Frank Muth, U.S. Army Recruiting Command commander. “And this will help us ensure our training bases are fully prepared to receive our new recruits in the safest way possible.""

Recruits who have experienced extreme hardship and had their basic training dates rescheduled due to living in a COVID-19 red zone may be approved for the new Future Soldier to Active Duty program. Through the program, new Soldiers can receive $1,600, or the base pay of an E-1 private during the delay.

By April 20 the Army will have delayed the shipment of a total of about 4,000 active-duty and Army Reserve recruits since March 16, Muth estimates. Until Monday, the Army had shipped about 1,700 recruits to BCT while delaying the transportation of troops in COVID-19 red zones.

The decision to stop the transportation of trainees to BCT stems from last month’s Defense Department order to minimize domestic travel and contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Muth said recruiters will continue to maintain regular virtual and phone contact with new Soldiers awaiting travel to the Army’s training bases: Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; Fort Benning, Georgia; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

""This pause is only for our current future Soldiers who had already signed a contract with us,"" Muth said. ""Our recruiters will still be out there in the digital space working with applicants who are interested in serving … when the situation stabilizes.""

Training changes

Smaller classes, social distancing and increased health screenings are among the significant changes at the training bases amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

About 100 Soldiers at the training installations have tested positive for coronavirus and 12 have fully recovered, Funk said. Each installation has taken measures to practice social distancing during physical training sessions and in dormitory housing, said public affairs officers at the installations.

“Ensuring the safety of all of our Soldiers, family members and civilian personnel is always our No. 1 priority,” said Funk, adding that the service will reassess the environment at the end of the two-week delay to decide whether to resume new troop movement to BCT. “And we will continue to take an abundance of caution to protect our force as this situation develops.”

Recruits take health screenings before initial processing, at their local military entrance processing stations and when they arrive at basic training installations. For their first two weeks, recruits take part in limited training while being closely monitored and taking daily health assessments, said Maj. Gen. Lonnie Hibbard, Center for Initial Military Training commander. The recruits will also take the classroom portion of the eight-week basic training curriculum during the controlled-monitoring phase.

“Force health protection is the Army’s top priority,” said Lt. Col. Peggy Kageleiry, CIMT public affairs director. “Protecting the force includes mitigating the spread of the coronavirus by executing strict health protocols at Army training centers. The Army will continue to train new recruits to maintain operational readiness.”

At Fort Sill, Soldiers continue to participate in basic training while practicing proper distancing during physical training and in learning activities. Instructors have changed the dimensions of formations to place recruits 6 feet apart and cadence-calling drills have been eliminated. Indoor classes have also moved outdoors. Col. Michael Konczey, 434th Field Artillery Brigade commander, said March 27 among the recruits and drill sergeants remains high.

Fort Sill will livestream its basic training and advanced leadership training course graduations, which remain closed to the public.

At Fort Leonard Wood, the training base’s 60-bed, open-bay dorm rooms are now housing 30 recruits per room for proper social distancing, a CIMT official said. Kageleiry said recruits and drill sergeants at Leonard Wood and the Army’s other training bases continue to get screened daily to help prevent COVID-19’s spread.

“I get asked a lot, ‘Why are we still training?’” said Col. Adam Hilburgh, 3rd Chemical Brigade commander at Leonard Wood. “The Army’s mission is to fight and win our nation’s wars, and in order to do that we need to maintain readiness. And one of the ways we do that for the Army is to provide trained, disciplined, quality Soldiers to the force, and we do that continuously.”

Fort Benning -- home of the Army’s Infantry School, Armor School, Ranger School, and Airborne School -- suspended all combatives training. At Fort Jackson, base officials confirmed a Soldier in training with 3rd Battalion, 13th Infantry Regiment, and an Army officer enrolled in the Adjutant General Basic Officer Leader Course were among those diagnosed with COVID-19. In-person graduations at the installation have also been canceled.

Gen. James C. McConville, the Army’s chief of staff, said at a press conference on March 20 that protective measures have been implemented because infection prevention is paramount. Should recruits show COVID-19 symptoms, the installations have the required medical capabilities to quarantine and treat all impacted personnel, he said.

“Parents are sending us their sons and daughters,” he said. “We have an obligation to take care of them.""

It is an honor to join you here at the Naval War College.Thank you, Ambassador Middendorf, for joining us today, and for your decades of public service to our Nation—including your time at the helm of our Department as the 62nd Secretary of the Navy. It is wonderful to see you again and it’s an honor to be here for this event.I cannot thank you enough for your contributions to our nation, our Navy, and the world. You’ve lived a truly incredible life.Rear Admiral Garvin, thank you for hosting us this afternoon here at the Naval War College.Dr. Ballard, thank you for your presence today as well as for your decades of service, both in uniform as a Naval officer, your many contributions to our collective understanding of the ocean, and your numerous discoveries of sunken ships—including RMS Titanic, USS Yorktown, Bismarck, and PT-109.I hope the future USNS Robert Ballard (T-AGS-67) will have as much success—and contribute as much to our Navy’s mission—as you have.Admiral Foggo, Master Chief Stevens, it’s an honor to have you with us. Thank you for your service to our country and our Navy.I would like to thank Commander Tom Callender and General Dynamics for joining us for this event. Commander Callender, thank you for your leadership and for helping ensure this event happened, as well as for your decades of service in our Navy as a submariner. It is great to see you again.In the past two and a half years as the Secretary of the Navy, I have been lucky enough to announce the names for a myriad of new ships, as well as attend numerous commissionings, keel-layings, and christenings.The ships we’re building across the country are a key piece of our department’s ability to deter our adversaries, support our allies and partners, and, if necessary, fight and win our nation’s wars.Our ships, aircraft, submarines, and people are operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week at, above, and below the ocean’s surface, as well as in space and cyberspace.A ready, combat-credible, forward-deployed fleet remains the most potent, flexible, and versatile instrument of military power. It ensures that the seas remain free and open, allowing for the peaceful flow of goods, ideas, and people.With this in mind, in September, I called for a new approach to maritime statecraft—a return to a national, whole of government effort to build comprehensive U.S. and maritime power.To that end, we have made significant strides and established new initiatives in the past year—including the Marine Innovation Unit, the Navy’s Disruptive Capabilities Office, our department’s Science and Technology Board, and five weeks ago, the Government Shipbuilder Council.Four different cabinet departments—Defense, Transportation, Homeland Security, and Commerce—came together to form the G-S-C because we recognize that we need a whole-of-government effort to rebuild our nation’s comprehensive maritime power.We recognize agility in ship production and design requires developing new, digital tools for our workforce to improve efficiency and capacity.The future of shipbuilding, maintenance, and repair looks much different than it did when I retired from the Navy twenty years ago—advances in modelling, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence will allow us to reduce costs, optimize systems, and improve collaboration.We continue to develop high-paying, high-skilled “new-collar” jobs that restore America’s manufacturing prowess by combining traditionally blue-collar trades with cutting-edge manufacturing technologies of today.It’s hard to believe that fifty years ago Ambassador Middendorf was championing the Aegis Weapons System as the Secretary of the Navy—today, our Aegis-equipped Arleigh Burke-class destroyers remain the workhorse of our force.Ambassador Middendorf also championed the Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine. Today, we’re working to continue that legacy—indeed, of our nearly 100 ships under contract and over 50 in construction, many of them can trace their lineage back to the systems and platforms he played a large role in shepherding through Congress.Our number one acquisition priority, USS Columbia, represents the future of our ballistic missile and strategic deterrence force.We’re building Ford-class carriers, Virginia-class submarines, Constellation-class frigates, San Antonio-class LPDs, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.This year, we commissioned the first Flight III destroyer, USS Jack H. Lucas, which represents the most technologically advanced surface combatant ever built.When commissioned, USS J. William Middendorf will become part of that storied line of ships—she will be the most capable surface combatant ever built.As we stand at the precipice of this decisive decade—hearkening back to your many years of exemplary service—the Navy stands ready to defend our nation and our allies, and to uphold the values of freedom and democracy that our nation represents.Today, our ships—especially the Ford and Eisenhower Strike Groups, and their surface escorts—have proven indispensable to our national strategy and defending American interests around the world.Just recently, our destroyers, USS Thomas Hudner, and USS Carney, shot down missiles and armed drones launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen, and prevented a potential pirate attack on a commercial vessel.The Navy's role is not just about deterring aggression; it is also about protecting American interests around the world.But we can’t do it alone.During my time in office, we’ve also announced the AUKUS trilateral security agreement—a landmark partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—to share resources and build nuclear-powered, conventionally-armed submarines for Australia.This historic agreement reflects our shared commitment to upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific, deterring aggression, and safeguarding our collective security.However, it is more than that, too. It’s a model for how we’re expanding naval diplomacy to the procurement and technology development spheres—and driving significant investment in our defense industrial base.Mutually respectful cooperation with our allies and partners is at the heart of the Biden administration’s National Defense Strategy—in stark contrast to our adversaries, who seek to leverage economic and military power to coerce their neighbors.In fact, our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, Middle East, Caribbean, and Latin America continue to work with us to develop and field a hybrid fleet.We’re operating and actively preparing the Navy for the future—laying the groundwork for the hybrid fleet.We’ve proved that our Navy can procure and develop off-the-shelf technology quickly, effectively, and efficiently to free our more capable traditional naval forces—like the future USS J. William Middendorf—to conduct more strategic missions—and so we can rapidly deploy manned platforms when keyed by indications from our unmanned force.During UNITAS 64, we operated seven separate robotic systems on, under, and above the seas, wholly integrated into the exercise’s command and control, and they executed missions alongside our—and our allies and partners’—traditional forces.This summer we deployed four unmanned ships to Japan for the first time—and they participated in Large Scale Exercise and Integrated Battle Problem, also alongside traditional forces. Next year, they’ll again participate in RIMPAC.Our future hybrid fleet is already arriving—and is changing how we utilize our forces today.And today, we face a geo-political landscape more akin to the era during which Ambassador Middendorf served.For the first time in 30 years, we face a nation with capabilities that approach our own. For the first time in over 100 years, we face intense peacetime competition with a global maritime power.The People’s Republic of China remains our pacing challenge—over the next, decisive, decade of strategic competition, we and our military must tackle the challenges facing us.Our reliance on the maritime domain is going to accelerate even further in the coming decades, and we still have so much to learn about the oceans our economy, lives, and national security depend upon.We look forward to welcoming the future USS J. William Middendorf into our fleet, and are excited for its future crew to represent our nation on a global scale, just as her namesake did throughout his life.May God continue to bless our country with fair winds and following seas. Thank you."

326,NSA and ESF Partners Release Recommended Practices for Managing Open Source Software and Software Bill of Materials,http://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3613105/nsa-and-esf-partners-release-recommended-practices-for-managing-open-source-sof/,"FORT MEADE, Md. – The National Security Agency (NSA), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and industry partners have released a cybersecurity technical report (CTR), “Securing the Software Supply Chain: Recommended Practices for Managing Open Source Software and Software Bill of Materials,” which builds on the “Enhancing the Security of the Software Supply Chain through Secure Software Development Practices” paper released by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).



The guidance in this release supports development activities of a single developer as well as activities of large industry companies to maintain software supply chain security practices to mitigate risks. Developed by the Enduring Security Framework (ESF) Software Supply Chain Working Group, an NSA, ODNI, and CISA-led a public-private cross-sector group, to provide details on recommended practices as a basis for describing, assessing, and measuring security practices relative to the software lifecycle.



""Open source software is an essential and valuable component in many commercial and public-sector products and services, and collaboration on open source software often enables great cost-savings for participants. However, organizations that do not follow a consistent and secure-by-design management practice for the open source software they utilize are more likely to become vulnerable to known exploits in open source packages and encounter more difficulty when reacting to an incident. For this reason, CISA is very pleased to have co-produced this guide with NSA, ODNI, and industry partners, which can be used by organizations of all sizes to improve the safety and security of their open source software management practices,"" Aeva Black, CISA Open Source Software Security Lead.



Software incorporated and/or utilized through open source may have embedded issues. It is imperative that we pay close attention to how these modules are bundled with the software at release. This in turn increases the potential for supply chains to be weaponized by national state adversaries who can access software via several means including, but not limited to: exploitation of design flaws, incorporation of vulnerable third-party components into a software product, infiltration of the supplier's network with malicious code prior to the final delivery of the product, and injection of malware within the software deployed in the customer environment.



""MongoDB is proud to have contributed to the Enduring Security Framework as part of the cross-sector working group dedicated to mitigating threats to critical infrastructure security. The latest ""Managing OSS and SBOM Guide"" will help with describing, assessing, and measuring security practices related to the software development life cycle, a cause that is very important to MongoDB and our customers. The focus on enhancing security practices throughout the software development life cycle underscores our commitment as a vendor to uphold software integrity and security, offering best practices and standards that aid consumers and vendors in these crucial responsibilities,"" Lena Smart, Chief Information Security Officer, MongoDB.



This report provides guidance in line with industry best practices and principles, including managing open source software and software bills of materials (SBOM) to maintain and provide awareness about the security of software. Specifically, the report provides more details on Open Source Software (OSS) adoption and the things to consider when evaluating and deploying an open source component into an existing product development environment include: its composition; process and procedures used when adopting open source software; and management, tracking and distribution of approved software components using an SBOM.

327,Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta Delivers Remarks at the Justice Department’s Violent Crime Reduction Summit,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/associate-attorney-general-vanita-gupta-delivers-remarks-justice-departments-violent,"Thank you, Amy. It is great to be here with you and the Attorney General, whose support for communities and law enforcement is the backbone of everything we do at the Justice Department. And it is wonderful to have so many U.S. Attorneys in the room — you and your offices are working every day to build partnerships and keep your communities safe.

Amy, I want to thank your team at our Office of Justice Programs, in particular Director Karhlton Moore and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), for putting together this convening and for your efforts to equip our law enforcement and community partners with resources to disrupt violence and end cycles of trauma.

I want to commend our partners, here in Indianapolis and across the country, for the critical work you are doing to reduce violence and advance safety — whether you are a police officer sworn to protect and serve, a prosecutor working to keep your community safe, a community leader or service provider dedicated to reaching those in need, or a local leader pledged to safeguard the welfare of your constituents. Your jobs are difficult, they can be dangerous, and make no mistake — they are utterly indispensable.

As a nation, I fear we have become much too accustomed to gun violence and the senseless destruction of lives. Mass violence is an all-too-common event. Just as unsettling are the countless shootings that occur on our streets every day in America.

As Associate Attorney General, I have met with families whose children were killed in the horrific mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, with mothers who lost their children to gun violence in Chicago, with survivors and family members from the Buffalo, New York, Tops Supermarket massacre. I remember the photos they shared with me, of loved ones whose lives were cut short, and I carry their stories with me — their grief, their anger, their frustration.

Guns claimed the lives of more than 48,000 people in 2022, including almost 20,000 homicides. Firearms have been the leading cause of death among children in this country since 2020. For far too many kids, the promise of a bright future, which should be every child’s birthright, is snatched away by a gun.

To the rising toll of gun crimes and mass tragedies we add the mounting tally of hate in our country. Hate crimes rose 12% between 2020 and 2021, and 2022 saw the highest reported levels yet. This is intolerable, and it violates everything we stand for as a nation.

It must be said that violent crime, as reported by law enforcement departments across the nation, is down. Despite upticks during the pandemic, the long downward trend that began in the early 90s is resuming. But we also know that the rate of nonfatal violent victimizations, many of which are never reported to police, rose last year — though, again, the rate is far below its peak three decades ago.

We must also acknowledge that the problem of violent crime is most pronounced in communities that have been marginalized and historically underserved. Neighborhoods that have long absorbed the costs associated with disinvestment are the ones most likely to face the regular threat of violence.

None of this is news to those of you in this room. You see these problems firsthand, and the sad reality is that too many of you have personal experience with mass violence, hate crimes, and the epidemic of gun violence, which is especially acute in communities of color. And many of you have been affected directly, either through exposure to trauma as a first responder or as someone who has personally experienced violence. The price of violent crime in America — economic, social, and emotional — is simply beyond measure.

But here, with our shared mission, is a seed of hope.

The programs you are here representing — from the National Public Safety Partnership, to Project Safe Neighborhoods, to the work in rural communities and through our Crime Gun Intelligence Centers — these efforts are built on a sturdy foundation of partnership — between law enforcement and the community, between federal and local partners, and between public safety professionals, community leaders, and people with lived experience.

I believe that this focus on partnership and collaboration is the key to meeting this moment. For too long, we have looked to law enforcement alone to solve violent crime. Police officers do all they can with the tools they have, often under extremely difficult circumstances, and they take heroic measures on behalf of the people and communities they serve. But law enforcement is also in the midst of a historic recruitment and retention crisis. We at the Justice Department are committed to finding and funding creative solutions to this difficult problem, including through our COPS Hiring Program, which just awarded $217 million to 394 agencies across the country to hire a total of 1,730 new officers this year.

But even without this crisis, we know that violence is a complex challenge that cannot be fully resolved by arrests and incarceration. Addressing violent crime requires every member of the community, a deep investment of social capital, and a strong commitment from all sectors.

That is why we at the Justice Department are committing to approaches that complement enforcement and elevate the role of the community. Two of the four core principles of the Department’s Comprehensive Strategy for Reducing Violent Crime are about building trust and empowering communities: the first is that violent crime strategies must be based on a foundation of trust between law enforcement and communities; and the second is that we can prevent violence through investments in community-based violence prevention and intervention programs. These principles are important because public safety requires law enforcement legitimacy, community leadership, and a belief that equal justice is possible.

But these are not just lofty ideas. We are putting our money where our mouth is, and — working with you, in your communities — putting these strategies into practice.

We have awarded nearly $200 million for community violence intervention and prevention programs across the country. “Community violence intervention and prevention” does not describe one particular kind of program, but rather, a comprehensive approach that is helping to change the way we talk about and address gun and other serious violence. In some programs, credible messengers with deep ties to their communities are trained to work with those most at risk of engaging in violence. Other programs focus on workforce development, social services, or trauma-informed care.

These are programs like the Urban Peace Institute in Los Angeles, where they are training and deploying peacemakers to work alongside law enforcement officers in underserved areas of the city. There’s the work in Lake County, Illinois, led by the State Attorney’s Office, that leans on violence interrupters to disrupt the cycle of crime and retaliation among youth. And there’s the Osborne Association in the Bronx, which provides conflict resolution, cognitive behavioral therapy, transitional employment, and other services to young people at risk for gun-crime involvement.

We know that a crisis of violence — whether one large-scale event or gun crime in our streets — places enormous demands on local resources. It shakes the community, it can bring business to a stand-still, and it leads to confusion, frustration, and fatigue for leaders as well as community members. We cannot yet anticipate and prevent every crisis, but in the meantime, we can increase our capacity for resilience and put our communities in the best position to respond and recover.

The Justice Department is working on all fronts to bring you resources to tackle these monumental challenges. Federal agents from ATF, the U.S. Marshals, the DEA, and the FBI are working with local, state, and Tribal partners. We provide peer-to-peer assistance to law enforcement leaders through the Mass Violence Advisory Initiative supported by BJA. We support victims of mass violence through the FBI’s Victim Services Division and our Office for Victims of Crime, and are continuously learning how to more effectively respond to victims and survivors.

We are making crucial investments in violence reduction programs, including through the Rural Violent Crime Reduction and National Crime Gun Intelligence Center Initiatives. We are providing research, training, and technical assistance through PSP and through BJA’s National Training and Technical Assistance Center, to broaden and build your base of expertise.

We support law enforcement agencies with targeted technical assistance, critical incident reviews, and organizational assessments, through our revitalized Collaborative Reform Initiative (CRI-TAC), managed by our Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), in partnership with the International Association of Chiefs of Police and eight other leading law enforcement organizations. To date, we have invested over $12.7 million in CRI-TAC and served more than 800 jurisdictions through over 1,016 technical assistance engagements. This year alone, CRI-TAC has assisted over 160 sites.

And we are brokering alliances, across disciplines and across levels of government, to give us the best chance of reducing violence in our communities.

We are proud of this work, and even more proud to be doing it with you. Your commitment to curbing violence and your willingness to do what it takes to achieve that goal are inspiring.

Every day, I think about the parents who have lost children, kids who have lost parents, and the first responders and communities grappling with the after-effects of violence. Some days I fear people are becoming numb to it all. But based on what I see here in Indianapolis, I am hopeful that as we work together on the underlying problems that lead to these tragedies, we can learn from one another, and lean on one another, and ultimately work toward the goal of safer, stronger, thriving communities.

Thank you for all that you do."
328,"Justice Department Secures Agreement with Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Resolve Disability-Based Discrimination Lawsuit",https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-chattanooga-tennessee-resolve-disability-based,"The Justice Department announced today that the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, has agreed to pay $32,600 to resolve allegations that it violated the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by refusing to allow four people with mental health disabilities to reside together in a single-family home in the city under the same terms and conditions as residents without disabilities.

The department’s lawsuit alleged that the city unnecessarily required Quality Lifestyle Service Inc. (Quality Lifestyle), a nonprofit housing provider, to apply for a special use permit to manage a four-person transitional home in the city’s R-1 residential zoning district. Under the city’s own zoning ordinance and state law, the home was an allowed use in that neighborhood. The lawsuit further alleged that the city denied the permit without any legitimate reason.

“Federal civil rights laws protect the rights of people with disabilities to live in the housing of their choice,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This agreement sends a clear message that the Justice Department will vigorously protect the rights of people with disabilities. All Americans, regardless of disability, have a right to fair housing in their communities.”

“The U.S. Attorney’s Office commends the complainant for sharing their experience to improve housing opportunities for persons with disabilities,” said U.S. Attorney Francis M. Hamilton III for the Eastern District of Tennessee. “Further, we commend the city of Chattanooga for cooperating in the investigation and working to reach a resolution that promotes accessible housing in East Tennessee.”

“Preventing persons with disabilities from accessing housing through discriminatory housing policies has no place in our society,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Demetria L. McCain of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “This agreement sends a strong message that HUD and the Justice Department will continue to work together to enforce our nation’s fair housing laws.”

Under the agreement, which was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, the city agreed to amend its zoning ordinance to ensure that persons with disabilities are not illegally denied housing opportunities or excluded from participation in the city’s services or programs. The city also agreed to pay a civil penalty to the government of $5,000, to train officials and employees about their fair-housing obligations under federal law, designate a fair-housing compliance officer and file periodic reports with the department.

The case began when Quality Lifestyle filed a complaint with HUD. HUD referred the complaint to the Justice Department, which conducted an investigation.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division enforces the FHA, which prohibits discrimination in housing based on disability, race, color, religion, national origin, sex and familial status. The division also enforces the ADA, which protects persons with disabilities’ access to state and local governments’ programs and services.

More information about the Civil Rights Division and the laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt. Individuals may report disability discrimination or other forms of housing discrimination by calling the Justice Department at 1-833-591-0291 or submitting a report online at www.civilrights.justice.gov. Individuals also may report discrimination by contacting HUD at 1-800-669-9777, or by filing a complaint online."
329,Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks at the Justice Department’s Violent Crime Reduction Summit,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-justice-departments-violent-crime,"Remarks as Delivered

Thanks everybody. Thanks, Amy. Thanks to everybody from the team at the Office of Justice Programs. Thanks, Karhlton, and everybody from the Bureau of Justice Assistance.

I know how hard it is to put something like this together and how much work. And I greatly appreciative everyone’s efforts.

Thank you, Mayor Hogsett and Chief Taylor for welcoming us to Indianapolis. We are grateful to both of you for being here today and for hosting us. Mayor Hogsett, as a former U.S. Attorney, we regard you as one of our own, and we are grateful that you are here.

I also want to recognize the state and local law enforcement leaders, city and town leaders, and community partners who have traveled from across the country to be here for the next three days.

I speak for all of us at the Justice Department when I say that your perspectives and your insights are invaluable to us. We have an enormous amount of respect for the work you do every single day in your communities.

And speaking of all of us at the Justice Department, I really mean that. I am also joined here this morning by Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, whom you all know well.

Also here are leaders from each of the Department’s law enforcement components, the ATF, FBI, DEA, and U.S. Marshals Service; 40 of our United States Attorneys and senior leaders from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices across the country; leaders from the Office on Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) , the Office for Access to Justice (ATJ); and many other components.

I am ERY pleased that all of them are here; I am very proud of their work.

Convenings like this one, with our law enforcement and community partners, are always important to us at the Justice Department. We know that the best time to build relationships across agencies and jurisdictions is before a crisis or an incident occurs in our communities.

But this is an especially critical time in our work together to keep our communities safe.

Today, we are confronting a global threat environment that makes it particularly urgent for us to remain vigilant in the face of risks of terrorism and hate-fueled violence.

We are closely monitoring the impact that the conflict in the Middle East may have in inspiring foreign terrorist organizations, homegrown violent extremists, and domestic violent extremists both in the United States and abroad.

And all of us have seen the extremely sharp increase in the volume and frequency of threats against Jewish, Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities across our country since October 7. The fear that so many communities are feeling is palpable.

This comes at a time when law enforcement agencies and communities across the country have already been facing significant challenges in the form of violent crime.

We are here together today because we know that no one law enforcement agency, no one community, no one town or city can address these challenges on its own. We need each other. We need to work together.

We are also here in Indianapolis for the same reason that all of us came to public service in the first place: we believe that everyone in our country deserves to feel safe and to be safe in our communities.

Every person, in every neighborhood, deserves to feel protected. Every parent deserves to know that their children will be safe when they play outside.

Violent crime is not just a threat to people’s physical safety; it is a threat to their ability to freely go about their daily lives. Violent crime isolates people and their communities. It deepens the fractures in our public life. And when it is not addressed, it can undermine people’s trust in the government and in each other.

Combating the threat that violent crime poses to people’s safety, and to our shared future, is what motivates us at the Justice Department every day.

Shortly after I was sworn in as Attorney General, we launched our Department-wide Violent Crime Reduction Strategy aimed at addressing the spike in violent crime during the pandemic.

Central to that strategy is the importance of our partnerships.

That includes partnership among federal law enforcement agencies assisting in the fight against violent crime; partnership with the local communities harmed by that crime; and partnership with the state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies protecting those local communities every day.

Another element of that strategy is the recognition that the best anti-violent crime strategies are tailored to the needs of, and are developed with, individual communities.

That’s why one of the first things we did was focus on strengthening Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN). We oriented the program around a set of principles that put community partnerships, community trust, violence prevention, and measuring results at the center of our efforts.

Since then, each of our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices has worked with its partners in state and local law enforcement to develop and implement data-driven, district-specific, anti-violent crime efforts.

Our U.S. Attorneys have brought together law enforcement, research, and community partners to develop PSN programs designed to focus on the drivers of violent crime in their communities. And I am proud of the work they have done. To give just a few examples:

Right here in Indianapolis, less than two weeks ago, a PSN case out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana brought together its partners at the FBI’s Indianapolis Field Office and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department to secure the conviction and sentencing of a repeat violent offender.

In the Middle District of Florida, the office’s PSN strategy has focused not only on the investigation, disruption, and prosecution of violent crime, but also on targeted outreach to members of the community, including students, community leaders, and people incarcerated in state prisons nearing their release dates. This outreach is aimed at preventing violence before it occurs.

And in the Northern District of Alabama, the office created a PSN program, the Operation Safe Families Initiative, to combat the domestic violence that is driving a significant part of the violent crime in that district. In Jefferson County, Alabama, domestic abusers annually commit more than 70% of the homicides.

The Northern District of Alabama’s PSN program brings together — in one building — federal and local prosecutors as well as law enforcement, victim service providers, and other partner agencies.

This program gives victims of domestic violence a place to go that can meet their needs — not just in terms of pursuing enforcement options against the perpetrator, but also in regaining a sense of safety and well-being.

Like PSN, the National Public Safety Partnership, or PSP, is focused on strengthening partnerships across communities to tackle violent crime.

PSP makes DOJ tools and expertise available to local law enforcement agencies as they work to address the unique challenges of their communities. Sites participating in this program are able to consult with and receive training, technical assistance, and an array of Department resources to combat violent crime.

Today I want to welcome the newest sites participating in PSP this year, all of which are represented here today.

Knoxville, Tennessee;

Minneapolis, Minnesota;

Raleigh, North Carolina;

San Antonio, Texas; and

Vallejo, California;

You join more than 50 communities that have worked with DOJ personnel, outside experts, and each other to better understand and tackle the violent crime challenges specific to their communities. We look forward to working together with you.

In addition to PSN and PSP, the Justice Department is putting to use every resource at our disposal in the fight against violent crime.

This includes our prosecutors, who are going after the recidivists and gangs that are responsible for the greatest violence.

This includes our law enforcement components, each of which is working with its state and local law enforcement partners to seize illegal guns and deadly drugs.

And this includes our grantmaking components, which are working closely with communities across the country to provide targeted support and assistance.

We are funding evidence-based, community-centered initiatives aimed at preventing and disrupting violence. We are funding community policing efforts that build the public trust between law enforcement and the community that we know is essential to public safety.

And we are making critical investments in hiring more law enforcement officers in communities nationwide to address the crisis in recruitment and retention to support much-needed resources for law enforcement officer health and wellness.

As we work with our partners nationwide to implement community-tailored approaches to combating violent crime, we also recognize that there are universal challenges that require a comprehensive approach. That includes the epidemic of gun violence.

And that is why ATF is working with its state and local partners to trace more firearms than ever before in its history.

That is why we are operating Crime Gun Intelligence Centers in every ATF Field Division to coordinate comprehensive tracing and ballistics analysis. These centers, which are represented here today, allow state and local law enforcement agencies to harness the power of ATF’s ballistics database and firearms-tracing technologies. This information helps lead them to the repeat shooters who fuel violent crime.

In addition, all 94 of our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices are bringing gun trafficking cases under the new provisions of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.

Those provisions have given us new authorities to go after gun traffickers and straw purchasers responsible for flooding our communities with guns. Our prosecutors have now charged nearly 300 defendants under that Act and seized hundreds of firearms in connection with these cases.

I have mentioned several examples of how the Justice Department is working to implement our partnership-based violent crime strategy.

In implementing that strategy, we have generated a wealth of resources shaped heavily by the feedback we have received from all of you.

But information is only as helpful as it is accessible. That is why, today we are releasing a new publication through the Office of Justice Programs, our Violent Crime Reduction Roadmap.

We have spent two and a half years using every available resource to combat the violent crime spike, and this is a guide to the programs and strategies that we have seen work.

We have seen them work in the District of New Jersey. There, federal, state, and local law enforcement have worked together to target their resources on the individuals and organizations that were primarily driving violent crime in five target cities with the worst violent crime. These efforts have paid off, as the number of shootings have decreased significantly in New Jersey, statewide.

And we have seen them work in the Eastern District of Michigan, where the U.S. Attorney’s Office has partnered with both law enforcement and the community to drive down violent crime in Detroit.

Through the One Detroit Partnership, they have aggressively prosecuted the primary drivers of violence, worked with community groups to prevent violence from occurring, and collaborated with corrections experts to support those who are returning to the community to ensure they do not return to violence.

This kind of partnership works: recent data from the Detroit Police Department indicate that this year the city is on track for the fewest homicides in Detroit in over 60 years.

It is our hope that the Violent Crime Reduction Roadmap provides a starting point for communities across the country to learn about resources available to help them replicate these efforts.

As I said at the start of my remarks, all of our communities are facing urgent and unprecedented challenges today.

But I am encouraged by the data we have been seeing indicating a recent decline in homicides. The FBI has reported that the number of homicides fell over 6% nationally between 2021 and 2022.

And earlier this year, the Major Cities Chiefs Association reported an over 10% decrease in the number of murders across 69 major cities through September of this year, compared to the same time period last year. These developments are encouraging. But this is not a time to relax our efforts. We have so much more to do.

I am even more encouraged by your presence here.

We know that the only way to replicate what is working and to bring violent crime down in every community is learning from each other and by investing in our partnerships.

I know that is what you’re going to be doing over the next three days.

Our work together is our best hope to fulfill the promise that brought us all here — that we will protect each other.

Thank you for your commitment to that work."
330,Justice Department Announces Release of Violent Crime Reduction Roadmap,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-release-violent-crime-reduction-roadmap,"Attorney General Merrick B. Garland announced today the release of the Justice Department’s Violent Crime Reduction Roadmap, a one-stop shop to assist local jurisdictions in developing, implementing, and evaluating strategies to prevent, intervene in, and respond to violent crime. The Roadmap helps connect jurisdictions with the information and resources they need to meet the complex and evolving challenges to help reduce violent crime.

The announcement came during the opening session of the Department’s Violent Crime Reduction Summit, which brings together federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial partners across the country to identify evidence-informed practices to increase public safety, enhance partnerships in the participating communities, and reduce violent crime. The Summit is convening executive leaders and key stakeholders from Project Safe Neighborhoods and National Public Safety Partnership sites, as well as grantees from several violent crime reduction programs including the Local Law Enforcement Crime Gun Intelligence Center Integration Initiative, Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative, and the Rural and Small Department Violent Crime Reduction Program. Also in attendance at the Summit are top Justice Department officials, including Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta and leaders of offices and federal law enforcement agencies across the Department. The Roadmap is part of a comprehensive Justice Department strategy to reduce violent crime.

“We have spent two and a half years using every available resource to combat the violent crime spike we saw during the pandemic, and this is a guide to the programs and strategies that we have seen work,” said Attorney General Garland. “But this is not a time to relax our efforts. We know that the only way to replicate what is working and to bring violent crime down in every community is by learning from each other and by investing in our partnerships.”

The dozens of Justice Department resources available from the Roadmap are organized around actions outlined in Saving Lives: Ten Essential Actions Cities Can Take to Reduce Violence Now, developed by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank for the criminal justice field. These strategies were identified by the Council on Criminal Justice’s (CCJ)’s Violent Crime Working Group, which included experts from community organizations, law enforcement, the public health sector, and academia.

“Effectively addressing violent crime requires partnerships and investments at every level — federal, state, and local law enforcement, and the communities we serve,” said Associate Attorney General Gupta. “This Roadmap is a one-stop shop for Justice Department resources — from funding to training to publications — that can help law enforcement, local leaders, and community members tackle this problem together.”

“This Roadmap lifts up proven solutions and the resources we have available for communities across the country,” said Assistant Attorney General Amy L. Solomon of the Justice Department’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP). “The effort to address violent crime will require continued collaboration and engagement between all stakeholders, and communities themselves. OJP is pleased to identify resources available here and, eventually, across the federal government that can support city leaders to implement these essential actions to save lives.”

The Police Executive Research Forum, funded by OJP’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, will provide local jurisdictions with tailored training and technical assistance on how to implement the 10 essential actions and utilize the Justice Department’s resources identified in the Roadmap, to reduce violent crime while building community trust. Training and technical assistance offerings include specialized expertise to help organizations solve problems and build capacity, and they provide direct connections to subject matter experts as well as how-to materials."
331,"Justice Department Announces Distribution of Over $158.9M to Nearly 25,000 Victims of Madoff Ponzi Scheme",https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-distribution-over-1589m-nearly-25000-victims-madoff-ponzi,"The Justice Department announced today that the Madoff Victim Fund (MVF) began its ninth distribution of over $158.9 million in funds forfeited to the U.S. government in connection with the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BLMIS) fraud scheme.

In this distribution, payments will be sent to 24,875 victims across the globe, bringing their total recoveries to 91% of their fraud losses. Through its nine distributions, MVF has paid over $4.22 billion to 40,843 victims as compensation for losses they suffered from the collapse of BLMIS.

“The department’s Madoff Victim Fund has exceeded expectations in the level of recovery provided to victims of the fraud committed by Bernard Madoff, which devastated thousands of lives,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “To date, the Madoff Victim Fund has assisted more than 40,800 individual victims in recovering over 90% of victim losses. The department continues to prioritize the use of civil asset forfeiture to ensure compensation is available for victims of fraud.”

“In 2009, when the Southern District of New York charged Bernie Madoff for his $64 billion securities fraud ‘Ponzi’ scheme, it was one of the most prolific financial crimes in American history. Among Madoff’s many victims were not only wealthy and institutional investors, but charities and pension funds alike — some of which invested money with Madoff on behalf of individuals working paycheck-to-paycheck who were relying on their pension accounts for their retirements,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. “The financial toll on those who entrusted their money with Madoff was devasting, and this office’s unprecedented efforts to return money to Madoff’s victims has now resulted in clawbacks of 91% of fraud losses to their rightful owners. I commend the career prosecutors of this office for today’s distribution of over $158 million and for their relentless pursuit of justice for victims of Wall Street fraudsters, like Bernie Madoff.”

According to court documents and information presented in related proceedings, for decades, Bernard L. Madoff used his position as chairman of BLMIS, the investment advisory business he founded in 1960, to steal billions of dollars from his clients. On March 12, 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies, admitting that he had turned his wealth management business into the world’s largest Ponzi scheme, benefitting himself, his family, and select members of his inner circle.

On June 29, 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison for running the largest fraudulent scheme in history. Of the over $4 billion that has been made available to victims, approximately $2.2 billion was collected as part of the historic civil forfeiture recovery from the estate of deceased Madoff investor, Jeffry Picower. An additional $1.7 billion was collected as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and civilly forfeited in a parallel action. The remaining funds were collected through a civil forfeiture action against investor Carl Shapiro and his family, and from civil and criminal forfeiture actions against Madoff, Peter B. Madoff, and their co-conspirators.

The MVF’s payouts would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and FBI in the prosecution of Madoff’s crimes and the recovery of assets supporting the forfeiture in the case.

The MVF is overseen by Richard Breeden, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, who serves as Special Master appointed by the Justice Department to assist in connection with the victim remission proceedings. Breeden and his team at MVF provided essential assistance to evaluate over 68,000 remission petitions involving billions in cash flows, and to compute each victim’s fraud losses to enable payments to be made.

More information about MVF and its compensation to victims of BLMIS is at www.madoffvictimfund.com, such as eligibility criteria, process updates, and frequently asked questions. Further questions may be directed to the MVF at 866-624-3670 or info@madoffvictimfund.com."
332,Justice Department Files Statement of Interest in Case Alleging Pennsylvania Jail Unlawfully Denied Access to Medication to Treat Opioid Use Disorder,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-statement-interest-case-alleging-pennsylvania-jail-unlawfully,"The Justice Department filed a statement of interest today explaining how the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to the provision of medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) in jails and prisons. The statement of interest was filed in Strickland v. Delaware County, a lawsuit pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that a county jail violated the ADA by denying an individual access to methadone that was medically necessary to treat his OUD.

“People held in our nation’s jails and prisons, including those with substance use disorders, do not surrender their civil rights at the jailhouse door,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “The ADA requires that jails and prisons individually assess the medical needs of people with disabilities and not categorically deny access to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved OUD medications that many need to effectively treat their disability. The Justice Department will continue to enforce federal civil rights laws to ensure the rights of people with disabilities are protected.”

“My office is dedicated to fighting the opioid epidemic with every tool that we have,” said U.S. Attorney Jacqueline Romero for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. “That includes enforcing the ADA to remove discriminatory barriers to treatment for OUD. Today’s statement of interest reminds jails and prisons about their obligations to address the needs of individuals with OUD and comply with the ADA.”

The Strickland lawsuit alleges that the George W. Hill Correctional Facility in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, unlawfully denied an incarcerated person access to methadone that he was taking to treat OUD under the supervision of a qualified medical provider before his incarceration. The lawsuit also alleges that the jail had a policy of providing methadone only for pregnant individuals and requiring all other individuals who were on methadone when entering the jail to undergo medically supervised withdrawal.

Through the statement of interest, the department explains that the ADA prohibits jails from categorically restricting access to FDA-approved OUD medications, like methadone, without individually assessing whether the person being denied access needs that medication to effectively treat their disability. The statement then sets out why this is required by the ADA and its regulations and aligns with broad consensus in the medical community, including the FDA and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

The ADA prohibits state and local governments from discriminating against individuals with disabilities and protects people in recovery from OUD, including individuals who are taking OUD medication at the direction of a medical provider.

The Justice Department’s submission of this statement of interest furthers its broader efforts to combat discrimination against individuals with OUD and to remove discriminatory barriers to treatment. The Justice Department has issued public guidance on the ADA’s protections for those with OUD. It has entered into multiple settlements with jails and prisons to increase access to OUD medication, including recent agreements in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania; Eastern Kentucky; and Massachusetts. It has undertaken enforcement efforts to combat discrimination against individuals with OUD in court supervision programs in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. It has also entered numerous settlements to address discriminatory barriers to treatment for OUD outside of the criminal justice context, including barriers related to employment, professional licensing, social services and healthcare.

The Civil Rights Division’s Disability Rights Section filed this statement of interest in collaboration with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

For more information on the Civil Rights Division, please visit www.justice.gov/crt. For more information on the ADA, please call the department’s toll-free ADA Information Line at 1-800-514-0301 (TTY 1-833-610-1264) or visit www.ada.gov.

Garland and Justice Department Officials Meet with Law Enforcement Officials in Indianapolis,https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-and-justice-department-officials-meet-law-enforcement,"Thanks everybody. Thanks, Amy. Thanks to everybody from the team at the Office of Justice Programs. Thanks, Karhlton, and everybody from the Bureau of Justice Assistance."
334,Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-us-attorneys-office-southern-1,"Good morning. I think it’s still morning. We’ve got another 15 minutes. Alright, good morning, everyone.

In just a few minutes, Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, U.S. Attorney Myers, and I will meet with some of our federal and state law enforcement partners here. The current elevated threat environment has placed an enormous burden on their shoulders. I am glad I have this chance to thank them directly for their service. I look forward to our discussion.

In the most difficult moments for our communities and for our country, strong partnerships between federal and local law enforcement agencies and the communities we serve, are essential to getting us through.

As always, but especially now, the Justice Department is remaining vigilant in the face of the potential threats of hate-fueled violence and terrorism.

We are closely monitoring the impact that the conflict in the Middle East may have in inspiring foreign terrorist organizations, homegrown violent extremists, domestic violent extremists both abroad and here in the United States.

All of us have also seen a sharp increase in the volume and frequency of threats against Jewish, Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities across our country since October 7.

That’s why, in October, I directed the FBI and each of our U.S. Attorneys to meet with law enforcement and community leaders to discuss what they are seeing on the ground and how we can best support them in the face of these threats.

Senior leadership at the Justice Department and I have done the same. In my conversations with law enforcement, community, and religious leaders, I have reiterated that the Justice Department has no greater priority than protecting the safety and security of everyone in our country.

Protecting all people and all communities from hate-fueled violence was the Justice Department’s founding purpose in 1870, and it remains our urgent purpose today.

As we work together to counter the new and unprecedented threats our communities are facing, we are not taking our eyes off other urgent challenges.

Here in Indiana, and across all 94 of our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, we are continuing to implement our Department-wide strategy to combat the violent crime spike that began during the pandemic.

A cornerstone of that strategy is our partnerships with state and local law enforcement and with the communities they with every single day.

For this Office, that has meant working with the FBI’s Safe Streets Task Force and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department as part of an OCDETF investigation to target the most substantial fentanyl trafficking organizations in central Indiana.

In August, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana announced that it had secured the sentencing of the 20th defendant in connection to a major drug trafficking [investigation]. Over the course of the investigation, law enforcement seized more than 72 pounds of fentanyl, 117 pounds of methamphetamine, 113 firearms, and 60 machine gun conversion devices. Combined, the defendants were sentenced to over 265 years in federal prison.

In June, this office took part in another OCDETF investigation with ATF, the IRS, and the DEA. As a result of that investigation, the office charged a defendant with unlicensed firearms dealing. The defendant is charged with selling more than 590 firearms to two individuals, aware that the firearms he sold would be transported to Mexico.

Law enforcement seized more than 1,000 firearms from the defendant’s residence.

These examples represent just a sliver of the work that our law enforcement officers in the Southern District of Indiana do to fulfill the Department’s mission: to uphold the rule of law, to keep our country and our communities safe, and to protect civil rights.

The Justice Department, and I personally, appreciate just how stressful and dangerous the job of law enforcement is.

In July 2021, a man drove his pickup truck to the gate of an FBI building in Terre Haute and threw a Molotov cocktail toward that building. When Terre Haute Police Detective and FBI Task Force Officer Gregory Ferency walked out of the building, the man shot and killed him. The U.S. Attorney’s Office is currently prosecuting the man we allege is responsible for Officer Ferency’s heinous murder.

Just this past July, Marion County Sheriff’s Office Deputy John Durm was brutally murdered when an inmate he was transporting strangled him to death with the chains of his handcuffs.

In this year alone, five law enforcement officers in the Southern District of Indiana have tragically died in the line of duty.

My heart goes out to these officers’ families, and to the families of so many others who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect their communities.

The Justice Department will do everything in our power to support law enforcement officers and their families. We know that when our officers are safe and supported, our communities are safer too.

Thank you for being here. Now I’m pleased to introduce the Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta."
335,Five Federal Agencies Issue Joint Advisory on Safe Business Practices and Compliant Transfer of Goods,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-federal-agencies-issue-joint-advisory-safe-business-practices-and-compliant-transfer,"The Department of Justice, Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), and Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today issued a joint compliance note highlighting common tactics deployed by malign actors in the maritime and other transportation industries as well as recent enforcement actions taken in response to alleged violations. Today’s note marks the first collective effort by the five agencies to inform the private sector about enforcement trends and provide guidance to the business community on compliance with U.S. sanctions and export laws. The Departments of Justice, Commerce, and the Treasury have previously issued two tri-seal compliance notes.

“Cargo shipments occur in increasingly complex geopolitical environments, and companies operating in this high-risk space must adhere vigilantly to U.S. sanctions and export control laws,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew G. Olsen. “As today’s joint alert makes clear, we will hold accountable companies that do not maintain rigorous compliance programs and violate the law.”

“Those who move cargo play a key role in helping to prevent sensitive goods and technologies from falling into the hands of proliferators, terrorists, and other malign actors,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “Across the federal government, we are united in our message – if you have a role in moving cargo, you have a responsibility to ensure your services are not being exploited by those who would do this country harm.”

“As Iran and other sanctioned actors increasingly use deceptive shipping practices to attempt sanctions evasion, those operating in the shipping sector need to be vigilant and employ risk-based compliance measures to counteract these threats,” said Director Brad Smith of OFAC. “Engaging with these actors not only risks civil penalties for U.S. companies, but also non-U.S. companies that cause U.S. persons to violate sanctions.”

“Training, outreach, and information sharing between the federal government and the transportation industry are the first lines of defense in preventing foreign adversaries from illegally obtaining sensitive U.S. technology for nefarious purposes,” said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of HSI. “It’s extremely important we remain vigilant and work collaboratively to ensure compliance remains at the forefront of what we do, as our nation depends on it.”

The compliance note describes various deceptive shipping and transportation tactics deployed by malign actors to facilitate the illicit transfer of cargo. In addition, the note advises companies doing business in these industries to implement and strengthen their compliance controls as necessary, especially when operating in high-risk areas or with counterparties who exhibit odd behavior. The note further identifies several compliance practices that may assist companies in identifying potential efforts to evade U.S. laws.

The compliance note also highlights criminal and civil enforcement authorities that the relevant agencies have taken to combat the illicit shipment of cargo as well as recent enforcement actions. These cases include the first-ever criminal resolution by the Department of Justice against a bareboat charter of a crude oil tanker carrying contraband Iranian oil and civil enforcement actions taken by BIS and OFAC imposing civil monetary penalties.

The note makes clear that companies engaged in the maritime or other transportation industries must be vigilant in their compliance efforts. Such vigilance includes assessing their risk profile for potential violations of U.S. sanctions and export laws, implementing rigorous compliance controls to mitigate those risks, and taking any other steps necessary to verify the true nature, origin, and destination of cargo they are involved in transporting."
336,South New Jersey Residents Charged for Roles in Dog Fighting Conspiracy Involving the “DMV Board”,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/south-new-jersey-residents-charged-roles-dog-fighting-conspiracy-involving-dmv-board,"Two New Jersey residents were charged for their participation in a dog fighting ring that involved the “DMV Board,” a Telegram-based dog fighting collective spanning several states. Tommy J. “Snakes” Watson, of Clayton, and Johnnie Lee Nelson Jr., of Bridgeton, appeared in court on the charges today and last Tuesday, respectively.

According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court, Watson and Nelson conspired with others to fight, train, transport and possess pit bull-type dogs in dog fighting ventures from August 2017 through March 2019, in violation of the federal Animal Welfare Act. Watson and others conducted a dog fighting operation known as “From Da Bottom Kennels” and fought pit bull-type dogs in dog fights, housed and trained dogs for dog fighting and acquired, without veterinarian assistance or scrutiny, medical equipment including skin staplers to treat dogs injured during fights. Watson and others also used the “DMV Board” to transmit videos of live-streamed dog fights, dogs training to fight and underperforming fighting dogs being killed including by hanging.

Watson fought two dogs, including one named “Bunz,” in a December 2018 dog fight at a location on Center Road in Upper Deerfield Township, New Jersey. Watson also trained and transported a third dog, named “Rambo,” for a dog fight event at the same location on March 23, 2019, which law enforcement disrupted. Two still-fighting dogs were discovered by law enforcement at the Center Road location inside a car where participants had placed the dogs before fleeing to avoid detection by law enforcement. Nelson trained “Rambo” for purposes of having him fight in the March 23, 2019 dog fight event at the Center Road location. Watson is also charged with the unlawful possession of ammunition that he brought to the dog fight event.

If convicted, Watson and Nelson each face penalties up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine per count of animal fighting charges. Watson also faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the ammunition charge.

Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) and U.S. Attorney Philip K. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey made the announcement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of the Inspector General, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations and detectives with the Cumberland County, New Jersey, Prosecutor’s Office are investigating the case, which remains ongoing.

Senior Trial Attorney Ethan Eddy of ENRD’s Environmental Crimes Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kathleen O’Leary and Desiree Grace for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the case.

An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce and BAE Systems Electronic Systems, a business unit of BAE Systems, Inc., have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms (PMT) to provide approximately $35 million in federal incentives under the CHIPS and Science Act to support the modernization of the company’s Microelectronics Center, a mature-node production facility in Nashua, New Hampshire. The project will replace aging tools and quadruple the production of chips necessary for critical defense programs including the F-35 fighter jet program.



The Department’s PMT with BAE Systems, Inc., marks the beginning of the next phase of implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act, a key part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda.



“We have been clear since day one that the CHIPS for America Program is about advancing our national security and strengthening domestic supply chains, all while creating good jobs supporting long-term U.S. economic growth. As national security becomes as much about the chips inside of our weapons systems as the weapons systems themselves, this first CHIPS announcement shows how central semiconductors are to our national defense,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, we have reached preliminary terms to make a substantial investment in New Hampshire’s expanding defense industrial base, which will help make our country and supply chains more secure and bolster the economy of the Granite State.”

“This announcement delivers on President Biden’s commitment to restoring American leadership on semiconductors, advancing our national security, and creating good family-sustaining jobs here in New Hampshire and around the country,” said Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard.

“This announcement of the PMT with BAE Systems, Inc., demonstrates our vision for the CHIPS for America program to ensure that we have a robust production capacity for the chips vital to U.S. national security,” said Under Secretary of Commerce of Commerce for Standards and Technology Dr. Laurie E. Locascio. “This is the first of many announcements that will enhance our nation’s manufacturing capacity and create new jobs and opportunities in communities across the country.”

“Microelectronics are at the heart of the technology and products we make for our defense and aerospace customers—from next-generation aircraft and satellites to military-grade GPS and secure communications,” said Tom Arseneault, president and CEO of BAE Systems, Inc. “This funding will help modernize our Microelectronics Center and fulfill the promise of the CHIPS and Science Act by increasing our capacity to serve national defense programs, growing our technical workforce, and helping to strengthen the nation’s onshore supply chain. This initiative is the result of a strong partnership with federal, state, and local government.”

As explained in the Department’s first Notice of Funding Opportunity, the Department may offer applicants a PMT on a non-binding basis after satisfactory completion of the merit review of a full application. The PMT outlines key terms for a CHIPS incentives award, including the amount and form of the award. After the PMT is signed, the Department begins a comprehensive due diligence process on the proposed project and other information contained in the application. After satisfactory completion of the due diligence phase, the Department may enter into final award documents with the applicant. Terms of the final award documents are subject to negotiations with the applicant and may differ from the terms of the PMT.

President Biden signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act into law in August 2022, which is a critical part of revitalizing American semiconductor manufacturing to create jobs, strengthen supply chains, protect national security, and advance U.S. competitiveness.

In a little more than a year since the CHIPS Act was signed into law, the Department has moved quickly to create the CHIPS Program Office and the CHIPS R&D Office and has built a team that represents decades of experience across industry and government. In February 2023, the Department released the first Notice of Funding Opportunity for commercial manufacturing facilities, and then opened it to include large supply chain projects. The Department also released a Notice of Funding Opportunity for smaller semiconductor supply chain projects and expects to launch the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) in the near future.

About CHIPS for America



The Department has received more than 550 statements of interest and nearly 150 pre-applications, full applications, and concept plans for CHIPS Incentives. The Department is continuing to conduct rigorous evaluation of applications to determine which projects will advance U.S. national economic security, attract more private capital, and deliver other economic benefits to the country.



CHIPS for America is part of President Biden’s economic plan to invest in America, stimulate private sector investment, create good-paying jobs, make more in the United States, and revitalize communities left behind. CHIPS for America includes the CHIPS Program Office, responsible for manufacturing incentives, and the CHIPS Research and Development Office, responsible for R&D programs, that both sit within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the Department of Commerce. NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST is uniquely positioned to successfully administer the CHIPS for America program because of the bureau’s strong relationships with U.S. industries, its deep understanding of the semiconductor ecosystem, and its reputation as fair and trusted.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. and Mexico have resolved a Rapid Response Mechanism petition under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that alleged INISA2000 — an Aguascalientes, Mexico, denim garment facility — denied freedom of association and collective bargaining rights.

To reach the successful conclusion, the government of Mexico collaborated with INISA2000 to hold trainings on freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Mexican government also oversaw company efforts to remediate workers’ claims, which included the following:

Issuing a statement on employer neutrality with respect to worker organizing.

Creating zero tolerance policies to support the realization of these rights.

Training workers and managers on these new policies.

“The U.S. Department of Labor welcomes the efforts by the government of Mexico, the petitioners and INISA2000 to address the issues at this plant, the garment sector’s first Rapid Response Mechanism case,” said Deputy Undersecretary for International Affairs Thea Lee. “The case demonstrates the value of our commitment to partnering with Mexico to resolve cases, regardless of covered sector. We believe it will lead to positive outcomes for workers and serve the core interest of both governments.”

“This matter marked the first time the United States invoked the RRM outside of the auto sector and the 10th time the RRM was invoked overall, exemplifying this administration’s continued commitment to ensuring our trade tools serve to defend workers’ rights across sectors,” said Ambassador Katherine Tai. “We commend the Government of Mexico and INISA for their efforts to generate positive outcomes for workers.”

The announcement follows a U.S. request for review of a petition filed in May 2023 by the Frente Autentico de Trabajo and the Sindicato de Trabajadores de Industrias del Interior. An investigation by the department and USTR centered on claims of employer interference in union activities, including attempts to impose a collective bargaining agreement on the workforce outside of the established legal process.

Before filing its petition, the Frente Autentico de Trabajo, a confederation of labor unions, and the union engaged with state labor authorities in Aguascalientes through new channels established by Mexico’s labor reform to resolve collective disputes. The negotiations reached by the union and employer through conciliation formed the basis for the U.S.-Mexico agreed-upon Course of Remediation completed on Nov. 10, 2023.

The department and USTR co-chair the Interagency Labor Committee for Monitoring and Enforcement.

340,Investigation finds Ohio food processor’s failure to guard machine’s moving parts led temporary worker to suffer amputation injury,https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/oalj/oalj20231211,"Investigation finds Ohio food processor’s failure to guard machine’s moving parts led temporary worker to suffer amputation injury

OSHA assesses Zwanenberg Food Group USA with $242K in proposed penalties

CINCINNATI ‒ A federal workplace safety investigation at one of the world’s leading suppliers of processed foods found a temporary worker’s finger amputation occurred when they reached into a meat grinder’s discharge port that lacked required safety guards.

On June 23, 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration responded to a report of a serious injury suffered by a 29-year-old kitchen worker at Zwanenberg Food Group USA in Cincinnati. OSHA learned that the worker had been on the job seven months.

OSHA cited the company for two repeat violations, one for not having required machine guarding on the discharge port, and one for failing to train employees on the company’s lockout/tagout procedures. Zwanenberg Food Group USA faces $242,197 in proposed OSHA penalties.

The incident — the second time since 2022 that a temporary worker suffered an amputation — marks the fourth time since 2017 that OSHA inspectors have found the company violated lockout/tagout safety standards meant to protect workers from contact with moving machine parts. Zwanenberg Food Group USA’s safety failures led OSHA to include the company in the agency’s Severe Violator Enforcement Program in 2017.

OSHA viewed the most recent incident as part of a pattern that led the agency to investigate if workers at Zwanenberg faced imminent danger from unguarded or inadequately guarded machinery. With production paused after the incident, the company agreed to correct guarding hazards on its processing equipment, train employees on safe machine operation, and implement safety program improvements, all of which OSHA will monitor.

“While they have taken a first important step at this plant, Zwanenberg Food Group needs to change their workplace culture and make worker safety a priority,” said OSHA Area Director Ken Montgomery in Cincinnati. “As an employer, they are responsible for protecting their temporary workers and making sure they are trained on workplace hazards and control measures to address those hazards.”

In April 2023, OSHA assessed the company $1.9 million in proposed penalties after another temporary worker suffered injuries on Oct. 12, 2022. OSHA cited the plant for similar violations less than two weeks before the October 2022 injury. The company is contesting both 2022 investigations.

Based in Cincinnati, Zwanenberg Food Group USA is a subsidiary of Holland-based Zwanenberg Food Group, founded in 1875. The privately held food company has 12 production facilities in the U.S., Netherlands and United Kingdom. Zwanenberg’s product line includes cooked ham, chili, luncheon meat, soups, stew, corned beef hash and pastas marketed under the Vietti, Southgate, Halal and other private label brands. The company employs about 175 workers at the Cincinnati facility.

The company has contested the findings and will appear before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

Today, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra hosted leaders from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) civil rights organizations in Washington to discuss actions the Department has taken to advance health equity, increase access to health care, secure non-discrimination protections, and increase access to behavioral health for the LGBTQI+ community.
During the meeting, Secretary Becerra highlighted some of these actions to date, including:
Strengthening data collection: Progress to increase the collection of  Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) data across HHS programs, which helps HHS achieve its mission and its Healthy People 2030 goals by identifying disparities in health and human services. As identified in the Federal Evidence Agenda on LGBTQI+ Equity, this progress to improve the collection of SOGI data seeks to improve the health and well-being of LGBTQI+ people.
Investing in health equity: The National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) new notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) to support innovative research to address health disparities among the LGBTQI+ community.
Supporting LGBTQI+ youth: A newly released ASPE brief on Emerging Practices for Supporting LGBTQI+ Young People Across Human Services Programs, which shares practices for service providers to support the needs and well-being of LGBTQI+ young people in their programs and communities.
Strengthening civil rights protections: HHS has issued multiple landmark proposed regulations to protect LGBTQI+ individuals and families from discrimination. Those rules include:
	A proposed rule from HHS’s Office for Civil Rights and the Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources (ASFR) proposed changes to the HHS Grant Rule which would protect LGBTQI+ people from discrimination in important health and human services programs by clarifying and reaffirming the prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in certain statutes.
A proposed rule from HHS’s Office for Civil Rights which would update implementation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to protect against discrimination based on an individual’s HIV status or diagnosis of gender dysphoria. A proposed rule from HHS’s Administration for Children and Families which would ensure LGBTQI+ youth in foster care receive safe and appropriate placements.
A proposed rule from HHS’s Office for Civil Rights which would strengthen health care non-discrimination protections for LGBTQI+ patients under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.

HHS is committed to building on this progress in order to deliver on the promise of health equity for communities that have often been underserved and under-resourced.
The following representatives participated in the meeting:

342,Live Whole Health #199: Playing with your schedule,https://news.va.gov/126997/live-whole-health-199-playing-your-schedule/,"If you shared your calendar with a friend, what they find a slot or scheduled time for play? Or just appointments, jobs and chores?

Other than special events, it seems, we rarely put fun activities on our calendars. We think of fun as optional. Something to do after our chores are done. The problem is that our to-do lists grow like weeds—as soon as one chore is done, another pops up!

Block time for fun!

Blocking time for hobbies, fun, and relaxation can be helpful in many ways. Here are a few thoughts:

Gives you something to look forward to. Think about a time you were able to schedule a short trip. You didn’t only benefit from the trip itself, but from imagining what you would do, planning for it, and talking with friends and family about it. A weekend trip provides more than two days of fun, including the weeks of excitement leading up to it. Knowing something fun is on your calendar provides a similar boost of happiness even before you do it.

Helps you use your time wisely. How many times have you found yourself with a free hour or two and ended up sitting on the couch trying to find something to watch on TV? If you plan to read, play music, paint, or go for a walk during that hour, you’ll benefit more than from spending the entire time channel surfing.

Prioritizes self-care. A life without play can lead to depression, hopelessness, burnout and irritation; yet play is rarely a priority for us. Scheduling time for play is part of your health and well-being, and it can lead to a better mood, stronger relationships and a greater sense of personal satisfaction.

Start here by listening to this 10-minute visualization exercise: Scheduling Pleasant Activities. You can then practice setting aside 30-60 minutes a few times a week for doing things you enjoy. Once it becomes part of a regular routine, you may find yourself prioritizing and looking forward to those appointments, and you’ll still get your chores done.

343,Innovation Experience event celebrates another year of transforming Veteran care,https://news.va.gov/126546/innovation-celebrates-year-of-transforming-care/,"The 2023 VHA Innovation Experience (iEX), hosted by VA’s Office of Healthcare Innovation and Learning (OHIL), brought nearly 700 VA employees, Veterans and industry professionals together to celebrate another year of transforming Veteran care.

Keeping Veterans at the Center of Innovation

Attendees, driven innovators and leaders started the three-day event with representatives from each of OHIL’s programs: Innovation Ecosystem, Office of Advanced Manufacturing, Center for Care and Payment Innovation, and SimLEARN.

VA Secretary Denis McDonough recognized VA employees for delivering more care to more Veterans than anytime in VA’s history. “We need you thinking big about Veteran-centric care so we can do even better, ensuring Vets have access to the highest quality, world-class, evidence-based care,” he said.

During a VA Data Analytics breakout session, OHIL’s Director of Data and Analytics Innovation, Dr. Amanda Lineau, summed up the need for innovation-focused programs by emphasizing that, “Connecting those who see the real problem with people who have the skills to solve those problems is core to our success.”

VA’s most valuable asset—employees

Day two began with a focus on the value that VA employees bring to the table and included a panel discussion on “How Government Innovation Accelerates Industry Impact.”

“Everyone has a challenge, and these are wildly different people from very different backgrounds. That’s what makes us strong. The who is the community and the where is everywhere,” said Allison Amrhein, director of the VHA Innovators Network.

VA Under Secretary for Health Dr. Shereef Elnahal kicked off the VHA Shark Tank Competition, issuing a call to action for everyone to identify barriers and take the necessary actions to address and overcome the problem in the name of improving Veteran care. Elnahal noted how programs such as Shark Tank allow VA to validate innovations that provide a tangible benefit to Veterans.

The competition included pitches on innovative solutions to address VA’s health care priorities. The 10 Promising Practice winners now move on to spread their innovations to additional VA facilities.

Inspiring innovation

The Mission Daybreak panel on VA’s top clinical priority, preventing Veteran suicide, reminded us that a culture of innovation to address the most pressing health care challenges faced by Veterans: getting buy-in from everyone involved.

Dr. Carolyn Clancy, assistant under secretary for Health for Discovery, Education and Affiliate Networks, concluded the three-day event by announcing the 2023 Dr. Robert L. Jesse Awards for Excellence in Innovation and inspiring attendees to take what they’ve learned home.

“Stay curious. I encourage you to apply what you’ve learned in seeking new ways of envisioning care and services for Veterans. Ask questions and feed your passion for learning and innovation,” she said.

The 2023 Innovation Experience welcomed innovators from across the country and showcased how VA continues to advance care for Veterans. Want to learn more about innovation at VA?

345,G7 Interior and Security Ministers’ Communiqué,https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/12/11/g7-interior-and-security-ministers-communique,"Preamble

We, the G7 Interior and Security Ministers, together with the European Commissioner for Home Affairs and the Secretary General of INTERPOL, met in Mito, Ibaraki on December 8 to 10, 2023. We were also joined by the Interior Minister of Ukraine. We gathered to discuss the global challenges to our safety and security, and renew our commitment to fight against threats to our societies and values. We are more united than ever, particularly in the context of an increasingly severe global security situation, to address the current challenges we face, guided by common values and principles, including freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and respect for gender equality and human rights. We remain determined to work with our partners to enhance our efforts to counter an array of common challenges and provide our people a safer, more secure, and better future. We build on the previous commitments of the G7 Interior and Security Ministers’ Meetings since 2017, in which we set our common agenda to address the current and emerging challenges based on our shared values. We welcome the ongoing efforts and intensification of cooperation of the G7 Roma-Lyon Group (RLG) to prevent terrorism and violent extremism and counter organized crime under Japan’s presidency in 2023.

Continued Solidarity With and Support for Ukraine

Our steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine’s fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity will never waver. We once again condemn, in the strongest possible terms, Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Recalling the G7 Hiroshima Leaders’ Communiqué, we reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace. We condemn all types of crimes committed in the context of Russia’s war. There must be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities, including Russia’s unlawful killings, sexual violence, and torture. In this context, we reiterate our commitment to holding those responsible to account consistent with international law, including by supporting the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities and international bodies such as the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) at Eurojust. We strongly condemn the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian civilians, including children, to Russia and elsewhere, and will continue to follow the progress of the ICC investigations in this regard with the utmost attention, and call for the immediate and safe return of all children, including those facing heightened risk of trafficking in persons. We reiterate the need for close cooperation between international and national authorities, supported by Europol and Eurojust, to ensure those responsible for international crimes can be held accountable. We stand with Ukraine as it seeks to counter the impacts of Russia’s war on the Ukrainian people. We thank H.E. Ihor Klymenko, Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, for joining. We discussed a range of subjects including the situation on the ground in Ukraine, and needs of Ukrainian law enforcement authorities in facing a range of threats in both the short and long term. We commit to supporting Ukrainian authorities through capacity-building measures, training, and the provision of urgently needed equipment to take all available steps to protect the people and sovereignty of Ukraine. We recognize Ukraine’s ambitious reforms, including on anti-corruption, and welcome the launch of the G7 Justice Ministers’ “Anti-Corruption Task Force for Ukraine”, and endeavor to coordinate our efforts and seek synergies with the Task Force when providing assistance to Ukraine related to anti-corruption. We are determined to deny Russia, Russian entities, and individuals that are complicit in the war the ability to hide and benefit from their assets in our jurisdictions. In coordination with our foreign, finance, and criminal justice counterparts, we will continue to work through the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force to enhance the effectiveness of our restrictive measures against Russia, together with the EU Freeze and Seize Task Force and the Task Force KleptoCapture. We recall and reaffirm the G7 Leaders’ Statement on February 24, 2023, the G7 Leaders’ Statement on Ukraine on May 19, 2023, and the G7 Leaders’ Statement on December 6, 2023, along with the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Statement on November 8, 2023, that stated, consistent with our respective legal systems, Russia’s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine. We reiterate our unwavering resolve to impose and enforce sanctions and other economic measures to further undermine Russia’s capacity to wage its illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression. We remain committed to countering any attempts to evade and undermine our sanction measures.

All Forms of Terrorism and Violent Extremism

We reiterate and underline the G7 Leaders’ Statement on December 6, 2023 that unequivocally condemned the horrific terror attacks across Israel by Hamas and others that began on October 7, 2023, and call for the immediate release of all remaining hostages without preconditions. The current situation in the Middle East not only poses a threat to global security and has a direct impact on our societies, but also raises humanitarian concerns. We emphasize Israel’s right to defend itself and its people against Hamas, in accordance with international law, as it seeks to prevent a recurrence of these traumatic events, which included murder, hostage-taking, sexual violence, and attacks on children. Hamas offers nothing but suffering to the Palestinian people, and it is an obstacle to a better future for them and for the region. We will continue to coordinate our efforts to isolate Hamas and ensure it cannot threaten Israel. We are also deeply concerned with the devastating impact on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza. Regional actors must cease de-stabilizing activities. We condemn the rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians, which undermines security and stability in the West Bank, and threatens prospects for a lasting peace. Those who have committed crimes must be held to account. We express our deep concern with the rise of hateful speech and acts across the world since the beginning of the conflict, and categorically reject antisemitism, anti-Muslim hatred, and any forms of discrimination on the basis of race, religion or belief. It disturbs peace and social cohesion, and above all it threatens Jewish, Muslim, and Arab people. We, the G7 Interior and Security Ministers and the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, stress our steadfast commitment to act decisively and jointly to protect these people from antisemitism, anti-Muslim hatred, and any forms of discrimination as well as actions incited by violent extremist actors that have been reported across our societies by taking all possible actions, including preventive and educational measures as well as decisive action by our security authorities as appropriate. The world continues to suffer from attacks by terrorist and violent extremist groups and lone actors, espousing a range of violent extremist ideologies and inspired by local, regional and global movements of all motivations. In this regard, we reaffirm our strong resolve to prevent and counter all forms of terrorism and violent extremism, both online and offline, at the national and international levels through collective efforts among the G7 members. We reiterate the importance of collective efforts on countering terrorism and violent extremism, and continue to collaborate at the domestic and international levels to ensure our efforts are thorough, appropriate, and effective. We also ensure that our responses respect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. We continue to increase our capabilities to prevent and counter threats, identify those who pose a risk, and protect populations, in particular at-risk communities, from acts of violence. We continue to emphasize the need for collaborative prevention efforts, using the G7 frameworks such as the RLG to take collective action. Terrorists and violent extremists utilize the Internet to disseminate illegal and harmful content, including terrorist and violent extremist content, to finance terrorist and violent extremist activities, recruit individuals to their cause, encourage radicalization to violence, and incite both physical and online attacks. We once again join our leaders in calling on the private sector to step up their efforts to address the dissemination of terrorist and violent extremist content online. We reaffirm our cooperation with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) and stress the importance of expanding GIFCT membership to include a broader range of technology companies, as well as helping smaller platforms identify and address terrorist and violent extremist content, in partnership with Tech Against Terrorism. We also reiterate our support for the Christchurch Call to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online and welcome the achievements made since its adoption in May 2019. We call on the GIFCT and its member companies to renew their commitment to prioritize addressing terrorist and violent extremist content online, in line with the Christchurch commitments, and to do more to address terrorist and violent extremist content, especially the rise in antisemitism and anti- Muslim hatred online since October 7, 2023. We emphasize the importance of building and maintaining trust between governments, including law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve, to create a society resilient to threats of terrorism and violent extremism. In this sense, democracy, the rule of law and good governance are essential in fostering effective and non-violent means for addressing political, social and other grievances. We reiterate our strong commitment to work together with all relevant actors, including civil society, to prevent and counter all forms of terrorism and violent extremism, and their financing. This includes countering cross-border movement of known terrorists via information sharing and screening through platforms such as INTERPOL, and ensuring our tools and policies are adapted to respond to the current threat landscape while protecting the most vulnerable.

Ensuring Economic Security

Recalling the G7 Leaders’ Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security on May 20, 2023, and the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Communiqué on April 18, 2023, along with the commitments from other Ministerial tracks, we also stand strong to do our part in ensuring economic security and countering threats to our democratic values. We are faced with both state-led and non-state-led activities that aim to acquire our cutting- edge technologies through exploitation of our open economic systems, economic espionage, evasion of sanctions and export controls, and other forms of covert intelligence collection. Additionally, otherwise-legitimate activities, such as foreign direct investment and provision of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can be abused by malicious actors to gain access to sensitive assets or data with implications for national security. In accordance with our respective legal frameworks, we will continue to implement export control measures, refine investment screening regimes, and secure supply chains, without unduly limiting trade and investment. We will work with international partners to intensify our collective effort to close gaps in our dual-use technology protection ecosystem and mitigate risks to national security stemming from foreign investments, preventing the exploitation of legitimate economic activity to advance aggression or provocations. We will take action to identify and mitigate risks of disruptions to critical infrastructures underpinning our supply chains.

Countering Threats to Peace, Security, and Our Democratic Values

We remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in North Korea, which is driven by North Korea’s choice to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of the people in North Korea. We reaffirm our commitment to ensure effective implementation of sanctions under relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions and prevent and address sanctions evasion and attempts in cyberspace to steal and launder digital assets. We urge North Korea to respect human rights and resolve the abductions issue immediately. We are increasingly concerned by hybrid threats and foreign interference activities, including information manipulation, spread of mis-, mal-, and disinformation, as well as transnational repression, by foreign states or non-state actors acting on their behalf, attempting to sow discord in our democracies across the globe. We join our colleagues and counterparts among the G7 in amplifying the strength and benefits of democracies and the freedoms they guarantee for every citizen, including the freedom of expression. We reaffirm our support for the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism to strengthen the G7 coordination in identifying and responding to foreign threats against democracies. In this regard, we strongly condemn the widespread use of information manipulation and disinformation by Russia and others. Recognizing the corrosive impact of these multifaceted threats to societies, we will foster resilience through a whole-of-society approach in protecting our information, technologies, and upholding our democratic values.

Keeping Cyberspace Safe

Recalling the G7 Hiroshima Leaders’ Communiqué, we reaffirm that governance of the digital economy should continue to be updated in line with our shared democratic values. These include fairness; accountability; transparency; safety; protection from online harassment, hate and abuse; and respect for privacy, human rights, fundamental freedoms and the protection of personal data. We join our Digital and Tech Ministers in promoting an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet. At the same time, as the G7 Ministers responsible for security, we are concerned with the ever-increasing dangers that cyberspace can have when misused by actors with malicious intent. We remain aware of that the Internet hosts a range of illegal content, including child sexual abuse materials, and harmful content, including content that can facilitate and encourage illegal and violent acts, such as manuals on how to assemble homemade firearms and explosives. We are committed to protecting our citizens from acts of terrorism and violent extremism, child sexual exploitation and abuse, fraud and other crimes that may be accelerated through the use of cyberspace, including by ensuring the appropriate frameworks in place are used. We will also leverage our partnerships with the ICT industry with a view to identifying and responding to such illegal and harmful content from cyberspace as appropriate. We recognize that both governments and the private sector need to work together consistent with domestic legislation and international obligation to ensure an effective approach to illegal and harmful content. We will strengthen our outreach efforts to empower Internet users and civil society on crime prevention related to cyberspace. We will promote public-private partnerships among industry, government, and academia, following best practices of the EU Internet Forum and other relevant international fora and communities. We encourage all state and non-state actors to act responsibly in cyberspace. Echoing our Foreign Ministers, we encourage China to uphold its commitments to act responsibly in cyberspace, including refraining from conducting or supporting cyber-enabled intellectual property theft. We will step up our cooperation to counter North Korea’s malicious cyber activities. We will collectively take international action to eliminate safe havens from which cybercriminals, such as Russian ransomware actors, can too often act with seeming impunity. We will continue to do our part in promoting the rule of law in cyberspace, countering cybercrime through the utilization of human-rights based international frameworks, and increasing information sharing with partners and strengthening cooperation in investigations in their actions. We continue to prioritize the international collaboration that is necessary to confront the global scourge of ransomware, phishing and other cybercrimes, including through fora such as the International Counter Ransomware Initiative. We will strengthen law enforcement and other relevant agencies’ cooperation among our nations to identify threats and preserve and obtain vital evidence needed to investigate cybercrimes and bring to justice those who are committing these crimes. Emerging technologies in cyberspace, including generative artificial intelligence (AI), offer many opportunities with respect to our work and society. While we must continue to harness the capabilities of these emerging technologies to keep our citizens safe and secure, we must also recognize that these technologies can be misused by criminals, terrorists and violent extremists to further their activities. We also recognize that such technologies can increase the scale of harm and make it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to identify, investigate and prosecute these crimes. To deal with this increased threat, we will continue to share information of the latest modus operandi of illicit activities, leverage our individual and collective capabilities, including by updating the capacities of our law enforcement agencies, work in partnership with industry to evaluate and minimize the risks of exploitation, promote information integrity, and seek to balance the rights and responsibilities of all stakeholders with a view to protecting the security and privacy of our citizens. We welcome the G7 Leaders’ Statement on Hiroshima AI Process on October 30, 2023 as well as the G7 Leaders’ Statement on December 6, 2023, and will prioritize the actions called for in the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems and the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for All AI Actors and Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems, keeping in mind that our efforts can lead emerging technology development to support the common good worldwide. Online privacy and security safeguards, such as strong encryption, are critical to protecting our citizens online and serve a vital purpose in repressive states to protect journalists, human rights defenders and vulnerable people. However, the rapid implementation of private and secure communication technologies without consideration of public safety and with limited or no consultation with democratic governments poses significant challenges in our ability to protect our citizens. Building on our collaboration to date and recalling previous statements made by the G7, we will work together to maintain tightly controlled lawful access to communications content that is vital to the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes, including terrorism and violent extremism and child sexual exploitation and abuse, and will work in partnership with technology companies to do this to protect the safety of our citizens. In this regard, we call on the private sector to increase their efforts to engage with democratic governments and civil society on secure communication technologies and ensure safety is considered at the design phase, including maintaining tightly controlled lawful access, when developing these technologies. To this end, we encourage the RLG to continue discussing respective approaches and sharing best practices in this field.

Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse

We affirm our strong collective commitment to tackle all forms of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Protecting children around the world, both online and offline, remains our top priority. We are concerned with the rise in child sexual exploitation and abuse, and recognize that the Internet, including social media platforms, continues to offer many opportunities for perpetrators to recruit, advertise, lure and groom, “sextort,” abuse, and exploit children, share images and videos depicting child sexual exploitation and abuse, including through “live streaming,” have children trafficked for sexual exploitation, and to normalize and hide these crimes. We are pleased to see the ongoing international consensus to prioritize tackling this issue, including through a recent UN call to action on removing known child sexual exploitation and abuse material from the Internet. We underscore that it is our individual and collective responsibility as governments and societies to do all we can to keep children safe from child sexual exploitation and abuse. In this regard, we remain committed to strengthening cooperation among the G7 and our partners and will continue to hold the perpetrators accountable using all the tools that our laws permit, We acknowledge the strong role of victims’ and survivors’ voices and perspectives to inform our respective policy orientations, to help raise awareness of these crimes, and to support effective action in delivering future change and building appropriate safeguarding responses. We are committed to deepening our engagement with victims, survivors, and the organizations that work to support them going forward. We recognize that it takes a whole-of-society effort, together with global action and standards to protect children from and fight against child sexual exploitation and abuse. We join the G7 Leaders in calling on the private sector to step up their efforts to identify and stop these crimes on their platforms. We stress the importance of each actor, including technology companies, taking all the steps they can to play their part in keeping children safe online around the world. We urge the ICT industry to further their cooperation with government, particularly with law enforcement agencies on information sharing, investigations, and reporting of online child sexual abuse material. We call on industry to take effective proactive action against child sexual exploitation and abuse, ensure that they do not inadvertently facilitate these crimes on their services, and that safety is prioritized at the design phase for the sake of countering serious threats and preventing harm to children, including by endorsing, and transparently implementing and reporting their progress on the Voluntary Principles to Counter Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. We reaffirm our commitment to the 2021 G7 Action plan to combat Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. We will continue to promote measures toward eliminating child sexual abuse materials on the Internet in close collaboration with the ICT industry, especially social media and other forms of online communication companies, along with civil society, including NGOs and wider international partners, as set out in Annex I.

Transnational Organized Crime

We affirm our joint effort to fight transnational organized crime in all its manifestations, including drug trafficking, firearms trafficking, trafficking in persons, migrant smuggling, child sexual exploitation and abuse, cybercrime, ransomware threats, crimes that affect the environment, corruption, fraud, intellectual property theft, copy right infringements, property crime, and money laundering. We further acknowledge that as transnational organized crime rapidly evolves, we need to better understand the linkages between different crime types and the tendency for illicit organizations to engage in polycriminality. We affirm our commitment to various international cooperation frameworks (e.g. INTERPOL, Europol, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), to continued engagement with other relevant international experts/bodies (e.g. civil society, academia), and to provide information and available resources. We acknowledge the need for law enforcement officials to continue to share information amongst themselves, investigate and build knowledge and capacity, especially on ICT, to adapt and respond to the evolving modus operandi employed by transnational organized crime networks and their engagement in polycriminality. Particularly regarding transnational organized fraud, we declare our enhancing cooperation in line with Annex II. INTERPOL and its global stop payment mechanism, and the private sector including the financial and technology sector. In particular, being conscious of the fact that criminals are increasingly using digital assets to launder the proceeds of crime by taking advantage of their anonymous nature, we reaffirm our commitments through the international anti-money laundering mechanisms and reiterate the need to continue to develop rules and regulations to prevent criminal actors from exploiting our valuable economic infrastructure, and to prevent jurisdictional arbitrage by virtual asset providers. We support initiatives by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on accelerating global implementation of the FATF Standards on virtual assets, including the “travel rule,” and its work on emerging risks. We endeavor to increase cooperation among the G7 members for freezing the digital assets transaction accounts and ensuring that mechanisms exist for the expeditious recovery of proceeds of crime that are digital assets, including through return to their lawful owners in appropriate cases, which includes sharing of information on digital assets transaction accounts (user accounts) that are being or suspected to be used for crime. We recognize that corruption and the laundering of proceeds of crime obtained from corruption offences drains public resources, and often fuel organized crime. We reaffirm our will to work with our international partners in their fight against corruption, including cooperation in investigations, information sharing, and capacity building, to better prevent such acts and to hold corrupt actors accountable. We also recognize the significant public health and security challenges posed by illicit drugs, including synthetic drugs, and other substances subject to misuse or abuse, as well as their negative impacts on societies. We will enhance efforts to target the illicit manufacturing and trafficking of these substances and related precursor chemicals, pursue and share information on criminals engaging in these activities, and disrupt the illicit supply chains at origin, transit, and destination points, while at the same time pursuing our efforts towards drug use prevention, treatment, and recovery services to minimize harms to people who use drugs. Working with implicated jurisdictions, we will also address the polycriminal dimension of drug trafficking, including the nexus between drug-related crimes and crimes that affect the environment, as well as firearms trafficking and money laundering. We will enhance our cooperation with other countries and international organizations through the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats and other multilateral fora. We remain committed to preventing irregular migration whether by land, air or sea, which can result in tragic loss of life. We reaffirm our commitment to join efforts to tackle the organized criminal networks that profit off some of the most vulnerable by facilitating migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons and the dangerous journey of migrants and asylum seekers. We will intensify efforts to break the business model of organized criminal networks, including through further cooperation to disrupt the supply chains that enable the criminal and exploitative operations of those engaged in trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling. We reaffirm our commitment to continue our international and transboundary cooperation to effectively prevent and combat crimes that affect the environment, including illegal transnational trafficking in wildlife such as protected flora and fauna, timber and timber products, hazardous and other waste, and precious metals, gemstones and other minerals, illegal mining, illegal logging, and crimes which could be associated with illegal unreported and unregulated fishing. We welcome the French initiative in organizing the first meetings of the network of experts on crimes that affect the environment this year. We support and celebrate the central role INTERPOL plays in law enforcement cooperation between our nations in its centenary year and endorse INTERPOL’s mission of delivering a safer world for all its members. We call for the organization to retain its focus on combatting international crime across INTERPOL’s global remit, and that INTERPOL’s future leadership ensure the organization continues to develop its global operational functions considering the growing international dimension across all spheres of criminal activity. We commit to continuing to support the organization in tackling the shared threats we now face.

Annex I: G7 Call on Technology Companies to Take Actions to Fight Against Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse

Protecting children around the world from all forms of child sexual exploitation and abuse, both online and offline, is everyone’s responsibility. With greater access than ever to Internet-enabled technology, we call on technology companies, particularly social media and other forms of online communication companies which provide services that are easily accessible to children, to step up efforts in playing their part in keeping children safe on their platforms. We strongly support and acknowledge the positive role that these companies can play in society, including promoting human interaction, social discussion, free expression, and economic activity. However, we also recognize that the threat to children online is rapidly evolving and growing, and these services are being utilized and exploited by perpetrators to commit serious crimes against children. Online child sexual exploitation and abuse can have significant impacts on victims and survivors, traumatizing them whose images continue to circulate online, sometimes long after they have reached adulthood, and creating the real risk and fear of being recognized in their daily lives. Children also risk becoming the targets of grooming and financial sexual coercion and extortion (“sextortion”) schemes, which can result in the production of additional child sexual abuse material as they are coerced and exploited by perpetrators. Some youth have also experienced the extreme outcomes of sextortion, such as self-harm or suicide. The growing risk of AI-generated child sexual abuse material also poses significant safety challenges for children, potentially overburdening and delaying law enforcement agencies from identifying victims and perpetrators of child sexual exploitation and abuse itself, and bringing the perpetrators to justice. We welcome the innovation of new and effective child safety tools from these companies. However, new design choices, including end-to-end encryption, should be implemented in a way that places child-safety at the heart of their approach to ensure that their platforms continue to be safe for children and that child sexual exploitation and abuse content does not go unreported, putting more children in further danger. In this context, we are jointly calling on technology companies to strive toward and endorse the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, accepting the need to take proactive voluntary action to act faster and go further in efforts to prevent, identify, report, and remove child sexual exploitation and abuse content from their platforms. There are a range of actions these companies can take, including deploying available technologies, to help them play their part in combatting these crimes. These actions should be immediately considered and taken in line with relevant jurisdictional legislative frameworks across the G7 countries and more widely. Robust action needs to be taken by these companies, and such steps could include: Adopting tools to protect child users, such as the default blocking of specific platform features;

Improving reporting features for users, identification and removal processes;

Limiting perpetrators’ abilities to create new profiles after being flagged as producing, sharing or facilitating child sexual exploitation and abuse on social media platforms;

Working alongside law enforcement agencies to strengthen reporting capabilities and sharing of critical evidence essential for apprehending and prosecuting perpetrators; and

Guiding children and their care givers to appropriate resources and support. We, the G7 governments working together to tackle these crimes, ask for increased transparency and greater engagement from these companies with government, civil society and victims and survivors’ groups, to work together to protect children. We also ask that these companies deepen engagement with law enforcement agencies to ensure that access to crucial evidence regarding online identity and activity of perpetrators, as well as their networks is provided and maintained, regardless of the platform-specific technology environment. Where possible, these companies should work together to share best practices, tools and indicators for identifying perpetrators. Protecting children, both offline and online, is a shared responsibility – all sectors of society need to take on this challenge, especially these companies, which are key to a whole-of-society response. Today, we urge immediate and stronger action from these companies as critical corporate citizens in keeping children safe from online sexual exploitation and abuse all around the world.

Annex II: G7 Declaration on Enhancing Cooperation in the Fight against Transnational Organized Fraud

Fraud, including online and telephone fraud, has evolved and become increasingly sophisticated, organized, and transnational in its nature. The enhancement of Information and Communication Technology that has assisted the development of society, is also being exploited by criminals around the globe to prey on the most vulnerable population through fraud. Online and telecommunication technology has enabled organized crime groups to work across national borders and carry out fraud in many forms. In certain parts of the world, we see the crime groups traveling abroad seeking safe havens to carry out their fraud operations remotely. We also see a growing link between transnational organized fraud and trafficking in persons, in particular, people lured through messages on social media and trafficked into working as accomplices of such criminal groups. Considering the accelerating technological change, and the evolving modus operandi of criminals that adapt to the changes within society, we acknowledge that the human and societal cost inflicted by fraud committed by organized crime groups will continue to grow and become a greater challenge, unless we act now. We will strengthen cooperation among the G7 and work with our partners around the globe to address all forms of fraud, and to detect, disrupt, and dismantle the organized crime groups behind this, including by: Preventing the reach and means of fraudsters;

Pursuing organized fraudsters acting transnationally;

Better empowering the public; and,

Building international understanding, partnerships and capabilities.

Governments, including law enforcement agencies, and industry have a role in better protecting society from fraud, and the victims and the public will always be at the center of these approaches. With this in mind, we will strive to create an international consensus and commitment to fight the crime of fraud in all its forms among the G7 and our partners around the globe through appropriate frameworks and international fora, including the UK hosted Global Fraud Summit in March 2024."
346,ICYMI -- Administrator Criswell Highlights FEMA Efforts at the White House Tribal Nations Summit,https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20231211/icymi-administrator-criswell-highlights-fema-efforts-white-house-tribal,"WASHINGTON -- On Dec. 7, FEMA leaders attended the White House Tribal Nations Summit. They were joined by more than 300 Tribal Nation leaders and representatives from agencies across the government.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell delivered remarks that highlighted FEMA’s efforts to improve Tribal Nations’ access to the agency’s resources. “Today, I am proud to reflect on the progress we’ve made over the past year to build the FEMA that Indian Country needs and deserves,” said Administrator Criswell. “Together we’ve made incredible strides -- but we still have a lot of work to do to make sure that we at FEMA are living up to our treaty and trust responsibilities.”

During her remarks, the Administrator outlined policy changes, clarifications and updates that support Tribal Nations, including:

Clarification of Public Assistance Eligibility

Roads on tribal lands that were either built or maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Department of Transportation are eligible to be repaired through FEMA’s Public Assistance programs. This clarification removes a roadblock that left many Tribal Nations unable to access their homes and businesses after a disaster.

Simplifying Damage Assessments

When traditional tribal residences and tribal ceremonial buildings are damaged, Tribal Nations will now be able to self-certify the damage assessment and scope of work for restoring those traditional structures. This will allow FEMA to more accurately account for damage and to repair traditional and ceremonial structures on tribal lands, such as pueblos, long houses and more.

Respecting Tribal Sacred Sites

FEMA is working to ensure that Tribal Nation data and coordinates of culturally sensitive locations, remains confidential. The agency will do this by no longer requiring photos, site maps or specific location details of damage done to tribal sacred sites.

Increasing Tribal Nation Input

FEMA plans to include more Tribal Nation input on recovery polices by increasing their participation in Public Assistance Working Sessions and Steering Committees. The agency will also work to hire more staff from Indian Country, while also increasing tribal-specific training for FEMA staff.

Launch of FEMA’s Tribal Affairs Hub

Administrator Criswell announced the launch of the first FEMA Tribal Affairs Hub, where Tribal Nations can learn more about FEMA grants, tribal disaster declarations, register for trainings and more.

Reminder of Upcoming Tribal Nation Training

Registration is open for the 9th Annual Tribal Nations Training Week (TNTW) at FEMA’s Center for Domestic Preparedness taking place March 9-16, 2024. In 2022, more than 200 leaders, emergency managers and responders from more than 70 Tribal Nations participated in the 8th Annual TNTW. The TNTW is only open to non-federal employees who work for Tribal Nations and Indian Health Service staff.

During the Summit, the Administrator, National Tribal Affairs Advocate Kelbie Kennedy and National Tribal Affairs Advisor Jay LaPlante hosted a closed-door nation-to-nation conversation and breakout session with tribal leaders.

Discussion topics ranged from building Tribal Nation resiliency long term, updating the tribal disaster declarations, access to FEMA grants, fire suppression in Indian Country, translating emergency messaging into Native languages and more.

The following senior FEMA leaders participated in the breakout:

348,President Biden Announces $22.4M FEMA Grant for Philadelphia to Hire 72 New Firefighters,https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20231211/president-biden-announces-224m-fema-grant-philadelphia-hire-72-new,"FEMA-funded SAFER grant program provides communities nationwide with the resources to hire more firefighters and open engine and ladder companies to effectively and safely respond to emergencies

PHILADELPHIA -- President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. announced that FEMA awarded a $22.4 million grant to the city of Philadelphia, paying for 72 firefighters’ salaries and benefits for three years, allowing three city fire stations to reopen: Engine 6 in Fishtown, Ladder 1 in Fairmount and Ladder 11 in South Philadelphia. In 2022, Philadelphia suffered its highest number of fire fatalities in a decade with more than a dozen of those deaths occurring from a single fire in the Fairmont neighborhood, which was formerly served by now-closed Ladder 1. This new funding will allow these fire stations to now provide faster responses to first-due areas.

Through the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant, FEMA provided $22,432,509 to assist the city of Philadelphia in increasing the number of firefighters to help communities meet industry minimum standards and attain 24-hour staffing to provide adequate fire protection from fire and fire-related hazards, and to fulfill traditional fire department missions.

“Firefighters are the first to be called and the last to leave when nearly any emergency arises,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “The Department of Homeland Security, in partnership with FEMA and the U.S. Fire Administration and under President Biden’s leadership, is committed to ensuring every firehouse and every firefighter has the support and resources they need to do their critical jobs. The SAFER grant President Biden awarded today meets that mandate, helping the City of Philadelphia recruit and retain more first responders, and helping keep the Fishtown, Fairmount, and South Philadelphia neighborhoods safe.”

“As a former firefighter, I understand just how critical it is that our local fire departments are funded as they work to save lives and protect livelihoods,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “Disasters start at the local level, and our firefighters are often the first on the scene. Thanks to President Biden, this grant funding allows FEMA to send additional dollars to these crucial first responders so they can build capacity and focus on saving lives.”

The President signed legislation last year that delivered $360 million each for FEMA’s Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program and the SAFER programs. It also increased funding for the of the U.S. Fire Administration to fund expanded training courses, renovate the National Emergency Training Center and invest in public awareness and messaging campaigns about fire safety.

To date, the SAFER Program has awarded approximately $5.2 billion in grant funding to provide critically needed resources to hire new, additional firefighters (or to change the status of part-time or paid-on-call firefighters to full-time firefighters), to rehire laid off firefighters, or to retain firefighters facing layoff, as well as recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters. This past year, FEMA made 177 awards totaling $360 million.

The SAFER grant is an annual competitive grant which eligible fire companies, unaffiliated EMS and state fire academies can apply for. The grant is subject to annual appropriations. Interested applicants can find tools and resources, including links to Program Webinars, at https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/firefighters/workshops.

349,EPA Settles with Trucking Companies Over Claims of Violation of California Truck and Bus Pollution Rule,https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-settles-trucking-companies-over-claims-violation-california-truck-and-bus,"“National truck fleets operating within California need to comply with our state’s truck and bus rule that regulates dangerous air pollution,” said EPA Pacific Southwest Administrator Martha Guzman. “Holding companies accountable protects the environment and public health, particularly among overburdened California communities that are bearing the brunt of pollution from diesel-fueled, heavy-duty trucks.”Diesel emissions from trucks are one of California’s largest sources of fine particle pollution, or soot, which is linked to a variety of health issues including asthma, impaired lung development in children, and cardiovascular effects in adults. About 625,000 trucks are registered outside of the state but operate in California and are subject to the rule. Many of these vehicles are older models and emit high amounts of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, a precursor to ozone, which is another air pollutant that is responsible for poor air quality in California.The California Truck and Bus Regulation has been an essential part of the state’s federally enforceable plan to attain cleaner air since 2012. The rule requires trucking companies to upgrade vehicles they own to meet specific performance standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter and to verify compliance of vehicles they hire or dispatch. Since January 1, 2023, all vehicles subject to the rule that travel in California have been required to have 2010 model year engines or equivalent emissions.In April 2023, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that requires a phased-in transition toward the use of zero-emission medium-and-heavy duty vehicles. Known as Advanced Clean Fleets, the new rule helps put California on a path towards fully transitioning the trucks that travel across the state to zero-emissions technology by 2045. The rule is expected to generate $26.5 billion in health savings from reduced asthma attacks, emergency room visits and respiratory illnesses. In addition, CARB believes that fleet owners will save an estimated $48 billion in their total operating costs from the transition through 2050.In July 2023, CARB and truck and engine manufacturers announced an unprecedented partnership to meet clean air goals. The new Clean Truck Partnership agreement offers flexibility to address public health of Californians and the needs of truck and engine manufacturers that build the technology required for the transition to zero-emissions.For more information on reporting possible violations of environmental laws and regulations, visit EPA’s enforcement reporting website.For more information on California’s Truck and Bus rule, visit CARB Truck and Bus RegulationExit EPA’s website.

351,Open Borders Make American Citizen-Only Voting Amendment Critical for 2024 Election; Raffensperger Calls on General Assembly for Swift Action,https://sos.ga.gov/news/open-borders-make-american-citizen-only-voting-amendment-critical-2024-election-raffensperger,"December 11th, 2023

Atlanta - Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger calls on the General Assembly to take immediate action to cement the vital election security measure that only U.S citizens can vote in U.S. elections into the Georgia Constitution. Georgia currently has the most seamless citizenship verification process in the nation but liberal groups are trying to use the Courts to overturn this vital election security measure prior to the 2024 election.

“With open borders, citizenship verification for voter registration is more important than ever,” said Secretary of State Raffensperger. “Organizations like the Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda are currently suing to end critical citizenship verification in our registration process, potentially exposing our elections to foreign interference, and diluting the power of legally registered voters. I’m calling on the General Assembly to take immediate action and pass a constitutional amendment ensuring that no liberal group can leverage the courts to add noncitizens to our voter rolls,” he said.

The state is currently being sued by liberal activists who want to eliminate the practice of citizenship verification before voters register to vote.

“Our system works,” said Brad Raffensperger. ”Failed candidates like Stacey Abrams, and the organization she founded, Fair Fight, have fought in court to eliminate citizenship verification for Georgia voters and they continue to fail in court.”

Roughly eight out of ten new Georgia voters apply for registration automatically when they get or update their driver’s license. The Department of Driver Services (DDS) is REAL ID certified and verifies citizenship status. Secretary Raffensperger was the first to conduct a full citizenship audit of Georgia voter rolls and work with Governor Kemp’s Department of Driver Services to ensure only American citizens vote in Georgia’s elections.

###

Georgia is recognized as a national leader in elections. It was the first state in the country to implement the trifecta of automatic voter registration, at least 17 days of early voting (which has been called the “gold standard”), and no-excuse absentee voting. Georgia continues to set records for voter turnout and election participation, seeing the largest increase in average turnout of any other state in the 2018 midterm election and record turnout in 2020, and 2022. 2022 achieved the largest single day of in-person early voting turnout in Georgia midterm history utilizing Georgia’s secure, paper ballot voting system. Most recently, Georgia ranked #1 for Election Integrity by the Heritage Foundation, a top ranking for Voter Accessibility by the Center for Election Innovation & Research and tied for number one in Election Administration by the Bipartisan Policy Center."

355,Governor Abbott Celebrates Hanukkah At Texas Capitol Menorah Lighting Ceremony,https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-celebrates-hanukkah-at-texas-capitol-menorah-lighting-ceremony,"Governor Greg Abbott last night celebrated Hanukkah with members of the Jewish community at the Texas Capitol Menorah Lighting Ceremony in Austin. Addressing a crowd of over 200, the Governor lauded the strength and resilience of the Jewish people and reaffirmed Texas’ commitment to protecting Jewish communities across the state and combating antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war.

""Together with Jewish communities across the nation and the world, we celebrate the miracle of Hanukkah,” said Governor Abbott. ""We also remember the lessons of hope, peace, and perseverance that this holiday season teaches us. This year, these lessons are even more important as the Jewish homeland fights to protect its citizens from the horrors of Hamas. During this Hanukkah season, and always, Texas stands with Israel. As we light theses candles, sing together, and pray together, I hope that this time of love and community burns brightly in all of us and reminds us that light always triumphs over darkness.""

During the ceremony, the Governor lit the shamash (servant candle) of the Menorah and reflected on the importance of the holiday for the Jewish community. Following the Menorah lighting, Governor Abbott handed out Hanukkah chocolate coins, called gelt, to children who attended the ceremony. The Governor was joined at the Hanukkah celebration by Rabbi Yosef Levertov, Rabbi Mendy Levertov, and other local faith leaders.

Last month, Governor Abbott traveled to Israel to meet with Israeli officials and visit with victims and impacted families to gain first-hand knowledge about the impacts of the Israel-Hamas war and ways Texas can continue to support Israel—America’s strongest ally in the Middle East.

Governor Abbott has taken significant action to bolster security and combat antisemitism across Texas amid acts of war against the State of Israel and innocent civilians by the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, including:

Previous significant action Governor Abbott has taken to ensure Texas maintains a strong and supportive relationship with Israel include: establishing the Texas Holocaust, Genocide, and Antisemitism Advisory Commission; awarding more than $19 million through his Public Safety Office for security enhancement projects to houses of worship, such as synagogues; and banning all state agencies from engaging in business or investments with companies that boycott Israel"

357,Har­ris Coun­ty Drops Law­suit After Attor­ney Gen­er­al Pax­ton Vig­or­ous­ly Defends Cru­cial Elec­tion Integri­ty Law,https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/harris-county-drops-lawsuit-after-attorney-general-paxton-vigorously-defends-crucial-election,"Harris County has dropped a lawsuit challenging the new state law that eliminated the unelected and unaccountable “Elections Administrator” position in Texas’s largest counties.

SB 1750 was adopted in 2023 after Harris County experienced multiple problems administering its elections. The law eliminates the Elections Administrator position in Harris County—an appointed position—and returns those powers to the Tax Assessor-Collector and the County Clerk, which are elected positions.

Harris County sued to enjoin the operation of SB 1750 on the grounds that it was an unconstitutional “local law” under Article III, section 56 of the Constitution. The Office of the Attorney General (“OAG”) countered that the legislature had a reasonable basis for the law: Harris County is the most populous county in Texas, and, as such, has an outsized statewide impact on elections—as evidenced by the county’s past significant difficulty with election administration.

Initially, a Travis County district judge ruled that the law violated the Texas Constitution. The OAG immediately stayed the ruling by appealing to the Texas Supreme Court. Harris County abandoned their lawsuit prior to the Court hearing arguments that were scheduled for November 28.

“Elections in our state must never be vulnerable to incompetent and unaccountable actors. Improperly administered elections undermine Texas voters’ trust and confidence when they should be entitled to total reliability and transparency,” said Attorney General Paxton. “I’m proud my team sprang into action to defend this important law when it was challenged."""

(“Blackbaud”) to ensure that the South Carolina-based software provider corrects its deficient data security privacy practices and is prepared to respond properly to any future security incidents.

The settlement resolves an investigation of a 2020 data breach which affected over 13,000 Blackbaud customers and their respective consumer constituents. Blackbaud’s customers—which include educational institutions, healthcare groups, cultural organizations, and nonprofits—use the company’s software to manage data on donors and constituents. The breach of highly sensitive data included Social Security numbers, government identification numbers, financial information, protected health information, and donor demographic information.

“My office will continue to work diligently to ensure that Texans’ personal and sensitive information is protected,” said Attorney General Paxton. “When companies discover that customers’ sensitive data has been breached, it is critical that they report such incidents quickly as required by Texas law.”

Under the settlement, Blackbaud has agreed to strengthen its data security and breach notification practices, including implementing specific security requirements related to database encryption, network segmentation, access controls, timely patch management, and dark web monitoring. Blackbaud has also agreed to make a payment of $49.5 Million to the 50 states participating in this settlement. Texas will collect over $2,766,000 of the total.

Pursuant to legislation enacted by the 88th Legislature, eligible active-duty military members and national guardsmen deployed for Operation Lone Star are now provided a death benefit.

The legislation provides that the surviving spouse, child, or parent will receive the benefit if the individual died while on active duty in connection with operations initiated to address criminal activity in the border region. Governor Abbott initiated Operation Lone Star in 2021 and it continues to protect the public from the dangerous flow of illegal activity enabled by the Biden Administration’s reckless immigration policies.

“Although nothing can replace a family’s loved one, our state seeks to honor the cherished memory and brave service of those who lost their lives in Operation Lone Star,” said Attorney General Paxton. “We have the opportunity to honor their sacrifice by distributing this benefit through the Crime Victim Compensation Program.”"
360,DPS Graduates 79 Recruits from Final Academy of 2023,https://www.dps.texas.gov/news/dps-graduates-79-recruits-final-academy-2023,"AUSTIN – The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) commissioned 79 new Texas Highway Patrol Troopers from recruit class C-2023 during a graduation ceremony on Friday, Dec. 8, which was held at Great Hills Baptist Church in Austin. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick gave the keynote address.

“It is always a great honor to speak at the Trooper Academy Graduation,” said Lt. Gov. Patrick. “I have done so several times in the past. These men and women are joining what I believe is the best state police in the country. We owe them so much for what they do for us every day. As Lt. Governor, I have consistently pledged my unwavering support to the brave Texans in law enforcement who put their lives on the line to protect our great state. The Department of Public Safety is essential in maintaining the safety and security of our communities, and I am proud to stand with them in their commitment to upholding the law and safeguarding the rights of every Texan.”

Class C-2023 is an Advanced Peace Officer School which means each of the recruits has prior law enforcement experience. 85 Trooper Trainees were selected to take part in what is the department’s 174th class. The 14-week school began on September 5, and of the 85 that began, only 79 successfully completed the school to graduate.

“We are honored that these 79 men and women have chosen to continue to serve as members of the Texas Highway Patrol,” said DPS Director Steven McCraw. “I know they will be tremendous assets to the department and help protect and serve the great people of the State of Texas.”

During the 14-week in-resident Academy, Trooper Trainees receive more than 430 hours of instruction. The comprehensive training comes from experts on various topics, including criminal and traffic law enforcement, crash investigation, crisis intervention, use of force, criminal investigations, communications, cultural diversity, fitness and wellness, and emergency medical assistance.

In addition to the required medical objectives, Trooper Trainees also receive components of the Tactical Emergency Casualty Care training to include trauma assessment, bleeding control and treatment of shock. The training prepares them to work as a Highway Patrol Trooper anywhere in the state, including in remote areas and extreme terrains.

Trooper Trainees conclude their rigorous training with a Joint Field Training Exercise, culminating scenarios and training events that simulate a potential day in the life of a Texas State Trooper. Trooper Trainees utilize skills and knowledge obtained throughout the academy and participate in approximately 25 scenarios utilizing inert training weapons ranging from vehicle pursuits to compliant driver traffic stops. It finishes with a Legacy Run to the State Capitol Peace Officer Memorial where they participate in a patch ceremony.

Here are some other class highlights:

361,DPS Presents Awards at Final PSC Meeting of the Year,https://www.dps.texas.gov/news/dps-presents-awards-final-psc-meeting-year,"AUSTIN – On Thursday, Dec. 7, 2023, the Texas Public Safety Commission (PSC), along with Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Director Steven McCraw, presented several prestigious awards to DPS personnel, including five Director’s Citations, one Lifesaving Award and a Unit Citation. The Awards were presented at the PSC meeting at DPS Headquarters in Austin. Four Director’s Awards were also given to people outside the department.

“These awards are a reminder of the tremendous work that takes place throughout this department every day,” said DPS Director Steven McCraw. “We are grateful for the men and women who put others’ wellbeing before their own – many times in order to save lives, and it’s wonderful to be able to personally thank them.”

The following individuals were recognized:

Lieutenant Kevin King, Texas Highway Patrol Division – Carrizo Springs, Captain Steven Tellez, Texas Highway Patrol Division – San Antonio, were each awarded a Director’s Citation for their significant and professional efforts in building a strong relationship with members of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District.

On May 24, 2022, the community of Uvalde experienced a horrific mass shooting at Robb Elementary School. Governor Greg Abbott then directed DPS to begin a school safety initiative to rebuild the community’s trust in law enforcement agencies that bear the responsibility of creating a safe environment for students and staff at the eight campuses within the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District. Captain Steven Tellez and Lieutenant Kevin King volunteered to serve as ambassadors and lead the school safety initiative during the 2022-2023 school year. Through their leadership, professionalism and forward thinking, Captain Tellez and Lieutenant King built a positive and safe environment for students, faculty and the entire Uvalde community. They prioritized visibility and accessibility for the entire school community, and spent time in classrooms and cafeterias, at sporting events and after school activities, getting to know the students and listening to their concerns. They adopted a more holistic approach to school safety, focusing on de-escalating conflicts and taking a proactive approach through education to address issues such as the reporting of “Threat to Life” events and the proper application of laws in an educational environment. Captain Tellez’ and Lieutenant King’s efforts have undoubtedly had a positive impact on the student disciplinary issues over the past school year. Students, parents, teachers, and the community have expressed great appreciation for their efforts and credit their presence in helping make Uvalde schools feel safer and more welcoming for all.

In recognition of these efforts, they are hereby awarded a Director’s Citation.

Trooper Michael Abay, Texas Highway Patrol Division – Corsicana, Trooper Damian Conner, Texas Highway Patrol Division – Corsicana, and Trooper Joseph Sherman, Texas Highway Patrol Division – Corsicana, are hereby awarded the Director’s Citation. Volunteer Fire Chief Jay Tidwell, Firefighter Joshua Lascano, Michael Bustamante and Lance Lewis are hereby awarded the Director’s Award.

On January 31, 2023, Trooper Curtis Putz was crushed between a concrete barrier and his patrol unit while investigating a traffic crash in icy conditions in the North Texas Region. Troopers Michael Abay, Damian Conner and Joseph Sherman were on the scene, investigating other traffic crashes due to the icy road. Trooper Abay ran toward the patrol unit and realized Trooper Putz was pinned underneath. Trooper Sherman was close by and notified communications of a Trooper down, requesting two ambulances to come to the scene. The driver who struck Trooper Putz was in and out of consciousness and Trooper Abay broke the driver’s side window to access them. Trooper Conner was informed that Trooper Putz was having trouble breathing and the patrol unit needed to be lifted off of him to allow him to breathe. Conner retrieved his floor jack and wheel chocks, then verified the patrol unit was in park and that the emergency brake was set. Trooper Sherman continued to communicate with Trooper Putz while Trooper Abay and Richland Volunteer Fire Chief Jay Tidwell began to lift and stabilize the patrol unit. During this time, Michael Bustamante, a tow truck operator, arrived on the scene and worked quickly to lift the patrol vehicle off Trooper Putz. Lance Lewis, another tow truck operator, assisted Mr. Bustamante with moving the patrol vehicle while protecting Trooper Putz from further injury. Off-duty Glen Heights Firefighter Joshua Lascano observed the crash and immediately provided an assessment of Trooper Putz’ injuries. As Mr. Bustamante lifted the patrol unit, Troopers Sherman and Abay, along with Firefighter Lascano, pulled Trooper Putz out from under the patrol car so they could assess his injuries and provide care until EMS arrived. Trooper Putz was taken to the hospital and is alive today thanks to the heroic actions of these individuals.

Trooper Jacob Morrow, Texas Highway Patrol Division – Cross Plains, was awarded a Lifesaving Award for his actions while deployed to Operation Lone Star. On Aug. 14, 2023, Trooper Morrow observed a female and two juvenile subjects approach the Rio Grande River, in Mexico. Trooper Morrow encouraged the subjects to walk to the nearest point of entry to seek legal access to the U.S., but the subjects began to cross the river in an area that is known to be quite deep. Trooper Morrow began to hear screams for help as he observed the subjects go under water multiple times. Trooper Morrow directed a National Guardsman to lower the concertina wire while he retrieved his throw bag. As Trooper Morrow approached the river and began to crawl over the wire, he could only see the juveniles above water. He deployed his throw bag into the river and instructed the juvenile subjects to grab the rope as he began pulling them to the riverbank. As Trooper Morrow began pulling, the mother surfaced, blue in the face and gasping for air. Trooper Morrow was able to pull all three subjects to shore. A National Guard medic advised the female would not have survived much longer in the water without assistance. Once EMS personnel arrived on the scene, all three subjects were transported to a local medical center for further treatment.

One Unit Citation was also given during the ceremony. The following unit was recognized:

The North Texas Region Aircrew is part of the Aircraft Operations Division (AOD) and operates out of the North Texas Region. On Thursday, March 30, 2023, the North Texas Region Aircrew, consisting of Lieutenant Pilot Jordan Teel and Staff Sergeant Tactical Flight Officer (TFO) Frank Gunnels, was dispatched to assist the Kaufman County Sheriff’s Office with the pursuit of a stolen vehicle. Within minutes, the aircrew intercepted the fleeing vehicle, which was traveling in excess of 100 miles per hour and using all lanes of the road to avoid numerous attempts by officers to spike the vehicle’s tires. After the suspect’s vehicle struck a civilian vehicle and spun out of control, the suspect exited with a firearm and began engaging officers with gunfire. Even as the aircrew was receiving gunfire, they continued to maintain overwatch of the suspect and guide officers to areas of safety and tactical advantage. The suspect fled into a neighborhood, and then into a wooded area, ultimately hiding in a creek, out of view of officers and the aircrew.

During this time, Lieutenant Clay Lacey, who had just completed his shift and was at his residence, messaged the entire duty station and advised AOD personnel of the situation. Captain Saben Emery, who was off duty and out of state, began monitoring the incident via digital downlink and began notifying additional personnel and arranging for additional assets. An additional aircrew from Austin, consisting of Lieutenant Pilot Justin Foyt and Staff Sergeant Chris Gates, was requested to relieve the aircrew currently on station. Staff Sergeant TFO Justin Kaiser was sent to the scene to assist with his DPS issued drone. Lieutenant Jason Roland responded immediately to coordinate with the command post, and Lieutenant Kris Edgmon was placed on standby as a relief pilot. Staff Sergeant TFO Robert Maeker and Garland PD TFO Robin Mondragon, who were in Houston for training, drove through the night to assist with the ongoing incident. Approximately 16 hours later, the suspect surrendered after hiding his firearm. AOD personnel assisted with the search and recovery of the firearm, which was vital in the investigation. The actions of these AOD personnel were fundamental in protecting the lives of officers on the ground and the citizens in the area.

The employees commended for their hard work and dedication include Captain Pilot Saben Emery, Training Captain Pilot Jason Roland, Lieutenant Pilots Jordan Teel, Clay Lacey, Kris Edgmon and Justin Foyt, Staff Sergeant Tactical Flight Officers Frank Gunnels, Justin Kaiser, Robert Maeker, and Chris Gates and Garland Police Department Tactical Flight Officer Robin Mondragon.

Please join us in congratulating all of the award recipients for their work in making Texas a safer place. Additional photos can be found on the DPS Facebook page.

363,Governor Hochul Announces Grand Opening of $27.5 Million Watertown Family YMCA in Jefferson County,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-grand-opening-275-million-watertown-family-ymca-jefferson-county,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the completion of the new $27.5 million Watertown Family YMCA in Jefferson County. The new facility repurposed a vacant, 89,000-square-foot building in the heart of Downtown Watertown into a family wellness, aquatics and fitness center that will benefit residents and neighboring communities. Empire State Development supported the project with a $3.6 million capital grant to assist with construction and rehabilitation costs.

“The completion of the Watertown YMCA is the culmination of many ongoing, strategic investments by New York State to redevelop Downtown Watertown that are breathing new excitement in the community,” Governor Hochul said. “The opening of this new and modern facility is another important milestone in this exciting transformation that will help revitalize and grow Downtown Watertown, now and for the future.”

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “The new Watertown Family YMCA is poised to be a vital anchor in Downtown Watertown, providing residents a center that will bring new life to the community. This new, modern facility will continue to bring countless benefits to a new generation of families well into the future.”

YMCA CEO Denise Young said, “We remain so grateful for the support we have received to make this project a reality for our community. This is not about a building, but about what will happen inside it, improving lives for the next five generations.”

The Watertown Family YMCA has offered benefits like swimming and exercise classes, and a variety of after school educational programs for the City of Watertown and surrounding communities for over a century. This new and modern facility expands on its traditional programming to meet the diverse needs of the community and will include features such as lap and recreational pools, an indoor track, multi-sport courts, exercise studios and a wellness center as well as community rooms, childwatch and kids adventure areas, art space and a space for teens. The new location features more than 350 public parking spaces and offers multiple entry and exit points. Additionally, the new YMCA Community Center enhances the City of Watertown’s Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI), ensuring the Y’s legacy as an anchor in downtown that will continue to benefit the entire community.

The project was also awarded a $9 million U.S. Department of Defense grant from the Defense Communities Infrastructure Pilot program to support military families at Fort Drum.

Assemblymember Scott Gray said, “Today marks a significant milestone for Watertown and Jefferson County as the brand-new Watertown Family YMCA is unveiled. This facility not only brings life back to a once-vacant building remembered by many as the “Harvest House” but also expands essential wellness, recreational and educational programs that meet the diverse needs of our community. Empire State Development's support has been instrumental in making this project a reality. The YMCA will serve as a beacon of health, education, and community spirit in the heart of Downtown Watertown, strengthening the ongoing Downtown Revitalization Initiative and benefiting residents for generations to come.”

Jefferson County Board of Legislators Chair William W. Johnson said, “What a great day for the YMCA, the City of Watertown and Jefferson County. This beautiful building is a testament to what can take place when all levels of government work together. I am glad that that Jefferson County could play a small role in this project.”

Watertown Mayor Jeff Smith said, “Today’s not about one project; it’s about multiple investments breathing life into our downtown. Investments like the DRI and the new YMCA project strengthen the community core and stimulate new projects like the redevelopment of the Globe Building. We’re not just growing, we’re creating a vibrant hub that will encourage more investment in our City. Thank you, Governor Hochul, and Empire State Development for your partnership in strengthening downtown Watertown.”

In addition to the new YMCA Aquatics Center, several state-supported projects are underway in Downtown Watertown. 5G Real Estate Group, LLC is undertaking a nearly $3 million project to restore the blighted and vacant Globe Building into 11 market rate apartments and 14,000 square feet of commercial space. The project, identified as a ""specific target for redevelopment"" in Watertown’s DRI strategic plan, is being supported with $558,000 in DRI funding through ESD.

Other projects nearing completion include the Downtown Street streetscape redevelopment project, which was awarded $1.5 million in DRI funds through the Department of State; and the Jefferson Community College Center for Entrepreneurship project in the former Strand Theater and Lamon Buildings on Franklin Street, supported by $2.5 million in DRI funding from ESD. The redevelopment of 138, 152-154, and 170 Court Street, supported by a $990,000 Restore New York grant awarded to the City of Watertown, is now complete."
364,Governor Hochul Announces New York City Subway Sets New Weekend Day Ridership Record,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-new-york-city-subway-sets-new-weekend-day-ridership-record-0,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that New York City subway recorded 2,918,691 paid rides on Saturday, December 9, surpassing the previous post-pandemic weekend high set on October 28. The 2.9 million paid rides are a six percent improvement on the October 28 record and represents the highest weekend day for ridership in four years

“New York at the holidays is the stuff of dreams, and it comes as no surprise that this time of year brings a boom in subway ridership,” Governor Hochul said. “There is no doubt the MTA is ready to welcome New Yorkers and visitors alike thanks to the investments we have made in safety and service throughout the system.”

MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said, ""The MTA is hitting its stride to close the year. This is the second time in less than two months that subways set a Saturday record – a huge vote of confidence in mass transit from riders. With more gridlock days ahead New Yorkers, and those visiting, know the subway is the best way to restaurants, shows and all the great holiday activities New York City has to offer.”

New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, “Santa came early this year. SantaCon surely played a role in this Saturday record, and I am happy so many used the subway to celebrate the holiday season throughout the city. While all ridership records are special, whenever we have a big Saturday, itreally shows that people trust the subway to get them to wherever it is they are going and that our focus on improving the weekend experience is bringing customers back in growing numbers.”

The record subway Saturday was driven by taps into the system – 58.5 percent of all rides were tap-and-go customers, a single-day record. OMNY, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s (MTA) contactless fare payment method, accounts overall for nearly half of all paid subway rides.

The ridership and OMNY records came two days before the MTA activated OMNY customer vending machines in The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, allowing riders to use cash at the vending machines to purchase OMNY cards. Credit and debit cards and digital wallets are also accepted for purchases.

OMNY cards provide another way to take advantage of OMNY’s financial flexibility to pay-as-you-go and never spend more than $34.00 in 7 days.

The record comes in the middle of a Gridlock Alert, issued by the New York City Department of Transportation. The MTA reminded New Yorkers of subway capacity during the first day of Gridlock on December 6. The subway has capacity for 2 million more people than it carries today, and in recent months has seen service added during the off-peak hours."

On December 3, 2023, Sergeant Rock passed away from an illness stemming from his assignment in and around the World Trade Center site following the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. He had retired from the New York State Police after 26 years of dedicated service on September 27, 2013. Sergeant Rock is from Kerhonkson, NY, and is survived by his wife."

On January 1, per an agreement between Governor Hochul and the New York State Legislature, New York’s minimum wage will increase to $16-per-hour in New York City, Westchester, and Long Island, and $15-per-hour for the rest of the state. Raising New York's minimum wage to keep pace with inflation will benefit hundreds of thousands of minimum wage workers across the state.

AUDIO of the event is available here .

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Before we get started, I'd like to highlight some bit of good news for 2024. New Yorkers are getting a pay raise. First of all, January 1st, the minimum wage will go into effect. It goes to $16 an hour in New York City, Westchester and Long Island. $15 an hour in Upstate, including right here in Albany. And going forward in the future, we'll be indexing the minimum wage for the first time ever to inflation. So,families can finally start getting ahead, which is so important to all of us.

The Department of Labor is launching a public relations campaign to make sure that people know that if their paycheck does not go up and they're minimum wage earners, they need to report that because there could be instances of wage theft where the employers do not ensure that the increase goes into effect. So, we want to make sure everyone is aware of that."

Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Dave, for the introduction. Thank you for the incredible work you do here every single day. At this very moment, there’s a race for global domination. That's why we're here. And I'm here to announce that New York State will win that race.

And in so doing, we'll set the course for the future of technology as we know it, not just for our state, not just for our country, but for the entire world. New York is acquiring. One of the most advanced semiconductor tools on the planet, reasserting America’s manufacturing dominance and reinvigorating communities all over the State of New York.

It's the result of an unprecedented collaboration between the private sector, local, state, and federal leaders. And I want to acknowledge the individuals who helped bring us to this incredible place today. Again, Dave Anderson, the CEO of New York Creates. Thank you for having the vision. That continues to see the possibilities of what we can do right here. Let's give David Anderson another round of applause. Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM. We are so proud. We've made so many announcements, a $20 billion announcement just a year ago to show that your continued belief in our state is well founded. So, thank you IBM for all you do for us and all the thousands and thousands of jobs you've created for, for many, many decades.

Scott DeBoer, the EVP of Technology and Products Micron. Just with Micron this past week, as we announced some significant and more investments in education in the Syracuse area. But Micron's not just focused on Syracuse, they're focused on the entire state. Jim Koonman, EVP at ASML, thank you again for being such an industry leader right here in the State of New York. County Executive Dan McCoy has joined us. Steve Acquario, to show the importance of this for counties. Heather Mulligan, the New York Business Council. Chancellor John King, thank you. Everyone part of our SUNY network, RPI President Marty Schmidt, HVCC President Roger Ramsammy as well. All of our partners in government, Hope Knight, Kevin Younis and everyone at ESD.

But let me give a special shout out to the incredible federal team that we have here. Do not take for granted. The powerhouse that we have right here in the state of New York in Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and partner in U.S. government at the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand. The two of them, the two of them believe, the two of them believe in this.

And Senator Schumer and I have been here many times, you've been here even more because I've been Governor just for two years. You've been, you've walked these halls, you've seen the innovation here, you believe in this. And it is that belief that helped us get to this place. And I'll talk more about that, but this didn't happen because people just hoped someday that it would. It happened because of the tenacity, a spirit of toughness that said we're not going to leave Washington until we deliver this. Not just for the nation, but what we did here in New York State. So, I want to applaud both of you for the incredible leadership that you bring to us every single day. So, thank you.

As I mentioned, this is a race for dominance, tech dominance. And if you want to know one thing about New Yorkers, we are competitive. We don't like to lose, and we lose very infrequently. At the heart of this race are semiconductors, the brains of our electronics, when you think of it that way. The technology that keeps planes in the air, keeps your refrigerator cold, keeps our stock markets and electric grids humming.

Semiconductors are absolutely central to our lives, even though you don't think about them on a regular basis. And the cutting edge is constantly evolving rapidly, rapidly before our eyes. Just look no further than the smartphone in your pocket. Actually, don't look at them. It's kind of disruptive. But that one little device has more processing power in it than all the computers combined that existed on our planet 50 years ago.

That's amazing. It has 100,000 times the computing power and 9 million times the memory that the computer, the Apollo 11 had to land astronauts on the moon. This is in our lifetime, my friend. This is not happening over 50 years or 100 years. This is happening now. And the countries that are able to lead on semiconductors will be at the vanguard of the world's technological future.

And the ones who aren't, the ones who aren't making these investments, will stall and fall far behind. That's what we're up against here. As I said, we're competitive. We're talking about, not just innovation, but geopolitical balance of power. That's what's at stake here, the geopolitical balance of power.

The U.S. used to dominate this industry. 1990, we had 40 percent of all the semiconductor manufacturing in the world. 40 percent. It should have kept going upward, upward, upward, and something happened. Today it's 12 percent, and we're just too dependent on ships and components from places like China, Korea, Taiwan. It's just, it's that supply chain challenge that we saw firsthand during the pandemic. It's not hypothetical, those supply chains came to a halt. The ports were crowded. The materials weren't coming in from other places. You don't have to imagine what that would look like, it happened in our country. Just imagine, think about what happened to the auto industry. By not having chips, it literally put the brakes on the manufacturing, endangering thousands of jobs here and elsewhere. Or imagine the geopolitical shift where countries turn on us. Places embargoes and trade practices stop us from receiving these chips, how debilitating and crippling that would be for our manufacturers.

So, there's massive implications for national security, technological innovation, economic growth and independence. And the Chinese, in particular, attempting to dominate this industry. And guess what? We have no intention of letting that happen. And that's why here today we're launching a new $10 billion partnership with leaders from the semiconductor industry and taking one more step forward to make sure New York is the semiconductor capital of the world.

We don't do anything small here. $10 billion, think about that scale. This historic investment will establish a next generation research and development center right here, right here in Albany at the NanoTech Complex, the most advanced in the country. It'll fund the construction of cutting-edge equipment, the first and only of its kind in North America.

And you ready for the name? I have to ask who came up with this name. Raise your hand if you really want to. High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Cluster. Okay, and don't ask me to say that twice. So maybe we can abbreviate that, come up with some really cool acronym? I'm sure we're smart enough to figure that out.

But there's only one company in the entire world that makes this equipment, ASML, and we're so glad they're here and grateful for their partnership in making this become a reality. So, what's New York's role? New York State is investing literally $1 billion dollars into Albany NanoTech as part of this new enterprise, and so that's our support for this to establish this home for cutting edge equipment.

Our money will also support the NanoFab Reflection, a new sophisticated building with over 50,000 square feet of clean room space. And the part I love the best, how many jobs are being created? Over 700 jobs. And these are good paying jobs, my friends.

We talk about the stress that families are under. How everything is so expensive these days, but they come in the door and get one of these good paying jobs and keep moving upward, there's no stopping them. They'll be able to take care of themselves, their families, make sure their kids can get a college education. That's what this is all about.

We're making meaningful commitments in workforce development, bringing in all communities to this, as well as environmental sustainability. When this is all up and running here, companies from around the world are going to flock to this area. They're already starting. They see what we have here, industry giants: Micron, IBM, Applied Materials, we know you're here. Tokyo Electron and others will have access to the most sophisticated semiconductor equipment on the planet. And we'll continue to build our reputation as a premier research and development center. That's how we guarantee America's place, not just here, but America's place at the forefront of the Global Semiconductor Race, and that's how we bring the jobs back home.

This day has been in the works for years. Enormous effort, a commitment, getting through some tough times, but I also said, we have to continue. And as a new governor two years ago, I declared that we have to reinvigorate our economy because businesses have to thrive, create more opportunities for New Yorkers.

And one thing with this incredible asset here, for 20 years, this asset has been here. We have to make sure more people know about it. What they have been doing is extraordinary. They have been building chips already. Have you seen the chips that they build here? Who's seen the chips they build here? The innovative chips built here right on this campus. I'm sure Chuck says – you think they're small, Chuck? How little are they? This is one. This is what we're building here. This is what we have built for IBM, right here. This looks familiar to you, right? This is what we're talking about here.

This is part of the innovation, and I want to make sure that everyone knows the capacity that we have here. Very few places on this planet have the capacity to do exactly what we just showed you now. I can't show you any longer because it's secret. Don't take any pictures. But, right up to now we've been talking about research and development, making those chips, helping IBM, helping other companies.

But there's another area and that is the actual manufacturing. And it's critical that we focus on both. Expanding the manufacturing all over. And, again, back to Washington, what was accomplished there. When Majority Leader Schumer and President Biden and the entire Senate supported – not the entire Senate – the smart people in the Senate supported – I had to retract that – the smart people, the people actually don't bet against America, the people want to believe in America and make sure they thrive. When they passed the CHIPS and Science Act, we knew this was an extraordinary opportunity, but that meant there'd be resources for companies to do well and come back to the United States. But how do we position ourselves to make sure that they come not just to the United States and expand here, but come to New York?

So, we built on that. That was a signal to us here in New York. We have this opportunity, and I want to thank the members of the legislature who are here. Please stand up, everyone who supported. Members of the legislature, if you didn't vote for it, what are you doing here? Members of the legislature, our assemblymembers and senators, who supported the Green CHIPS Act. The Semiconductor Incentive Program. And it's hard to get incentive programs for business through the legislature, but these true believers understood the power that we could unleash. Taking advantage of what they did in Washington and bringing that power right here. So, we capitalized on it. Again, I want to thank our fellow representatives.

We recruited Micron. You know the story. It was not easy. We had to nurture them and bring them along. It was kind of like a courtship, right? We had to let them see the love of New York. And how that there's a marriage created here with Micron in New York would lead for generations of a great partnership. And for them to build their U.S. MegaFab plant right here in Upstate New York is one of the greatest accomplishments of our generation. It is extraordinary. The largest investment, economic development investment in the country, $100 billion. And I love the 50,000 jobs that are coming. And we're training people today for those jobs.

That's what's going on in Syracuse as we speak. And I want to thank Chancellor John King, all the labor partners, the business community. We also created Go Semi, an office to help the expansion, to make sure that we have all the assets for everyone. It's working on the skilled workforce. We're hitting it on all fronts. I want to thank everyone here today because you are here to witness history. You know this didn't necessarily have to happen here. But there are committed individuals, just like the people who built this state and made it into the great powerhouse that it was a generation ago, two generations ago, 100 years ago. We are that generation that is driving the change as required at this moment. Because the world will look to New York and say, “This is the day they moved ahead. This is the day that we literally won the race.”

And to everyone who's part of it, I congratulate all of you, and onward to victory. Let's run through the tape and make sure we bring all those jobs and opportunities right here in the great State of New York. Thank you, everybody.

And with that, let me bring up the architect of bringing the jobs back to the United States. Getting it through Washington, getting it through all the hassles, all the hurdles, but he never gave up. And that is our own Senator, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. He thought it was going to be really small. I had to show him it's really big, right? Don't let it fall out, Chuck."
368,Governor Hochul Announces Completion of 74-unit Public Housing Redevelopment in Nassau County,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-completion-74-unit-public-housing-redevelopment-nassau-county,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced completion of the major redevelopment of Laurel Homes, a previously dilapidated public housing complex in North Hempstead’s Roslyn Heights.

Establishing a Global Semiconductor Hub in New York State

Governor Hochul has maintained a strong commitment to building a modern economy in New York State by growing the semiconductor industry and attracting innovative businesses that create good paying, 21st century jobs. In October 2022, after signing New York’s first-in-the-nation Green CHIPS legislation to build a thriving, sustainable chips industry, the Governor announced an historic $100 billion investment from Micron to establish a state-of-the-art leading-edge memory manufacturing campus in Central New York that will create 50,000 jobs. Since signing Green CHIPS, the Governor has also announced major investments from several other semiconductor manufacturers and companies from the semiconductor supply chain, including AMD, Edwards Vacuum, and TTM Technologies to expand their presence in New York.

In her 2023 State of the State address, Governor Hochul announced the creation of the $45 million Governor’s Office of Semiconductor Expansion, Manufacturing, and Integration, known as GO-SEMI, to oversee the state’s efforts to continue to grow the industry."

371,Governor Hochul Launches Effort to Ensure That New Yorkers Receive Increased Minimum Wage Starting January 1,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-launches-effort-ensure-new-yorkers-receive-increased-minimum-wage-starting,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the start of a statewide public awareness effort to ensure that New Yorkers earning minimum wage receive the state’s historic minimum wage increase when it takes effect next year. On January 1, per an agreement between Governor Hochul and the New York State Legislature, New York’s minimum wage will increase to $16-per-hour in New York City, Westchester, and Long Island, and $15-per-hour for the rest of the state. Raising New York's minimum wage to keep pace with inflation will benefit hundreds of thousands of minimum wage workers across the state.

“On January 1, we are lifting New York’s minimum wage to help hard-working New Yorkers keep up with rising costs and continue supporting their families,” Governor Hochul said. “If you are a minimum wage worker and you don’t see this increase in your paycheck next year, I urge you to file a wage complaint with the Department of Labor to make sure that you are getting the wage increase you deserve.”

As part of the FY 2024 Budget, Governor Hochul secured an historic agreement to increase New York’s minimum wage through 2026 and index it to inflation beginning in 2027. After the initial increase, the minimum wage will increase by $0.50 in 2025 and 2026. In 2027, the minimum wage will increase annually at a rate determined by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the Northeast Region – the best regional measure of inflation.

The New York State Department of Labor will begin a public awareness effort to remind New Yorkers about the minimum wage increase and encourage minimum wage workers to report missing wages. That effort will include digital outreach via social media, newsletters, and e-mail communications and direct outreach to distribute informational flyers with partnering organizations.

Minimum wage earners who do not see the increase reflected in their paychecks can file a wage complaint on the New York State Department of Labor’s website or by calling 833-910-4378. For more information about NYSDOL’s efforts to combat wage theft, visit the Department’s landing page."

373,Attorney General James Announces Sentencing of Genovese Crime Family Associate,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-announces-sentencing-genovese-crime-family-associate,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today announced the sentencing of an associate of the Genovese crime family. Thomas Poli, 65, of the Bronx, intentionally submitted false information to the court regarding his own criminal case and participated in commercial bribery related to contracts with Aguila, Inc. (Aguila), an often criticized and now defunct homeless services provider. Poli was sentenced to nine months in prison for Offering a False Instrument for Filing and Commercial Bribing.

“Rather than honor his word and his plea agreement, Thomas Poli lied to the court and got others to lie on his behalf — all to get out of just a day of court-ordered community service,” said Attorney General James. “Now Poli must pay for his selfishness. My office will continue to hold corrupt individuals accountable, and I am grateful to our partners in law enforcement for their ongoing support in defending our justice system.”

In order to satisfy the conditions of a plea agreement on a 2019 criminal charge, Poli requested then Bronx County Clerk Luis Diaz draft a letter to the court stating that Poli performed volunteer work for Aguila. In reality, Poli did not perform any community service for the organization, and in fact, he was paid by Aguila for vending, storage, and furniture contracts. In July 2022, Diaz pleaded guilty to one count of Offering a False Instrument for Filing in the First Degree, a class E felony, for his role in creating the fraudulent letter submitted by Poli to the court.

In September 2023, Poli was arraigned and pleaded guilty in Bronx County Supreme Court to one count of Offering a False Instrument for Filing in the First Degree, a class E felony, and one count of Commercial Bribing in the Second Degree, a class A misdemeanor. In addition to the felony charge, Poli also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge related to a kickback payment made to Aguila leadership in exchange for influence over some of the organization’s contracts and contract payments.

In April 2022, unrelated to his 2019 criminal case, Poli was charged with racketeering conspiracy following a joint investigation by the U.S Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) for his role in illegal gambling and related extortions in connection with the Genovese crime family. Poli has since pleaded guilty and was sentenced in federal court.

This was a joint investigation between OAG’s Organized Crime Task Force (OCTF) and OAG’s Public Integrity Bureau, led by former OCTF Detective John Mullen under the direction of OCTF Detective Supervisor Bradford Miller and Deputy Chief Andrew Boss. The Investigations Division is led by Chief Oliver Pu-Folkes.

OCTF Assistant Deputy Attorney General Joseph Marciano and Special Assistant Deputy Attorney General Russell Satin are handling the prosecution in this matter, under the supervision of OCTF Deputy Bureau Chief Lauren Abinanti and Public Integrity Bureau Chief Gerard Murphy, with assistance from Legal Support Analysts Grace Koh and Santiago Molina. Nicole Keary is the Deputy Attorney General in Charge of OCTF. OCTF, the Public Integrity Bureau, and the Investigations Bureau are all part of the Division for Criminal Justice Division, which is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General José Maldonado and overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy."
374,Carteret County Oyster Bar Owner Pleads Guilty to  State Tax Charges,https://www.ncdor.gov/news/press-releases/2023/12/11/carteret-county-oyster-bar-owner-pleads-guilty-state-tax-charges,"A Carteret County businessman pleaded guilty on December 4, 2023 in Wake County Superior Court to five felony tax charges filed by the North Carolina Department of Revenue.

William Louis Willis, 55, of 707 Arendell Street #B, Morehead City, pleaded guilty to five counts of Embezzlement of State Property.

Superior Court Judge Patrick Nadolski, sentenced Willis to a 16-month minimum, 29-month maximum prison term. The sentence was suspended, and as a condition of probation, Willis was ordered to serve four days in the custody of the Wake County Sheriff’s Office. Willis was placed on house arrest, with electronic monitoring for 60 days, ordered to perform 50 hours of community service, and was also placed on supervised probation for 60 months. Prior to the plea, Willis paid $1,000.00 towards restitution and was ordered to pay the remaining $93,510.69 in restitution.

Information presented in court showed that Willis, a managing member of Katwil, LLC, dba Shuckin Shack Oyster Bar, aided and abetted the business to embezzle, misapply, and convert to its own use approximately $94,510.69 in North Carolina Sales Tax (State and Carteret County) during the period January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2021. During this period of time, Willis was a responsible person of Katwil, LLC, and was under a duty to collect, hold in trust, and remit North Carolina and Carteret County Sales Tax to the North Carolina Department of Revenue.

The charges against Willis resulted from an investigation by special agents with the Department’s Criminal Investigations Division in Raleigh, and was prosecuted by the Special Prosecutions attorneys in the office of the Attorney General."
375,Mayor Bowser Announces Approval of $22.5 Million in U.S. Treasury Funding for Whitman-Walker Max Robinson Center at St. Elizabeths East Campus,https://dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-announces-approval-225-million-us-treasury-funding-whitman-walker-max-robinson,"(Washington, DC) – Today, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that the U.S. Department of Treasury has approved $22.5 million in federal funding to be invested in the Whitman-Walker Max Robinson Center, located on the St. Elizabeths East Campus in Ward 8. This investment is drawn from the American Rescue Plan’s Capital Projects Fund and will support the continued expansion and development of the new Max Robinson Center, which provides critical health care services to the Ward 8 community, with a unique focus on LGBTQ health and HIV care. This funding will support the construction of a new research facility at the Max Robinson Center.

“This investment in Whitman-Walker will spur innovation and create new career and care opportunities for our residents – right here on the St. Elizabeths East campus in Ward 8,” said Mayor Bowser. “We are grateful for this investment from the Biden Administration and for recognizing the critical role that Whitman-Walker plays in building a healthier and more equitable DC.”

The Capital Projects Fund (CPF) provides $10 billion to states, territories, freely associated states, and Tribal governments to fund critical capital projects that enable work, education, and health monitoring. These funds are addressing many challenges laid bare by the pandemic, especially in rural America, Tribal communities, and low- and moderate-income communities, helping to ensure that all communities have access to the high-quality modern infrastructure, including broadband, needed to access critical services.

“Connecting workers and families to training, education, and health care services is central to expanding economic opportunity and prosperity in communities across the country,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “The expansion of Whitman-Walker’s Max Robinson Center, financed in part by the American Rescue Plan’s Capital Projects Fund, shows how the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments are building projects needed to expand access to critical health and educational services.”

The Max Robinson Center is designed to serve residents in the surrounding neighborhoods and offers workforce training and education programs, as well as public access to computers and high-speed internet. The Center also houses the Whitman-Walker Institute, which works closely with residents to seek feedback and to promote research that reflects community experiences and needs. The new CPF funding will allow the Center to build two multipurpose community spaces that will support community health and wellness initiatives, as well as 40 exam/consult rooms, 8 dental suites, and 23 group and psychotherapy rooms that will enable expanded telemedicine services. The investment will also enable workforce training programs, education, and skills in partnership with local universities for D.C. residents interested in administrative and health care roles.

“We are so grateful to the U.S. Treasury and the District of Columbia for this once in a lifetime commitment. Our new Max Robinson Center is a modern and welcoming health care and research facility built for the purpose of expanding health, research and job readiness training for communities with disproportionate health outcomes. From Max we will be able to expand care to 10,000 more people annually; be fully prepared for any future health emergency or outbreak and work to eradicate health disparities for residents in Wards 7 and 8 and throughout the city,” said Naseema Shafi, Chief Executive Officer, Whitman-Walker Health and Cindy Lewin, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Whitman-Walker Health System. “The new site will also provide necessary access to more capacity for community-based research that ensures groundbreaking scientific discoveries. This historic investment at this critical time builds a future for residents of the District of Columbia.”

The Max Robinson Center is the latest addition to the St. Elizabeths East Campus redevelopment in Ward 8. To date, Mayor Bowser has invested over $900 million in the redevelopment, which includes the opening of the Entertainment and Sports Arena, the new 801 Men’s Shelter, the District Townhomes, the Residences at St. Elizabeths, a 750-space parking garage at the Entertainment and Sports Arena, and the Sycamore & Oak retail village. In June, the District celebrated the topping-off of the Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, GW Health facility, a full-service hospital that will open in 2025.

376,Governor Glenn Youngkin Introduces New Effort to Combat Antisemitism in Upcoming Budget,https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018826-en.html,"Governor Glenn Youngkin Introduces New Effort to Combat Antisemitism in Upcoming Budget

Enhances Security Funding Program in the Wake of Increased Antisemitic and Islamophobic Threats Across Commonwealth

RICHMOND, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin today proposed $375,000 of renewed funding for the Virginia Holocaust Museum and $2 million for security grant funds increasing the total fund to $5 million. This fund allows Jewish community institutions to apply for enhanced security measures.

The Virginia Holocaust Museum investment will support the Alexander Lebenstein Teacher Education Institute program, which organizes high-quality learning experiences, educational content, and exhibitions for students to learn about the Holocaust and other genocides. Additionally, the allocated budget funds will support outreach and community-based programming such as the “Speaker’s Bureau,” which provides students with the opportunity to hear firsthand accounts from Holocaust survivors.

The Governor’s budget also revises and increases funding for the Department of Criminal Justice Services’ hate crime security grant program and makes changes to allow at-risk community non-profits to apply for the funds directly. This new initiative will improve security at community centers and over the biennium, will invest $5 million to combat hate crimes.

“At a time of rising antisemitism and disturbing displays on our college campuses, it is more important than ever to support community outreach initiatives, provide learning opportunities for our students about the horrors of antisemitism, and enable security enhancement opportunities for our Jewish communities,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “I’m pleased to pledge an additional $2.3 million dollars in Virginia’s budget to combat antisemitism and reiterate my commitment to stand against antireligious bigotry.”

“Virginia Holocaust Museum is grateful for this timely investment in education and community building by Governor Youngkin,” said Samuel Asher, Executive Director of Virginia Holocaust Museum. “Commitments to Holocaust education respond to the challenging times our communities face statewide. Support like this ensures the Virginia Holocaust Museum can continue to deliver our mission to educate and inspire generations of Virginians to fight prejudice and indifference.”

“My community is deeply grateful for Governor Youngkin’s commonsense approach to safety and security,” said Rabbi Dovid Asher of Keneseth Beth Israel. “When Jews represent just 2% of the population, yet more than 60% of faith-based hate crimes, moral leadership requires exactly this type of major investment. These wise investments will positively impact our state for generations to come.”

Given increased reports of anti-religious bigotry across the country following the October 7th Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Governor Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Directive Six in October, which created an actionable plan to coordinate with educational institutions and law enforcement entities to combat threats of violence against Jewish people and other religious communities. On his first day in office, Governor Youngkin signed Executive Order Number 8 establishing the Commission to Combat Antisemitism, which released a report on December 5, 2022.

In May 2023, Governor Glenn Youngkin signed legislation patroned by Delegate Anne Ferrell Tata and Senator Siobhan Dunnavant, which formally adopts the Working Definition of Antisemitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) on May 26, 2016. This bill was a critical first step toward identifying and combating cases of antisemitism in education, on college campuses, and across the Commonwealth.

The institutions will partner with the Virginia Innovation Partnership Authority to collaborate on commercialization and startup support.

“Today’s investment announcement lays the groundwork for remarkable startup innovation and commercialization that interconnects Charlottesville, the Greater Richmond Area, Roanoke and the New River Valley. Through this state commitment and private philanthropy, we are building Virginia’s research triangle and network, supporting our higher education institutions’ research endeavors, and expanding Virginia’s university research capacity that will enhance life-saving research development for generations to come,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “My administration is committed to building Virginia’s research engine for the future and creating high-paying jobs in the process.”

“For the last decade, VCU’s Medicine for All Institute has led the world in developing innovations to making medicines by lowering costs, strengthening supply resilience, and increasing quality. As we look towards the next decade of the advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in Virginia, Medicine for All is excited to be a partner in growing the capabilities and job opportunities this industry can bring to the Commonwealth. Governor Youngkin’s continued investment and support is helping make this a reality and we are grateful to be a part of this important initiative,” said Dr. Frank Gupton, Co-Founder, Phlow and CEO, Medicines for All.

“The Commonwealth will greatly benefit from this major collaborative initiative from Governor Youngkin to advance biomedical research, innovation and translation at and between the states major academic health centers. This investment will not only advance the ongoing biomedical and health sciences research at the states three largest academic medical centers but will facilitate increased collaboration and innovation between them,” said Dr. Mike Friedlander, Executive Director of Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC and Virginia Tech Vice President of Health Sciences and Technology. “At this time in history, the most impactful advances in medicine come from multi- and trans- disciplinary team science that requires groups with complementary expertise working together across institutions. This initiative will provide such an opportunity for researchers at UVA, VCU, and VTC to accelerate these advances for the benefit of the health of all. In addition to catalyzing research breakthroughs and their applications for improved health, this investment will contribute to the enhanced growth of the bioscience commercialization ecosystem across the state through development of intellectual property and emerging biotechnology companies, working closely with our academic medicine institutions.”

“We are exceptionally grateful for the Governor’s announcement today of the Commonwealth’s additional funding for the UVA Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology,” said Dr. K. Craig Kent, CEO of UVA Health and Executive Vice President of Health Affairs for University of Virginia. “We look forward to continued collaboration with our other university research colleagues and the full spectrum of bioscience partners across Virginia.”

“Innovation is at the heart of a thriving economy and the Commonwealth of Virginia. Today’s landmark investment announced by Governor Youngkin will help accelerate university collaboration and elevate Virginia’s leadership in the critical biotech, life sciences, and pharmaceutical manufacturing health sectors,” said Joseph Benevento, President of the Virginia Innovation Partnership Authority (VIPA).

The Virginia Innovation Partnership Authority will convene the three institutions to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Authority and each other. Once the MOU is signed by the three institutions and by VIPA, $50 million will be available for UVA’s Manning Institute for Biotechnology, $27 million will be available for Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, and $13 million will be available for VCU’s Medicines for All Institute.

— Governor Wes Moore and the Maryland Energy Administration today announced the annual launch of two key programs that bring better energy solutions to the homes of low-to-moderate income Marylanders and Marylanders living in overburdened or underserved communities. The FY24 Energy Efficiency Equity Grant Program and FY24 Solar Energy Equity Grant Program are expected to provide a total of $22.5 million in Fiscal Year 2024 to Maryland nonprofit organizations and local governments to help them install energy efficiency and weatherization measures, as well as solar energy generating systems, on eligible homes.“We must work together to ensure that as we accelerate the transition to a clean energy future, we leave no Marylander behind,”“These programs will help Marylanders save money, create new pathways to work, wages, and wealth, and prove to the nation that you don’t have to choose between a green economy and an equitable one – we can, and will, achieve both.”“Expanding equitable access to the many benefits of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures to Maryland’s most vulnerable is an important part of meeting Governor Wes Moore’s pledge to get Maryland to 100 percent clean energy by 2035. Our goal is to help every Marylander realize the benefits of clean and efficient energy,”“By investing in Maryland’s historically disadvantaged, overburdened and underserved communities, we are underscoring this administration’s commitment to leaving no one behind in the clean energy transition.”According to the U.S. Department of Energy , low-income households have the country’s highest energy burden, or percentage of a household’s monthly income spent on energy expenses. In comparison to higher-income households, low-income households face an energy burden that is, on average, three times higher. Updating outdated and inefficient lighting, appliances, and heating and cooling systems that use large amounts of energy reduces the amount of energy that a household needs, helping Marylanders shrink their energy costs and free up income for other expenses.Adding a solar system further reduces energy cost and consumption, because the energy is produced at virtually zero operating cost. In addition, Maryland’s net metering law allows for solar energy that exceeds a home’s usage to be sold back to the grid, further enhancing the cost savings to disadvantaged, overburdened and underserved Marylanders.The energy efficiency and solar energy sectors have grown rapidly and will continue to do so as the demand for clean, efficient, affordable and reliable energy accelerates. Maryland employed nearly 75,000 clean and efficient energy industry professionals in 2022, according to federal estimates. More than 66,000 of these jobs are in the energy efficiency sector alone and nearly 7,000 jobs are in the solar energy sector. Many current and prior recipients of Energy Efficiency Equity and Solar Energy Equity grants contract with energy efficiency and solar energy installers that offer workforce training and development opportunities to the same communities that benefit from these grant funds. The Maryland Energy Administration expects both programs to be highly competitive. Each applicant and interested party is strongly encouraged to thoroughly review the Funding Opportunity Announcements prior to completing and submitting application packages. Only the strongest proposals that best meet all requirements of the respective program will be considered for funding.More information about the Energy Efficiency Equity Grant Program , including terms, conditions, requirements and how to apply, can be found here . Questions should be directed to the Maryland Energy Administration Section Chief, Energy Efficiency, at LMIReports.MEA@Maryland.gov More information about the Solar Energy Equity Grant Program, including terms, conditions, requirements and how to apply, can be found here .

​“Dr. Slaughter was a trailblazer. He made history as the first Black leader of the University of Maryland, College Park, and through his fierce advocacy for equity and inclusion he left the school better than he found it. Dr. Slaughter expanded minority faculty hiring and retention, developed academic programs in STEM fields, and guided the university with grace. You can find his fingerprints on every corner of the university he helped grow.





The State of Maryland is a better place because of Dr. Slaughter. His legacy of excellence lives on in the students he inspired and the educators he mentored. Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones, friends, and former colleagues.”"
