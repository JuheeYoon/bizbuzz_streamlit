Officers were called to the 900 block of Cox Avenue just before 3:30 p.m. for a person shot, according to Atlanta police. At the scene, which is surrounded by junkyards, autobody shops and car impound lots, police found an unresponsive woman who appeared to have been shot.

Emergency medical personnel pronounced the woman dead at the scene, police said. The victim has not been publicly identified, and police did not say how long she had been dead."

Details are limited, but Channel 2 Action News reported the man was struck after falling onto the northbound tracks. He was not publicly identified.

The incident was reported at around 4:30 p.m., leading officials to stop the rail service and establish a bus bridge to move travelers from Lakewood, East Point and College Park."

Jim Durrett, president and CEO of the Buckhead Coalition, said it stemmed from an abundance of guns and drugs on the streets at a time when the north Atlanta community is getting safer. He said violent crime in Buckhead has fallen 25% year over year.

“I hope the community understands that overall the crime statistics in Atlanta, and especially in Buckhead, have been going in the right direction,” said Durrett, who also is executive director of the Buckhead Community Improvement District. “But we get reminded episodically that there are people out there that are willing to use firearms to get what they want.”

When the dust settled from Saturday’s gunfire, authorities said three of the men died at the scene, while a fourth was alert while being taken to a hospital. The three victims were identified Monday as 22-year-old Javier Leach, 27-year-old Justin Barber, and 23-year-old Kingston Cook by the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office.

It is unclear how everything transpired and whether any of the victims knew each other. However, police believe residents at the high-rise invited others in prior to the shootout, Maj. Peter Malecki told reporters at the scene. The complex has roughly 400 apartment homes, according to its website.

“This is an incident that happened inside a unit,” Malecki said, according to Channel 2. “That’s an area that we cannot police. So, we do need common sense to prevail in those situations. And, of course, nothing good comes from drug activity. This department does its best to shut down drug operations. So, if anyone has tips or information, that’s why we ask that you send those our way so we can try to prevent incidents like this.”

Atlanta City Councilman Howard Shook, who represents the area, said Atlanta police in Zone 2 have done a good job in protecting residents, but can’t stop every crime.

“They can’t stop people from pulling out guns and shooting each other,” he said. “That’s probably what we have here.”

Saturday’s shooting happened a short distance from the Buckhead Village District, home to several shops and dining establishments. Resident Michael Scott told the news station that he was worried about children and families in the area after seeing the aftermath of the gunfire. “It was horrible out here,” he said.

Still, Shook felt the deadly incident didn’t reflect broader issues of violence in the community.

“I’d be worried if this was a family walking out of a restaurant or something like that, but those cases are so rare,” he said. “Most of the violence is propagated by a violent segment of an increasing violent culture.”

The announcement of the ethics council came during a fireside chat about the positives and potential pitfalls of AI between Altman and John Hope Bryant, CEO and founder of financial literacy nonprofit Operation HOPE. Bryant announced the council and said it was about being “a force for good.”

OpenAI, one of the darlings of the tech industry, is backed by more than $10 billion in funding and services by Microsoft. Last month, the board of the AI company announced Altman was fired, saying he had not been “consistently candid in his communications with the board.”

His firing blindsided and infuriated investors and employees. Within days, Altman was offered a job by Microsoft. Nearly all of OpenAI’s employees threatened to quit if Altman was not reinstated. Just five days after the board fired Altman, it reversed its decision and almost all the board members who initially ousted him left.

In the wake of the tumult, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is looking into Microsoft’s investment into OpenAI, according to Bloomberg, as is the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority.

In one of the few comments Altman made alluding to the tumultuous firing, he apologized for being a bit subdued and tired, saying “I’m sorry, it’s been a long few weeks.” The audience laughed and cheered.

“It’s definitely weird, being in the news and reading these things that just don’t seem like me at all,” Altman continued. “You know, in the spirit of having empathy for your enemies, I think people have a lot of anxiety about AI and I get that and I feel that too. And they need a person to project it onto.”

‘Profound ethical implications’

The ethics council was born out of meetings Altman had earlier this year at Clark Atlanta that was facilitated by Bryant. Details on the new initiative were sparse, but Bryant, who will be a co-chair alongside Altman, said it will not provide a legal framework around AI. The goal is rather to provide some ethical guidelines for the burgeoning technology.

How exactly AI will impact humanity is unknown, but it is already transforming everyday life, inspiring both excitement and worry. Companies are trying to get ahead of potential backlash to AI products by standing up their own ethics initiatives, said Paul Root Wolpe, director of the Center for Ethics at Emory University.

Unlike many other technological evolutions, ethics are intrinsic to AI because in most cases the technology must make decisions that impact humans, Wolpe said, like self-driving cars, mortgage algorithms, automated dermatology screenings and more.

“Lots and lots of AI has profound ethical implications and that’s why the AI industry has become so interested in AI ethics, because they can’t get around it,” Wolpe said in an interview before the announcement was made.

Such a council can bring different viewpoints to potentially harmful and biased ways AI could be used, particularly against people of color, because “the definition of harm is not always clear,” Wolpe said. But they are also good public relations for a company that is trying to make sure its products don’t cause public outrage.

Ethical issues in AI are vast, from transparency in how the technology makes decisions to false videos and photos AI can conjure up that’s made to look real, called deepfakes, to autonomous weapons systems, Wolpe said.

Altman acknowledged that it is scary to think about AI going wrong. He said the technology becoming a powerful computer hacking tool and the development of bioweapons keep him up at night.

But he said he was also scared about the technology being developed only in a vacuum.

“The people that are going to be most affected by the technology deserve the biggest voice in what it’s going to do,” Altman said. “If you don’t put it out in the world, if you don’t let people use it, if you don’t show it to people and say ‘Hey, give us feedback,’ you just can’t do that,” Altman said.

A little over a year since his company launched ChatGPT into the world and almost overnight changed how people interacted with AI, government regulators are starting to enact guardrails.

On Friday, the European Union laid out a sweeping new law that’s one of the first major attempts to govern the technology. While the policies would specifically apply to AI systems in the EU market, it will likely impact the tech in the rest of the world.

The U.S. trails behind the EU in regulating AI, though many of the big players are American companies. In October, President Joe Biden issued an executive order on standards for safe and trustworthy AI, but Wolpe noted it “was a blueprint to create regulations, but was not itself a regulation.”

Atlanta leaders will now have a seat at the table with one of the biggest AI players, though it remains to be seen what impact the council will have.

“We want to make sure that the opportunities of AI are also shared with people at the bottom of the economic pyramid here and around the world,” Bryant told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Now in its 10th year, the HOPE Global Forum brings thousands of academics and leaders in business, faith and philanthropy to discuss how to make the economy work better for the underserved. Bryant calls the forum a “Black and brown Davos,” referring to the influential annual World Economic Forum held in Switzerland.

Firefighters eventually knocked down the fire and were able to reach the victim.

“Unfortunately with that much fire at the time, it was unable for the victim to be rescued,” Flanagan told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

County Coroner Richard Hawk said he was waiting to release the woman’s identity.

During the rescue operation, crews were able to get the two men out safely. They were taken to separate Atlanta-area hospitals and their conditions are unclear at this time.

Officials at first believed the fire started in the front of the home near where the woman was found dead, but Flanagan said it likely originated toward the middle of the residence. A cause has not been determined.

“Nothing seems to be suspicious at this time, but at the same time, we do our due diligence and work together to get as many facts as possible,” he added.

The chief noted that the frequency of fires typically increases as temperatures drop. He urged residents to be safe while using candles, heaters and fireplaces and while cooking during the holidays.

“That plays a role in contributing to our increase in fires during this time of year,” Flanagan said. “We do obviously encourage people to be safe.”"

Not that a downturn is impossible, Ayers said: “Chances of a recession are one-in-three. We think a ‘soft landing’ is more likely than not.”

The Federal Reserve’s campaign of rate hikes, aimed at taming inflation, has made borrowing more expensive for households and business. With inflation dropping, but still higher than the Fed would like, those rates aren’t rising, but they are not coming down either.

That means less energetic hiring and more trouble paying bills.

Higher mortgage rates have chilled the housing market, so even with few homes on the market, average home prices are likely to drop this year, according to the forecast. With so many people working remotely at least part of the week, vacancies in office space are rising.

That threatens banks that have made loans to develop real estate. Were that to be widespread, that could spur a financial crisis, similar to the one that threw the economy into a deep recession in 2007-09.

The greatest dangers to the Georgia economy may come from far-off geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine or an expanded Middle East war that disrupts oil shipments and sends energy prices soaring. But unless those kind of crises spin out of control, the Georgia economy should skirt disaster, according to the UGA prediction.

After several years of robust hiring and higher wages, virtually all the signals from companies and consumers will show a deceleration without reversing those gains, Ayers said. “We expect late payments and bankruptcies will increase but only to the levels we saw before the pandemic.”

Georgia overall has the advantage of momentum, he said.

The population has continued to grow, while state and federal governments have greased the skids for a surge of job-creating investments in manufacturing, especially in production and parts for electric vehicles, he said.

Also speaking Monday was Avery Shenfeld, chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, who said many people have thought of the U.S. economy like Wily Coyote in the old Roadrunner cartoons, racing out into thin air, defying physics for several impossible seconds before surrendering to the inevitable.

But the American household has proven resilient, continuing to spend, and with incomes mostly outpacing inflation in recent months, they have kept the economy airborne, he said.

“We’ve been fearing that at some point gravity would take hold,” Shenfeld said. “But we are not going to end up crushed at the bottom of the cliff with an anvil falling on us.”

The economy has defied expectations because people and companies are flexible, Christopher Fagan, a partner at Moore Colson, an Atlanta-based accounting and consulting firm, said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

And while they hate how high interest rates make borrowing more costly, companies and consumers hate it more when those rates are unpredictable, he said. “We definitely have some clients who are struggling. High interest rates — that pulls cash out of their business, cash you would have used.”

More than anything, it was the uncertainty about rates was a problem, Fagan said. “Now we know they are not heading to 10%. They may move up a half-point or down a half-point. It’s a headwind, but Americans in general are very resourceful. People are working around it.”

10,[Georgia] https://www.ajc.com/news/,Chic downtown Atlanta hotel sold to Colorado firm after loan trouble,https://www.ajc.com/news/chic-downtown-atlanta-hotel-sold-to-colorado-firm-after-loan-trouble/YCHIZVPM5VCTZFUBH4YCHDNEFI/,"The W hotel and the 763-room Sheraton Atlanta Hotel became two of the largest properties to face loan distress this year as the office and hospitality markets unevenly recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. High interest rates and a wall of debt set to mature in the coming years have some economists worried a wave of foreclosures could sweep through underperforming commercial properties.

In July, Texas-based Ashford filed a federal notice that it would return the W Atlanta and 18 other hotels across the country because they were not generating enough revenue to cover their debts. The decision to offload the hotels saved Ashford about $305 million in costs to continue holding the properties, while also reducing the firm’s debt portfolio by about $700 million, according to filing.

The 19 hotels were financed by three commercial mortgage-backed securities, whose lenders included Bank of America, Barclays Bank and Morgan Stanley. The loans matured in June, but Ashford Hospitality Trust did not extend the loans after deciding the return on investment was not worth it, according to the filing.

The W hotel, which is managed by Marriott, opened in January 2009, coinciding with the Great Recession.

The situation with Ashford was the second time an owner of the W hotel faced issues with its lenders. Following a complicated foreclosure that also involved the property’s primary lender going through bankruptcy, the hotel went through foreclosure in October 2010.

Ashford Hospitality Trust would acquire the hotel in 2015 for nearly $57 million.

Neither Ashford nor Stonebridge responded to a request for comment. This is Stonebridge’s first hotel in Georgia.

“It’s exciting to not only expand in existing markets but also grow in new markets with these cash-flowing hotels within the Hilton and Marriott families,” Steve Kakaty, Stonebridge’s chief investment officer, said in the release. “We are thrilled to add these properties, which offer both renovation and operational upside, to our portfolio.”"

Officers were called to Renfrew Court, a neighborhood of single-family homes near Adamsville, after getting reports of an unresponsive child, Atlanta police said. When they arrived, officers found the 4-year-old and he was taken to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

Police said the manner and cause of the boy’s death were unclear, and investigators are working to determine the circumstances of the case."

The impact threw the pedestrian into a wooded area on the shoulder of the road. The 17-year-old, whose name was not released, was taken to Wellstar Kennestone Hospital in critical condition and died from the injuries Sunday, according to police.

A spokesperson for the Cobb school system told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution late Monday the teen was a student at Harrison High School.

“It is with great sadness that we announce the sudden passing of a Harrison student,” the school system said. “Our hearts are heavy, and we will keep the student’s family, friends and entire Harrison community in our thoughts, knowing the loss will be felt even more this holiday season. Grief counselors will continue to be available to support students and staff. We do ask you to give our school family privacy during this time of grief.”

At the scene of the crash, Cox admitted he had been drinking but refused to give a breath sample, his arrest warrant states.

“Accused emitted a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, which was strongest when he spoke, had bloodshot and watery eyes, admitted to consuming three beers while at a Christmas party, refused to provide a voluntary breath sample or perform any voluntary field evaluations,” the warrant states.

Neither Cox nor his passenger were injured in the crash. He was arrested at the scene and charged with serious injury by vehicle, DUI, obstruction and failure to yield to a pedestrian, police said. The charges were later upgraded to include first-degree vehicular homicide.

After officers obtained a search warrant, Cox is accused of refusing to allow his blood to be drawn, his warrant states.

On Monday, Cox was being held without bond at the Cobb jail, booking records show."
13,[Georgia] https://www.ajc.com/news/,"Delta offers employees $1,000 for emergency savings, 33,000 sign up",https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-airport-blog/delta-offers-employees-1000-for-emergency-savings-33000-sign-up/ZWKDBPT4ZNBT3HVGG5QNDNPBVY/,"Many employers offer financial literacy programs to their workers as an employee benefit, including Atlanta-based Delta. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Delta cut hours, offered early retirement and took other steps to ensure survival as travel ground to a halt. Delta executives noticed workers were pulling funds from their retirement savings to make ends meet.

This year, Delta launched an expansion of its employee financial well-being courses with longtime nonprofit partner Operation HOPE.

Employees can sign up, watch financial education videos and get financial coaching sessions with Fidelity Investments — and get $750 from Delta deposited into a Fidelity savings account.

Employees who sign up for payroll deductions and put $250 of their own money into their account then get an additional $250 match from Delta.

Day is one of more than 33,000 Delta employees who signed up for the emergency savings fund program the company began offering its employees this year.

About 57% of U.S. adults can’t afford a $1,000 emergency expense, according to Bankrate.com in a report this year.

Of Delta’s 100,000 employees, more than 21,000 have completed the program — most of them frontline hourly employees such as flight attendants and airport workers, according to Kelley Elliott, Delta’s vice president of Total Rewards, who runs human resources for the company. That amounts to about $21 million in Delta contributions.

Day, 51, was featured Monday during a panel discussion between Delta officials and Operation HOPE CEO John Hope Bryant during the financial literacy nonprofit’s annual summit in downtown Atlanta.

Day said she learned during the financial education sessions that “pretty much everything that I was doing was okay. But it wasn’t preparing me for retirement, or leaving an inheritance for my kids,” who are in their early 30s, Day said.

During one of the sessions, her financial coach suggested she consider cutting expenditures on dining out and candle purchases. She gave it a try for a month.

“I could not believe the amount of money that was still in my account” — $700 in one month, she said.

Her daughter recently called and asked for help paying her rent. “And I said, ‘Well how much do you need?” Day said. “While we were still on the phone, I was able to send her” the $850 she needed — something Day says wouldn’t have been possible before she started saving this year.

Day now aims to save enough for a down payment on a house next year. “That’s my goal. I want to leave something for my kids, my grandkids. ... How can I buy a house if I’m buying all these candles?”

She also learned from the financial education sessions that she was leaving money on the table by not contributing more to her 401(k).

Nearly 40% of HR professionals who responded to a survey said their companies offer financial education or counseling to employees, and 20% offer one-on-one financial coaching, according to an HR Research Institute report this year.

During the pandemic more than 40,000 of Delta employees took unpaid leave.

The company’s executives noticed that employees were taking money from their 401(k) funds, collectively pulling out about $1 billion in early withdrawals. That indicated that they were struggling and needed help.

While the airline has paid out more than $1 billion in profit sharing to employees in past years and plans to again for this year’s results, its fortunes plummeted early in the pandemic and profit sharing payments were cut while employee hours and pay were reduced.

Employees who are worried about money “can’t show up to be the best that they can be that day, because they’re stressed out about something else,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said during Monday’s event.

Struggling financially “corrodes your self-esteem, it corrodes your confidence,” said Bryant during remarks on stage with Bastian. “If I don’t feel good about me, I’m not gonna feel good about you.”

“When you remove the stress of somebody financially, you change their lives,” Bryant said."
14,[Georgia] https://www.ajc.com/news/,"Retired NYPD officers, brothers recognized for helping save MLK Jr.’s birth home",https://www.ajc.com/news/crime/retired-nypd-officers-brothers-recognized-for-helping-save-mlk-jrs-birth-home/AW2XIQNQKZEWRIA4FZEHDEL5TU/,"The brothers detained U.S. Navy veteran Laneisha Shantrice Henderson, 26, who allegedly doused the home’s front porch with gasoline before trying to light it on fire. She has been charged with second-degree criminal attempt to commit arson and interference with government property and was denied bond during her first appearance hearing Saturday.

The brothers had just taken their photos of the historic home and were already checking out other sites along the street when another man, Zach Kempf, shouted to them to let them know what had happened and asked for them to follow her. Kempf had stopped the woman from reaching the gasoline-soaked porch after he saw her grab a lighter she’d left in the grass.

“When he told us that the girl was trying to burn the house down and then started running away, right away my brother looks at me and he goes, ‘What do you think? Should we chase her?’” Kenny Dodson said.

“I said, ‘Well, let’s get her. (But) I’m not chasing anybody. I’ll get in the car and (go) after her, but I’m not running after anybody,’” he added with a chuckle.

The brothers said they jumped in their car and followed Henderson down the street until she started into an alley. That’s when Axel Dodson jumped out of the car and followed her.

“As soon as he jumped out of the car to chase, I wanted to keep — no matter how long you’ve been gone ... your policing kicks in, and I wanted to keep my eye on him,” Kenny Dodson said. “So as soon as he jumped out and started chasing her ... I jumped out.”

The two quickly caught up to Henderson and began yelling at her to get on the ground.

“As soon as we got up there and yelled for her to get down, she pretty much knew she was caught,” Axel Dodson said. “She didn’t really put up much resistance and got on the ground. We didn’t have any handcuffs, so I basically just held her arms behind her back.”

The brothers then took the woman back to the scene and waited for Atlanta police to arrive.

“Their quick action saved a jewel of our city — something very important to Atlanta,” police Chief Darin Schierbaum said at the scene.

“When the police commissioner and I first heard about what occurred in Atlanta, we couldn’t have been more proud that it was two NYPD retired officers,” first deputy police Commissioner Tania Kinsella said Saturday. “We say, ‘When you see something, say something,’ but our officers — because once a cop, always a cop — not only did they see something, they did something. And for that, we commend you.”

Kenny Dodson said that just the day before, their father asked them if they missed policing.

“I said, ‘Yeah, you know, I kind of missed that adrenaline rush from time to time, I do. I miss coming out and doing the job and helping people, I miss that,’” he said. “It’s funny that the very next day we’re involved in something like that. But it wasn’t just the adrenaline rush. It was doing it with my brother that I just, I love ... It was the joy I had from doing some policing with my little brother.”"

A more flexible funding formula?

Brace for more talk about tweaking the state funding formula for public colleges and universities when the 2024 session of the Georgia General Assembly begins next month.

We told you in early September about an ad hoc Georgia House of Representatives committee that’s been meeting since late August to discuss state funding for the University System of Georgia and the Technical College System of Georgia.

Since then, lawmakers have brainstormed potential changes to how the state pays to maintain and operate campus buildings. The University System, for example, receives money based on the square footage of its campus facilities, but officials have said that amount hasn’t kept pace with inflation and soaring utility bills.

There also have been discussions about how to help colleges foot the bill for higher-cost programs, such as nursing, that train students for in-demand jobs. Colleges struggle to hire nursing instructors because they generally earn more working as a nurse than teaching at a college, officials say.

Rep. Marcus Wiedower, R-Watkinsville, led the funding formula discussions this fall. At a Dec. 6 House Higher Education meeting, Wiedower said the House, Senate, school leaders, and the governor’s office need to work together to update the appropriations process into something “more malleable” and more “appropriate” to support Georgia’s most-needed career paths.

The University System’s funding formula is driven largely by enrollment and credit hour counts from two years prior. Martin said that two-year “lag” is something that could be addressed: “We actually know how many people are there now.”

Speaking of the upcoming session, lawmakers are already prefiling legislation for their colleagues to consider.

One bill caught our eye because it proposes to remove provisions that make students convicted of certain felony drug offenses ineligible for Georgia’s popular HOPE scholarship and grant programs.

House Bill 853, prefiled on Nov. 22 by Rep. Eric Bell, D-Jonesboro, calls for students to not be disqualified for HOPE “solely based on a conviction for an offense involving marijuana or a controlled substance.”

Bus depot on Irwin Street

A $6.37 million bus depot will be built to house Georgia State University’s new fleet of electric buses.

The Georgia Board of Regents in November authorized the construction of a central bus facility on 1.5 acres of vacant land at 315 Irwin St. in Atlanta.

The depot will house up to 20 buses used to transport students around the campus and to parking areas. In June, Georgia State announced it had received a $22.3 million federal grant to purchase electric buses, which are scheduled to be delivered in summer 2025, according to University System of Georgia documents.

The depot project will include administrative space with offices and restrooms, documents state.

The board also approved a $2.5 million renovation of Kennesaw State University’s Carmichael Student Center. The renovation will create a welcome center for prospective students and visitors to the Kennesaw campus.

Georgia State space research

Georgia State University physics and astronomy professor Stuart Jefferies is the recipient of an out-of-this-world grant.

The university announced last week that Jefferies was awarded the $5 million grant from the U.S. Air Force. It will be used to figure out the best ways to detect, map and image faraway objects in space, the university said. The techniques developed could help bolster national security and assist astronomers by providing clearer images of faint objects, the school said.

Also on the research team are experts from the Georgia Tech Research Institute, the University of Hawaii and the University of Minnesota.

More federal funding for Georgia State

Speaking of Georgia State, the university also received more than $7.5 million from the U.S. Department of Education.

The funding is part of $93 million announced by the federal agency Friday to support research at historically Black, tribally controlled and minority-serving schools. Georgia State’s award comes through the Postsecondary Student Success Grant program, which strives to improve student retention, transfer and graduation rates.

Georgia State is designated as a minority-serving institution by the federal government. Black students make up 42% of the university’s 50,521 enrollment, another 20% of students are white, 18% are Asian, 14% are Hispanic and about 5% are multiracial, according to a fall 2023 state enrollment report.

Georgia State will use the new funding to integrate personalized chatbot communications into introductory math and English courses, according to the Education Department.

Climate change grant

More money is rolling in to support Emory University researchers studying how climate change impacts the health of under-resourced urban populations, focusing on Atlanta.

Emory experts from the Rollins School of Public Health received a $3.8 million federal grant to create the Climate & Health Actionable Research and Translation Center, or CHART.

The center’s research will examine heat-related illness in Atlanta, the university said. The center also will work to identify climate and health issues in the city.

“Extreme heat already kills more Americans than hurricanes, floods and tornadoes combined, and climate change is making it a lot worse, especially for urban populations who already suffer from the urban heat island effect,” said Yang Liu, the center’s director, in a written statement.

The grant will help “build climate change resilience in our communities,” Liu said.

Middle Georgia State’s biggest gift

Middle Georgia State University received the largest contribution in its history from the Delta Air Lines Foundation.

The $3 million grant will expand the aviation program, the university said in a news release.

“This grant opens doors to creating more opportunities for prospective students in our state to pursue rewarding careers in aviation,” said university President Christopher Blake, in a written statement.

A portion of the grant will go toward purchasing equipment, hiring faculty and creating more training sites in rural Georgia and around Atlanta. The aviation school is based in Eastman and has satellite sites in Macon and Griffin.

Unlike many national monuments, there is no gate restricting access to the civil rights leader’s birth home, which attracts more than 700,000 visitors from around the world annually. The two-story Queen Anne-style house sits about 10 yards off the street in a historic preservation district, but Auburn Avenue is a busy public street with no traffic restrictions, making it difficult to secure the area.

Utah resident Zach Kempf, who was in town for business, was visiting the site after wrapping up his last day of work. He told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he and his coworker saw the woman approach the property with a can. At first, they thought she was a groundskeeper using the can to water plants, he said.

“She seemed a little agitated,” said Kempf, whose suspicions rose when the woman rushed passed them and up the porch steps, into a roped-off area, and started yanking on the front door. Those suspicions were confirmed when she started pouring the can’s contents onto the porch and bushes, and the smell of gasoline hit them.

That’s when Kempf started recording on his cellphone as police were called.

“What are you doing?” he is heard asking the woman.

In the video, obtained by the AJC, the woman is dressed in all black with no shoes and waves him away.

“No, that’s gasoline,” Kempf responds.

Before police could arrive, Kempf said he and two other bystanders — who turned out to be retired New York City police officers — realized they had to step in.

Kempf first saw her car keys lying in the grass, so he grabbed them to prevent her from leaving. He then saw her grab a lighter that had fallen onto the ground and quickly ran to block her from going up the steps to the porch. He said when she realized he wouldn’t let her by and that he had her keys, she started to rush away. At that point, the two officers stepped in to restrain the woman until authorities arrived. The entire ordeal lasted less than six minutes, Kempf said.

“If the witnesses hadn’t been here and interrupted what she was doing, I mean, it could have been a matter of seconds before the house was engulfed in flames,” Atlanta fire Battalion Chief Jerry DeBerry told reporters.

Kempf said the woman was never violent or aggressive and didn’t say much when asked what she was doing and why.

Police confirmed she poured gasoline onto the property. An incident report noted that several security cameras in the area captured the incident.

Once in custody, Henderson was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital for a psychological evaluation. She was eventually released and booked into the Fulton County Jail.

Before leaving the Navy in 2020, Henderson was an enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist and received several awards, including the Navy “E” ribbon, good conduct medal, national defense service medal and global war on terrorism expeditionary and service medals.

By Friday morning, there was no evidence at the scene of what had happened the previous day. Aside from news crews gathered outside the home, it seemed to be business as usual with tour groups being led around the site by park rangers. One group posed for photos in front of the historic home after listening to a ranger’s presentation.

The home, which is part of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta, was purchased by King’s grandfather in 1909 for $3,500. King was born there Jan. 15, 1929, and lived in the home until he was 12 years old.

In 2018, the National Park Service officially purchased the home, as well as a house on Sunset Avenue in Vine City where King lived until his death. The NPS is scheduled to pump millions of dollars into the infrastructure of the historical park over the next five years to make significant changes. The birth home was recently closed for major renovations expected to take at least two years.

Judy Forte, the retiring superintendent of the park, said she was stunned by the incident.

“It is hard to understand how a resource as important as Dr. King’s birth home, where someone was born who changed the world, was close to being burned down and destroyed,” said Forte, who is retiring Dec. 31. “I am grateful to the people who stopped it from happening.”

Forte said the park works closely with Atlanta police to provide patrols during the evening and a network of cameras provide surveillance. But due to it being an urban park right off a busy street, it’s hard to barricade. Even while the home is closed, tourists can walk up the path and take photos on the porch steps.

“The preservation of that home is important,” Forte said. “It is the heart and soul of America, and the public has charged us with protecting it.”

Address records show that Henderson lives in Brandon, Florida, about 15 miles outside of Tampa. She previously lived in Eufaula, Alabama, and Tallahassee, Florida, records show. Officials have not shared information about why she was in Atlanta.

Kempf told the AJC that he spoke with Henderson’s family, who arrived at the scene. He said they told him they’d been looking for her and were concerned.

On a Facebook page that appeared to belong to Henderson, she posted several photos with a caption “Fam(ily) Affairs” on Thursday. In that post, she included a hashtag that said #FreeMalachiZYork.

York, also known as Dwight York, was the founder and leader of the Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, a Georgia-based extremist group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. In 2004, York was sentenced to 135 years in prison for various crimes, including molesting children.

Thursday’s incident remains under investigation by Atlanta police and fire, as well as the National Park Service. The FBI said it is aware of the allegations but did not confirm if it is investigating.

It’s not the first time that one of the civil rights icon’s homes has been attacked. On Jan. 30, 1956, one month after the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott, King’s home was bombed while his wife Coretta, 7-week-old daughter Yolanda and a neighbor were inside. The front of the home was damaged, but no one was injured.

Then, in April 1960, after King and his family returned to Atlanta, Ku Klux Klansmen burned crosses in front of several Black homes in the city. King’s residence, where he lived with Coretta before they moved to Sunset Avenue, was targeted.

The park service said it is “dedicated to maintaining the safety and sanctity of this historic site, ensuring that it remains a place of inspiration and reflection for all” and will take precautionary measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the average life expectancy for Americans is 76.4 years. That means you have a good chance of seeing the comet if you were born in the 80s or later.

And, lucky us, Halley’s orbit will favor watchers in the Northern Hemisphere, the website states.

“Interestingly, 2061 is the mirror-image of the comet’s last appearance in the winter/early spring of 1986,” space.com wrote. “Back then, the comet was out of sight and on the opposite side of the sun in midwinter; but in midsummer of 2061 the comet will be on the same side of the sun as us, in full view, and appearing at least 10 times brighter! Then it will rapidly drop down, and upon entering the evening sky, will gradually favor more southerly locations.

“But for viewers at mid-northern latitudes the comet should still evolve into an eye-catching sight, albeit low in the west-northwest sky on early August evening,” it continued.

That, of course, depends on how much development happens in the next four decades. Bright lights could block out any comet sightings."

As work on the concrete pads begins, it’s yet to be seen how the new electric air taxi industry that Archer envisions may develop, and how that could transform the town of Covington with a population of about 15,000.

Still, state and local officials have offered millions of dollars in tax incentives to Archer for the project — including a $3 million grant for machinery and equipment, contingent on job creation. Plans are underway to train people to work in the factory building a new generation of aircraft.

Choosing Georgia

The decision to choose Covington over 28 other sites in consideration around the country was led by Archer vice president of manufacturing Glen Burks, who spent some time in Marietta and Atlanta while in the Marine Corps.

But it was a particular mix of political, geographic and economic factors that made the Covington site attractive enough to seal the deal. He recalled meeting with Newton County Industrial Development Authority officials two years ago during the site selection process.

“The very first time we sat down on August 2021 in Covington and met them for the first time, they were so excited about Archer,” Burks said during remarks at an Atlanta Aero Club luncheon in September.

Other developments — including a planned Rivian electric vehicle plant to be built farther down I-20 — encountered fierce resistance from local residents and some local officials.

Burks said the cooperation he saw from officials in Covington “makes it to where you can solve anything.”

Georgia and local officials are hungry for projects like Archer, which they code-named Project Jane early on. The state and Gov. Brian Kemp “have identified e-mobility as a critical industry to Georgia’s future,” according to Georgia Department of Economic Development global commerce division director Bob Kosek. “Georgia is creating the jobs of tomorrow, building on our existing industries, including aerospace.”

Kosek called Archer “a natural fit for the community’s tech ecosystem, which includes Meta, Rivian, and Takeda.”

Covington ended up as one of three finalists for the Archer Aviation site, along with Tucson, Arizona, and the Alliance Airport in Fort Worth, Texas.

Burks said the elements that made Covington attractive included the location on an airport, affordability and the town’s growth aspirations.

With plans to hire hundreds of hourly workers for the factory, Burks prioritized a low cost of living — a lesson he learned after seeing hourly workers struggle with a high housing costs in Maryland at a previous job.

Having a community with housing “at a price point they could afford — whether that’s apartment living, townhomes, single family homes... that’s certainly important to me,” Burks said.

And he said that over a series of visits to Covington over the last couple of years, he has seen the town grow.

Certification flight path

Archer’s most important goal is working toward certification of its Midnight aircraft in the new electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) category, a process that is expected to stretch into 2025.

Archer aims to get a production certificate to open the Covington facility in the middle of next year and begin building aircraft on an assembly line.

Getting new aircraft certified takes years even under good circumstances, and the task of getting Federal Aviation Administration approval for eVTOLs that could change how people fly is even more daunting.

Still, Archer is already putting the pieces in place to prepare for the Covington site, including hiring some employees to start working at its San Jose facility. The first six to eight aircraft are being produced at San Jose for testing and those employees will move to Covington when the new plant opens. They’re being trained with a three-week curriculum developed in partnership with Georgia Piedmont Technical College.

Building a workforce

In the first few years, Archer plans to ramp up to a few hundred workers at the Covington facility, according to Tosha Perkins, Archer’s chief people officer. That is expected to grow to about 650 workers come 2027, and as many as 1,500 workers by 2030.

To do that, the company plans to help develop a certificate program at Georgia Piedmont Technical College to train an eVTOL manufacturing workforce, and use the state’s workforce development program Georgia Quick Start.

Perkins said she doesn’t plan to list the job openings until sometime in the first half of next year when the company is confident that it will get the production certificate around June.

She knows attracting people to Covington to work in an entirely new industry won’t necessarily be easy.

“Covington itself is a very small town,” Perkins said. So it will be important that the community continues to add enough housing for hundreds more workers and that the area is alluring enough to draw people willing to move there and raise a family. “It’s just not yet built up in a way where we could do that today,” she said."

Then, Brittney Heinzman realized her bags weren’t hanging in the doorway of her Irvine apartment, where they normally would.

She tried to brush it off. Maybe she was just jetlagged from her flight home, or perhaps she had been in more of a rush to leave for Thanksgiving than she remembered.

But then Heinzman noticed the TV was gone from her bedroom dresser. And there was a stray espresso cup in her shower.

She ran to her closet to see what else might be missing — only to find a woman cowering in the corner, clutching kitchen utensils, including a pizza cutter.

Heinzman remembered screaming.

The woman left, and in less than 48 hours she was behind bars for what police have described as a burglary carried out in multiple trips, and possibly over several days.

Wendy Wilkinson, a resident of the same apartment complex, is accused of stealing at least $30,000 worth of items from Heinzman’s apartment while her neighbor was out of town — including designer handbags, sunglasses, two TVs, credit cards and her passport, according to Kyle Oldoerp, a spokesperson for the Irvine Police Department.

Wilkinson, who officers found hiding in her own closet, was booked Dec. 3 on suspicion of burglary and possession of stolen items, Oldoerp said.

“We are unable to confirm exactly how many times she went into the apartment,” Oldoerp said. “It’s more than likely she went in multiple times. ... It’s possible she was going back and forth between her apartment.”

It’s that possibility that has Heinzman most on edge.

“Knowing that someone was in my place, multiple times — you don’t know if they were in your bed,” Heinzman said, tearing up.

The 35-year-old continues to find more items gone from her apartment. But what’s missing most is her sense of security.

“This woman didn’t just want handbags, she didn’t just want a TV — she wanted my identity,” Heinzman said. “That’s the part that makes your stomach feel so sick.”

Heinzman, who works in software sales, said she knows all those stolen items — while valuable — are replaceable. But she’s struggling with unanswered questions, as well as how to move forward after finding a stranger in her home.

Oldoerp said there were no signs of forced entry, but Heinzman said she knows she locked her apartment door when she left. Police say they found items stolen from Heinzman’s apartment in Wilkinson’s apartment, car and an off-site storage unit.

Heinzman said she moved to the Skyloft Apartments on Main Street, touted as a luxury complex, for increased security. But she said that promise has fallen short. It was a neighbor’s front-door camera that caught footage of the suspect, not building security cameras, police said.

“There’s just no security at this building,” Heinzman said. “I moved out of L.A. into a safer place ... [but] it’s like smoke and mirrors.”

Representatives from Skyloft and Legacy Partners, the real estate firm that manages the property, did not respond to a request for comment.

Heinzman hasn’t felt safe enough to stay in her apartment since she came home from her weeklong trip to visit family over Thanksgiving. She said she worries for her neighbors as well.

Wilkinson was arrested and charged in two other burglaries in 2021, court records show. However she was not convicted in either case, as they were were diverted through a mental health pretrial program, according to Orange County court records. Wilkinson remains in jail on $150,000 bail, court records show.

Heinzman said she needs to find a new place to live for her peace of mind. She had only moved into Skyloft seven months ago.

“To this day, I’m realizing more and more stuff that’s gone,” Heinzman said. “I just invested all this money into this place, I loved my place, and then the mental part of it — you don’t sleep, you have this image in your mind of this person standing in your closet.”"
25,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,What are the odds? Two winning tickets for $395-million jackpot sold at same Encino gas station,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/what-are-the-odds-two-winning-tickets-for-395-million-jackpot-sold-at-same-encino-gas-station,"Powerball and California Lottery forms are on display at Blue Bird Liquor in Hawthorne. Two tickets sold at the same Encino gas station picked the winning number for a $395-million Mega Million jackpot Friday.

In a first in California Mega Millions history, two tickets purchased from the same Chevron station on Ventura Boulevard in Encino hit the $395-million jackpot, potentially creating controversy over the retailer’s share of the winnings.

The chances of winning a Mega Millions jackpot stand at an astonishing 1 in 302,575,350. The prospect of two separate transactions winning with the same numbers at one location can seem implausible, especially considering there are 23,000 lottery retailers across the state.

Whoever owns the two tickets would split the jackpot, but it is still unclear whether the two tickets were purchased by the same person or two players, which could result in controversy over whether the gas station owner is awarded $1 million or more for selling the tickets.

As of Monday, the jackpot has yet to be claimed, according to lottery spokesperson Carolyn Becker.

The identity of the person or people who purchased the tickets remains unknown. However, Becker said the lottery’s gaming system meticulously tracks each transaction statewide, and the law enforcement team investigating the winnings knows whether it was a single transaction or two separate ones.

The California Lottery isn’t revealing this information to “protect the integrity of the security review process once there’s a prize claim.” Potential jackpot winners coming forward must undergo a vetting process, involving a California Lottery law enforcement officer interview to verify that they are legitimate winners.

“It’s a really rigorous vetting process, particularly for these big jackpots, to make sure that the winner is actually the right winner and not some bad actor trying to claim to be the winner,” Becker said.

Los Angeles County Luxury Playground in the Valley Entertaining in Encino has never been so effortless. Welcome to 4778 Zelzah Avenue, the epitome of indoor/outdoor living.

Becker said it could take weeks or months to release the information regarding the number of transactions. The identities will also be disclosed, adhering to California laws that require the lottery to publicize the winner’s complete name and location within a year.

Although two winning tickets being sold in one location is unusual, Becker said it is not impossible.

“Perhaps one person wanted to try their luck on two different rows for whatever reason, or maybe a couple of buddies wanted to try their chances with the same exact numbers,” Becker said.

When store manager Nitessh Karla arrived at the gas station Saturday morning, a barrage of voice mails greeted him, with one from state lottery officials telling him his store had sold the winning tickets.

“I got a telephone call [saying] ‘Your store hit the jackpot.’ Then I checked the machine and found out someone won the lotto,” Karla said.

Apart from the occasional Scratcher winner collecting a smaller jackpot, Karla said he had never witnessed a win like this in his nine years at the store.

Karla is skeptical that two customers purchased the winning tickets.

“Personally, I think it is the same guy. Maybe he forgets he already bought it and buys it again,” Karla said.

How the tickets were purchased is pivotal to whether Karla’s store receives only $1 million or nearly $2 million in lottery bonuses.

A retailer who sells a winning ticket is eligible to receive a bonus of half of 1% of the jackpot, capped at $1 million. But if a retailer sells two tickets that both win on the same game, it could be considered two transactions and result in more than $2 million in bonuses.

Becker said this bonus payout is “unprecedented in California in terms of a jackpot of this magnitude.” The California Lottery’s legal team is reviewing the regulations’ language, she said.

“Our lawyers are looking at it because if it’s one person, the retailer will get a million dollars,” Becker said. “The question is, do they get more than that? Do they get two bonuses that add up to more than a million dollars?”

The winning numbers for Friday’s game were 21, 26, 53, 66, 70, and the Mega number 13. This was the 10th Mega Million jackpot won in 2023.

The jackpot for the next Mega Millions drawing Tuesday will be $20 million.

With the store’s newfound notoriety, Karla said he has seen an increase in customers buying lotto tickets and Scratchers, hoping the store’s luck hasn’t dried out yet."

The complaint, filed by a dozen L.A. County cities in late September, sought an injunction barring the Los Angeles County Superior Court from using the new schedule. The suit alleged the court violated its responsibilities to uphold public safety under the California Constitution by enacting a new policy that would eliminate the use of bail in almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases.

Orange County Superior Court Judge William Claster, who was hearing the case because it had to be moved outside of L.A. County, ruled Monday that the state Constitution does not require the use of money bail. Claster also said he could not grant the cities’ request for relief because it would overturn a preliminary injunction granted earlier this year that barred the Los Angeles police and sheriff’s departments from enforcing cash bail requirements except in cases deemed to carry a risk of violence.

Claster allowed the cities to amend their complaint, but his ruling broadly struck down each argument they made in their 85-page lawsuit filed in late September, shortly before the new bail schedule took effect.

The case is expected to return to court in March, and some of the plaintiffs remained positive Monday despite Claster’s ruling.

“We’ll go back and take another look at this in light of what the court said from the bench,” said Whittier Mayor Joe Vinatieri. “We will take another shot at it.”

California Hollywood exec’s son held without bail in Tarzana body parts case Samuel Bond Haskell IV is ordered held without bail on charges that he murdered his wife and in-laws then left his wife’s torso in a dumpster.

Under the new schedule, which went into effect on Oct. 1, almost all misdemeanor defendants can be cited and released, or freed without bail after their case is reviewed by a judge. The judge has the option to institute other nonfinancial conditions of release, such as electronic monitoring or home supervision by probation officials, in each case.

Certain misdemeanors — including stalking, domestic battery and violation of a protective order — still require cash bail under the new schedule. Defendants accused of murder, manslaughter, rape and most types of assault still face hefty cash bail amounts.

The new bail schedule has drawn backlash from law enforcement leaders and some politicians, who argue releasing defendants without bail would lead them to re-offend without fear of consequences. Similar complaints were made after the county implemented an emergency “zero bail” policy to lower jail populations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. A report to the L.A. County Board of Supervisors last year showed that instances of re-arrest or failure to appear in court remained relatively unchanged in the wake of the policy.

“The message criminals get from the wide provision of cite-release or booking-release in the bail schedules is that they can immediately continue criminal activity with impunity, and with little actual, imminent consequences,” the lawsuit said.

Claster, however, ruled that he had no legal obligation to act simply because the cities disagreed with the wisdom of the court’s bail policy.

“Whether the cities are correct in this assessment is not before this Court,” Claster wrote, adding that he could only rule on whether or not the policy complies with state law.

Although data on the effects of the 2-month-old bail policy are limited, court and police records raise doubts about the argument that the release of low-level offenders has led to any kind of crime surge.

According to data made public by the court last month, only 3% of the more than 5,000 people processed under the new bail schedule were re-arrested during the first three weeks it was in effect. In November, all categories of property crime decreased in Los Angeles, according to LAPD data."
27,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"‘I hate Mexicans,’ woman shouts at mother in viral video from Disneyland",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/racist-rant-caught-on-video-inside-disneyland-bathroom,"Video of a woman’s rant in a Disneyland bathroom last week went viral after it was shared by a mother who confronted the woman for making racist comments toward her and her 2-year-old son for speaking Spanish, she said.

After a video went viral showing a woman shouting “I hate Mexicans” in a Disneyland parking lot bathroom, a man was arrested while protesting outside her San Bernardino County home over the weekend, authorities said.

Eva Ramirez confronted the woman for making racist comments toward her and her 2-year-old son for speaking Spanish as they were heading into the Anaheim theme park on Tuesday, according to an Instagram post from Ramirez, who recorded part of the encounter.

The woman in the video, wearing a Steamboat Willie T-shirt and mouse ears, says, “This is America. You don’t speak Spanish in America, an English-speaking country.”

“I have a child and I speak Spanish to my child. You have a problem with that?” Ramirez says. “We can speak Spanish wherever the heck we want to.”

The woman, accompanied by an older woman who got into a wheelchair after using the bathroom, tells Ramirez she and her son should not have used a large, unmarked stall.

“Your comment was racist and it had nothing to do with using the restroom,” Ramirez says.

The woman throws up her hands and says, “I don’t care. I hate Mexicans, it’s true. There it is.”

As the woman walks by Ramirez and several other people in the restroom, she extends her middle finger toward the camera.

Disneyland security told Ramirez they could not make the woman leave because it was only a verbal confrontation, she said.

“A security guard told me, ‘Well, what do you want us to do about it?’” Ramirez said when reached by phone Monday.

She wanted someone with Disneyland to acknowledge the racist incident, but security only offered to escort her into the park after she showed them the video, she said. When she and her son were escorted in, she saw the other woman being led into an office.

“They told me that they already got her side of the story, and it felt dismissive as I tried to explain what happened,” Ramirez said. “I told them I wouldn’t stay at Disneyland, because I wouldn’t feel safe knowing that they let that other person into the theme park and didn’t do anything for me.”

Security guards called Anaheim police officers to the park, but Ramirez said Disneyland employees seemed to downplay the confrontation.

A spokesperson for Disneyland could not be immediately reached for comment, and the Anaheim Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.

Ramirez’s video has received over 8,500 likes on Instagram and subsequent re-posts by other social media accounts. The exchange in the bathroom was first reported by KTLA-TV Channel 5.

Several social media accounts shared the name of the woman believed to have made the racist comments, but she has deleted or made her own social media accounts private. A person who answered a phone number associated with her name hung up when a Times news reporter identified themselves.

On Sunday, a small crowd of protesters gathered outside a home in Apple Valley, where activists said the woman lives. As they shouted her name, San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies arrived in four cruisers, according to video shared by the Instagram account Riverside County Accountability.

Among the protesters was Edin Enamorado, an activist known for calling attention to people who make racist comments or harass street vendors, often protesting outside their homes and places of work or over social media.

A deputy told the protesters to get on the ground, but nobody moved. The group recorded the deputies as they approached, and Enamorado said they had permission to protest from a neighbor in the gated community.

A few seconds after stepping out of his car, a deputy handcuffs Enamorado and another deputy throws his phone into the street, according to the video.

Enamorado said he was booked on charges of trespassing and refusing to leave. A spokesperson for the sheriff’s department confirmed that Enamorado was arrested and released from jail.

“We were there to let her know and her neighbors know who she is,” Enamorado said when reached by phone on Monday. “I do think she is a bigot, but first I would say that she is uneducated.”

Enamorado said Ramirez reached out to him to provide a bigger platform for her Instagram post, adding that he feels people who make racist comments in public should know there are consequences for their actions."

Surprise, surprise.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/shohei-ohtani-orange-county-losing-young-people,"Shohei Ohtani celebrates after scoring during a game between the Angels and Pittsburgh Pirates at Angel Stadium on July 21.

When Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani joined the Angels in 2018, my cousins and I made a bet. How long until he leaves Orange County to join the Los Angeles Dodgers?

We knew it wasn’t a matter of if, but when.

Not just because the Blue Crew is one of baseball’s marquee franchises, while the Halos are as respected as a soul patch. Or because Angels owner Arte Moreno makes NFT investors seem as smart with their money as, well, the Dodgers, who just signed Ohtani to the richest contract ever in professional sports, at $700 million for 10 years.

Nah, we knew Ohtani was fated to leave because he’s a young, talented person — and folks like him usually get the hell out of O.C. the moment they can.

We saw the best minds of my generation flee for Austin, Texas, Chicago, New York, the Inland Empire, but especially L.A. — the place our elders taught us to fear as full of crime and liberals. Our friends and relatives left to find opportunities that were impossible in staid, conservative, expensive Orange County. They rarely looked back. When their new neighbors asked where they were from, most would demur and say “Southern California” or “near Los Angeles.”

City, civic and county leaders didn’t care about this exodus, since O.C. was never meant to be cool. We were the spot where people moved after they made it. Orange County was aspirational, and if you couldn’t afford to hack it here, good riddance and don’t forget to take along other underachievers like you.

This thinking went on, unchecked, for decades. But it’s finally dawning on the lords of O.C. that losing our young to Los Angeles and elsewhere portends doom.

Orange County has shrunk in population three out of the last four years — a once-unthinkable development in a region that has always bragged about its growth. O.C’s median age has gone from 33.3 years in the 2000 census to 39.5 years in 2022, a rate of aging that has outpaced the nation. About 17,000 people between the ages of 20 and 35 left in 2016 and 2017 alone, according to the Orange County Business Council’s most recent Workforce Housing Scorecard, which called the youthful exodus a “troubling trend” and a “drain on the county’s future workforce.”

Like Orange County, the Angels have historically preferred established and over-the-hill players and barely blinked when homegrown prospects left for better opportunities. The team rarely invests in its farm system, the way Orange County cities have never really cared about creating affordable housing, good-paying jobs or other necessities that would help to keep young people here. Ohtani, like so many of the smart people who have left O.C. in my lifetime, finally got fed up with his situation — and could you blame him?

Even Moreno couldn’t resist the siren call of L.A. — he renamed his team the Los Angeles Angels shortly after buying it 20 years ago.

This is an apples-to-oranges comparison, of course — or rather, Dodgers-to-Angels. The 29-year-old Ohtani, unlike most millennials, is a once-in-an-epoch phenom with enough money to buy a series of homes from Angel Stadium to Dodger Stadium. But his departure means the Angels are now staring at years of irrelevancy if Moreno continues his youth-averse ways.

That’s where Orange County finds itself today.

It’s sad to say this about a place where I was born and raised and plan to live my entire life, because heaven knows, people outside of the power structure have tried to stop this brain drain. From the late 1990s through the 2010s, I followed and eventually wrote about those who were trying to make O.C. a cool place, one we could proudly proclaim to be as hip as L.A. Homegrown stars shined in clubs, restaurants, galleries, fashion and other culture scenes. Cities like Costa Mesa, Anaheim and Santa Ana became creative hubs that — gasp — even Angelenos would visit.

No one exemplified this creativity more than Gwen Stefani, Orange County’s most famous musician and someone whom the Board of Supervisors included this month as an inaugural member of the Orange County Hall of Fame. She and her band, No Doubt, became global stars with their breakout album “Tragic Kingdom,” a title that was a play on Disneyland’s nickname and meant to reflect how people of Stefani’s generation hated boring, old Orange County and were committed to do something about it.

Stefani has always proudly repped Orange County, caring enough to be the headliner when Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre closed down in 2016 and when Anaheim’s Honda Center celebrated its 30th anniversary in September. But Ms. O.C. hasn’t lived down here for decades. After spending a few years in Oklahoma with her husband, country superstar Blake Shelton, she’s back in Los Angeles.

The scenes that birthed Stefani and others fizzled out, as people aged out and fled their old stamping grounds to the suburban limbo of south Orange County, or to places like Nashville. Some are still fighting the good fight — but more than ever, they look to L.A. for their creative and professional salvation.

Including me.

When I joined The Times five years ago this month, I had spent my career almost exclusively covering Orange County. I wanted to show the rest of the world that my homeland was worthy of respect and to highlight those battling against the forces that kept driving out too many talented people.

I planned to continue focusing on O.C. in my new job. Once I began to cover Los Angeles, that changed. I quickly discovered an excitement and energy to L.A. that doesn’t exist in Orange County and can’t be replicated elsewhere, that intoxicates you and makes you wonder what took you so long to get it.

Ohtani will soon experience that for himself. That’s why I don’t blame him for leaving the Halos, as cool as it would have been to see him in Orange County for the rest of his career. He and too many others before him saw no future down here, especially once they realized there are far more welcoming places out there.

To paraphrase a famous World War I song, how ya gonna keep us down in Anaheim after we’ve seen the City of Angels?"
29,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Column: Hunter Biden isn’t being accused of any new wrongdoing. So why was he just indicted again?,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-12-11/hunter-biden-indictment-tax-charges-special-counsel-david-weiss-republican-impeachment,"It’s not necessarily sinister for a prosecutor to go from offering an attractive plea deal to a defendant to throwing the book at him. Plenty of defendants have seen that happen after they turn down a plea bargain or authorities turn up new evidence.

But the reasons for the dramatic shift in Hunter Biden’s case are more unusual and troubling.

Under a nine-count indictment brought by special counsel David Weiss in Los Angeles last week, Biden faces new and far more serious charges for the very same conduct that was the subject of a favorable plea agreement in July. The deal would have required the president’s son to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax violations while dismissing a gun charge if Biden could stay out of trouble for a year.

The collapse of that deal is one reason for the new charges against Biden. Sloppy lawyering on both sides resulted in an agreement that seemed to require the judge to decide whether to bring or dismiss the gun charges, a quintessentially executive function that could violate the separation of powers. She rightly balked, and the parties couldn’t put the pieces back together.

The important point is that the unwinding of the bargain had nothing to do with Biden. He was in effect an innocent bystander to the breakdown.

Biden’s second bad break was a function of the Department of Justice’s special counsel regulation and Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland’s determination to remain — and appear — apolitical.

The department is committed to the principle that like defendants should be treated alike. If a line prosecutor proposes to charge a crime either far more harshly or far more leniently than in previous cases, she had better have a compelling reason. The department’s many-tiered supervisory structure is tasked with ensuring the consistency that is a hallmark of equal justice. Even a U.S. attorney — the position Weiss previously held under former President Trump and President Biden — may be overruled in a high-profile case if he departs from standard practice.

That supervisory structure was irrelevant here, however. Once Weiss asked for special counsel status and Garland granted it as of August, he gained a fiefdom within the department where no one could second-guess his decisions.

The consequences were enormous for Biden. I have looked long and hard without finding such a tough case against another defendant like him — that is, one who failed to pay taxes while in the depths of substance abuse and later paid them back with interest and penalties.

This suggests a serious abuse of prosecutorial discretion. Weiss may have the raw power to charge the case as he did, but doing so violates the core principle of treating like defendants alike.

That brings us to the third and most unnerving potential reason for the new federal case against Biden. The maximalist indictment, which includes all manner of gratuitous swipes at Biden’s dissolute conduct in the throes of drug addiction, comes after Republicans in Congress savagely attacked Weiss over the prospective plea deal.

A number of House Republicans want to see Hunter Biden in the stocks. It goes without saying that such partisan blood lust has no place in federal charging decisions.

But it gets worse. Republicans in Congress are trying to use the new charges to help justify an impeachment investigation of President Biden — notwithstanding the absence of any persuasive evidence tying the president to his son’s misconduct.

It would be controversial but not unheard of to target one family member to get at the criminal conduct of another. It would be beyond the pale to do so in the service of a highly dubious political endeavor such as the move toward impeaching President Biden.

Hunter Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, reacted to the charges with indignation, promising to put the government on trial. The problem is that the law provides very little room to challenge the probity of prosecutorial decisions. Claims of vindictive prosecution are restricted to narrow conditions that don’t apply here.

Hunter Biden has been to hell and back in recent years. He may be headed that way again through no fault of his own — and for reasons that appear to be nakedly political.

30,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Hoping to build an ADU? New grants can help low-income Californians get started,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/adu-grants-resume-to-help-lower-income-californians-build,"Michael Wolff looks over plans for an accessory dwelling unit he is building for his father in Santa Rosa in this September 2019 file photo.

State officials have revived a popular grant program to help lower-income California homeowners build accessory dwelling units by covering some of the upfront costs. But funding is limited, so demand for aid may soon outstrip the supply of dollars.

The California Housing Finance Agency’s ADU Grant Program offers up to $40,000 to qualified homeowners to cover pre-construction costs of an ADU, including planning and permit fees for the structure. The program exhausted its initial $100 million months ago, causing the agency to stop taking applications; now, $25 million more is available for homeowners seeking help.

Obtaining a grant is not as simple as filling out a form online, however. For starters, applicants have to meet the program’s new income limits. Household income must be less than 80% of the area median income, which translates in Los Angeles County to $84,160. That’s down from 150% of the area median income in the initial round of grants.

Applicants also need to work through a state-approved lender or “special financing participant” because the grants aren’t paid to homeowners — they’re paid to lenders. The CalHFA website lists 18 participating lenders as well as 10 governmental or nonprofit agencies, including Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles County, which specializes in affordable housing.

Typically, homeowners must obtain a construction loan for an ADU from a participating lender before seeking an ADU grant. The loan will cover the costs that the grants will reimburse, including architectural designs, permits, soil tests, impact fees, property surveys, energy reports and utility hookups, the agency says. These expenses can make up a sizable portion of the cost of a new ADU, especially one built by converting a garage or other existing structure.

If you haven’t started work on an ADU yet, let alone obtained a loan, you can still get in line for a state grant. Neighborhood Housing Services, which provides construction loans for ADUs, says it will try to reserve a potential grant for anyone who emails it two pieces of information: a current mortgage statement and one month’s worth of pay stubs or other proof of income. The information, which should be sent to admin@nhslacounty.org, should also include the person’s legal name, address and Social Security number.

A homeowner who meets the income limits but can build an ADU without a loan can still apply for a grant through NHSLA. But the agency’s construction team would have to manage the project and the grant funds, said Iris Cruz of Neighborhood Housing Services.

Grant applicants will have to sign and submit an affidavit to CalHFA attesting to several things about themselves and their plans, including that they are a U.S. citizen or legal resident; they own and have their primary residence on the property where the ADU is being built; they will use the ADU for permanent housing or long-term rentals; and the ADU will conform to local building and zoning codes. If any of those statements prove to be false, the applicant could face a prison term and a fine of up to $10,000.

The lender, meanwhile, will have to attest that the grant applicant meets the program’s income limits."

Kevin McCarthy.

Bakersfield Assemblymember Vince Fong said Monday he is entering the race to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy in Congress, becoming the best-known Republican vying for the Central Valley seat in the House of Representatives.

When McCarthy announced last week that he planned to retire by the end of the year, Fong, 44, said he would not run for California’s 20th Congressional District seat. But on Monday morning, Fong said he had changed his mind.

“It is my strong belief that the Central Valley must continue to be represented by proven, conservative leaders in Congress,” Fong said. “In light of recent developments and in an attempt to unite our community in this critical moment in our nation’s history, I have decided to run for Congress in 2024.

“I have spent my career fighting for Central Valley families. I am eager and ready to take that fight to Washington and deliver meaningful results for our community.”

Fong, who was born and raised in Bakersfield, began his career working for McCarthy’s predecessor, then-Rep. Bill Thomas, then worked for nearly a decade as McCarthy’s district director. Fong was elected to the state Assembly in 2016.

It’s a path that mirrors that of McCarthy, who began his political career in Thomas’ office, then served four years in the state Assembly before running for Congress.

In Sacramento, Fong has largely focused on public safety, water and fiscal issues, generally eschewing culture wars that dominate some parts of the GOP. He carried bills attempting to pause a tax on gasoline that funds road repairs and direct money away from high speed rail, both of which were unsuccessful.

Fong has served as the vice chairman of the Assembly budget committee, a perch he has used to advocate for conservative fiscal policies even though Republicans have little power to influence decisions in the state Capitol.

Fong currently represents about 60% of the voters in California’s 20th Congressional District, his campaign said.

In Washington, Fong said he would aim to “defend the Central Valley’s water and energy resources,” focus on border security, and oppose “new taxes and the reckless spending that has fueled inflation and caused our cost of living to soar.”

Fong’s announcement came hours after California Sen. Shannon Grove (R-Bakersfield), seen as a front-runner for the seat, said she would not run.

In a statement late Sunday, Grove said “after prayerful consideration and thoughtful discussions” with her family, she had decided to finish serving her California Senate term, which ends in 2026.

Politics Kevin McCarthy will retire from Congress at end of year Rep. Kevin McCarthy will give up his Bakersfield seat after nearly two decades in Congress, leaving House Republicans with an even slimmer majority.

“I will honor my commitment to those who elected me to the California state Senate, and I will continue to fight for the needs of Central Valley residents,” Grove said. “Our district feeds and fuels the nation, and I intend to continue fighting for those interests! As one of only 40 Senators in the state, there is still much work that lies before me.”

Candidates have until Wednesday to enter the race for McCarthy’s seat.

33,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Tesla’s response to the DMV’s false-advertising allegations: What took so long?,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-12-11/tesla-dmv-false-advertising-charges,"Seven years after Tesla released the automated driving feature it calls Full Self-Driving, the California Department of Motor Vehicles is pressing accusations of false advertising, with serious implications for the electric car maker.

Tesla is defending itself by saying, in effect, that the DMV let the company slide for so many years, the case no longer has legal standing. Plus, the company, run by Chief Executive Elon Musk, says the DMV is violating its free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution’s 1st Amendment.

The DMV “has been aware that Tesla has been using the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability since Tesla started using those names in 2014 and 2016 respectively,” the company said in a response filed in a state administrative court Friday.

The company “relied upon [the DMV’s] implicit approval of these brand names” and “the DMV chose not to take any action against Tesla or otherwise communicate to Tesla that its advertising or use of these brand names was or might be problematic,” the response notice states.

As to free speech, Tesla claims that the state’s false advertising rules on autonomous vehicles “impermissibly restrict constitutionally protected speech that is truthful and nonmisleading.”

The DMV launched its investigation in May of 2021. It filed its administrative complaint in July 2022 and spent the next year researching the case before requesting trial date hearing.

In a motion filed Nov. 20, the DMV accused Tesla of misleading automotive customers with claims about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving with numerous false statements. One example: “The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” Whatever the design intent, neither Autopilot nor Full Self-Driving is yet able to do a full trip with no driver interaction.

Musk has made wilder claims over the years, but usually has hedged them with words like “expect” and “hope.”

Several customers have sued Tesla after spending $8,000 to $15,000 for a feature called Full Self-Driving that, most independent driverless car experts agree, cannot drive itself.

Should the DMV win its case, its legal motion says, Tesla’s California manufacturer’s license could be revoked, and the company could be required to pay restitution to “persons or institutions who have suffered financial loss or damage.”

Meanwhile, several years-long investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Autopilot and Full Self-Driving safety concerns continue to drag on, including inquiries into vehicular deaths and crashes into police cars and ambulances. Thus far, NHTSA acting administrator Ann Carlson and her boss, Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have declined to talk about the investigations and the amount of time they’re taking to complete.

34,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Column: Sacramento politicians need the guts to fix California’s money woes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/sacramento-politicians-need-the-guts-to-fix-californias-money-woes,"California state government’s bank account has dwindled from a nearly $100-billion surplus 18 months ago to a projected $68-billion deficit.

How could that possibly happen?

Three reasons:



Sacramento politicians haven’t had the guts to fix a very flawed roller-coaster tax system that generates barrels of revenue in good times but goes bust when the economy sours.

They spend too much money. That’s self-evident. At any rate, they’re spending more than the state is taking in. A lot more.

All that aside, rising interest rates cooled the economy by increasing borrowing costs. That stifled home buying and business expansions, according to independent Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek, who projected the $68-billion deficit last week.

The analyst says the state stumbled into the red ink hole partly because the federal government extended the normal tax filing deadline this year from April until November. It wanted to ease life for Californians harmed by last winter’s drenching storms. California followed the feds’ lead and did the same.

So what? It meant Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators didn’t know how much revenue they had to spend before the deadline for passing a budget. They needed to enact a spending plan by the start of the fiscal year July 1. But the revenue data weren’t available until tax returns were filed in the fall.

Their solution was to blindly overestimate the taxes the state would collect.

If they’d known the revenue flow was slowing, mitigating steps could have been taken: spending cuts, tapping reserves, internal borrowing.

“The [tax filing] delay really messed us up,” says H.D. Palmer, Newsom’s budget spokesman. “If we’d had that cash data on hand in spring like normal, it would have required solutions to close the gap and we’d have a much smaller problem today.”

OK, but they could have had the foresight to act long before spring. On Newsom’s watch starting in 2019, annual state spending has jumped by 53% — more than $100 billion from the $203-billion budget he inherited from Gov. Jerry Brown to $311 billion currently.

But overspending is only part of the problem. There’s another part that neither Republicans nor most Democrats want to talk about: a volatile tax system that overreacts to economic changes.

Less money came in than expected because of California’s warped tax system. It relies mostly on wealthy-income taxpayers — regardless of whether they’re having a good or bad year. The system functions like a yo-yo, performing erratically depending on whether the economy is booming or busting.

Specifically, the state feeds off taxes on rich people’s capital gains, especially their stock earnings. Sometimes stocks tumble. And capital gains become investment losses.

The top 1% of earners pay nearly 50% of the state income tax. And the top one-tenth of 1% pay 28%.

“These lucky folks get a lot of their income from capital gains and stock options,” Palmer says. “It turns out that 2022 was not a great year for the financial market. The Nasdaq dropped 33%, the biggest drop since the Great Recession in ‘08. The Nasdaq is relevant because of California’s high-tech economy.”

The top 10% of earners — with taxable incomes above $200,000 — kick in roughly 80% of the tax. California has a very progressive tax system, with the lower 60% of earners paying only around 2%.

The legislative analyst says the state took in $26 billion less than expected in the last fiscal year — ”a severe revenue decline.” And he forecasts a “serious” $68-billion deficit through the next fiscal year.

Personal income tax receipts were 22% — $19 billion — less than forecast just from April through November, Palmer says.

Putting this in perspective, the personal income tax supplies two-thirds of the state general fund. Back in 1950, when our tax system was stable, the income tax accounted for only 10%. Then, the sales tax was the main revenue source, feeding 60% of the general fund. Today it’s just 16%.

A big reason the sales tax has diminished in importance is that we’ve become less of a retail economy and more of a service economy. But we’re one of the few states that don’t tax services. Our tax system is stuck in the mid-20th century and should be modernized.

What’s needed is to reduce income tax rates at all levels and extend the sales tax to services.

That doesn’t mean taxing haircuts, lawn mowing and baby sitting. But we could tax labor on car repairs, as parts already are. Tax Lakers tickets and concerts. More important, tax attorney, accountant and interior designer fees — services used mostly by big business and the wealthy.

But that thought scares politicians. Most would love to vote for an income tax cut. And it would require only a simple majority vote of the Legislature. But extending the sales tax to services would necessitate a two-thirds vote. That would take strong gubernatorial and legislative leadership. And it has never materialized. Too politically risky.

Former state Controller Betty Yee, a Democrat who’s running for governor, advocated such tax reform for years but backed off.

“People focus on one aspect without looking at the entire system and then just beat me up for wanting to tax services,” Yee told me. “It’s very hard for people to put their arms around the entire system.”

So Newsom and the Legislature will probably cut school funding, trim some other spending, tap into savings, borrow internally and shamefully deploy fiscal gimmickry to “balance” the next budget.

And our tax system will continue to perform erratically."
35,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Supreme Court turns away case threatening California ban on gay ‘conversion therapy’,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-12-11/supreme-court-conversion-therapy-case-gay-trans-kids,"A divided Supreme Court on Monday turned down a Christian group’s free-speech challenge to the laws in California and 21 other states that forbid licensed counselors from using “conversion therapy” with children and teenagers.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. filed dissents, and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said he also voted to hear the case.

“There is a fierce public debate over how best to help minors with gender dysphoria,” Thomas said, and states such as Washington and California have “silenced one side of this debate.”

But a majority of the other justices disagreed, and refused to hear a case that challenged the states’ laws. It marked the fourth time since 2014 that the court has refused to hear such a case.

Lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal group, argued states should not be permitted to “censor” counselors who espouse Christian values.

They appealed to challenge a Washington state law they said violates marriage and family counselor Brian Tingley’s rights to the freedom of speech and free exercise of religion.

Tingley “helps clients with various issues, including sexuality and gender identity,” the ADF lawyers said in their petition to the court. “A practicing Christian, Tingley grounds human identity in God’s design rather than a person’s feelings or wishes. Many of his clients agree and seek his counsel precisely because they want to align their identity with their faith.”

The law at issue prohibits licensed counselors from using “a regime that seeks to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity.” State lawmakers said this “therapy” was proven to be ineffective and significantly increased the risk of suicide among young people.

When the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld California’s first-in-the-nation law in 2014, it ruled the state had broad authority to regulate the practice of medicine and “professional speech” about medical treatments.

The appeals court applied the same rule in upholding Washington’s law last year. “States do not lose the power to regulate the safety of medical treatments performed under the authority of a state license merely because those treatments are implemented through speech rather than through scalpel,” wrote Judge Ronald Gould. “As of 2015, every major medical, psychiatric, psychological, and professional mental health organization opposes the use of conversion therapy,” he added.

But five years ago, the Supreme Court disagreed with the 9th Circuit’s view that “professional speech” could be strictly regulated. Citing the 1st Amendment, the justices in a 5-4 vote set aside part of a California law and ruled that “pro-life crisis pregnancy centers” could not be required to notify patients that they did not perform abortions and sometimes did not have medical professionals on staff.

The ADF’s lawyers argued that ruling undercut the 9th Circuit’s decision in Tingley’s case. They contended he is subject to state fines for “pure speech” because he has a different viewpoint.

“A counselor who encourages same-sex conduct or assists a young person to adopt a transgender identity is free to do so. But a counselor who discusses a client’s desire not to pursue sexual relationships outside of marriage between one man and one woman, or to align the client’s sense of identity and biological sex, faces steep penalties,” they said.

Though the court turned away the latest challenge, the current conservative majority has shown itself ready to rule at times for free speech claims that involve religion.

In 2022, the justices reversed the 9th Circuit and upheld, in Kennedy vs. Bremerton, a free-speech claim from a football coach who defied school officials and insisted on praying at the 50-yard line.

In June of this year, the court agreed in 303 Creative vs. Elenis with the ADF’s lawyers and ruled a self-employed website designer in Colorado had a free-speech right based on her Christian beliefs to refuse to design wedding websites for same-sex couples.

In defense of Washington’s law, state Atty. Gen. Robert Ferguson said the 1st Amendment protects a person’s right to say harmful and hateful things in public. “But if a teenager told their state-licensed therapist: ‘I think I am gay,’ and the therapist responded: ‘Well then God hates you,’ or, ‘Well then you should kill yourself,’ the therapist could lose their license and be sued for malpractice. No reasonable person would disagree.”

He said that under the law, therapists can “discuss conversion therapy with minor clients, recommend it be performed by others (e.g., religious counselors), promote it in public or private .... All they cannot do is perform conversion therapy in their capacity as licensed therapists,” he told the court.

Equal Rights Washington, the state’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, said Tingley claims “he merely wants to express his ideas without state ‘censorship,’ but that is not the relief he seeks. Instead, he seeks Washington’s endorsement of his therapeutic methods. In effect, he wants to tell his patients that the state of Washington deems him an expert and that his treatment methodologies are an exercise of that expertise. The Constitution does not require Washington to endorse treatment methodology that Washington believes to be ineffective and unsafe.”"
36,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Bass, one year in: Progress on homelessness but still a steep climb",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/mayor-karen-bass-inside-safe-program-finishes-its-first-year,"Mayor Karen Bass’ Inside Safe program moved Clifton Grant Jr. from a sidewalk encampment into a room in the Hollywood Le Bon Hotel. “I’ve got something to wake up for now,” he said.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had been in office for little more than week when she announced the launch of Inside Safe, her signature program to move homeless Angelenos out of the city’s biggest encampments and under a roof.

The first place she went was a noisy stretch of Cahuenga Boulevard under the 101 Freeway in Hollywood. Working closely with Councilmember Nithya Raman, city and county agencies found beds for about 30 unhoused residents living at or near the overpass.

Last week, the mayor celebrated her first year in office, touting the work her administration has done to address the crisis. By then, 10 more people had set up tents, tarps and at least one cardboard structure on the streets around the overpass that had been targeted by Inside Safe in December 2022.

The return of those encampments offers just one example of the challenges the mayor will face in the second year of her fight against homelessness.

Since taking office, Inside Safe has moved 1,951 people off sidewalks, median strips and alleys in such areas as Echo Park, North Hollywood, Westlake, Van Nuys and South Los Angeles, according to figures compiled by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority covering the period that ended Nov. 30.

At the same time, Bass has struggled to accomplish the crucial next step: moving those same people out of hotels and motels and into actual homes. Just 256 people, or 13% of the people who participated in Inside Safe, were in permanent housing during the time frame examined by LAHSA.

About 1,200 continue to live in hotels and motels, some of them for 10 months or more. An additional 100 or so are in tiny homes, shelters or other types of interim housing. The remainder have exited the program.

If Bass is unable to break the logjam, she will need to lease even more hotel rooms next year, even as her Inside Safe team heads into additional neighborhoods — while also returning to the areas where encampments have reemerged.

When she first took office, Bass expected that the encampment residents would end up staying in interim housing for three to six months. A year into the job, she says a more realistic duration, in at least some cases, will be one to two years.

Bass, in an interview, said the city already had thousands of other homeless residents waiting in line to get into permanent housing by the time Inside Safe was launched. “The question that remains to be answered is, where do the Inside Safe people fall in the line?” she said.

At least some of those other homeless hotel dwellers are losing patience.

Stephanie Ryan, who lived at one point under the Cahuenga overpass, said she has been trying to get into permanent housing for three years. Ryan, 33, has a room at the Highland Gardens, a hotel used by the city as interim homeless housing, although not for Inside Safe. After two separate stays in that facility, plus a stint in a hotel near downtown, Ryan said she has felt the temptation to return to the street.

Ryan said she doesn’t like having her belongings searched when she enters the hotel or having to check in each night. She also dislikes random room inspections.

“I don’t like having to answer for everything I do,” she said. “It’s not like I’m in an apartment where you can come and go.”

By mid-November, the city had agreements to use rooms at 46 hotels, including the 13-story L.A. Grand in downtown Los Angeles and the Motel 6 in Canoga Park, according to a city analysis. Bass has made moves to build out the city’s own interim housing portfolio by purchasing and renovating the 294-room Mayfair Hotel, at a cost of $83 million.

Bass said she is determined to clear the bottleneck that is preventing unhoused residents from getting into homes by fast-tracking the approval of 9,000 units of affordable housing. She also has focused on removing bureaucratic barriers that have delayed the move into permanent housing.

In addition, the mayor promised to send city crews back to the Inside Safe locations where tents have reappeared.

“I guarantee you, by the end of the year, all of those areas will be cleared too,” she said at a briefing last week.

Inside Safe is only one part of Bass’ strategy for combating homelessness. During her first year, she has pushed for the construction of more affordable housing on publicly owned land, including properties owned by Metro. She has fostered a new culture of collaboration between city and county agencies, which historically have been at odds.

Still, no homeless initiative has become more closely linked with Bass than Inside Safe. The program, which received $250 million in this year’s city budget, sends outreach workers to encampments to make voluntary offers of housing — usually hotel and motel rooms.

Bass declared early on that the removal of street encampments would be a key feature of the initiative. More than once, she has said that Angelenos will not believe the city is making serious headway on the homelessness crisis if they continue to see tents in their neighborhoods.

On that front, she has made serious progress.

The Times visited 31 of the 32 Inside Safe locations targeted by Bass by Nov. 30. About three-fourths were either entirely free of encampments or had only a handful of tents — three or fewer.

On Hoover Street in Historic Filipinotown, sidewalks underneath the 101 Freeway that were unusable for years are finally clear of debris. On Culver Boulevard in Del Rey, a median strip that was once home to dozens of people had a single tent last month. In Chatsworth, only a couple of tents could be seen in recent weeks near a flood control channel that runs alongside a Metrolink station.

(The Times did not attempt to assess Inside Safe’s work in Skid Row, the part of the city with the largest concentration of homeless residents, because outreach teams went to different sections of that neighborhood.)

One of the largest Inside Safe operations took place in Venice, where, during the peak of the rainy season, more than 100 people agreed to move indoors. That encampment stretched across four streets and had been a long-standing source of neighborhood anger.

Since that operation, sidewalks in that area have been kept clean and safe, said Connie Brooks, a writer who has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years.

“It’s a very different environment,” she said.

Berta Jacobo, who resides in Westlake, said her neighborhood is also more peaceful in the wake of the mayor’s initiative. Outreach workers went to that densely packed neighborhood last month, focusing on several streets between Wilshire Boulevard and 8th Street.

Jacobo, 47, said she and her neighbors contacted the city more than a year ago, well before Bass won her race for mayor, about the heaps of trash and open drug use that they saw at the encampments. In those locations, fires had broken out, destroying at least two cars, she said.

“Things are so much better now,” Jacobo said.

Eight Inside Safe locations visited by The Times — about one-fourth of the total — have at least partially repopulated or were never fully cleared.

In April, the mayor’s team spent several days on the streets that surround El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument in downtown Los Angeles, moving nearly 80 people indoors. On Thursday, those streets had 36 tents or tent-like structures.

Inside Safe also went to a long-standing encampment in Harbor City, helping almost 70 people find interim housing. Last week, that area had a dozen tents.

In South Los Angeles, retired schoolteacher June Richard was thrilled to see Inside Safe visit her neighborhood last spring. On that day, city crews temporarily closed off 49th Street over the 110 Freeway. Outreach workers set up tables and chairs to make arrangements for the area’s unhoused residents.

The atmosphere was festive. By the end of the operation, dozens of people had been moved indoors.

Last week, Richard was no longer enthusiastic. The overpass near her home had four tents on the north side and three on the south. With trash scattered across sidewalks, the neighborhood “looks like a dump,” she said.

“I’ve seen people, a whole family, walking in the middle of the street because they have so much stuff on the overpass,” she said.

At some Inside Safe locations, new barriers make it difficult for homeless residents to return.

In Beverly Grove, city crews have fenced off several median strips on San Vicente Boulevard, adorning them with planters filled with multicolored succulents. In Mar Vista, new fences block the vast majority of the sidewalk on Venice Boulevard under the 405 Freeway.

In Hollywood, the mayor’s team targeted an encampment on El Centro Avenue that had experienced multiple fires, at least one involving a propane tank. Once the tents were gone, planters were added to the street. Months later, bigger ones were put in.

Larry Slade, who heads the homelessness committee of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., gave the mayor’s work on homelessness a grade ranging from a B-plus to an A-minus, saying she has brought focus and funding to the issue. Still, he worries the crisis may be too big for any mayor to solve.

“Inside Safe is like trying to bail water out of a stream,” he said. “That program is an excellent idea, and she is the right person to lead that effort. I am just concerned that we are really just trying to mitigate a tidal wave.”

*

Of the 1,951 people relocated by Inside Safe through Nov. 30, nearly 400 people have exited the program, with the vast majority returning to homelessness, according to LAHSA’s most recent figures. Fifteen have died.

Bass and her team say that departure rate — nearly 1 in 5 participants — is much lower than that found in the other interim housing programs that serve homeless Angelenos.

Still, the mayor’s initiative has come under sharp scrutiny from the city’s mutual aid groups, which provide food, water, tents and supplies to the city’s homeless population. Some have criticized Bass for sending encampment residents to motels that are far from the neighborhoods where they were living. Others say the hotels lack sufficient social services.

Carla Orendorff, a homeless advocate who lives in Reseda, said Inside Safe participants frequently feel pressure to give up their belongings, signing release forms or offering their consent on video. Unhoused residents have moved into motels, only to learn they are not permitted to have guests in their rooms, making them feel isolated and alone, she said.

One unhoused resident, who moved out of an encampment in Van Nuys, was later found dead of an overdose at his motel, Orendorff said.

“This policy is honestly killing people,” she said.

Asked about those assertions, Bass said the city needs to ensure that Inside Safe has a much better system of social services, including drug addiction treatment. She described that as a “top, top issue” for the coming year.

At the same time, the mayor argued that unhoused residents are much safer in hotels and motels than they are living on the sidewalk, where they are in danger of being raped, injured or killed.

“It is a travesty to leave people on the street,” Bass said.

Clairissa Jones, 24, is aware of the dangers. While living in Skid Row, she said, one assailant struck her with a pipe. Others stole her clothing and cellphones.

“One time I came back and my entire tent was gone,” she said.

Last month, outreach workers with Inside Safe found Jones a room at a hotel near MacArthur Park. Since then, she and her boyfriend have been enjoying the bed and the TV, while also relying on the medical clinic van that comes to the facility.

When Jones thought she had COVID-19, the hotel ordered her an Uber to take her to the hospital.

“I found out at the hospital that I was pregnant,” she said. “I got housing just in time.”

Clifton Grant Jr., 47, a former lab technician, had been living on Selma Avenue in Hollywood when the Inside Safe teams arrived. On that street, homeless encampments stretched on and off for nearly four blocks, occupying sidewalks on both sides of a grade school.

Grant, who grew up in Inglewood, became homeless about five years ago, during a serious mental health crisis. In August, Inside Safe teams moved him into a room in the Hollywood Le Bon Hotel that offered a bathtub, mini-fridge, microwave and queen-size bed. “I was blown away,” he said.

Since entering Inside Safe, Grant has had regular access to his medications and mental health treatment. He has been attending church and is talking about going back to school. He is extraordinarily grateful to the woman he calls “Miss Bass.”

“I’ve got something to wake up for now, with not just misery being upon me,” he said. “I get up, I thank God. I feel like I’ve got a purpose, like I can set goals now that seem achievable.”

Bass returned to Selma Avenue on Wednesday to celebrate the accomplishments of the last year. But in that neighborhood, it was clear that her initiative has a long road ahead.

One block south of Selma, more than a dozen tents lined the south side of Sunset Boulevard. At Hollywood Boulevard and Gower Street — a block east of the Inside Safe location on El Centro Avenue — nearly two dozen tents now cover the sidewalks.

On Cahuenga Boulevard, site of the mayor’s first Inside Safe operation, three people said they had already lived at one or more of the city’s homeless hotels. One said he was recently kicked out for yelling. Another said he got in trouble for having too many recyclables.

Asked about those locations, Bass said that as long as the city continues to have more than 46,000 homeless residents, the Inside Safe operations in Hollywood will be “a drop in the bucket.” Still, she said she remains optimistic — and intends to keep working to bring people off the street.

“We’re going to continue to knock down those barriers,” she said."
37,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Nonprofit plans to transform a former oil drilling site in South L.A. into affordable housing,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/nonprofit-plans-to-transform-a-former-oil-drilling-site-in-south-l-a-into-affordable-housing,"Richard Parks, left, president of the South L.A. nonprofit Redeemer Community Partnership, walks with neighbor QC Kelker next to a former oil drilling field on Jefferson Boulevard.

After a years-long neighborhood battle against an oil drilling site in South Los Angeles, a local nonprofit has purchased the now-demolished facility and plans to transform it into a park, community center and affordable housing.

The Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust recently bought the 1.86-acre dirt lot on Jefferson Boulevard for nearly $10 million from Sentinel Peak Resources. The nonprofit and its partners are now seeking grants and other funding sources to pay for planning, remediation and project execution.

“It’s what we hoped for,” Richard Parks, president of the South L.A. nonprofit Redeemer Community Partnership, said of the purchase. “It’s just so amazing to see our community receiving beauty for ashes. It’s overwhelming and feels like such a blessing.”

The sale marks a new chapter in a persistent and community-led fight against the oil drilling site, which residents argued for years was noisy and spewed foul odors. It also comes at a time of growing concerns about the risks and inequities of urban drilling in neighborhoods. L.A. City Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky recently introduced legislation aiming to address public health and environmental threats posed by a drill site near the Pico-Robertson area.

Oil wells are known to emit carcinogens such as benzene and formaldehyde, and living near wells is associated with health problems such as respiratory issues and preterm births, studies have found.

Community leaders hope the purchase serves as a model for how to repurpose shuttered fossil fuel facilities as the city phases out existing oil and gas wells, a historic move approved last year by the L.A. City Council that also bans new oil and gas extraction.

Tori Kjer, executive director of the L.A. Neighborhood Land Trust, believes it is critical that these sites are transformed into uses that benefit communities historically affected by oil drilling. “It’s an environmental justice issue,” she said. It’s also imperative that planned site uses won’t displace residents through gentrification, she added.

“It’s so important, this idea of joint development, where you’re layering in affordable housing, community space and a park together,” she said. “For us, it’s really the ideal approach to equitable development in communities. ... This is a rare opportunity, and an important opportunity, as we think bigger scale about future types of development in Los Angeles.”

Kjer estimates they will need three to six months and about $600,000 for remediation planning, and an additional year and $2 million to $3 million for cleanup. They are seeking state grants. The park’s budget will be about $6 million.

Lori R. Gay, president and chief executive of the Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles County, said their target is to build 70 affordable housing units. They are also considering creating a community land trust to preserve the neighborhood and produce new homeowners.

“The Jefferson site is in a homeownership community, so we wanted to maintain both the integrity and culture of the community with affordable homeownership,” she said. “It is too easy to just build affordable housing focused on tenancy and not provide the opportunity to build generational wealth. This development provides the opportunity to build wealth for generations to come.”

But the grand visions for the property won’t come without hurdles.

Finding land trust lenders will be challenging, Gay said, as will plan reviews and significant market changes that could hinder the speed of development. Having multiple partners involved in a large project could also further complicate it, Kjer added. Planning, remediation and raising and finding finances will also be tricky.

“The housing kind of funds itself, and we have some really good prospects for funding the park through different grants, but the community center I think will be a very big challenge,” Parks said. “How do we raise the several million dollars to be able to build that out for the community?”

First approved nearly 60 years ago, the South L.A. oil site on West Jefferson Boulevard and Van Buren Place was situated closer to homes than any other city drilling facility, according to the nonprofit Community Health Councils.

In 2013, environmental justice advocates with Redeemer Community Partnership began organizing after the oil company requested permits by the city of Los Angeles to drill three new wells.

Parks remembered knocking on residents’ doors and hearing concerning stories about the nearby oil facility: One woman was sprayed with oil while she watered her front lawn. The noxious smells of diesel exhaust and petroleum fumes permeated through a toddler’s room even with the windows closed. Others complained of headaches and nosebleeds, and miscarriages were commonplace, he recalled.

A report by a petroleum administrator, who was hired in 2016 to oversee oil and gas operations in the city, noted that the Jefferson Boulevard facility was classified as having hydrogen sulfide gas, which can give off a rotten-eggs odor and cause smell loss, and that chemicals such as benzene have also been emitted from the site.

In 2017, after persistent demands from community activists to enclose the site, L.A. City Council members issued a set of stringent rules that oil companies must follow if they wanted to continue operating drilling sites next to homes in South L.A.

The requirements included, among other things, that drilling equipment be permanently closed off by a 45-foot-tall structure to reduce noise, odors and block glaring lights. It was a big victory for community activists, who had argued that the site exemplified the toxic outcomes of oil drilling in urban neighborhoods.

Officials at the time described the requirements as the toughest ever imposed on a drill site in L.A.

Sentinel Peak Resources spurned the commands and filed a lawsuit. The company argued that the new mandates were “unduly oppressive” and would force it to reduce or stop its operations.

Nearly a year later , the company announced it would shutter the site for good.

While it removed all oil operating equipment and capped the 36 wells on site, the community began working on a shared vision for the site’s future.

“Because we knew if we did not do that, that the toxic violence of oil extraction would be replaced by the violence of displacement,” Parks said. “Developers are coming in, they’re tearing down homes, they’re building up student housing, they’re driving out longtime residents, and we didn’t want to see that happen.”

With help from California Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer (D-Los Angeles), who is running for L.A. City Council District 10, they secured a $10-million state grant for those efforts.

“I’m really excited,” Jones-Sawyer said. “This will be the blueprint for how you can effectively make changes.”

When Redeemer Community Partnership contacted him about their vision for the land, “it seemed like the perfect combination of dealing with our housing crisis and dealing with our crisis with having no open space. And so when I had the opportunity to provide the $10 million ... it seemed like a wonderful opportunity,” Jones-Sawyer said.

For residents such as Corissa Pacillas, who fought for years for more stringent protections from the Jefferson Boulevard site, the purchase exemplifies the power of organizing.

“It was encouraging to see that when people really intentionally organize and speak up, and are persistent ... passionate and have good leadership ... that change can happen,” said Pacillas, who spent years documenting the facility’s activities from the porch of her second-floor apartment. “I’m just so excited that the property ... is going to go toward really benefiting the community.”"
38,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Newsom administration advances delta tunnel project despite environmental opposition,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-12-09/newsom-administration-advances-delta-tunnel-project,"In the face of heavy opposition from environmental groups, Gov. Gavin Newsom and his administration are pushing forward with a controversial plan to build a 45-mile water tunnel beneath the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta — a project the governor says is vital to modernizing the state’s aging water system.

State officials released their final environmental analysis of the proposed delta tunnel project on Friday, signaling the start of a process of seeking permits to build the tunnel that would use massive pumps to transfer water from the Sacramento River to cities and farmlands to the south.

Newsom and state water managers say the tunnel would help California adapt to worsening cycles of drought fueled by climate change and capture more water during wet periods. They say it would also help address the risks to infrastructure posed by earthquakes and flooding.

“Climate change is threatening our access to clean drinking water, diminishing future supplies for millions of Californians,” Newsom said in a written statement. “Doing nothing is not an option. After the three driest years on record, we didn’t have the infrastructure to fully take advantage of an exceptionally wet year, which will become more and more critical as our weather whiplashes between extremes.”

Environmental groups have condemned the plan, saying the tunnel would seriously harm the delta’s deteriorating ecosystem and threaten fish species that are already on the brink. Opponents argue that the funds needed to build the tunnel would be better spent on groundwater recharge efforts, water recycling, and stormwater capture, among other projects.

Debate over the project has been simmering for decades. Former Gov. Jerry Brown sought a two-tunnel proposal, calling the project WaterFix. Newsom has supported a redesigned project with a single tunnel, called the Delta Conveyance Project.

The plan calls for a concrete tunnel 36 feet wide and running 140 to 170 feet underground, connecting to a new pumping plant that would send water into the California Aqueduct.

Construction costs have previously been estimated at $16 billion, but the state plans to update those cost estimates next year.

California officials say the tunnel’s two proposed intakes on the Sacramento River would allow the system to capture and transport more water during wet periods. State water managers say the current infrastructure makes for missed opportunities when large quantities of stormwater are allowed to flow through the delta and into the Pacific Ocean during rainy periods, such as last winter.

Tunnel supporters say the project would improve California’s ability to withstand worsening droughts and intense swings between wet and dry periods.

“We really don’t have time to waste in terms of getting all projects moving forward that can secure California in this new hydrologic scenario,” said Karla Nemeth, director of the state Department of Water Resources.

Nemeth said the increase in water availability from the delta would be “pegged to those times when we do have those high flows,” rather than during dry times.

“Ultimately, it really is triggered by intense pulse conditions,” she said.

Officials estimated that if the tunnel had been in place during the torrential storms in January, the state could have captured and moved an additional 228,000 acre-feet of water, enough to supply about 2.3 million people for a year.

“We need to preserve the backbone of our water system,” said Wade Crowfoot, the state’s natural resources secretary.

Crowfoot said without this update, the existing water system is vulnerable to the effects of climate change as well as potential damage from a large earthquake, which could disrupt water deliveries for 27 million Californians. He said a quake could render the system unusable for months or more than a year, which he said would be “the largest catastrophe in any water system in America.”

“To ensure that our conveyance is both climate-resilient and earthquake-resilient, we need to modernize this infrastructure,” he said.

Environmentalists and other critics argue that the state is failing to see the big picture and has based the project on outdated climate science.

“Like its predecessor, the WaterFix Project, the Delta Conveyance Project fails to consider or address the risks from accelerating climate change impacts to Sacramento and San Joaquin River watersheds and the delta,” said Deirdre Des Jardins, an independent water researcher.

Des Jardins and a coalition of environmental and fishing advocates said in recent written comments that the project faces major uncertainties, “including worsening climate change impacts on water supply and sea level rise, coupled with the need to reduce exports in order to increase freshwater flows through the delta.” They also said the state has failed to consider non-tunnel alternatives.

For the record: A previous version of this story misspelled Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla’s name as Barrigan-Parilla.

Newsom’s tunnel proposal, as outlined in the state’s final environmental impact report, is “another failure of state water officials to imagine alternative approaches in a climate-impacted California,” said Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director of the group Restore the Delta.

“The big pipe engineering solutions of the last century are no longer the way forward in California water’s climate-changed reality,” Barrigan-Parrilla said. The latest delta tunnel plan, she said, is “out of date for climate change science” and will quickly be obsolete if it’s built.

She suggested the state invest in projects that “reduce reliance on water exports from the delta,” such as underground water storage in farming areas, more stormwater collection and wastewater recycling in cities.

Other environmentalists said the tunnel’s water diversions would deny critical flows to the delta and San Francisco Bay. They warned that would exacerbate recent declines in native fish such as Chinook salmon, longfin smelt, white sturgeon and endangered delta smelt.

“The science clearly demonstrates that fish need increased river flows to survive, but state agencies are ignoring it,” said Jon Rosenfield, science director for San Francisco Baykeeper. “California diverts more than half of the water flowing through Central Valley rivers to serve industrial agriculture and big cities. Because of excessive water diversions, the list of fish native to San Francisco Bay and its watershed that are verging on extinction continues to grow, and our fisheries are increasingly shut down.”

This year, commercial salmon fishing was shut down along the coast because fish populations declined dramatically.

Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Assn., charged that Newsom and his administration “mismanaged our rivers during the drought,” harming the fishing industry, and that the tunnel project “looks like an extinction plan for salmon.”

“Southern California residents will be on the hook to pay for nearly all of this $20-billion boondoggle,” Artis said. “The tunnel could cause Southern California water rates to skyrocket — without delivering much benefit. The core problem is that we’re pumping too much water from the Bay-Delta. We need to divert less.”

John Buse, senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the state’s final environmental report “maintains the same skewed analysis by failing to come to terms with the massive harm this tunnel will bring to the delta and its fish.”

Although many environmental groups oppose the tunnel, Newsom’s proposal has found support among some water districts, organized labor and business groups.

Jennifer Pierre, general manager of the 27-member State Water Contractors, said California can no longer afford to delay the project.

“Our climate reality requires that we build and adapt,” Pierre said. “The Delta Conveyance Project represents a golden opportunity to increase the [State Water Project’s] ability to move and store water when it’s wet for use when it’s dry and will allow us to be more flexible in response to the state’s changing hydrological conditions.”

Jennifer Barrera of the California Chamber of Commerce said that improving the state’s “water system and its infrastructure through the Delta Conveyance Project is urgently needed.”

Within 10 days, the state is expected to certify the environmental documents, culminating the review and enabling the Newsom administration to turn to environmental permits. State officials said they expect to complete all permits by 2026, allowing for construction to begin around 2030.

The completion of the environmental review will also lead to discussions among managers of water agencies about whether to contribute financially to the project. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will review the environmental documents as well as an upcoming analysis of costs and benefits as the district’s board considers “how best to invest our resources in response to the changing climate,” said Adel Hagekhalil, the district’s general manager.

State officials said the project is part of a broader water strategy to respond to a projected 10% loss in average water supplies by 2040 due to hotter conditions.

The state is continuing to invest in other types of projects, including wastewater recycling, stormwater capture and groundwater recharge, as well as improved efficiency and conservation efforts, Crowfoot said.

“But at the same time, we can’t stick our head in the sand about the fact that our backbone water infrastructure remains essential,” Crowfoot said. “We can’t simply shift investments into all those localized sources and expect to maintain water reliability for 40 million people in the fifth-largest economy in the world. We have to do both.”

40,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Emotional reunion at DFW one of many Lazos de Oro provides for seniors and loved ones,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/inspired/2023/12/08/this-program-provides-seniors-with-long-awaited-hugs-with-their-distant-children/,"Families bearing balloons, flowers, and signs crowded gate D22 at DFW International Airport, among them Juana Guzmán, eagerly awaiting a hug from the parents she believed she might never see again.

Those gathered were waiting on a flight from Mexico City, from where 28 elderly Mexicans were being whisked away for a visit to the United States -- and their loved ones -- through the humanitarian program Lazos de Oro, Golden Ribbons.

“I have waited almost 25 years for this hug, for this moment. Waiting a few more hours is nothing,” said Guzmán, a McKinney resident born and raised in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero.

Nearly two hours after the plane landed, the group of elderly adults in blue vests walked through U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoints and out the sliding doors for their reunions. Children and grandchildren ran into the arms of elderly parents for a long-awaited hug.

Susana Infante Cruz, 75, and her husband, Juan Guzmán Ceballos, 80, boarded a plane for the first time to get to Dallas. Between tears of joy, the couple embraced their daughter Juana Guzmán, 50, and son José Guzmán, 45, more than two decades after the siblings migrated to Texas for a better life for their own children.

Lazos de Oro works with separated Mexican families, like the Guzmans, to help older adults navigate the visa process. That includes filling out the paperwork to scheduling interviews with the U.S. Embassy, to coaching them on what to expect at the interview and getting them to Dallas for the reunions.

About 150 seniors from several Mexican states, including Guerrero, Sinaloa, Michoacán, San Luis Potosí and Chihuahua, have come to the U.S. this year with the program’s help. As part of the process, people travel in groups, in different batches, from Mexico City to Dallas, where relatives must pick them up. For some, North Texas is their final destination. Others continue on to New York, Tennessee, Florida, Washington, Arizona, Alabama and other states.

“I want someone to pinch me. I can’t believe they are here. It’s the best Christmas present ever,” said José Guzmán.

After hugs and kisses and meeting her grandchildren for the first time, Susana Infante Cruz gave her daughter Juana a blue bucket filled with brown, circular tablets of homemade chocolate.

Juana Guzmán emigrated from Guerrero 25 years ago, leaving her two daughters with her mother so she could search for work in the U.S. She ended up in Dallas after a friend told her she could stay with her and help her find a job. She worked for several years at various fast-food restaurants.

“Like everyone else, I said, ‘Just three years and then I’ll go back to my daughters and my parents,’” Juana Guzmán said. “In the blink of an eye, 25 years passed.”

After more than a year of living and working in the United States, her daughters joined her. They later became Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, but have yet to travel back to Mexico.

“I was just a little girl when my grandmother cared for me. I have very vague memories, but I remember living on the ranch,” said Maritza Manzano, Juana’s daughter, as she waited at the airport with her phone ready to film the reunion.

Manzano said she couldn’t wait for her grandmother to meet her 10-year-old daughter, who has only seen her great-grandmother on video calls through WhatsApp.

The Guzmán family’s story is the kind often repeated among immigrant families across the country, said Jaime Damián, founder of Lazos de Oro.

How it works

“Families have to rely on humanitarian programs and the good faith of the U.S. government to allow them to see their parents before it is too late,” said Damían, who lives in Plano but was born and raised in Guerrero.

The visa that the organization helps process is like any other tourist visa. In this case, the embassy also considers that the applicants are adults over 58, have not seen their family for years and are usually without work due to their age or low income, said Damián.

Damián has a long history of working with immigrants in North Texas. He has worked on various projects with the Mexican Consulate in Dallas, the Secretaria del Migrante in Guerrero, and other government agencies.

But it wasn’t until 2018 that the U.S. Embassy approved Lazos de Oro as a humanitarian program, and they began implementing the program.

The program was suspended during the pandemic because the U.S. government paused non-emergency visa interviews for almost two years. In 2022, the group resumed operations and 130 older adults participated.

Juana had a beef soup ready for her parents at her home in McKinney, with fresh tortillas, rice and salsa. She took several days off to enjoy her parents and share her life in the U.S. with them.

The Guzmán family said they tried to get visas for their parents on two other occasions before they knew about Lazos de Oro but could not secure them.

“One day, I saw on Facebook the photos of a friend’s mother from our town, and I wondered how she managed to get here. And I asked her, and that’s when I learned about Lazos de Oro and the work that Jaime is doing,” Juana said.

They started the process in April, and her parents had their interview at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in October. Still, they almost couldn’t leave their hometown in Guerrero because Hurricane Otis hit the region hard and many roads were closed.

“Luckily, they found a bus that took them out of Guerrero and they went to their interview,” Juana said. “Right after they were approved, they called me and I couldn’t say a word. I was just crying. Crying with happiness.”

The Guzmán family will spend the rest of the year together, eating traditional banana leaf tamales, authentic Mexican chocolate, and other homemade foods that the Guzmán siblings and grandchildren have been craving for years.

“I don’t need anything else. I have everything. I can hug my parents, something I thought I’d never be able to do because they’re getting older, and I can’t leave the country,” Juana said."
41,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Farmers Branch police officer on trial for murder in fatal shooting of man in stolen truck,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2023/12/11/farmers-branch-police-officer-on-trial-for-murder-in-fatal-shooting-of-man-in-stolen-truck/,"A Farmers Branch police officer is standing trial for murder this week, more than four years after he fatally shot a man driving a stolen pickup in a strip mall parking lot.

Michael Dunn, 47, is charged in connection with the June 2019 killing of 35-year-old Juan “Johnny” Moreno Jr. If convicted, Dunn faces up to life in prison. He opted to have his trial before a judge, rather than a jury.

Advertisement

The case hinges on whether Dunn, who was in uniform, reasonably feared for his life when he opened fire. Dunn’s attorneys say he believed he was in imminent danger and made a split-second decision. Prosecutors, however, say that Moreno did not pose a threat to Dunn.

Advertisement

Farmers Branch police were tracking a stolen white pickup Moreno was driving June 12, 2019, when he pulled into the northwest Dallas shopping center. Moreno went into a dimly lit game room, tailed by an undercover officer, before leaving and getting back into the white truck.

Surveillance video showed Dunn approach the truck in a marked police car. Dunn’s squad car was perpendicular to the truck when Moreno made a wide left turn to pull out of a parking space. Video shows black plumes coming from the truck’s exhaust as it revs, and tire skid marks were photographed in the parking lot.

Dunn fired, striking Moreno. A bullet struck his left hand, piercing his fingers and palm, likely while he was still gripping the steering wheel, a medical examiner testified. The fatal shot hit Moreno in the back of his head, transecting his brain stem, according to testimony.

The truck crashed into several parked cars and came to a halt. The engine can be heard running after the shooting on body-worn camera footage. An officer reached into the truck’s cab, put it in park and switched it off, according to testimony.

Body-cam video also captured Dunn telling another officer, “He tried to run me over, dude,” shortly after the shooting.

Officer Stephen Grigg testified that Moreno’s passenger told him, “That’s not cool, he tried to run him over.” The exchange was allegedly captured on body-cam footage, but it was not played in court. The passenger, who Dunn detained, was not injured in the gunfire.

Advertisement

Dunn’s attorney’s honed in on Moreno’s toxicology report, which showed he had a large amount of methamphetamine in his system at the time of his death, and how the drugs may have altered his behavior.

Farmers Branch police officers — including police Chief Kevin McCoy, who was appointed earlier this year — and Moreno’s family were packed shoulder-to-shoulder inside the courtroom near downtown Dallas early Monday. Dunn donned a light gray suit and reading glasses. He’s been out on bond since shortly after his arrest and chatted with McCoy, his attorneys and fellow officers throughout the day.

Dunn turned himself in to Seagoville police after a Dallas County grand jury indicted him for murder. At the time, he was a veteran of the Farmers Branch Police Department and placed on administrative leave.

Moreno’s family has also filed a civil suit against Dunn for excessive force and Farmers Branch police, alleging deficiencies in police training. The civil suit is paused pending the outcome of the criminal case, according to court documents.

Dunn is the second officer in the department to face a murder charge in recent years.

Former Farmers Branch officer Ken Johnson was off-duty in March 2016 when he chased down and killed 16-year-old Jose Cruz, whom he caught breaking into his SUV. Johnson was convicted of murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison, as well as 10 years probation for seriously wounding Cruz’s friend, who was also 16.

Testimony is expected to continue Tuesday morning."
42,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Murder charges dropped midtrial against 2 in Dallas-area slaying of Seattle woman,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2023/12/11/murder-charges-dropped-mid-trial-against-2-in-dallas-area-slaying-of-seattle-woman/,"Murder charges were dropped Friday against the wife and boyfriend of a woman on trial for the slaying of a Seattle woman who went missing in Dallas more than three years ago.

The Dallas County district attorney’s office asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Nina Marano and Charles Beltran “in the interest of justice,” according to court documents. Both still face a charge of tampering with evidence in connection with the death of 23-year-old Marisela Botello-Valadez, whose remains were found off a country road in southern Dallas County. They face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

It was not immediately known why the murder charges were dismissed. A spokeswoman for the DA’s office declined to comment. Beltran’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment.

Advertisement

“We have known for a while that the State would likely dismiss Marano’s murder case due to Beltran[’s] newest version of what happened,” Marano’s attorney, Heath Harris, said in a text message. “Beltran has lied too many times to be trusted.”

Harris also represents the third suspect, Lisa Dykes, 60, who is charged with murder and tampering with a corpse, accused of fatally stabbing Botello. Dykes faces up to life in prison if convicted of murder. Prosecutors rested Monday evening, after five days of testimony. The defense is expected to present its case Tuesday morning.

Beltran testified against Dykes last week, saying he witnessed her attacking Botello and saw her bloodied nightgown. Harris told jurors in opening statements that Beltran is a habitual liar who has repeatedly changed his version of what happened on Oct. 5, 2020. Beltran initially told friends he dropped Botello off near Baylor University Medical Center after they met, fearing police would immediately home in on him as a suspect because of his criminal background.

Dykes, Marano and Beltran lived together and were in a physical and romantic relationship, according to witnesses; Dykes supported Beltran’s budding rap career, while Beltran gave Dykes companionship. Later, Dykes married Marano, a recently widowed attorney, and the trio moved into a Mesquite home together. Beltran — portrayed by lawyers as a freeloading womanizer — allegedly continued to pursue other women.

Prosecutor Robin Pittman delivered opening statements in the trial of Lisa Dykes, who is charged with murder and tampering with a corpse in the killing of Marisela Botello Valadez, while holding a photo of Botello in Frank Crowley Courts Building’s Criminal District Court 6 in Dallas on Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2023. Botello was reported missing after a night out in Deep Ellum in October 2020. Police have said her body was found in March 2021 in a wooded area in Wilmer, in southern Dallas County. (Juan Figueroa / Staff Photographer)

Botello flew to Dallas for “a break from Seattle” and to visit an old friend. Botello’s mother described her as a joyous and trusting young woman who loved to travel. Botello, wearing a purple sparkly dress, went out alone in Deep Ellum late Oct. 4, 2020, where she met Beltran on the sidewalk. They went to Mesquite in the early morning hours of Oct. 5, according to Beltran, who took the witness stand last week.

Prosecutors have painted Dykes as a jealous, fed-up lover who killed Botello in twisted, passion-filled rage.

Beltran told the jury — eight men and six women — he awoke to Dykes on top of Botello, grasping a kitchen knife and making a stabbing motion. He said he pushed Dykes, knocking her and Botello to the floor. According to an arrest warrant, Beltran told police Marano came into the room and shoved him out of the way. On the witness stand, however, he said he saw Marano in bed as he fled the home.

“I told you not to bring any more girls over here,” Beltran alleged Dykes said as she attacked Botello. He said Dykes’ white nightgown was soaked in blood. “Why are you disrespecting us?”

Beltran said he tried to get Botello to wake up, but she was motionless. He got dressed and fled. The trio then traveled back and forth from Florida, Pennsylvania and occasionally into Mexico until they were arrested and extradited to Texas. Dykes and Marano later fled to Cambodia and were rearrested.

Botello’s body was found in March 2021, in a farmed and wooded area in Wilmer after someone setting up traps for feral cats stumbled upon the bones and called authorities. Crime scene photos and videos showed a skull and femur bone jutting out from a muddy field just off the road. The bones had no signs of trauma but did appear to be weathered from the elements and scavenged by animals, according to testimony.

The murder trial against Marano was a flashpoint for Dallas police’s digital storage issues. A three-day hearing earlier this year revealed that the lead detective on the case failed to turn over hundreds of pieces of evidence until just before the initial trial date. Police have said 18 videos or photos were permanently deleted because Detective Christine Ramirez did not save them correctly.

Ramirez, who is still employed by Dallas police, may be called to testify by Dykes’ lawyers. Prosecutors have said they do not intend to call her as a witness.

Marano’s trial was delayed — and put in limbo — because of the failure to turn over evidence. It is unknown if the evidence affected Dykes’ case or whether it will be brought up at her trial.

During the hearings in Marano’s case, state District Judge Amber Givens admonished prosecutors for not ensuring all the evidence was turned over to defense attorneys well ahead of the trial. Dallas County prosecutors then asked to remove Givens from overseeing the trio’s cases. A visiting judge granted the request, further delaying all three cases."

Alonzo Smith, 29, pleaded guilty in July to one count of conspiracy to possess of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, the attorney’s office said in a news release. He was sentenced Thursday, the attorney’s office said.

Smith had been accused of “operating multiple drug houses in the Fort Worth area,” the release stated. Authorities found 800 grams of methamphetamine, nearly 190 grams of cocaine, 496 grams of black tar heroin and 300 grams of fentanyl during a search of one of the locations, according to the news release.

Smith’s attorney for the criminal case did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Court records showed that a person named Joe Earl McKee, Jr. had also been named as a defendant in the same criminal court case. He also pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count of conspiracy to possess of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, and was sentenced in November to 14 years in federal prison, records showed.

Nathan Johnson in March primary,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2023/12/11/texas-rep-victoria-neave-criado-to-challenge-state-sen-nathan-johnson-in-march-primary/,"State Rep. Victoria Neave Criado will challenge Sen. Nathan Johnson in the March primary, a rare contest between two of Dallas’ top Democrats.

In an exclusive interview with The Dallas Morning News, Neave Criado said Johnson was timid in fighting to protect the rights of Texans adversely impacted by the agenda pushed by state’s top Republican leaders.

“It’s time for change,” Neave Criado said. “We need to have leaders who are not going to be afraid or hesitant to stand up, no matter the consequences.”

Neave Criado criticized Johnson for voting for what she called a racial profiling bill that — among other things — carries a minimum 10-year jail sentence for transporting someone unauthorized to be in the country.

Political Points Get the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT

The bill came about during the third special legislative session of the year. In the Senate, only two Democrats voted against the bill, whereas in the House, few Democrats crossed the aisle to support the bill.

“We’ve got the governor pushing racial profiling bill that the incumbent voted for, and that’s not acceptable,” Neave Criado said. “This is not the time to be quiet. This is not the time to support Gov. Abbott’s agenda, which is contrary to the interests of the community.”

Johnson told The News he stands by his record and is looking forward to the campaign.

“I’ve been unwavering and outspoken in my opposition to the right-wing agenda, while delivering major policy wins that improve people’s lives. That’s what being a good legislator is about,” he said.

Neave Criado, who filed her Senate candidacy Monday, said she would be a fiercer fighter for Texans who want their rights protected.

“I’ve been fighting for our community and I have stood up for women’s reproductive health care,” she said. “As chair of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, I’ve taken on Governor Abbott and called out his discriminatory policies.”

Endorsements for Johnson

Neave Criado’s announcement comes on the heels of Johnson publicizing endorsements from several prominent North Texas Democrats, including fellow state Sen. Royce West of Dallas and Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price.

The deadline for candidates to file for the March 5 primaries is Dec. 11.

Neave Criado, 42, is a four-term member of the House, winning her most recent election by a wide margin over a third-party candidate.

Her entrance to the Legislature, like Johnson’s, came after flipping a red seat blue with her election victory in 2016. She unseated a three-term Republican by less than 1,000 votes and has held the seat since.

In Johnson’s case, he beat then-Sen. Don Huffines in 2018. Huffines went on to unsuccessfully challenge Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022′s Republican primary.

Johnson, 55, is the vice chair of the Senate Democratic caucus. This year, he helped secure $1.8 billion for power grid backup infrastructure that was part of a larger package voters approved in November.

Neave Criado has been a Democratic leader in the House, serving as chairwoman of the County Affairs Committee. She’s also chairwoman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus.

She has developed and pushed legislation that seeks to curb sexual assault, sexual harassment, human trafficking and domestic violence.

Her most high-profile legislative accomplishment is the Lavinia Masters Act, a law that seeks to end the backlog of thousands of rape kits that haven’t been submitted to crime labs for testing.

The race against Johnson, however, could be challenging.

The percentages of voting-age Latino and Black voters in the districts is below that of whites, who could control the outcome of the contest. Neave Criado, however, could get a boost from female voters, the most dominant portion of the Dallas County electorate.

And Johnson boasts a significant advantage in his war chest, with roughly $892,000 in campaign funds banked compared to Neave Criado’s $26,000, according to their latest campaign finance reports.

Neave Criado said she has a path to victory.

“I’m gonna work to earn every single vote in every community, regardless of the color of your skin,” she said. “When we look at everything happening nationally, everything happening in the state, we need somebody who’s going to be in this fight 100%.”"

On Monday evening, the state’s highest court struck down a temporary restraining order issued by a Travis County judge on Thursday, which would have allowed her to get an abortion despite the state’s ban on the procedure. State Attorney General Ken Paxton petitioned the Texas Supreme Court to block that decision late Thursday night. The Supreme Court initially halted the decision Friday while it considered the case before issuing its opinion.

In its opinion, the court said that Cox’s doctor, Damla Karsan, did not prove that Cox met the conditions required for a medical exemption. It also said women who meet those standards need not seek a court order to obtain the procedure.

“The law leaves to physicians — not judges — both the discretion and the responsibility to exercise their reasonable medical judgment, given the unique facts and circumstances of each patient,” the opinion said.

Cox, 31, is at the center of the abortion lawsuit that has garnered national attention as the Dallas-area woman fought to get an abortion for a fatal fetal diagnosis despite Texas’ bans. Cox’s doctors advised her that carrying the pregnancy to term could be harmful to her health and future fertility, according to the case filed last week by the Center for Reproductive Rights.

Cox made the decision to leave Texas for the abortion before the state Supreme Court released its opinion.

“This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate. Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer,” center president Nancy Northup said in a post on X. “This is why judges and politicians should not be making health care decisions for pregnant people.”

The abortion rights group did not say where or when Cox would have the procedure.

Before suing the state, Cox said she experienced severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks before her baby was diagnosed with full trisomy 18, a condition that makes it highly unlikely the baby will survive long after birth if it’s not stillborn. The suit alleges that Cox is at risk for severe complications because of her two prior cesarean sections and elevated vital signs.

During the hearing in Travis County court last week, Center for Reproductive Rights attorney Molly Duane argued that it’s unclear what the state considers to be elements needed to qualify for a medical exemption.

“I read the statute, Dr. Karsan reads the statute to say that a serious risk of substantial impairment of Ms. Cox’s reproductive functions would fall within the medical exemption,” Duane said.

After the ruling was issued, Duane said “this ruling should enrage every Texan to their core.”

“If Kate can’t get an abortion in Texas, who can?” Duane said in a statement. “Kate’s case is proof that exceptions don’t work, and it’s dangerous to be pregnant in any state with an abortion ban.”

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine filed a brief Monday before the court’s ruling in favor of allowing Cox to have the abortion.

“The pervasive ‘climate of fear’ among the Texas medical community is certain to be made worse by this case and the State’s actions in opposing the abortion Ms. Cox needs,” the medical group said in the court document. “Perhaps that’s the point of the State’s conduct.”

Legal experts had said the case could serve as a model for similar situations in the 20 other states where abortion is outlawed or restricted. A pregnant woman in Kentucky filed a lawsuit Friday arguing that her state’s near-total abortion ban violates her rights to privacy and self-determination under the state constitution.

Under Texas’ abortion bans, pregnant people can only get an abortion if they have a “life-threatening physical condition,” or are at risk of “substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” The state Supreme Court is currently reviewing another case, Zurawski v. Texas, that includes 20 women who say their abortions were delayed or denied because the exemption definitions were unclear.

The Zurawski lawsuit, also brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights, requests a temporary injunction that would exempt any Texan with a medically complicated pregnancy from the state’s bans, including those with fatal fetal diagnoses.

Cox joins tens of thousands of Americans traveling out of state to obtain an abortion. Nationally, over 92,000 patients crossed state lines for abortions in the first six months of 2023, compared to 40,600 in the first half of 2020, according to recent analysis by the Guttmacher Institute.

Abortions in Texas have plummeted since the state’s bans took effect, dropping from 50,000 in 2021 to 26 in the first six months of 2023, according to Texas Health and Human Services Commission data.

Senate Bill 8, also known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, bans abortion after six weeks gestation and is enforced through lawsuits from private individuals. People who help Cox obtain her abortion out of state could be sued under the statute, which has largely gone untested, said Carl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond.

The future of Cox’s lawsuit is also unclear. Tobias said it’s possible that the case could continue to move through the legal system, even after Cox receives her abortion. Cox’s lawyers informed the court they want to proceed with the case, state Supreme Court director of public affairs Amy Starnes said in an email Monday.

“Roe was a case that wasn’t entirely different from this, and the Supreme Court kept the case alive under an exception that talks about something capable of repetition but evading review,” Tobias said. “You would never get through the whole court system before you’d have to terminate your pregnancy as a plaintiff.”

The landmark Roe v. Wade case, which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned last year, originated in North Texas when a woman sued then-Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade over the right to an abortion. When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in her favor in 1973, Jane Roe, a pseudonym for Norma McCorvey, had already given birth to the child.

Monday’s ruling in the Cox case does not bode well for the future of Zurawski v. Texas, said Seema Mohapatra, health law expert and law professor at Southern Methodist University. The court is set to decide that case in coming months."

Texas weather is getting hotter and more extreme, study finds",https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2023/12/11/its-not-your-imagination-texas-weather-is-getting-hotter-and-more-extreme-study-finds/,"In the coming years, Texas can expect more blistering heat, extreme rainfall and devastating droughts, according to a new report by the state’s climatologist.

The severe heat and drought of the past two years were not anomalies, but rather part of a trend toward hotter summers and milder winters, the report says. Notably, the number of 100-degree days in Texas has tripled over the past 40 years. This year, Dallas-Fort Worth recorded 55 days of at least 100 degrees.

Even nighttime offers little relief. Texas recorded the warmest low temperatures on record this year, and 2022 ranked the fifth-warmest for low temperatures, the study says.

Aside from heat, extreme weather is spreading across the state, the report says, from a growing risk of wildfires in East Texas to a significant increase in the intensity of hurricanes along the Gulf Coast.

These patterns are expected to accelerate in the next 12 years, according to the report, which was funded by Texas 2036, a nonpartisan public policy nonprofit named for the state’s upcoming bicentennial. Although the complete report will be published early next year, the group released some initial findings Monday.

Statewide, the average annual temperature is expected to be 3 degrees warmer by 2036 than the average of the 1950s, the report found.

“Texas’ weather pattern is trending toward worsening extremes,” Texas 2036 wrote in a summary of the report, conducted by the state’s climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, who is also a professor at Texas A&M University. The report “demonstrates Texas must prepare for hotter summers, milder winters and more flash droughts.”

The pending report is a follow-up of the group’s 2021 report, which also found changing climate patterns. Nielsen-Gammon, who worked on the study with colleagues at Texas A&M, analyzed a variety of meteorological trends, including average and extreme temperatures, precipitation, extreme rainfall, drought, urban and river flooding, winter precipitation, wildfires, severe thunderstorms, hurricanes and coastal erosion.

Recent polling by Texas 2036 showed that Texans have noticed changes in weather patterns and are concerned with the effect of weather on their finances. More than three-fourths of registered voters think the state’s climate has changed over the past decade, and 87% said they were concerned weather-related events in Texas such as wildfires, floods, drought and hurricanes could increase what they pay for property insurance.

“The data confirms our previous finding that Texas’ weather patterns are becoming more extreme,” Jeremy Mazur, Texas 2036 senior policy adviser, said in a news release. “This opens the door for policy discussions on what can be done to adapt to these changes or, where possible, mitigate their effects on Texas communities.”"

50,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Three Colorado refs brawl at fourth-graders basketball game in wild video,https://nypost.com/2023/12/12/news/three-colorado-refs-brawl-at-fourth-graders-basketball-game-in-wild-video/,"These referees need to be hit with technical fouls.

Three refs at a Colorado youth basketball game threw punches and tackled each other in the middle of a court surrounded by horrified onlookers, shocking video shows.

The brawl broke out during the fourth quarter of a fourth-grade boys’ game between Cherry Creek and Legend Blue on Saturday morning at the Gold Crown Field House in Lakewood, according to a clip of the live-streamed game posted online.

Two of the refs walk toward each other aggressively as one of them takes a swing before a third runs over and tackles one of the pair to the ground — all within a few feet of young players, the footage shows.

“Oh my goodness,” a man off-camera exclaims as a young player about to receive a pass backs off the court and covers his mouth in shock.

Two men in plain clothes run onto the court to break it up. One holds a ref back as the two other refs wrestle on the floor.

The pair on the floor get up and square off with each holding their fists up before more bystanders — it’s unclear if they are parents or coaches — step in to stop the fighting, according to the clip.

A fourth ref, who was not involved in the brawl, also tries to amend the peace.

A woman behind the scorekeeping table can also be seen in the clip jogging over to one team of kids to shield them from the violent scene.

No one was seriously hurt during the squabble and “no children, coaches or parents were directly involved,” according to the Gold Crown Foundation, which provides youth sports programs.

The three referees involved were suspended from the league.

“Through our in-house camera system we were able to identify everyone involved and our staff removed all three officials from the premises,” the foundation said in a statement to The Post. “We have informed these independently contracted officials that they are suspended indefinitely from working for Gold Crown Foundation.”

The organization apologized to all who had to witness the “unacceptable behavior — especially the kids.”

“This is an unfortunate reminder that we all need to keep the kids’ best interest in mind and that our adult behavior plays a pivotal role in youth sports,” Gold Crown said. “Let this also be a reminder to everyone that Gold Crown has zero tolerance for any adult behavior that puts the kids’ experience or safety at risk.”"
51,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Deal linking US immigration law changes to Ukraine aid unlikely to be struck this week: GOP senator,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/deal-linking-us-immigration-law-changes-to-ukraine-aid-unlikely-to-be-struck-this-week-gop-senator/,"Senators are not close to striking a deal that would tighten US immigration laws and approve billions of dollars aid for Ukraine, lawmakers said Monday.

Time is of the essence to make a deal, with both the House and Senate scheduled to recess for the holidays on Thursday.

However, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who is leading GOP senators in negotiations that seek to tie President Biden’s $61.4 billion in wartime funding for Ukraine with changes to the US asylum system, was doubtful that both parties could come together on an agreement by the end of the week.

“We’re not gonna be able to get [a deal] by Thursday or Friday this week. We’re still working through text… and there are large areas that are unresolved,” Lankford told reporters Monday, calling it a “frustrating weekend” and accusing the White House of not looping him in on discussions Biden administration officials were having with Democratic lawmakers.

3 Republican senators accused Biden of keeping them out of the loop as they negotiate a deal that would approve billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. AP

The Oklahoma Republican further told NBC News that he is uncertain that even an extra week in session would lead to agreement being hammered out.

“There’s no way to get it done this week,” Lankford said. “The question is are we staying in next week or does this actually move into early January to be able to resolve? That’s a big unknown at this point, and that depends on how the negotiation actually goes and how we’re actually working through to be able to actually get text that actually works.”

With the clock ticking, Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) said Monday that he expects the White House to get more engaged in talks, similarly accusing the Biden administration of not being “serious about addressing this in a real, meaningful, serious way.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet with Biden and House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday in a last-ditch bid to secure additional funding for his country before members of Congress skip town for the year-end holidays.

“We have a responsibility to the [US],” Lankford said of whether Zelensky could say anything to Republican lawmakers that would get them to back off their immigration reform and border security demands.

“That would mean me going back to my state and saying I care about people in other countries, but I don’t care about what’s happening in my own country. It’s important that we actually do two things at once here,” he added.

Thune said his message to Zelensky will be “we wanna help but we need Dems to get serious” on border security.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the leading Democratic Senate negotiator, left the door open to the possibility of a deal being struck by Thursday.

“Obviously, we don’t have the benefit of time right now,” Murphy told NBC News. “I’ve seen stranger things happen in the Senate. But that certainly seems like an uphill climb — but not impossible.”

Biden, 81, requested that Congress approve a $106 billion supplemental aid package, which includes $61.4 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, in October.

The package, which also includes roughly $44.5 billion in support for Israel, Taiwan and the southern US border, was voted down a third time by the Senate last week.

Senate Republicans are demanding an overhaul to America’s “broken asylum process” as a condition for passing the spending request, and hope to attach migrant asylum and parole modifications to the president’s national security supplemental.

GOP senators are demanding that migrants be ineligible for asylum if they have transited through at least one country outside their home country before arriving in the US or have committed felonies or other serious crimes.

The lawmakers also seek to raise the asylum “credible fear of persecution” standard from “significant possibility” to “more likely than not” and revive the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” policy, which allowed US border authorities to return migrants to Mexico while their asylum claims played out in the court system.

The GOP proposal also seeks changes to the humanitarian parole system, which the Biden administration has used to resettle more than 200,000 refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine, and hundreds of thousands more from countries that include Venezuela, Cuba and Haiti.

Republicans want parole only for migrants not currently in the country and limited to rare cases."

Emily Matson worked at Erie News Now based in the Keystone State for nearly 20 years before her death, Lilly Broadcasting said in a statement.

“It is with a very heavy heart that we have learned of the passing of our beloved Erie News Now news anchor Emily Matson,” the parent company said in a statement posted on the station’s website.

“Emily was a shining light in our newsroom, delivering news with a passion and love she had for the Erie community and Northwest Pennsylvania.

“We loved Emily dearly and our hearts go out to the Matson family and her husband Ryan at this time.”

More information about Matson’s death, including the cause, was not immediately known.

Matson became an anchor at the station after she was previously a reporter and morning show producer, according to a first-person bio on Erie News Now’s website.

“I must be dreaming! An anchor gig in my hometown! I am so happy to be in Erie, telling the stories which impact my neighbors every day,” she said in the bio.

Colleague Jamison Hixenbaugh, a reporter with Erie News Now, called Matson’s death “utterly devastating.”

“Working side-by-side with her off-and-on for the past 15 years, I can vouch…she was one of the most wonderful people I’ve ever met.,” he said in a Facebook post.

“She was such a talented journalist and anchor, but even more, she was an incredible friend. From being side-splittingly funny and feisty, to thoughtful and caring…I’m going to miss you being around Em.”

Former colleague and Tennessee-based WVLT anchor Christyn Allen called Matson a hard worker, goofball and “your biggest cheerleader.”

“She was a fiercely loyal friend, and if you were lucky enough to be one of her people, you’d hit the jackpot,” she said in an Instagram post. “She always made sure her people were taken care of. I’m so thankful our paths crossed, and we never lost touch.”

Another former co-worker, David Wolter, WBKO’s chief meteorologist in Kentucky, called Matson a “fun-loving, positive spark” on even the worst day.

“Her personality was contagious and the way she was on-air was exactly how she was off-air,” Wolter said in a Facebook post. “She was real, and simply a wonderful person to know. It was always good times when I got the opportunity to work with her.”"
53,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Biden warns ‘public opinion can shift’ on Israel as WH accused of snubbing hostage families from Hanukkah event,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/biden-warns-public-opinion-can-shift-on-israel-as-wh-accused-of-snubbing-hostage-families-from-hanukkah-event/,"WASHINGTON — President Biden warned Monday that global public opinion “can shift overnight” toward Israel’s war in Gaza — as the White House was accused of snubbing family members of hostages held by Hamas from an 800-person Hanukkah celebration.

“Several family members of the American citizen hostages missing in Gaza had asked the White House to attend its Hanukkah reception tonight, but did not receive invitations, one of them tells me,” reported CNN journalist MJ Lee, who recently covered relative pleas for Biden to “get creative.”

White House event invitations and perceived snubs routinely draw attention and it’s unclear who on the West Wing staff would have been responsible for the decision.

Up to seven US citizens and one permanent resident, in addition to dozens of Israelis, are believed to remain captive in the Gaza Strip after being abducted from southern Israel in the Oct. 7 attacks that killed about 1,200 people including 33 Americans.

The Post was not immediately able to confirm the exclusions and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The alleged snubs come as Biden, 81, continues to staunchly support Israel’s invasion of Gaza — potentially putting his own re-election at risk by upsetting younger, Arab and Muslim voters.

At the Hanukkah event Monday night, Biden said “we’re committed to providing military assistance to Israel until they get rid of Hamas” and proclaimed “I’m a Zionist” to cheers.

“But, but, we have to be careful — they have to be careful. The whole world’s public opinion can shift overnight. We can’t let that happen,” Biden said, without elaboration.

“We’re working relentlessly for the safe return of the hostages,” he went on. “I personally spent countless hours — I mean probably up to 20 hours — with the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Israelis to secure the freedom of hostages, to get the trucks in and get humanitarian aid flowing, to convince them to open the gate.”

Biden also praised a recent Senate speech on antisemitism from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in which he said Jews feel “abandoned” and slammed “dogwhistles” from “friends and allies.”

“Everyone in America should read it,” Biden said of Schumer’s address.

“I also recognize your hurt from the silence and the fear for your safety because the surge of antisemitism in the United States of America and around the world is sickening,” Biden said, two days after University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned after declining to say at a congressional hearing that it was against school rules to call for the genocide of Jews.

“You know we see it across our communities in schools and colleges and social media,” Biden said. “They surface painful scars from millennia of hate to genocide for the Jewish people.”"
54,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Florida GOP chairman recorded graphic video of his encounter with woman accusing him of rape: report,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/florida-gop-chairman-recorded-graphic-video-of-his-encounter-with-woman-accusing-him-of-rape/,"Florida Republican Party Chairman Christian Ziegler recorded a graphic video of himself engaged in a sex act with the woman accusing him of rape, according to a report and a police affidavit.

Ziegler shot the video on his cell phone after he showed up at the woman’s apartment alone on Oct. 2, according to the Florida Trident. He claims the activity was consensual.

Ziegler’s accuser is seen “bent over a piece of furniture in the bedroom” and heard telling the Florida GOP chairman to “climax in her mouth rather than on her new shirt,” in the short video, sources to the outlet.

As part of the criminal investigation into the Sunshine State GOP chair, the Sarasota Police Department is now in possession of that video recording.

The GOP leader’s wife, Bridget Ziegler, confirmed to Sarasota police that she and her husband had previously had a consensual three-way sexual encounter with the alleged rape victim, a woman whom Christian Ziegler has known for 20 years, the affidavit shows.

“Sorry I was mostly in for her,” the accuser told Christian Ziegler in a text message the day of the alleged rape, referring to Bridget, according to the affidavit.

The message came after the Florida GOP chairman asked the alleged victim for her address, and informed her that it was “prob just me this time” because his wife was no longer free to participate in the tryst.

Surveillance video from the apartment shows Ziegler knocking on the alleged victim’s door and walking inside, according to the Florida Trident, which appears to contradict at least part of the woman’s version of events.

“The victim opened her apartment door to walk her dog and Christian was standing outside in the hallway,” the Sarasota police affidavit reads. “Christian entered the apartment, bent the victim over the bar stool and vaginally penetrated her with his penis.”

Both the woman and the Florida GOP chair exit the apartment together after the alleged rape, with surveillance footage reportedly showing Ziegler returning to his pickup truck and the woman walking across the street to get food.

With detectives listening in, the alleged victim contacted Ziegler weeks after their encounter, telling him, “I’m not okay with what happened the other day between us.”

“Oh. That’s not good,” Ziegler responded, according to the affidavit. “You are my friend. Known ya for like twenty years now; Lol.”

“Yeah I know, but that was not cool and you didn’t bring her and did that to me,” the accuser replied.

“[Bridget] was in. Then couldn’t because no response,” Ziegler said. “She said in next time. But I understand. Your [sic] my friend I actually like you as a person, so sorry you got upset, but can leave you alone if you prefer.”

When the alleged victim told Ziegler in one of the controlled calls with law enforcement that he sexually assaulted her, he responded by saying, “Those are big words, please don’t, no I didn’t. You invited me in, that’s it. I did not at all, and I never want you to feel that way.”

Ziegler, who is facing mounting calls for his resignation, maintains that he had consensual sex with the woman on the day of the alleged rape.

The Republican Party of Florida is holding an emergency meeting Sunday where a vote on whether to force Ziegler out as chairman is expected to take place.

“I don’t see how we can continue with that investigation ongoing, given the gravity of those situations. I think he should step aside,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said earlier this month. “I think he should tend to that.”

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Florida House Speaker Paul Renner (R), Florida Senate President Kathleen Passidomo (R), the Pinellas County GOP have also called for Ziegler’s resignation.

“This is the topic of every water-cooler conversation and every lunchroom conversation,” state Rep. Spencer Roach, (R-North Fort Myers) told the New York Times Monday. “People are befuddled and bewildered and frustrated.”

“These people for years have held themselves as paragons of Christian conservative values,” Roach added, referring to Ziegler and his wife. “This is a huge breach of trust.”

Bridget Ziegler, a DeSantis-endorsed member of the Sarasota School Board and co-founder of parental rights group Moms for Liberty, may learn her fate on the school board on Tuesday, when a meeting on whether to recommend that she step down from her post will take place, according to Politico.

She has reportedly already left her post as the director of school board programs for the Leadership Institute, a conservative nonprofit, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.

Robert Crimo III, 23, dismissed his public defenders during a court appearance Monday and declared his intent to defend himself.

After making his declaration, Judge Victoria Rossetti repeatedly asked Crimo whether he understood the implications of his decision — pointing out the considerable amount of paperwork alone he would be required to file, along with the multiple life-sentences he faced if found guilty.

Crimo, clad in red prison garb and with his black hair grown past his shoulders, said he understood and wished to proceed.

Rossetti pushed her case, asking Crimo if he had any legal education and advising him to change his decision.

The suspect responded that he’d once been an observer in a courtroom, and that he’d only ever received a high school education.

“You will be representing yourself,” Rosetti eventually conceded. She then agreed to move the trial date a year forward from the initially planned time frame.

Crimo faces 21 counts of first degree murder, along with 48 accounts of both attempted murder and aggravated battery stemming from the shooting rampage he allegedly carried out in July 2022.

Then 21 years old, Crimo allegedly positioned himself on the roof of a building overlooking the Highland Park parade and fired indiscriminately into the crowd. In addition to the seven people killed, 48 people — children included — were injured.

Prosecutors say he admitted to committing the massacre after police arrested him following an extensive manhunt.

His father, Robert Crimo Jr., was sentenced to 60 days in prison in November after pleading guilty to misdemeanors of reckless conduct for helping his son obtain a gun license in 2019 despite having made threats of violence.

There were 2,031 antisemitic incidents reported in the US between Oct. 7 — when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel — and Dec. 7, according to preliminary data released by the ADL.

That figure is a staggering 337% spike compared to the same two-month time frame in 2022, when there were 465 incidents documented.

The number also is nearly triple the previous roughly 45-year high over a two-month span: October and November of last year, when 741 incidents were recorded, an ADL rep told The Post.

The ADL, which was founded in 1913 and began recording antisemitic incidents in 1979, called the increase “unprecedented.”

The shocking numbers cover 40 physical assaults, 337 instances of vandalism, 749 incidents of harassment and 905 rallies that involved antisemitic rhetoric and support for terrorism against Israel, the ADL said.

“The lid to the sewers is off, and Jewish communities all across the country are being inundated with hate,” he said.

Addressing growing antisemitism on university campuses, Greenblatt added, “Public officials and college leaders must turn down the temperature and take clear action to show this behavior is unacceptable to prevent more violence.”

The ADL included in its statistics the death of a Jewish man and pro-Israel supporter, Paul Kessler, 69, who was killed during a clash with a pro-Palestinian protester in California last month.

While a suspect was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter, he is not facing hate-crime charges.

At least 1,411 of the recent US incidents are said to be connected to the Israel-Hamas war, which has led to tense protests over the Jewish state’s military campaign in Gaza.

About 250 antisemitic incidents targeted Jewish institutions including synagogues and campus Hillels, the group said.

About 400 antisemitic incidents have happened on college campuses — another sharp rise compared to the same time period last year when there were only 33 incidents.

There was also a jump in vandalism and harassment of businesses that are Jewish or Israeli-owned, according to the ADL.

“Vandalism of a Jewish business isn’t political protest – it’s antisemitism, and it’s criminal,” Greenblatt said. “Boycotts have historically targeted the Jewish community at times of crisis, and it’s alarming that it’s happening again now.”

The White House previously announced a national strategy in May to address antisemitism.

Vice President Kamala Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, said at the lighting of a massive menorah in front of the White House last week to mark the start of Hanukkah that American Jews are “feeling alone” and “in pain.”

US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) also sounded the alarm late last month over a “spike in antisemitism” that he said was fueled by pro-Hamas “dogwhistles” at protests denouncing Israel."
57,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Zelensky tells DC audience Ukraine troops watching Congress aid fight,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/zelensky-tells-dc-ukraine-troops-watching-congress-aid-fight/,"WASHINGTON – Ukrainian troops on the front lines of Russia’s invasion are anxiously awaiting US lawmakers’ decision on sending additional military aid, Kyiv President Volodymyr Zelensky told an audience here on Monday.

“Every one of you here understands what it means for a soldier to wait for munition, waiting for weeks, months without knowing if support will come at all,” Zelensky told a room of military leaders and students at the National Defense University, about two-and-a-half miles from the US Capitol.

“Every one of you with command experience knows what it means when instead of moving forward you’re just watching, waiting for armor or equipment while your enemy is satisfied and preparing for assaults,” he added.

Zelensky spoke at the Defense Department school a day before he is scheduled to meet with President Biden and House Speaker Mike Johnson in a last-ditch bid to secure additional funding for his country before members of Congress break for the year-end holidays.

Wearing an army-green sweatshirt reading, “I’m Ukrainian,” Zelensky lamented gridlock in Congress over a supplemental aid package requested by President Biden in October that would spend $61.4 billion on new assistance for Ukraine.

The package, which also includes roughly $44.5 billion in support for Israel, Taiwan and the southern US border, was voted down a third time by the Senate last week.

“Any of you with a son or daughter in [a] combat zone just wouldn’t get it if they were told that protecting lives could wait because there’s a little more debating,” Zelensky said. “Let me be frank with you, friends: If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill, it’s Putin and his sick clique.”

The 45-year-old also previewed the talking points he is expected to discuss with US leaders Tuesday.

“There are two key things – confidence and security – that are crucial for internal stability in countries and for international peace,” he said. “America and all free nations need to be confident in themselves in their strengths in their leadership so that dictatorships doubt themselves and their power to undermine freedom.

“When the free world hesitates, that’s when dictatorships celebrate, and their most dangerous ambitious [take place],” he added,

Noting that his speech came on the 82nd anniversary of the US entering World War II against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Zelensky said his troops are the “first front” in what he believes is “the start of [Russian President Vladimir Putin’s] “global war against freedom.”

“America’s honored son’s and daughters, just like those present here now, had to join the continental war in Europe,” he said. “And now – without American boots on European ground defending freedom against Russian aggression – American Bradleys, HIMARS, 155-caliber artillery, ATACMS and F-16s can get the job done in Europe exactly how global freedom needs it.”

“The current generation of free nations should learn from past battles in Europe that destruction spread by dictatorship is too greedy, and it needs to be stopped right at the start,” he added.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who introduced Zelensky, noted that the Ukrainian leader’s speech was planned on short notice, as the trip to DC was only publicly announced on Sunday.

“Students here will study at the example of Ukraine,” Austin said. “This is an institution that teaches leadership. And Mr. President, you are living proof that a single person’s leadership can help rally an embattled democracy, inspire the free world and change the course of history.”

“Make no mistake,” he added, “America’s commitment to supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression is unshakable.”"

Attorneys Abbe Lowell and Bartholomew Dalton requested that US District Judge Maryellen Noreika throw out the case, arguing in turn that the indictment violated a past agreement between the 53-year-old and the government, is based on an unconstitutional firearms statute and that Weiss was unlawfully appointed to special counsel status.

A fourth motion to dismiss claims the case is a “selective and vindictive prosecution” of the first son and “a breach of separation of powers” because Weiss “buckled under political pressure” from former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.

“After five years of a thorough (and what was and must continue to be a very expensive) investigation, U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a holdover from the Trump administration, decided to resolve the entire investigation of Mr. Biden through a Diversion Agreement concerning a firearm charge and a separate Plea Agreement to resolve tax-related misdemeanor charges,” the lawyers wrote.

“This is the resolution Mr. Weiss suggested and wanted; his office signed the Diversion Agreement, which was effective upon execution by the parties, and the Plea Agreement, which his Office argued this Court should accept in open court,” they said.

“Because the facts in the case did not change and the law only became more difficult for such prosecutions, the public record supports no conclusion other than Mr. Weiss changed his decision because he buckled under political pressure to bring more severe charges.”

A spokesman for Weiss’ office declined to comment.

7 In September, Weiss slapped Hunter with three counts for making false statements about his drug use and buying a Colt Cobra revolver in 2018, during which time he was, by his own admission, addicted to crack cocaine.

The four filings, which run a total of 111 pages, came after Lowell previewed his arguments Monday morning on MSNBC.

“It’s because he is the son of the president who’s named Biden,” Lowell told “Morning Joe” of the case against his client. “Republicans … have tried and tried to say that President Biden has done something wrong. They can’t find a shred of evidence.”

He reiterated that the new charges were “not [because of] a change of the facts, not a change of the law, but the enormous pressure that was put on by Republicans from former President [Donald] Trump to the chairpeople of House committees to demand that something more be done.”

In September, Weiss slapped Hunter with three counts of making false statements about his drug use and unlawfully buying a Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 — during which time the now-president’s offspring was, by his own admission, addicted to crack cocaine.

His attorneys referred to the case in their Monday motions as “a gun charge that is widely violated, yet almost never prosecuted.”

Hunter’s attorneys argued in August court filings that federal prosecutors had reneged on a plea agreement with the first son, which blew up July 26 after Noreika questioned the scope of its immunity provision.

In Monday’s motions, Lowell and Dalton said both parties had signed a diversion agreement granting Hunter “immunity for any offense concerning his purchase of a firearm (among other offenses).”

Those “other offenses” potentially would have included other tax charges, money laundering, bribery and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, providing Hunter Biden broad immunity from future prosecution.

Lastweek, nine counts related to tax fraud — including three felony charges — were filed against Hunter Biden in Southern California by Weiss’ team of prosecutors.

But the first son’s attorneys claimed Monday that their has continued to abide by the terms of that first agreement struck with Weiss’ office, including several probationary measures such as drug tests and limits on foreign travel.

They also pointed to a ruling earlier this year by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that they say renders the statute under which Hunter is being prosecuted unconstitutional.

“Because persons protected by the Second Amendment can no longer be denied gun ownership due simply to past drug use …” the attorneys said, “any false statement by Mr. Biden concerning his status as having used a controlled substance no longer concerns ‘any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale’ of a firearm.”

7 Lowell also asked Noreika to hold an evidentiary hearing to “to further develop the record” of Weiss’ office having mishandled the case, including following up on subpoenas to Trump administration officials who may have interfered. Getty Images

They further note that Weiss’ appointment as special counsel violates Justice Department regulations, which require such prosecutors to “be selected from outside the United States Government.”

Former President Donald Trump appointed Weiss as Delaware US attorney in 2017 at the recommendation of the state’s Democratic senators Chris Coons and Tom Carper.

Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated the prosecutor to special counsel status Aug. 11, though he still remains the US attorney in Delaware.

Hunter’s attorneys also asked Noreika to hold an evidentiary hearing to “to further develop the record” of Weiss’ office having purportedly mishandled the case, including following up on subpoenas to Trump administration officials, including the former president and ex-Attorney General William Barr.

The first son has pleaded not guilty to the gun charges and is prepared to head to trial early next year."
59,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Embattled Harvard president Claudine Gay accused of plagiarism — but stands by her work amid calls for resignation after antisemitism hearing,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/claudine-gay-denies-newly-surfaced-plagiarism-accusations/,"Embattled Harvard President Claudine Gay is fending off accusations she plagiarized numerous portions of her 1997 Ph.D. thesis in direct violation of Harvard’s academic integrity policies.

Documents obtained by journalists Christopher Rufo and Chris Brunet posted on X juxtapose political scientist Gay’s paper with earlier works of several authors and academic scholars, which in some passages are replicated nearly word-for-word.

In one example, taken from page 12 of Gay’s dissertation, Rufo points out the now-Harvard president seemingly “lifts an entire paragraph” from a 1990 paper by Lawrence Bobo and Franklin Gilliam.

Appearing in Bobo and Gilliam’s original paper, published seven years before Gay wrote her thesis, is the phrase “blacks in high-black-empowerment areas–as indicated by control of the mayor’s office–are more active than either blacks living in low-empowerment areas or their white counterparts of comparable socioeconomic status.”

Then in Gay’s paper she writes “African-Americans in ‘high black-empowerment’ areas–as indicated by control of the mayor’s office — are more active than either African-Americans in low empowerment areas or their white counterparts of comparable socioeconomic status.”

5 Harvard President Claudine Gay has faced increasing calls to resign following her testimony at a congressional hearing last week in which she failed to unequivocally denounce calls for “global intifada” on the Ivy League campus. Getty Images

In a statement to the Boston Globe Monday, Gay vehemently defended her academic rigor, saying “I stand by the integrity of my scholarship. Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards.”

Though Gay does cite Bobo and Gilliam by name in the lead-in to her own strikingly similar passage, Rufo points out her near-verbatim replication of their wording violates Harvard’s policies on paraphrasing.

“When you paraphrase, your task is to distill the source’s ideas in your own words. It’s not enough to change a few words here and there and leave the rest; instead, you must completely restate the ideas in the passage in your own words,” the Harvard policy reads in part.

“If your own language is too close to the original, then you are plagiarizing, even if you do provide a citation.”

5 Rufo and Brunet allege Gay had lifted passages and sometimes complete sentences from her dissertation. @realchrisrufo / X

Rufo provided several other examples where Gay’s words bear near-identical resemblance to works by scholars including Richard Shingles, Susan Howell, Deborah Fagan and Carol Swain.

In a passage from a 1981 Richard Shingles paper, Rufo highlights that Gay reproduced the line “black consciousness contributes to political mistrust and a sense of internal policy efficacy which in turn encourages policy-related participation.”

Gay’s version of the line, which appears without quotation marks, reads: “Race consciousness, Shingles (1981) had argued, contributed to political mistrust and a sense of internal policy efficacy which in turn encouraged policy-related participation.”

Other side-by-side comparisons indicate Gay based Appendix B of her thesis almost entirely on Gary King’s book “A Solution to the Ecological Inference Problem” without acknowledging the source material, despite the fact that King was Gay’s dissertation advisor, Rufo points out.

5 The bloggers also pointed to Harvard’s own policy on plagiarism, which they say Gay grossly violated with her failure to adequately paraphrase and offer citations. @realchrisrufo / X

Rufo’s X thread was also shared by billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, which garnered more than 2.3 million views in less than 24 hours.

In his post, Ackman said he had asked a “senior member” of Harvard’s faculty to look over the plagiarism allegations against Gay. He claims the school staffer “found them to be credible.”

In addition, the Washington Free Beacon further claimed four papers written by Gay and published between 1993 and 2017 did not have proper attribution.

The outlet said scholars it had consulted agreed Gay had “violated a core principle of academic integrity” and said they had found 10 instances where Gay had lifted sentences or paragraphs and only changed a word or two.

The bombshell allegations come amid increasing calls for Gay’s resignation following a disastrous congressional hearing last week in which she stopped short of denouncing Harvard students calling for “global intifada” on freedom of speech grounds.

“We embrace a commitment to free expression – even views that are objectionable, offensive [and] hateful,” she said. “It’s when that speech crosses into conduct that violates our policies against bullying and harassment. That speech did not cross that barrier.”

In the ensuing firestorm, billboard trucks calling for Gay’s ouster encircled the Ivy League school’s campus on Sunday festooned with the words “FIRE GAY” and bearing images of her appearance before Congress.

The outpouring of criticism for Gay has grown steadily louder following the resignation of fellow Ivy League university president Liz Magill from the University of Pennyslvania. She stepped down Dec. 9 following her appearance before Congress aside Gay and Massachusetts Institute of Technology president Sally Kornbluth.

The campuses of many of America’s top universities — including Harvard — have become hotbeds of antisemitic rhetoric in the wake of Israel’s war against Hamas, which began after Oct. 7 when the terror group launched a surprise terror attack on the country, killing 1,200 civilians and kidnapping over 240.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant claimed that Israel Defense Forces were “on the verge of dismantling” the remaining Palestinian terror strongholds in Jabalya and Shejaiya after mass surrenders in the area, CNN reports.

“We are near a breaking point in the northern Gaza Strip,” Gallant said. “Anyone who prefers to surrender, as hundreds have done already — we will spare their lives.”

Gallant’s comments come a day after the IDF confirmed the death of Emad Krikae, the commander of Hamas’ Shejaiya Battalion.

Krikae was the leader believed to be behind anti-tank missile training in Gaza City and allegedly took part in the rocket fire and raids carried out against Israel on Oct. 7.

The Hamas official’s reign was short-lived. He was slain by Israeli forces, as was his predecessor who was listed last week among the dozen other commanders, including the one in Jabalya, killed in Gaza since the war began.

6 Emad Krikae, the commander of Hamas’ Shejaiya Battalion, was confirmed dead Monday. IDF

Along with killing half of Hamas’ estimated 24 battalion leaders, the IDF said it has apprehended 500 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists over the past month. About 140 of the men were taken into custody just over a week ago when the temporary cease-fire agreement fell through.

The Israeli military noted that some of the operatives “were caught hiding in civilian buildings, schools and shelters.”

The members of the terror group have since been transferred to the Israeli Security Agency and Unit 504 for further questioning, the IDF said.

The details came days after about 100 Palestinian soldiers, many of whom were in their underwear, were caught on video surrendering to the IDF in Jabalya and Shejaiya.

US Department of State spokesman Matthew Miller described the images of the nearly naked men as “deeply disturbing” during a press briefing Monday, adding that America is probing on why such photos were released in the first place.

Gallant claimed that many of the fighters who have turned themselves in to the IDF were short on food and weapons, as much of northern Gaza is struggling with lack of resources since the war broke out.

There remains much concern over the fighting in Jabalya, which holds one of the largest refugee camps in northern Gaza. There have been dozens of casualties reported at the camp in recent days, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health.

As the war continues in north and south Gaza, Israel is also contending with conflict along its northern border with Lebanon, where it traded missile fire with Hezbollah terrorists Monday.

“In response to launches from Lebanon toward communities in the western Galilee earlier today, IDF fighter jets struck a Hezbollah military site,” the Israeli military said in a statement.

Hezbollah confirmed the attack and that it suffered “a direct hit” from Israel but noted that the terror group will continue to fight in support of Gaza.

The group then fired several anti-tank missiles at homes along Metula in northern Israel. The bombing, Hezbollah claimed, was in retaliation to a Lebanese mayor killed in an earlier IDF airstrike.

Miller noted that the US is also seeking answers about the fighting in Lebanon after claims that Israel had used white phosphorus missiles in one of the strikes.

Although not banned by international law, the incendiary missiles are tightly regulated, with Israel facing harsh criticism after firing such rockets in the densely populated Gaza Strip in 2008.

“Anytime that we provide items like white phosphorus or really anything to another military, we do it with the expectation that it will be used for legitimate purposes and in fully keeping with humanitarian law and law of armed conflict,” Miller said.

As Israel battles the Iran-backed terror groups, Ukraine’s ambassador to the Jewish state claimed that the Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war were actually part of a much larger global conflict of good vs. evil.

“Israel and Ukraine are now at the forefront of the free world war against the axis of evil led by Russia and Iran,” Ukraine Ambassador Yevgen Korniychuk said in a statement after a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Korniychuk urged Netanyahu not to ally himself with Russia, calling Putin a hypocrite for showing concerns about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza after the Kremlin’s invasion in Ukraine."

Genevienne Rancuret was charged with drunk driving and felony assault after cops in Billings said she repeatedly drove her car into a gathering by members of Israel United in Christ on the sidewalk shortly after 12:30 p.m. on Saturday.

“I just kind of saw this white Jeep fly by me and jump onto the sidewalk, straight at the group of people that were there,” Jamee Wagenmann, an eyewitness to the shocking vehicular attack, told KTVQ-News. “The first thing I thought was they lost control and they were in a wreck.”

But Wagenmann said the vehicle then veered “into the Albertsons parking lot and then drove straight at them from behind, like trying to catch them not paying attention.

“Screaming. Even cars were honking. It was chaos,” she said.

Local cops said they’re still trying to figure out what prompted the four-wheeled assault.

“Looks like whatever they were saying struck a nerve with her and she decided to act,” Lt. Matt Lennick, a spokesman for the Billings Police Department, told The Post Monday.

“Not seeing anything indicating this was long-term planned or anything. We didn’t even know they were coming,” he said. “She just happened to be in that area at the same time they were and this escalated.”

Police said Rancuret drove from the scene but was pulled over by cops two hours later and charged.

The department said in a press release posted on Facebook that she was hit with a total of eight counts of felony assault with a weapon, referring to the vehicle, driving under the influence and criminal mischief.

The suspect was ordered held at the Yellowstone County Detention Facility following the incident.

Simon Paul and Travis John Branson were accused in a Montana federal indictment last week of killing some 3,600 birds including federally protected Golden and Bald Eagles, the latter of which is the US national symbol.

Branson boasted in messages that he was “[O]ut [here] committing felonies” and he told buyers of the fowl that he was “on a killing spree,” according to the indictment.

Paul and Branson “illegally sold the eagles on the black market for significant sums of cash across the United States and elsewhere,” the filing claims.

The poaching duo allegedly carried out the lucrative scheme from January 2015 through March 2021, selling wings and tails of the regal animals they killed near Ronan, Montana on the outskirts of the Flathead Indian Reservation, the filing claims.

The pair raked in more than $350 a pop on the winged apex predators, the court papers say.

From April 30, 2020, through March 13, 2021, the men sold or offered to sell the parts or whole birds of two Bald Eagles and 11 Golden eagles, according to the indictment, first reported by the Messenger.

Branson would travel from Washington to the Reservation “to shoot” the birds and Paul — who lived near Ronan — was the “shooter” and “shipper,” the court papers allege.

In one instance on March 13, 2021, the two men “returned to a previously killed deer to lure in eagles,” and Branson shot a Golden which Paul cleaned, before transporting its parts away, the indictment claims.

They are both charged with one count of conspiracy and one count of trafficking wildlife. Branson is charged with eight counts of unlawful trafficking of Bald and Golden Eagles and Paul is charged with five counts of the same crime.

Branson faces up to 18 years behind bars if convicted on all charges while Paul faces 15 years imprisonment if convicted on all charges.

Sources told The Post the 31-year old purchased a $4 million Japanese-inspired home in Altadena, California, for his parents, who previously lived just a few miles away.

Castro has also enlisted his younger brother Jesse, 27, who works as a banker, to help manage his assets after scooping the $2.04 billion jackpot last year, from which he took a lump sum payout of $997.6 million.

“They are a team and they’re very grounded,” a source said of the siblings. “They’re not into partying. They’re not out in clubs otherwise everybody would see them.

“The only pictures that they have are of him coming out of his lawyer’s [office] or the bank. That’s who they are. They are just normal people.”

The $4 million Altadena mansion Castro bought for his father, also named Edwin, and mother, Frances, boasts five bedrooms and five bathrooms and is 4,631-square feet in total with stunning views of the surrounding San Gabriel Mountains, according to Dirt.com.

Castro, a trained architect who graduated from Woodbury University in Burbank — ranked 18th in the nation in architecture schools — was possibly inspired by the home’s unique features.

“The home’s U-shaped focal point is the gorgeous courtyard that created its own private oasis for you to escape the lounge in a zen patio completed by red floating Japanese roof and tranquil pond,” according to the home’s Zillow listing.

The house was last on the market in 2010 for $1.1 million before being sold to Castro in March.

Since his historic win, Castro has dropped a combined $76 million on three massive mansions in California.

His largest purchase was in September, when he bought a $47 million seven-bedroom, 11-bathroom, compound with an infinity pool in Bel Air.

Castro also has a $25 million mansion in the Hollywood Hills, which was “a steal” because the 31-year old bought it at $10 million less than the initial asking price from the developers, a source explained.

The property boasts seven bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, a koi pond and another infinity pool overlooking the whole of Los Angeles.

Castro is still getting used to the limelight according to sources, who say he’s already been targeted by scammers and is wary of flaunting his wealth in public.

However, Castro has a soft spot for sports cars and has been seen driving a $200,000 Porsche 911 around Los Angeles. However, sources say his favorite remains a vintage green 1970s Porsche 911 SC, which is a family heirloom.

Sources say Castro remains humble despite his newfound wealth and wants to stay out of the public eye.

However, behind the scenes, sources told The Post he is committed to using his millions to do some good and has made significant donations to numerous local charities.

A source said the family also plans to hold onto the $2 million home where Castro and his brother grew up, just a few miles away from Crescenta Valley High School where he graduated and was a linebacker for the football team.

Israel Defense Forces First Lt. Eden Ram — who is already up and walking again — described in an emotional online post how she was stationed at the Urim Southern District Base with 12 other soldiers when they were ambushed by the terrorists, with the gunmen shooting Ram in the leg just as she reached the base’s Operations Room.

Trapped in the room, the injured soldier and six fellow service members could do nothing but wait until Hamas blew through every security door until they finally reached the IDF troops, unleashing a volley of gunfire on them, she recalled.

“Throughout this, I was not sure if I was dead or alive,” Ram wrote on October7.org about the moment 12 bullets struck her body.

“I felt dead, but I could still see and hear and feel. I waited for the final bullet that would hit and kill me, but it never came,” she said.

Despite resigning herself to death — with Ram even sending goodbye messages to loved ones before Hamas breached the doors — she found herself alive even after being riddled with bulletse and played dead for four hours as the terrorists checked on the bodies.

She said that as she lay in a pool of her own blood surrounded by dead friends and colleagues, she felt the breath of her friend, Sahar, who also survived the attack.

Once the coast was clear, Sahar immediately helped treat Ram, who had bullet wounds across her legs, left arm and shoulder.

“I was in so much pain that I couldn’t say a word — angels came to save me,” Ram said of the moment more soldiers and first responders arrived at the base.

“They took me to Soroka hospital [in Beer Sheba], and on the way, I immediately asked to call my family and tell them that I was alive against all odds!”

The first 48 hours in the hospital were grueling as she received two life-saving operations, with doctors putting her on ventilation for the next three days while keeping her heavily sedated.

Despite the damage to her body, Ram said, she should be able to regain full function of her limbs.

Ram has sped through her rehabilitation, and last week, she received an award from Israel President Isaac Herzog for her valor Oct. 7.

During the ceremony, she said that she was ecstatic to be back on her feet, describing her recovery as nothing short of a miracle.

“The difficult moments will accompany me forever,” she said. “I had hard thoughts about whether I was even alive and if I would be able to hold on, but then a miracle called me.”"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lashed out at the Biden administration over the weekend for vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.

Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) condemned the White House as “shameful” in a post on X after the US nixed the measure, which was backed by all but one other Security Council member and dozens of other nations in the global body.

“The Biden Admin can no longer reconcile their professed concern for Palestinians and human rights while also single-handedly vetoing the UN’s call for ceasefire and sidestepping the entire US Congress to unconditionally back the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza,” she wrote.

Ocasio-Cortez, 34, who has backed President Biden’s re-election bid, has also been openly critical of his approach to Israel’s war against Hamas.

In voting against the resolution Friday, the US claimed that the process was rushed and shunned a handful of its recommendations.

The United Kingdom abstained from voting on the resolution, which would have passed if the US had done the same. The remaining members — Albania, Brazil, China, Ecuador, France, Gabon, Ghana, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, Russia, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates — voted in favor.

“It would simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on Oct. 7,” Robert Wood, the US deputy ambassador to the UN said following the vote.

“This resolution essentially says Israel should just tolerate this,” Wood added. “We do not support this resolution’s call for an unsustainable cease-fire that will only plant the seeds for the next war.”

As one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, the US can veto any resolution on its own.

Ocasio-Cortez has publicly called for a cease-fire in Israel, which has been at war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip since the terror group’s Oct. 7 attack, which killed an estimated 1,200 civilians — including 33 Americans.

Other members of the so-called “Squad” have been at odds with Biden on Israel.

Recently, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the sole Palestinian-American woman in Congress, declared she was holding back her support for Biden’s re-election next year.

“The struggle that I have with the president is a number of issues,” she told the Wall Street Journal over the weekend.

“They feel invisible to the government,” Tlaib told the outlet of her Middle Eastern constituents, “and that’s something I need to have a conversation with [President Biden] about.”

A new WSJ poll has found a deep schism among Democrats over Israel, with 24% saying they sympathize more with the Palestinians, compared to 17% who sympathize more with Israelis, while 48% have equal sympathy for both sides.

Meanwhile, 55% said Israel was engaged in an appropriate response to the Oct. 7 attack, while just 25% believed the Jewish state is going too far and 20% said they didn’t know or refused to answer.

Despite his staunch support of Israel, Biden has scored low with the public over his handling of the crisis— receiving a 37% approval rating and a 52% disapproval rating.

The 81-year-old’s anecdote is, like other biographical details he’s shared in public remarks, not supported by his own autobiography — or by Reagan’s daily presidential diary.

“President Reagan was nice enough to send Air Force Helicopter One to take me down, but it couldn’t fly,” Biden told firefighters during a day-trip to Philadelphia, using an incorrect name for the aircraft.

“And so my fire department came up, put me in the back and took me on heavy snow on the day I went down to Walter Reed,” added the president, whose stories often face withering fact-checks amid campaign-trail criticism of his mental acuity.

The latter part of the story involving the local fire department is described in Biden’s 2007 book “Promises to Keep,” but Reagan offering or dispatching the presidential helicopter is not mentioned.

A review of records posted online by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library turned up no corroborating evidence.

Press reports indicate that then-Sen. Biden was admitted to Walter Reed on Feb. 12, 1988 — and Reagan’s daily diary, which includes a detailed account of his meetings and phone calls, shows no discussions about sending the chopper to assist the Democrat.

In fact, Reagan himself was unable to use Marine One on the morning of Feb. 12 due to poor weather, according to a handwritten annotation, forcing him to take a motorcade to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to board Air Force One for a flight to Los Angeles.

The term “Marine One” is used for whichever helicopter the president is traveling in, rather than a specific vehicle — as is the case with the term “Air Force One” — and it’s typically joined by two identical decoys. It’s unclear how many times presidents may have tried to loan one of the military helicopters as a favor.

Biden’s autobiography provides a detailed account of his trip to Walter Reed, triggered by what he said was his brother James Biden’s determination that the facility had the best expert to treat him.

“Weather conditions made a medevac helicopter flight too dangerous,” Biden wrote. “I had no idea what time it was, but I found myself on a gurney, my test results strapped to my chest, being wheeled out the doors of Saint Francis [hospital in Wilmington, Del.] toward a waiting ambulance.”

Biden wrote that the ambulance was “manned by my friends in the local volunteer fire department” and escorted through the snow by Delaware and then Maryland state police.

“The medical personnel did not seem easy with the situation. If the aneurysm burst, there wasn’t a thing they could do for me out on the open road,” Biden wrote.

“We rode on for about half an hour… as the ambulance driver picked his way through the snowstorm until suddenly we noticed we weren’t moving anymore. The snow was coming down harder, and we weren’t going anywhere.

“‘Why are we stopped?’ Jill kept saying. ‘Why are we stopped?’ Finally she started banging on the partition that separated us from the driver’s cab.

“‘The Maryland State Police aren’t sure where to go,’ came the answer. ‘Move!’ Jill yelled. ‘We can’t.’ ‘Dammit,’ she said. “move this ambulance!’ The next thing I knew, we were moving again.”

Reagan featured later in the book version of the story.

Biden wrote that he was discharged from Walter Reed after 10 days, but then had to be taken back to the hospital for another 10 days and “President Reagan even sent his own doctor to check on me.”

“When I got back home, Jill and the staff made the decision to keep me completely isolated,” he went on. “There would be no work, no phone calls, no nothing. President Reagan had called twice. Jill was grateful to the president, but she made no exceptions to her rule.”

The White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment on whether evidence exists to support Biden’s most recent version of the story.

Biden has made a series of incorrect public remarks about his own biography, including telling a debunked story involving an Amtrak conductor 13 times as president — and claiming last year that his uncle Frank Biden had been awarded the Purple Heart, despite chronological details making the story factually impossible.

A New York Times poll released last month found 71% of swing-state voters say Biden is “too old to be an effective president,” while just 39% said so of former President Donald Trump, 77, who is seeking a rematch against Biden next year.

Biden’s defenders say he’s simply prone to gaffes that are aggravated by a lifelong stutter.

He ended his first presidential campaign in 1987 — shortly before his aneurysm — after revelations he plagiarized campaign speeches and a law school paper, as well as that he exaggerated his academic record."
67,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Breast cancer survivors may not need mammograms every year: study,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/lifestyle/breast-cancer-survivors-may-not-need-mammograms-every-year-study/,"Annual mammograms are recommended indefinitely for breast cancer survivors in many countries, including the US, but a large British study finds that less frequent screening is just as good.

Yearly screening is meant to monitor whether cancer has come back. All that testing causes anxiety for patients and costs money.

Until now, there wasn’t solid evidence for when women could ease back on yearly mammograms, said Janet Dunn of the University of Warwick, who led the study funded by the research arm of the UK’s National Health Service.

The study showed less frequent mammograms are just as good as a yearly schedule for breast cancer survivors 50 and older.

“It’s really all about giving the ladies the all-clear a bit earlier if you can,” Dunn said. The findings were being discussed Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The unpublished study has not yet gone through a full peer review.

Researchers followed more than 5,200 women. The participants were 50 and older, and had undergone successful breast cancer surgery, mostly lumpectomies.

After three years of annual screening, half were randomly assigned to get mammograms every year and the other half to get less frequent ones.

Both groups did well, with remarkably similar results. Six years later, 95% of both groups were still cancer-free. Breast cancer survival was 98% in both groups.

“This is an eye-opening study,” said breast cancer specialist Dr. Laura Esserman of the University of California, San Francisco who was not involved in the new study but is leading research on a personalized approach to screening. “I think people will be very surprised.”

The new study is “very strong,” but more research will be needed to change US guidelines, said Corinne Leach of Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. She led the development of a 2015 US guideline that calls for indefinite annual screening for these kinds of patients.

“One study alone typically does not move the needle on guidelines,” Leach said. “This study inspires other researchers to do more work in this area. And that is what could lead to a change.”

In the new study, most women in both groups followed their assigned screening schedule. Some in the annual group missed screenings and some in the less frequent group were screened ahead of schedule. When the researchers analyzed the findings based on what the women actually did, the conclusions remained the same.

Survivors “can breathe easily” three years after surgery as they resume a less frequent mammogram schedule, Dunn said.

The findings are likely to change practice in the UK and “will be influential globally,” she said.

How often is less frequent? In the study, it depended on the type of surgery.

In the less-frequent screening group, women who’d had mastectomies had a mammogram once every three years. Those who’d had lumpectomies, also called breast conservation surgery, had mammograms every two years.

The findings do not apply to younger breast cancer survivors, who were excluded from the study and tend to have more aggressive cancers. And women who have both breasts removed don’t need mammograms.

“It’s high time that we have a more personalized approach to screening, not just for women who’ve never had breast cancer, but for those who’ve had breast cancer,” Esserman said.

Raphy, 75, and Rebecca, 70, who asked NBC LA to not use their last names out of fear of reprisal, told the outlet Sunday that although the attack had badly rattled them, they are more determined than ever to wear their faith proudly, even as antisemitic incidents across the US have increased amid Israel’s war on Hamas following the terror group’s Oct. 7 attack against the country.

“I was really enraged, not because of the [injury] but because I was hit as a Jew,” Raphy said.

The alleged assault took place in Beverly Hills, Calif., Saturday morning when the man, identified by police as Jarris Jay Silagi, 44, approached the pair and demanded Rebecca’s earrings.

Silagi, who was arrested nearby shortly after, removed his belt to repeatedly strike Raphy.

“At first, it was a shock. There was a huge hard knock on my forehead here,” Raphy said in the NBC interview, gesturing to his head.

“And all of a sudden I saw the guy hitting my husband with a belt and screaming, ‘Give me your earrings, Jew,'” Rebecca told the outlet.

Bloodied and bruised, Raphy chased Silagi down the street as the would-be robber’s pants fell down, Rabbi Pini Dunner of Beverly Hills Synagogue told NBC.

Raphy sustained a laceration to the head and was treated at the scene, police said. Dunner said after the attack, Raphy “went home, changed shirt, and came back to synagogue” for a planned Torah reading, noting he’s a regular at the place of worship.

Silagi was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, attempted robbery and elder abuse, according to Beverly Hills police. The charges include a hate crime “enhancement” which could result in a lengthier prison sentence if he’s convicted.

“Our officers quickly apprehended the suspect and he is in custody,” said Beverly Hills Police Chief Mark Stainbrook.

“This despicable act of hate against a member of our community will not be tolerated.”

According to NBC, Silagi was convicted of second-degree robbery in 2012 stemming from an incident in which he tried to steal a patron’s phone at a Beverly Hills restaurant, for which he received a five-year prison sentence.

Police said he’s being held at the Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court Dec. 12.

“This case presents a fundamental question at the heart of our democracy: whether a former President is absolutely immune from federal prosecution for crimes committed while in office or is constitutionally protected from federal prosecution when he has been impeached but not convicted before the criminal proceedings begin,” Smith wrote in an 81-page petition to the high court filed Monday.

He added that the request was “of imperative public importance” as the former president is scheduled to head to trial on March 4, 2024, and Trump’s attorneys have already appealed a district court ruling against blanket immunity.

Even with a “highly expedited” appeals process, Smith added, “it is unclear whether this Court would be able to hear and resolve the threshold immunity issues during its current Term” — which ends around four months before the 2024 election.

5 Special counsel Jack Smith has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on claims from former President Donald Trump’s lawyers that he has immunity from his Jan. 6 federal indictment, according to a Monday filing. AP

Smith’s petition asked for a response by Dec. 18 — and a resolution to the constitutional questions presented within mere weeks should the justices take up the issue.

The court responded Monday evening by giving the former president’s attorneys until 4 p.m. Dec. 20 to answer Smith’s filing.

Trump’s lawyers had argued the former president’s attempts to contest his 2020 loss to former Vice President Joe Biden fell within the “outer perimeter” of his official responsibilities.

The special counsel also noted that “precedent supports expeditious action,” referencing the Supreme Court’s 1974 ruling in United States v. Nixon.

In that case, President Richard Nixon was denied executive privilege and forced to comply with a special prosecutor’s subpoena for audio recordings central to the Watergate investigation.

“As in Nixon, ‘the public importance of the issues presented and the need for their prompt resolution’ merit this Court’s intervention now, without awaiting the completion of appellate proceedings,” Smith argued.

“And as in Nixon, that is true even though the district court correctly denied respondent’s presidential-immunity and related double-jeopardy claims,” he added.

The double-jeopardy claims stated that Trump was immune from prosecution since he had been impeached in the House for incitement of insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, but acquitted by the Senate.

A separate Supreme Court ruling — Nixon v. Fitzgerald — provides presidents with mere “civil immunity” while conducting their official duties, Smith also noted, but not an “absolute shield from criminal liability.”

“A cornerstone of our constitutional order is that no person is above the law,” he wrote. “The force of that principle is at its zenith where, as here, a grand jury has accused a former President of committing federal crimes to subvert the peaceful transfer of power to his lawfully elected successor.”

“Crooked Joe Biden’s henchman, Deranged Jack Smith, is so obsessed with interfering in the 2024 Presidential Election, with the goal of preventing President Trump from retaking the Oval Office, as the President is poised to do, that Smith is willing to try for a Hail Mary by racing to the Supreme Court and attempting to bypass the Appellate Process,” a spokesperson for the former president said in a statement.

“‘Deranged’ may need to be reminded that the Supreme Court has not been kind to him, including by handing down a rare unanimous rebuke when the Court overturned him 8-0 in the [Bob] McDonnell case. As President Trump has said over and over again, this prosecution is completely politically motivated. It is an unprecedented attack against Crooked Joe Biden’s Political Opponent—Banana Republic style! There is absolutely no reason to rush this Witch Hunt to trial, except to injure President Trump and his 150 million, at least, supporters. President Trump will continue to fight for Justice and oppose these authoritarian tactics.”

On Dec. 1, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump’s motion to dismiss the four-count indictment against him for attempting to overturn the 2020 election results in Washington, DC, which culminated in the breach of the US Capitol by a mob of his supporters.

Trump, 77, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, is the runaway front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, leading the field by more than 47 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics polling aggregator.

“It’s because he is the son of the president who’s named Biden,” Lowell told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” in response to last week’s indictment of the 53-year-old handed up by a Southern California grand jury convened by special counsel David Weiss. “Republicans … have tried and tried to say that President Biden has done something wrong. They can’t find a shred of evidence.”

“What they’ve successfully done … is basically saying, ‘OK, I can’t get the president, so I’ll besmirch his son in a way that suggests that there’s something going on between the two of them,'” Lowell added.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if they reach back at a time that Hunter was in a stationery store when he was 11 and took a piece of bubblegum and see if they could charge that,” Lowell moaned about the charges.

The indictment filed Thursday accuses Hunter Biden of nine tax-related counts, including three felonies, in connection with dodging $1.4 million in payments owed to Uncle Sam between 2016 and 2019.

The first son is also facing three charges in Delaware related to alleged illegal possession of a firearm while addicted to crack cocaine and two tax misdemeanors previously featured in a plea deal that imploded back in July.

Republicans have argued, based on the testimony of two IRS whistleblowers, that the Justice Department displayed favoritism toward the first family by shutting down lines of inquiry and ignoring evidence that may have implicated the president.

5 Abbe Lowell believes Hunter Biden isn’t getting a fair shake due to his relationship to Joe Biden.

Lowell argued Monday that Weiss had upped the charges against his client “not [because of] a change of the facts, not a change of the law, but the enormous pressure that was put on by Republicans from former President [Donald] Trump to the chairpeople of House committees to demand that something more be done.

“That’s not the way it’s supposed to work.”

Lowell insisted that the first son was merely late on his taxes and suffered from drug addiction that was catalyzed by the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015 from brain cancer.

“As everybody knows, [he was] at the bottom of the barrel of his addiction to crack cocaine, which explains a lot of his misconduct, and also addresses whether he was in what they call a ‘scheme,'” Lowell said.

Weiss was elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland on Aug. 11, shortly after a wrist-slap plea agreement for Hunter crumbled in Delaware federal court.

Even some Democrats such as Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) have suggested they believe Hunter Biden’s behavior warranted prosecution.

Lowell further complained Monday that prosecutors did not inform the defense ahead of time that new charges were coming.

“They said nothing. Indeed, this was a complete surprise to us, notwithstanding we had been in contact with them,” Lowell further said before insisting that his client had suffered enough.

“He has extraordinary accountability,” the lawyer said. “Well first of all, he nearly died.”

5 Rep. James Comer is leading the House GOP impeachment inquiry. AP

“If the US attorney had followed through, and continued on what was supposed to happen in June, there would have been accountability,” he said. “It’s not on [Hunter] that anything happened bad after that day.”

House Republicans opened an impeachment inquiry into the president Sept. 12 to examine whether he improperly benefited from his family’s foreign business dealings.

Investigators have subpoenaed Hunter and first brother James Biden for closed-door interviews this month, but have yet to agree on a date for the sit-downs.

Lowell has offered up his client for public testimony, but Republicans have insisted on a deposition first.

“We will see how that goes because we will want Hunter to as he has indicated every pertinent and relevant question,” the attorney said, “but he should do so in a forum in which the people can hear the tactics of the Republicans.”"

Rafael Govea Romero, 23, was arrested Saturday on a capital murder charge in the killing of the 16-year-old Edna High School student last week.

Romero’s bond has been set by a magistrate at $2 million.

Police and Texas Rangers acting on a tip went to Romero’s family home in the small town of Schulenburg, about 95 miles west of Houston, and took him into custody.

Detectives also seized evidence from Romero’s silver Ford Taurus that they claimed linked him to Medina’s killing, but they did not say what it was, reported station KTRK.

No motive has been released for the deadly stabbing, and cops have not said whether Romero and Medina knew each other.

Edna Police Chief Rick Boone said Romero has been in the US illegally after overstaying his visa. His family has reportedly lived in Schulenburg for about five years.

Romero has been detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) because of his undocumented status, according to the Edna police.

The Post reached out to ICE for comment Monday and was still awaiting a reply at press time.

4 Rafael Medina, 23, was arrested Saturday on a capital murder charge in Schulenburg, Texas.

Medina was found dead in her bathtub on Dec. 5 by her mother, Jacqueline Medina, who became alarmed when her daughter failed to show up for Edna’s annual Christmas parade, where she was supposed to march with her cheer squad.

“My daughter was found in a way that no mother should ever find their child,” Medina previously told station KAVU. “Someone hurt my child, someone took my child from me.”

The grieving mom said that a few weeks earlier, someone had broken into their home at the Cottonwood Apartments, and she wondered if the same intruder may have tried to pull off another heist but was caught in the act by Lizbeth.

Police released surveillance video of the suspect, who was seen wearing a black Volcom sweatshirt and had a distinctive tattoo behind his right ear.

Lizbeth was honored before her school’s football game Thursday night, where her fellow cheerleaders and family members wore purple — the teenager’s favorite color.

“My head is just spinning everywhere, and I just want answers, I want justice,” her anguished mom told KTRK.

Medina described her daughter as “bubbly” and “happy.”

72,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Texas woman Kate Cox leaves state to obtain abortion amid legal battle,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/texas-woman-kate-cox-leaves-state-to-obtain-abortion-amid-legal-battle/,"AUSTIN, Texas — A pregnant Texas woman who sought court permission for an abortion in an unprecedented challenge to one of the most restrictive bans in the US has left the state to obtain the procedure, her attorneys said Monday.

The announcement came as Kate Cox, 31, was awaiting a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court over whether she could legally obtain an abortion under narrow exceptions to the state’s ban. A judge gave Cox permission last week, but that decision was put on hold by the state’s all-Republican high court.

“Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which was representing Cox.

The organization did not disclose where Cox went.

Cox was believed to be the first woman in the US to ask a court for permission for an abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. Her lawsuit quickly became a high-profile test of bans in Texas and a dozen other GOP-controlled states, where abortion is prohibited at nearly all stages of pregnancy.

Days after Cox filed her lawsuit, a pregnant woman in Kentucky last week also asked a court to allow an abortion. There has been no ruling yet in that case.

Doctors have told Cox that her fetus is at a high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth, and low survival rates, according to the lawsuit.

They also told Cox that inducing labor or carrying the baby to term could jeopardize her ability to have another child in the future."
73,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Florida pastor and wife shot dead just one week after getting married,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/florida-pastor-and-wife-shot-dead-one-week-after-marrying/,"A husband and wife from Florida were gunned down in their home Saturday — just one week after tying the knot, according to reports.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office said it had arrested a suspect, Sony Josaphat, in connection with the killings in West Palm Beach.

The names of the victims were not released after shocked relatives invoked a Florida law that bars identifying victims of crime.

“She has never been as happy as she was now,” a relative said of the bride, telling WPTV she and her husband had just married the prior Saturday, which was also the bride’s birthday.

A wedding picture of the couple shows the female victim, a longstanding nurse practitioner, smiling widely next to her new pastor husband.

The victims, who regularly attended a local church, were both originally from Haiti, the woman’s sister said.

Three of the wife’s children were inside the home when Josaphat is said to have gunned her and her spouse down.

One of her adult children witnessed the shootings, according to reports.

Neighbors in the normally quiet community said they heard loud bangs but thought the couple were working on their home.

Cops were called and found both bodies with multiple gunshot wounds.

Homicide detectives quickly identified Josaphat as a suspect in the case and executed a search warrant at a home on the same block.

Josaphat was taken into custody after a brief interview inside the residence.

Police have not yet released a motive for the slayings.

Josaphat is facing two counts of first-degree murder and was ordered held without bond. He is slated to appear in court again early next month."
74,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Madoff victims paid another $158M by compensation fund, bringing total to $4.22B: feds",https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/madoff-victims-paid-another-158m-by-compensation-fund-feds/,"Another $158 million has been paid out to victims of global swindler Bernie Madoff, the feds announced Monday — bringing the total to a whopping $4.22 billion.

A compensation fund to repay victims of Madoff — who died in 2021 while serving out a 150-year prison term — has begun distributing its ninth installment to 24,875 people worldwide, according to the Manhattan US Attorney’s Office.

The Madoff Victim Fund was set up a decade ago after the scam king — who became one of the world’s most hated figures when his $65 billion Ponzi scheme was revealed — copped to his crimes.

Including the new payout, the fund will have disbursed a total of $4.22 billion to 40,843 victims, who span 127 countries and 49 US states — helping them to recoup 91% of their losses, the feds said.

Fund special master Richard C. Breeden lauded the progress made in making victims whole again and said the fund is aiming to make a final payout by the end of 2024, according to an update report released this month.

“When we started, no one knew how many Madoff victims existed, where they were, or the amount of their losses,” Breeden said. “Now, in our tenth anniversary year, we have finally pushed past the 90% payout milestone.”

“Today’s announcement is a realization of our dreams of what we could do to help so many people with shattered lives,” the special master said. “At [Madoff Victim Fund], we have traced the contours of the fraud, calculated the stolen cash and then put it back directly into the hands of the people from whom it was stolen.”

The compensation money not only comes from the funds Madoff was forced to cough up at his sentencing, but also from his co-conspirators.

Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 financial crimes in 2009 and was sentenced that year.

He died in a federal lockup in North Carolina on April 14, 2021, at 82.

Madoff’s massive stock fraud ripped off not only investors but also his friends and family through a shady wealth management company he started in 1960.

He made a failed bid for compassionate release in the summer of 2020 on the grounds that he only had months left to live due to kidney disease.

Roughly 500 victims at the time wrote letters to the judge saying that Madoff should die behind bars.

“The financial toll on those who entrusted their money with Madoff was devastating, and this Office’s unprecedented efforts to return money to Madoff’s victims has now resulted in clawbacks of 91% of fraud losses to their rightful owners,” Manhattan US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement Monday."
75,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Ex-Hamas hostage says captivity in Gaza was like playing 'Russian roulette’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/ex-hamas-hostage-says-captivity-in-gaza-was-like-playing-russian-roulette/,"A former Hamas hostage says her seven weeks in captivity were like being forced to play “Russian roulette” every day — but her faith in humanity was restored when fellow captives readily gave up their meager portions of food to her 3-year-old twin daughters to help them survive.

Sharon Alony-Cunio, 34, described the nightmare she and her family experienced when Hamas broke into their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7 and kidnapped her, her husband, David, and their twin girls, Emma and Yuli.

Crammed together in a tight space with 12 other hostages at first, her family was at the mercy of the terror group, which then began constantly moving them across Gaza to flee from the advancing Israeli army and airstrikes, Alony-Cunio told Reuters.

“It’s Russian roulette. You don’t know whether tomorrow morning they’ll keep you alive or kill you just because they want to or just because their backs are against the wall,” she said.

The mother of two said one of her toddler girls was separated from them for 10 days before eventually being returned, while her husband was removed from the group three days before the mom and twins were freed last month. He remains a captive.

Alony-Cunio said that while held, her family and the other hostages with them struggled to sustain themselves on pita bread provided by Hamas, along with the rare treats of dates, cheese, rice and meat rations that needed to be split among them.

“Everyone gave up food for [Emma and Yuli],” Alony-Cunio said of the kindness of her fellow hostages.

But food wasn’t the only obstacle, Alony-Cunio said. She said she often struggled to keep her children’s minds occupied, as they could do nothing but whisper and sit in a room that would sometimes go dark for hours at a time after the power was cut.

There was also the problem of allowing the twins to use the bathroom, with Alony-Cunio noting that they often had to go in a sink or a trash bin.

As she struggled to help her children survive the 52-day ordeal, Alony-Cunio said, the worst part was being kept in the dark about what was happening in the outside world and whether there were any efforts to free them.

“Every day, there is crying, frustration and anxiety,” she said. ” ‘How long are we going to be here? Have they forgotten about us? Have they given up on us?’ ”

Alony-Cunio and her twins were among the 11 Israeli hostages freed during the fourth day of the temporary truce agreement between Hamas and the Jewish nation, which ultimately saw more than 100 people released by the end of November.

During the family’s time in captivity, their relatives became vocal advocates for the immediate release of the hostages, urging both the Israeli and US governments to do everything in their power to negotiate a deal.

Now Alony-Cunio has joined her family in calling on Israel to make the hostages the top priority in the war against Hamas, hoping that soon she and her daughters can be reunited with husband David.

“I am petrified I will get bad news that he is no longer alive,” Alony-Cunio said.

“We are not just names on a poster,” she said of the hostages. “We are human beings, flesh and blood.

“The father of my girls is there, my partner, and many other fathers, children, mothers, brothers.”

76,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,California baristas fired after blocking Jewish customer from bathroom claim owner knew of antisemitic graffiti for months,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/former-farleys-east-workers-claim-owner-knew-of-antisemitic-graffiti/,"A trio of California baristas who got the boot after being filmed blocking a Jewish woman from entering a restroom said Monday they are being scapegoated — and that the coffee shop’s owners were aware of the antisemitic graffiti in the bathroom for months.

The three workers at Farley’s East in Oakland restated their support for the Palestinian cause in their emailed statement while insisting they stand against antisemitism and did not deny the woman entry to the restroom because she is Jewish.

“We condemn the genocide being committed against the people of Gaza, and we stand against the continuous displacement and oppression of the West Bank by the Israeli government,” their statement said.

“We stand against racism and antisemitism in all its forms.”

The former employees blamed their firing on “the unwillingness and refusal of both Farley’s East owners to protect their longtime staff after a ring wing doxxing campaign targeted our fellow coworkers with violence and hatred.”

Now-viral video taken Dec. 3 showed three gleeful employees denying the woman access to the restroom, telling her “Free Palestine” and accusing her of wanting to use the facilities because “Israel loves taking private property and saying it’s their own.”

Before the video was taken, the customer complained about graffiti inside that read “Zionism = fascism,” which the video shows the ex-staffers proudly defending. The staffers now say one of the shop’s owners, Chris Hillyard, had known about the prominent graffiti for two months.

Staffers added that no one knew who wrote the graffiti in the first place​ but that the owners chose to leave it alone.

The baristas gripe that the customer began “filming staff and other customers without their consent” before she was offered another restroom instead of the graffiti-filled room.

“When it became clear she would not leave until being allowed into the specific restroom with the graffiti, staff allowed her to enter. The customer did not use the restroom, but instead recorded the graffiti on her phone and then left immediately,” the workers’ statement read.

The next day, a different set of staff was asked by another customer whether the graffiti would be cleared, prompting the manager to ask the owners to remove the graffiti to “stop further harassment of staff,” the baristas said.

“It was only when Farley’s was spammed with one-star reviews that Chris Hillyard began gathering information about both incidents,” the staffers charge, adding that no action was taken until after the video went viral.

In addition to accusing the owners of knowing about the graffiti all along, the ex-employees say they failed to support staff during “aggressive harassment and doxxing.”

The cafe’s owners Amy and Chris Hillyard posted on social media Sunday that the employees’ behavior seen on the video berating the customer “was shocking and unacceptable” and that they were fired because of their actions.

The former staffers have slammed the owners’ response, saying it “justifies the harassment of the staff in the video and places the blame entirely on staff members, despite the fact that Chris Hillyard knew of the graffiti for months and did not act.”

Three additional staffers have resigned as a result of their co-workers’ treatment, the statement claims.

8 Ex-staffers slammed Farley’s East for their response posted on social media.

One of the staffers who quit, former manager Adan Ortega, said he could not work at Farley’s anymore because the Hillyards were “more worried about protecting themselves than the staff.

“At every opportunity they got to help clear this mess, they chose to not put their staff first and only thought about themselves​,” Ortega claimed.

​The former worker also slammed the apology the Hillyards put out, saying it suggested that the claims of antisemitism were true and would only invite further harassment against the fired employees.

“It’s all just damage control​ … and now they’re left to deal with all the harassment, doxxing from people who don’t know the full story,” Ortega ​said. “​[The involved former workers’] faces are online, their family information is out there, and down the line, it’ll affect them when they go looking for new jobs.”

The Hillyards did not respond to the Post’s request for comment ​Monday on the allegations levied by the former employees.

8 Former workers created an Instagram to share their statement on the incident. Instagram/@formerfarleyseastunited

Video of the incident gained more than 2.6 million views when it was posted Tuesday by StopAntisemitism.

Before the three employees were fired, Farley’s issued an apology Thursday after growing outrage from the viral video.

“The staff handled the situation poorly and we apologize for this error and the distress caused to the customer. We’ve taken corrective measures with our staff and removed the offensive graffiti,” the coffee shop said in its initial apology.

“We’re committed to ongoing staff training for a safe and welcoming environment. Thank you for understanding that we are a small business doing our best to operate a community business in a difficult environment.”

77,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters demanding cease-fire arrested in Senate office building,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/dozens-of-pro-palestinian-protesters-arrested-in-senate-office-building/,"More than 50 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested Monday morning after scattering what appeared to be bloodstained dollar bills in the lobby of a Senate office building and demanding a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, authorities said.

“Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now!” shouted protesters wearing black T-shirts that declared “Stop Weapons Now,” as they held up a banner that read, “Aid to Israel = Bombing Palestinians.”

A lone protester scaled an immense sculpture in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building and sat cross-legged above the fray, before Capitol Police officers and DC firefighters brought a ladder in and ordered him down, according to photos shared by NBC News.

A Capitol Police spokesperson said 49 people were arrested and charged with unlawfully crowding, obstructing or incommoding.

The person who claimed the statue and another woman were charged with resisting arrest, bringing the total apprehended to 51.

5 More than 40 demonstrators were arrested Monday morning during a pro-Palestinian protest in the Hart Senate Office Building after scattering what appeared to be bloodstained dollar bills and demanding a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.

The demonstration featured bags of cash painted red to resemble bloodstains, which were later dumped across the atrium floor.

“Anti-Israel protestors making a mess of the Senate. I’m sure they’ll change hearts and minds by making hardworking Senate custodial workers spend their entire day cleaning up the mess they created,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said on X.

“Thank you to Capitol Police and the Senate facility staff for upholding professionalism in the midst of such clownery.”

Jewish Voice for Peace demonstrators also chained themselves to the White House fence on Monday, as workers at the executive mansion prepared to host an evening Hanukkah party.

The protests followed several demonstrations that have occurred in other buildings on the Capitol complex and in major US cities — even as a new poll shows a majority of Americans believe Israel is taking appropriate military actions to defend itself against Hamas terrorists.

However, Democrats support the Jewish state’s military effort far less than their Republican counterparts, with 48% expressing equal sympathy for Israelis and Palestinians and 24% expressing sympathy for Palestinians alone. Just 17% of Democrats sympathize more with Israel, according to the Wall Street Journal survey.

Republicans and Democrats in the upper chamber are deliberating President Biden’s request for a $106 billion supplemental national security package, which would provide military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, in addition to further security funding for US border enforcement.

Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), have been united in their support for the aid package, with only Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) voting against advancing the measure last week.

“I voted NO on the foreign aid supplemental bill today for one reason. I do not believe that we should give the right-wing extremist Netanyahu government an additional $10.1 billion dollars with no strings attached to continue their inhumane war against the Palestinian people,” Sanders said in a statement.

5 “Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now!” protesters shouted in footage posted to social media, as they wore black T-shirts that declared “Stop Weapons Now” and held up a banner that read: “Aid to Israel = Bombing Palestinians.” @SenThomTillis / X

“Israel has the absolute right to defend itself against the Hamas terrorists who attacked them on October 7. They do not have the legal or moral right to kill thousands of innocent Palestinian men, women, and children.”

The vote was largely symbolic as Republicans are opposing the bill until immigration policy changes can be added to its text, with many expressing doubt that such a measure could pass before a holiday recess.

Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, during their Oct. 7 invasion of the Jewish state — including at least 33 American citizens. Jihadists also took approximately 240 hostages back to Gaza, including around 10 Americans — two of whom were released during a week-long pause in the fighting last month.

A senior Israel Defense Forces official confirmed last week that roughly 5,000 Hamas terrorists and 10,000 Palestinian civilians have since been killed in the war."

The hardback is one of just 200 early editions of the bestselling children’s book sent out to bookstores ahead of its 1997 mass publication, according to Hansons Auctioneers, which sold the prized literary relic at its Staffordshire saleroom Dec. 11.

The lucky seller was an unidentified 58-year-old Scottish woman, who purchased the book while touring the Scottish Highlands with her family that same year.

“I bought the Harry Potter book before anyone really knew much about it, or the author,” she told Hansons.

Although her fortuitous find predated the Harry Potter mania that swept the globe soon after publication, she recognized the cover and title after reading one of then-unknown author J.K. Rowling’s first-ever published interviews in The Scotsman newspaper.

“I recognised the distinctive book cover straight away. The book seller had placed it in a wicker ‘bargain bucket’ basket on the floor,” she told the auction house.

“Because it had no dust jacket, I got a couple of pounds knocked off the price. Our two children enjoyed the wizard tale as a bedtime story all through that holiday in 1997.”

Years later, the book owner’s children did some research online that led them to believe they possessed a first edition, but she assumed her copy was worthless because of the missing dust jacket. Little did she know what she had was a “holy grail for collectors,” Hansons said.

The book was in storage for years, virtually forgotten and left, of all places, in a cupboard under the stairs in the family’s house, much like young Harry Potter’s meager accommodations at the Dursley’s home in the novel.

However, when she eventually learned the first print run editions weren’t released with a dust jacket, she decided to have her copy authenticated.

“These first issues are getting harder and harder to find. This must be one of the few remaining copies that’s been in private hands since it was purchased in 1997, said Jim Spencer, Hansons’ resident Harry Potter books expert.

“It’s a genuine, honest copy – and a fantastically well-preserved example. This hasn’t been paraded around salerooms or rare book fairs or been restored. It’s fresh to market and it deserves to go full steam like the Hogwart’s Express.”

3 Having no idea of its value, the book was in storage for years in a cupboard under the stairs in the family’s home. Courtesy of Hansons/MEGA

Spencer said this specimen is a particularly rare find because of its relatively pristine condition.

“Most examples are quite badly worn, especially ex-library copies. They’ve often been shared among friends and carried around in school rucksacks, which in some ways is lovely, capturing the buzz of Harry Potter when it first gained popularity,” he said.

“However, more traditional collectors are incredibly fussy about condition, and this could hardly be better.”

The novel, which was re-titled “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” for US audiences, went on to sell more than 120 million copies.

It remains one of the best-selling books of all time."
79,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,NBC News demands Trump official scrap deepfake debate reporter video,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/nbc-news-demands-trump-official-scrap-deepfake-reporter-video/,"NBC News has called on a top Trump campaign official to take down a deepfake video purporting to show one of the network’s reporters breaking down last month’s third Republican primary debate.

Senior Trump 2024 adviser Chris LaCivita posted the video on Nov. 8 of Garrett Haake seemingly trash-talking Trump’s rivals ahead of the Miami debate, which NBC News co-hosted with the Republican National Committee.

The video, which was still on X as of Monday afternoon, started off as a normal “Meet the Press”-style report.

But it cut to footage of the candidates, with Haake’s voice berating each of the presidential hopefuls as they appeared on screen.

“This is Ron DeSantis, an establishment RINO that wears insoles in his boots in order to look taller,” the voice says over video of the Florida governor.

“And this is Nikki Haley,” said the voice of “Haake.” “Nobody really gives a s–t about Nikki Haley.”

The video then cut to South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, with the voice saying, “this guy is probably just a stagehand.”

3 A Trump campaign official shared a deepfake video featuring Garrett Haake outside the third Republican primary debate.

“Who the f– invited this guy?” the voice then asked as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appeared on the screen.

“And this guy is probably just delivering pizzas,” the roll call concluded of Vivek Ramaswamy.

“Anyway, nobody cares about these bulls–t RINO debates,” the deepfake added. “Especially when you know that Donald Trump is going to kick some ass tonight.”

The video then cut to show Trump dancing. The 77-year-old former president skipped the Miami debate, opting to hold a fundraiser in suburban Hialeah instead.

3 Haake’s voice could be heard over images of the candidates, trash-talking each one. Getty Images

LaCivita later clarified that the video was meant as a “parody,” writing on X: “To keep NBC News lawyers off my ass, please note… THIS IS A PARODY.”

But NBC News lawyers have written to LaCivita urging him to take down the video, two people familiar with the exchange told Semafor.

The network declined comment when contacted by The Post.

It is unclear whether LaCivita created the video himself or whether it originated elsewhere.

“If the videotape was done by [or at the behest of] the Trump campaign, it could find itself in a torts lawsuit,” George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told Mediaite.

3 The video ends with Haake’s voice saying “nobody cares about these bulls–t RINO debates. Especially when you know that Donald Trump is going to kick some ass tonight.”

“If it is a reposting alone, there could be greater defenses in sharing a video that has drawn attention in the campaign, though NBC could still claim that the Trump campaign is replicating the violations.”

Turley also noted that “Haake has an obvious false light claim here” and “may also have a claim under appropriation of name or likeness.”

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
80,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Ukraine releases chilling images of turncoat ex-pol’s assassination near Moscow: ‘A signal to all traitors and war criminals’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/ukraine-releases-chilling-images-of-turncoat-ex-pols-assassination-near-moscow/,"Ukraine has released chilling video and photos documenting its assassination of a pro-Russian former local pol who defected to Moscow — saying the killing should serve as a warning to “all traitors and war criminals.”

Ilya Kyva, 46, who had defected to Russia and was publicly labeled a traitor by Kyiv for siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime, was shot and knifed to death in a snow-covered park in the Odintsovo region Wednesday.

Photos released by the Security Service of Ukraine, a k a the SBU, the country’s spy agency, showed Kyva’s lifeless body lying in the snow surrounded by drops of blood.

Another image displayed the weapons used to kill the high-level target — a handgun and a knife — hanging from a nearby tree along with a pair of binoculars apparently used by the hitman to stalk his prey.

In disturbing video also released by the SBU, the suspected assassin is seen showing his stakeout position, which he jokingly dubbed his “office” with a “red carpet,” and a route for him to escape to a nearby bus stop.

Kyva’s daily routines and movements were said to have been meticulously studied as part of the special operation, which was carried out at the high-end Velich Country Club, located 12 miles from Putin’s main official residence, Novo-Ogarevo.

Kyva died at the scene from gunshot wounds, according to local authorities. Russia’s Investigative Committee has launched a murder investigation.

“[Kyva’s killing] serves as a signal to all traitors and war criminals who have sided with the enemy. Remember: Russia will not protect you. … Death is the only prospect awaiting enemies of Ukraine,” the SBU said in a statement.

Kyva, a former member of Ukraine’s parliament representing the Socialist party from 2017 to 2019, had fled to Russia by way of Spain before the start of the Russians’ war on Ukraine in February 2022. He stayed there until his death, often criticizing Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, on state-controlled Russian television programs and on social media.

The defector, who had sought political asylum and citizenship from Russia, had been sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court to 14 years in prison for charges including treason and incitement to violence.

Ukraine military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov made it clear his country was responsible for Kyva’s killing.

“We can confirm that Kyva is the real deal,” he said. “This is the fate that befalls the biggest traitors of Ukraine, as well as the henchmen of the Putin regime.

7 Kyva, 46, had served as a member of Ukraine’s parliament before fleeing to Russia before the start of the war. social media/e2w

“He was one of the biggest and most disgusting scum, a traitor and collaborator,” the spokesman added.

Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyva’s death proves that Kremlin collaborators aren’t safe from retribution even within Russia.

“Regardless of the incident with Kyva, it is very important for everyone who actively cooperates with the Russian occupation administrations in one way or another to understand that their risks are extreme, even if they are located on Russian territory,” he said.

“Of course, the activity and capabilities of the Ukrainian special services have grown enormously over the past two years,” Podolyak noted.

Kyva’s “liquidation” comes two months after another pro-Russian ex-member of Ukraine’s parliament, Oleg Tsaryov, survived an assassination attempt in occupied Crimea.

Several prominent pro-war Russian figures have been assassinated since the start of the conflict in operations blamed by Moscow on Ukraine. The victims have included journalist Darya Dugina, war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky and former submarine commander Stanislav Rzhitsky.

The same day Kyva was shot dead outside Moscow, Oleg Popov, a former deputy of the Kremlin-backed Luhansk Regional Parliament, was killed in a car bombing also allegedly masterminded by the SBU.

All of the targets were listed in Myrotvorets, a sprawling unofficial Ukrainian database of people considered enemies of the state. On Wednesday, Kyva’s photo on the site was overwritten with the word “Liquidated” in blood-red letters.

81,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Trump leads Biden in Michigan, Georgia despite indictment: poll",https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/trump-leads-biden-in-michigan-georgia-despite-indictment-poll/,"Former President Donald Trump is running in front of President Biden in two battleground states — including one where he’s under indictment for trying to overturn the 2020 election result, according to a new poll.

Surveys conducted by SSRS for CNN found Michigan registered voters break for Trump by double digits (50% to 40%) over Biden, while Georgia registered voters back the former president over his successor by five percentage points (49% to 44%).

The 2024 matchup polls also found that Trump, 77, is winning support from voters who didn’t participate in the 2020 election by a 26-point margin in Georgia and a 40-point margin in Michigan.

Registered voters who cast their ballots for Biden, 81, in 2020 are also breaking for Trump in both those states.

Trump lost both Michigan and Georgia in 2020 and was indicted in the Peach State this past August — along with 18 co-defendants — for his attempts to reverse Biden’s victory there.

5 Recent CNN surveys conducted by SSRS found Michigan registered voters break for Trump over Biden, 50% to 40%, and Georgia registered voters back the former president by 49% and the Democratic incumbent by 44%. AP

More than 60% of voters said Biden legitimately won both states last time around, according to the CNN polls, compared with a little more than a third who disagreed.

The polls also revealed 52% of Georgia registered voters approve of the prosecution of Trump by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis — but 53% believed the charges were either not disqualifying or irrelevant to his fitness for the White House, even if true.

In Michigan, the exact same percentage also believed Trump’s criminal cases were not disqualifying or were irrelevant, whereas 46% said the charges do preclude him from serving a second term if true.

The 45th president is also facing federal indictments alleging he made “knowingly false” claims about voter fraud in the last presidential election, as well as that he unlawfully retained sensitive national security information after leaving office.

Biden is lagging behind Trump in voter assessments of the candidates’ policy positions, ability to understand the problems Americans face as well as sharpness and stamina, the surveys show.

Majorities of registered voters in Michigan (54%) and Georgia (52%) said Trump’s policy positions are either exactly their own or close enough.

By contrast, 57% in Michigan and 54% in Georgia said Biden’s policy stances are not what they want in a president.

About half of voters in both states also said the former president has the ability to understand problems of people like themselves — with Biden trailing Trump by eight percentage points in that category in Michigan (48% to 40%) and six percentage points in Georgia (50% to 44%).

Most voters in Michigan (55%) and Georgia (53%) also said Trump has the sharpness and stamina to be president again, while roughly a third said the same of Biden.

5 A whopping 69% of registered voters in Michigan and 66% in Georgia said the Democratic incumbent does not have the sharpness and stamina to serve another term in office. AP

A whopping 69% of registered voters in Michigan and 66% in Georgia said the Democratic incumbent does not have the sharpness or stamina to serve another term in office.

However, majorities of voters in the battleground states also said Trump doesn’t have the temperament they are looking for in a president.

Biden’s job performance is also underwater in both swing states, with 64% of registered voters in Michigan disapproving of his work and 61% in Georgia saying the same."
82,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,‘SNL’ faces calls to apologize for sketch that mocked Elise Stefanik — instead of university presidents,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/calls-grow-for-snl-to-apologize-over-sketch/,"“Saturday Night Live” is facing mounting calls to apologize — and even be officially investigated — over its tone-deaf sketch making light of university presidents refusing to condemn calls for the genocide of Jews.

“This is really appalling,” Dr. Sara Yael Hirschhorn, a “historian of Israel and Jews” and a visiting professor at the University of Haifa in Israel, wrote of Saturday’s cold open.

“NBC do you think antisemitism is acceptable as the punchline of a joke about American society?” the historian asked.

“This needs to be investigated by the [Federal Communications Commission],” she urged, tagging the federal agency.

Many demanded an apology for the sketch, which poked fun at US Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) for demanding the university leaders answer to outrage at their failure to condemn calls for the genocide of Jews on campuses.

“After a day of much-deserved backlash, one would think SNL would delete this video and apologize for their antisemitism,” business attorney Krista Nicole posted on X

“This is truly disgusting. What is so funny about Elise Stefanik calling out antisemitism?

“What a slap in the face to Jews everywhere,” Nicole wrote.

Podcaster Lionel, meanwhile, said he was “overjoyed with what appears to be an avalanche of common sense and radical good taste in calling out obvious bulls–t” at the so-called skit.

“SNL has been in the imposter status as a comedy show for decades,” he said.

“It’s time for Lorne Michaels to apologize. And disappear.”

The Post has reached out to “Saturday Night Live” for comment.

Saturday’s show began with a sketch featuring newcomer Chloe Troast as Stefanik, targeting her line of questioning during Tuesday’s House Education Committee hearing, when she asked the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and MIT whether calls for the genocide of Jews violate their schools’ codes of conduct.

“I’m going to start yelling questions at these women like Billy Eichner,” Troast says in the video.

“Antisemitism — yay or nay?” she screams at the three women. “Yes or no! Is calling for the genocide of Jews against the code of conduct for Harvard?”

Troast’s Stefanik later claims, “I am here today because hate speech has no place on college campuses.

“Hate speech belongs in Congress, on Elon Musk’s Twitter, at private dinners with my donors and in public speeches by my work husband, Donald Trump.”

Almost immediately after it aired, the sketch was condemned online as antisemitic.

“Only a hate-filled, anti-Semitic SNL could do a sketch about the anti-Semitic college presidents testifying in front of Congress and make the questioner Congresswoman Stefanik the target of the sketch,” radio host Mark Simone tweeted.

Meghan McCain also wrote that “there is a 400% increase in antisemitic hate crimes since Oct. 7, and SNL thinks it’s hilarious.

“This is vile,” she said. “Vile.”"
83,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,New Hampshire man accused of Vivek Ramaswamy threat: ‘Blow his brains out’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/new-hampshire-man-accused-of-vivek-ramaswamy-threat-blow-his-brains-out/,"A 30-year-old New Hampshire man faces federal charges after authorities say he texted a threat to kill Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy.

Tyler Anderson, of Dover, made his initial appearance Monday afternoon in Concord federal court and was ordered held until a detention hearing due to take place Thursday morning.

According to investigators, Anderson responded to a text message from the Ramaswamy campaign advertising a Monday morning breakfast event in Portsmouth

“Great, another opportunity for me to blow [Ramaswamy’s] brains out!,” Anderson allegedly replied, per court documents.

In a follow-up message, investigators say, Anderson warned: “I’m going to kill everyone who attends and then f— their corpses.”

Court documents did not identify Ramaswamy as the threatened candidate, but details of the event matched the biotech entrepreneur’s campaign calendar, and a spokeswoman confirmed the 38-year-old was the subject of Anderson’s threat.

“We are grateful to law enforcement for their swiftness and professionalism in handling this matter and pray for the safety of all Americans,” Tricia McLaughlin told The Post.

When authorities arrested Anderson on Saturday, they found similar messages on his phone responding to a different campaign.

“Fantastic, now I know where to go so I can blow that bastard’s head off,” read one Dec. 6 message, while a follow-up read: “Hope you have the stamina for a mass shooting!”

Court documents did not identify the candidate who was subject to the earlier threat, but the campaign’s message used the phrase “tell it like it is,” a statement associated with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

“We appreciate and are thankful for the Department of Justice and law enforcement moving quickly to address these threats,” a Christie spokesperson told The Post Monday evening.

In a separate statement, Ramaswamy said: “We are grateful to law enforcement for their swiftness and professionalism in handling this matter. Our security team worked closely with New Hampshire state police, who are some of the best in the nation. We’re going to let the investigators do their work and figure out who this person is and what their motives might be.

“I will however say this: we constantly hear about January 6 and ‘violence’ and ‘extremism on the right’ from the media, but the same media goes silent when the target is a Republican. Deranged voices and left-wing cranks like Keith Olbermann and Steve Schmidt continue to demonize Republicans and question our loyalty to the country. It’s no wonder that fanatics will take action. Whenever it’s some nut with alleged right-wing views, the media is quick to blame all conservatives for stoking violence. And yet the media never looks in the mirror and sees that they stoke hatred and violence by questioning our patriotism and motives and accusing us of undermining democracy.”

Anderson faces a single charge of transmitting an interstate threat to injure, according to court documents.

If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison, a maximum of three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000.

Ramaswamy is polling at an average of 7% in New Hampshire ahead of the state’s Jan. 23 primary, according to RealClearPolitics.

Former President Donald Trump leads the pack with an average of 45.7% support, followed by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (18.7%), Christie (11.3%), Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (7.7%) and Ramaswamy."

Almost a quarter of Democrats (24%) said they sympathized more with the Palestinian people than their Israeli counterparts, according to a Wall Street Journal poll released Monday.

Just 17% of Democrats said they sympathized more with Israelis, while 48% had equal sympathy for both sides.

Democrats under 50 had even more pronounced pro-Palestinian sympathies — 35% compared to 13% more sympathetic to Israelis, per the poll. Among Democrats over 50, Israelis drew more sympathy by 22% to 12%.

“There is a schism between younger Democrats and older Democrats in where their sympathies lie,” said Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, who conducted the WSJ survey with Democratic pollster Michael Bocian. “It has the potential to become a modern-day Vietnam for the Democrats.”

In all, 55% of Americans said Israel was taking appropriate military action to defend itself and prevent Hamas from attacking again. A quarter of Americans (25%) said Israel was going too far in its response to the Oct. 7 terror attack by Hamas, while 20% said they didn’t know or refused to answer.

On the sympathy question, 42% of Americans said they sympathized more with Israelis and just 12% said they felt more sorry for the Palestinians. A third of Americans said they felt sorry for both sides equally.

However, the gap was narrower among Americans between the ages of 18 and 34, 31% of whom sympathized with Israelis and 23% of whom sympathized with Palestinians. Another 31% said they sympathized with both parties in the conflict.

“I think the war clearly has been very harmful, not just among progressives, not just among Democrats,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

“At the end of the day, I think Biden’s gonna win this election. But what’s going on now is not helpful.”

The WSJ poll is in lockstep with other recent surveys showing a deep chasm on the left over the latest Middle Eastern war.

A CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday found that the proportion of Democrats who believe President Biden has shown Israel too much support jumped to 38% from 28% in October.

In the Wall Street Journal poll, more than two-thirds (69%) of Republicans expressed more sympathy for Israelis, while just 2% were more sympathetic to Palestinians and 17% said they sympathized with both equally.

The survey also found majority disapproval (52%) of Biden’s handling of the Middle East war, while just 37% said they approved.

The poll also found just 37% also approved of Biden’s overall work while in office while 61% disapproved.

The WSJ poll was conducted among 1,500 registered voters from Nov. 29 to Dec. 4. It carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points."

Aaron McCarthy, 25, had been sitting on a sidewalk near the entrance to one of the fast food chain’s London sites Saturday night when the McDonald’s employee approached him and asked him to move.

Footage shot by a passerby showed the security guard suddenly kicking McCarthy’s blankets away before using the mop to douse the sidewalk with the soapy water.

4 The homeless man, Aaron McCarthy, 25, had been sitting on a sidewalk near the fast food restaurant’s entrance in London on Saturday night when the McDonald’s employee approached him.

“The guy started mopping the floor and kicking my stuff into the water. It was disgusting,” McCarthy told the Telegraph in the aftermath.

“I had to leave because it was so stressful, and I hardly slept the entire night because my bedding was all soaked. You can still smell the bleach on my blanket.”

In the video, witnesses could be heard slamming the incident as “outrageous” and “bang out of order.”

4 Footage of the ordeal showed the security guard suddenly kicking the man’s blankets away before using the mop to douse the sidewalk with soapy water.

Damon Evans, who posted the footage on X, tagged McDonald’s UK to express his outrage.

“Do you think it is acceptable for your staff to soak the sleeping bags of homeless people in the middle of winter (or any other time of the year)?” he asked.

“Disgusting behavior. He wasn’t even outside your premises.”

4 Witnesses could be heard slamming the incident as “outrageous” and “bang out of order.” 4 McCarthy said his belongings were soaked in bleached water during the ordeal.

McDonald’s later apologized for the ordeal, saying it was “shocked and saddened” by the footage.

“The third-party security guards involved have been permanently removed from our restaurants and the restaurant team has been reminded of the importance of treating all people with respect, including vulnerable people both in the restaurant and within the wider community,” the fast food chain said in a statement on X.

“We would like to wholeheartedly apologize to the gentleman in the video and will work with the council to locate him and make amends as part of our ongoing work to support homelessness charities in & around the area.”"
86,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Holiday travel expected to top 115M travelers — and these cities could fare worst: AAA,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/lifestyle/holiday-travel-expected-to-top-115m-travelers-and-break-flying-record-aaa/,"Prepare for lines, crowds and traffic: This holiday travel season is set to be one of the busiest yet.

Over the 10-day year-end holiday travel period from Saturday, Dec. 23, 2023, to Monday, Jan. 1, 2024, the American Automobile Association projects that 115.2 million travelers overall will go 50 miles or more from home — a 2.2% increase from last year.

This year will mark the second-busiest since AAA began tracking Christmas and New Year’s travel in 2000. The busiest year was 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic halted worldwide travel, according to AAA’s year-end forecast.

According to INRIX, a provider of transportation data and insights, Saturday, Dec. 23, and Thursday, Dec. 28, will be the most congested days on the road, and Saturday, Dec. 30 will see more traffic than any normal Saturday.

“Nationwide, drivers could see travel times up to 20% longer this holiday season. In major metros, especially in Denver, Minneapolis, and Washington, DC, drivers could experience nearly double the typical delays,” Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX, said in a statement.

“Avoid peak commuting hours and use traffic apps, local DOT notifications, and 511 services to minimize holiday travel traffic frustrations.”

The AAA expects airports to have the busiest holiday season yet with a projected 7.5 million air travelers, beating 2019’s record of 7.3 million.

The AAA expects airports to have the busiest holiday season yet with a projected 7.5 million air travelers, beating 2019’s record of 7.3 million. AAA

“This year-end holiday forecast, with an additional 2.5 million travelers compared to last year, mirrors what AAA Travel has been observing throughout 2023,” Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel, said in a news release.

“More Americans are investing in travel, despite the cost, to make memories with loved ones and experience new places.”

Luckily for those hopping on a plane for their travels, average ticket prices are slightly lower than last year, AAA reported.

“It depends on your desired route and destination. There are last-minute deals to be found, but if your preference is a nonstop flight with seat selection, AAA recommends booking well in advance and protecting your investment with travel insurance,” Twidale shared.

Meanwhile, a majority of travelers will drive to their holiday destinations, with nearly 104 million people expected to hit the road — up 1.8% compared to 2022. Traveling by car this year is also the second-highest record behind 2019 when 108 million people hit the road.

The best times to get on the road for holiday travels are either before lunchtime or after 7 p.m.

The number of people traveling by other methods of transportation such as bus, train and cruise is also expected to surpass 2019.

AAA projects that more than 4 million will take an alternative mode of transportation during the year-end season compared to 3.66 million in 2022 and 3.89 million in 2019.

In a post-pandemic era, the interest in cruises has increased, and the industry is prepared for an influx of cruise bookings that typically come in the new year.

“Savvy travelers know that right after the holidays is the best time to book a cruise,” Twidale said. “That’s when cruise lines offer some of the best deals, and AAA members get exclusive benefits in addition to those discounts.”"

The ring’s owner, a Malaysian businesswoman staying at the swanky hotel, filed a police report Friday accusing an employee of stealing the treasure — only for Ritz security guards to find the ring inside a dusty vacuum bag on Sunday, Le Parisien reported.

The woman told police she left the ring on a table inside her hotel room on Friday when she left to go window shopping in the city for a few hours, and when she returned it was nowhere to be found.

After filing the complaint, the hotel said it was exploring all leads. Police began to investigate and prosecutors were prepared to file charges if it was found the ring had been stolen by a hotel staffer.

By the time the prized jewel was found inside a dusty vacuum cleaner bag, the guest had already left for London. She was expected to return to Paris for her precious ring, worth just over $807,000 (€750,000), according to the report.

“Thanks to the meticulous work of security guards, the ring was found this morning,” the hotel told the newspaper in a statement.

“We would like to thank the staff at the Ritz Paris who mobilized for this search and who work each day with integrity and professionalism.”

The Ritz offered the woman three additional nights to make up for the inconvenience, which she did not accept, according to the report.

The ring was being held by the police until the woman can come collect it.

The incident came after a Saudi princess had more than $900,000 in jewelry swiped from her room at the famed hotel in 2018.

Months earlier, thieves stole some $5 million worth of merchandise from the hotel’s jewelry shop.

The valuables were eventually recovered but two of the suspected heisters remained at large, French media reported at the time."

“She was in the corner of my closet,” Brittney Heinzman, 35, told CBS News of discovering her neighbor Wendy Wilkinson, 43, crouched inside her bedroom closet at the Skyloft Apartment complex in Irvine with a pizza cutter, cutting board and kitchen towel in hand Dec. 1.

“It’s just like your worst nightmare, you know?” said the victim, who had just moved into the apartment complex — where a one-bedroom, 733-square-foot unit costs nearly $2,900 a month — and has now decided to relocate.

“Where was security?” she told KTLA. “I feel like I’ve just been stripped down to nothing.

“To have somebody go through your every drawer, your every cabinet, take your passport, take everything personal, you’re just left with so many questions,” Heinzman said.

Heinzman said she first noticed that the front door to her unit was unlocked and her apartment had been ransacked when she returned home from vacation Dec. 1.

Then when she opened her bedroom closet, she allegedly found Wilkinson hiding inside.

“She just looked at me like a deer in headlights, and I just screamed, ‘Get out! Get out!’ ” Heinzman said.

Wilkinson responded, “Please don’t hurt me” before running out of the apartment, Heinzman said.

“But that just threw me off more,” the victim said. “I’m like, ‘Are you going to hurt me?’ because she has a pizza cutter in hand. I don’t know.”

After the suspect fled the apartment, Heinzman said, she called the cops as she and a friend followed Wilkinson through the apartment complex.

They took cellphone video and images of her, and a neighbor’s Ring doorbell camera captured the suspect, barefoot with blue leggings and a white crop top and with her hair up in a bun, running through the hallways.

When Irvine police finally arrived, Heinzman told them she noticed a number of items were missing from her apartment.

“She took sunglasses, she took Dior handbags, she took socks, she took my work ID, my work badge, my passport, my credit card that she decided to use the next day” at a car wash down the road, Heinzman told CBS News.

In total, officers allegedly located more than $30,000 worth of Heinzman’s belongings in her apartment, car and storage unit.

With all of those stolen goods, police believe the suspect must have entered Heinzman’s apartment multiple times in the past.

It remains unclear how she was able to get inside.

“Based on the time that the victim was away and the amount of property that the suspect was able to steal, we believe it is likely the suspect went into the residence multiple times to collect items,” Officer Kyle Oldoerp said in a statement.

Court records also revealed that Wilkinson was free on bail for a separate burglary.

She has since pleaded not guilty to first-degree residential burglary and identity theft in Heinzman’s case."

The 511 faculty members signed a letter Sunday to the Harvard Corporation urging the university to allow Gay to remain at her post — as billboard trucks circled the campus with signs reading “Fire Gay.”

The support came as a statement is expected to be made about Gay’s future, just days after University of Pennsylvania president Liz Magill lost her job over similar testimony failing to condemn antisemitism, the Harvard Crimson said.

Despite the outrage, the faculty members said they “urge you in the strongest possible terms to defend the independence of the university and to resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard’s commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay.”

“The critical work of defending a culture of free inquiry in our diverse community cannot proceed if we let its shape be dictated by outside forces,” they added in the letter obtained by the student paper.

The Ivy League leader has faced intense scrutiny after she failed to explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would break school bullying and harassment codes while testifying in a congressional hearing on antisemitism on Tuesday.

History professor Derek J. Penslar said faculty have a wide range of views on Gay’s testimony and leadership — but felt that her firing should not be influenced by politicians and other outsiders.

“I don’t think that signing this letter is an exoneration of the University for its handling of issues involving antisemitism and Islamophobia over the last couple of months,” Penslar said.

In response to the backlash over her testimony, Gay apologized for her remarks.

“I am sorry. Words matter,” Gay said during an interview with the Harvard Crimson on Thursday.

90,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Allies of imprisoned Kremlin foe Navalny sound the alarm, say they haven’t heard from him in 6 days",https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/allies-of-alexei-navalny-say-they-havent-heard-from-him-in-6-days/,"TALLINN, Estonia — Allies of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny sounded the alarm on Monday, saying that neither they nor the politician’s lawyers have heard from him in six days.

Navalny, who is serving a 19-year term on charges of extremism, was due to appear in court Monday via video link but didn’t, spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said.

She said prison officials cited electricity problems. Lawyers in recent days also haven’t been able to access Navalny, according to Yarmysh.

“It is already the sixth straight day that we don’t know where Alexei is and what is happening to him,” Yarmysh wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Navalny, 47, has been behind bars since January 2021.

As President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, he campaigned against official corruption and organized major anti-Kremlin protests. His arrest came upon his return to Moscow from Germany, where he recuperated from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin.

Navalny has since been handed three prison terms and spent months in isolation in a penal colony in the Vladimir region east of Moscow for alleged minor infractions.

He has rejected all charges against him as politically motivated.

Last week, Yarmysh said that for three days in a row Navalny’s lawyers spent hours at the penal colony waiting for permission to visit him, only to be turned away at the last minute.

Letters to the politician were not being delivered, and he didn’t appear at scheduled court hearings via video link.

Navalny is serving a 19-year prison sentence for extremism charges. AP

Yarmysh said Friday that the developments were concerning given that Navalny recently fell ill: “He felt dizzy and lay down on the floor. Prison officials rushed to him, unfolded the bed, put Alexei on it and gave him an IV drip. We don’t know what caused it, but given that he’s being deprived of food, kept in a cell without ventilation and has been offered minimal outdoor time, it looks like fainting out of hunger.”

The Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll, released Monday morning, shows Trump, 77, with the largest lead the survey has ever recorded so close to a GOP caucus.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 45, placed a distant second with 19% support, with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley close behind at 16%.

Trump gained eight percentage points from the outlet’s late October poll, while DeSantis picked up three percentage points after completing his goal of visiting every county in the Hawkeye State.

Haley, despite landing a major endorsement from the Koch political network’s Americans For Prosperity Action super PAC last month, failed to make any gains from late October.

No other Republican candidate got above double digits.

Biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy came in fourth with 5% support — up from 4% in October — followed by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staying flat at 4%. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson was at 1% and Texas pastor Ryan Binkley continued to poll at 0%.

“The field may have shrunk, but it may have made Donald Trump even stronger than he was,” J. Ann Selzer, president of the Selzer & Co. polling firm, told the Des Moines Register.

“I would call his lead commanding at this point. There’s not much benefit of fewer candidates for either Ron DeSantis or Nikki Haley.”

Overall, 76% of likely Republican caucusgoers say they are considering backing Trump on Jan. 15, up from 67% in October.

That figure includes 51% who say he is their first choice, 13% who say he is their second choice and 11% who say they are actively considering him.

The ex-president also had the largest share of “very favorable” ratings among poll respondents at 49%, compared to DeSantis’ 24% and Haley’s 20%, and leads his challengers among every demographic, according to the poll.

The number of likely GOP caucusgoers who are confident that Trump can defeat President Biden in a hypothetical general election has increased eight percentage points to 73% since October — even as Trump faces 91 felony charges across four separate criminal cases.

Only 24% of poll respondents said that the 45th president’s legal woes will make it nearly impossible for him to trounce Biden next November.

The Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom poll surveyed 502 likely Republican caucus-goers via telephone from Dec. 2-7 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4%.

Meanwhile, new CNN polls have fond that Trump now leads Biden in Michigan and Georgia — two key battleground states that the sitting president won in 2020.

In Georgia, 49% of polled registered voters said they preferred Trump, compared to 44% who picked Biden.

In Michigan, the former president captured 50% of support to Biden’s 40% among poll respondents."

Arlan Burnham, a fourth-grader at West Creek Elementary School, was found dead under debris when his Clarksville home collapsed Saturday, his mother announced on Facebook.

“My beautiful baby boy, Arlan, did not make it out of the house,” Katherine Burnham wrote, noting that her home is “gone” after being in the “direct path of [the] tornado.”

“I can not put into words how absolutely devastated I am.”

Arlan and his older sister, Ella, were both trapped under debris.

While a neighbor, Billy Urban, managed to pull both out, only the girl survived, escaping with superficial injuries, Clarksville Now reports.

“My son was amazing,” the grieving mom told the outlet. “There is no one in this world like him. Anyone that has ever encountered him is experiencing a loss.”

Her husband, Kyle, also posted on Facebook that “our entire family was turned upside down” by the tornado.

“Kyle and I are not OK,” the mom stressed in her post.

“We don’t know how to navigate through this, we have no idea what is next,” she said. “Anyone who knows me at all knows how much I love and adore my kids, all kids really.”

A family friend has since set up an online fundraiser for the Burnham family to rebuild their homes and pay Arlan’s funeral expenses.

“The road to recovery will be long and arduous, both emotionally and financially,” it reads.

“The Burnham family is now faced with the overwhelming task of rebuilding their lives from scratch.

“As they navigate through the grief of losing a cherished family member, they also must contend with the daunting challenge of reconstructing their home and replacing the essentials that were lost in the tornado.

“Let us come together as a community to show Kyle Burnham and his family that they are not alone in their struggle,” the GoFundMe says, noting: “Your generosity will provide them with the strength and resources needed to begin the healing process and rebuild their lives in the wake of this heartbreaking tragedy.”

As of Monday morning, the fundraiser had already netted more than $85,000 for the family — 17 times more than the $5,000 it requested.

The family is also asking for clothing donations.

Two other adults who died in Clarksville have not yet been identified.

Also killed in the powerful storms were Joseph Dalton, 37, Floridana Gabriel Perez, 31, and Perez’s 2-year-old son, Anthony Elmer Mendez.

Metropolitan Nashville Police said Dalton’s mobile home rolled on top of Perez’s during the storm.

Perez’s other son, 7, and Dalton’s 10-year-old son had been inside their respective homes at the time and were taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

In total, 83 people were injured and 23 are being treated at local hospitals."
93,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Biden to host Hanukkah ceremony at the White House as antisemitism fears rise,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/biden-to-host-hanukkah-ceremony-at-the-white-house-as-antisemitism-fears-rise/,"WASHINGTON — President Biden is hosting a White House reception Monday to mark Hanukkah, celebrating the holiday as he has continued to denounce rising antisemitism in the US and abroad amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

The president, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will attend the reception. Hanukkah continues through Friday.

The Biden administration in May announced what it called the first-ever national strategy to counter antisemitism.

That laid out more than 100 actions, including a series of steps to raise awareness and understanding of antisemitism and the threat it poses around the U.S.

Still, antisemitism has only intensified in some quarters since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other militants sparked Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, which faces heightened criticism for the mounting Palestinian death toll.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned of an impending “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and urged its members to demand an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.

The Biden administration supported a since-expired, temporary pause in the fighting as Hamas released some of the hostages it held in Gaza, and is pushing for another truce — but the fighting continues in the meantime.

The husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, Emhoff is the first Jewish person to be the spouse of one of the country’s nationally elected leaders.

On Saturday, Liz Magill, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, resigned amid pressure from donors and criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy.

Universities across the US have been accused of failing to protect Jewish students amid rising fears of antisemitism worldwide and fallout from the war in Gaza."

One search warrant executed Wednesday at the Natural Bridge Zoo in Rockbridge County shows that 89 living animals were seized, while another 28 deceased animals were removed, The Roanoke Times reported.

The office of Attorney General Jason Miyares is conducting the investigation, with help from the Virginia State Police.

The warrant said that it had been issued in relation to the care of and cruelty to animals.

The attorney general’s “Animal Law Unit offers support and prosecution of animal cruelty cases upon request of a local Commonwealth’s Attorney or law enforcement agency,” Miyares spokesperson Victoria LaCivita said in an email Friday. “Because this is an ongoing criminal investigation, we cannot comment further.”

LaCivita did confirm that one of the dead animals taken was a tiger that had to be euthanized with consent of the owners to humanely end its suffering.

Other live animals that were taken away included lemurs, macaws, pythons and llamas, according to the warrant, filed Friday in the county’s circuit court.

Many crates and animal carriers were taken into the zoo.

A phone call to Natural Zoo Bridge went unanswered Saturday, and there was no immediate response to an email seeking comment.

The zoo has already been closed for the winter.

Mario Williams, an attorney for the zoo’s owner, questioned the probe, telling WDBJ-TV earlier in the week that the zoo would seek to halt any permanent seizure of the animals, which he said would be unconstitutional."

The creepy clip, obtained by KLAS-TV, shows Jonathan Martinez Garcia strolling through Eldorado High School and attempting to open a classroom door near the end of a hall before skulking away.

Martinez Garcia, 17, is serving a minimum of 16 years in prison after being found guilty in June for the vile assault on his former teacher in April 2022. He could remain behind bars for up to 40 years.

The surveillance footage, released after a public records request, also shows his teacher — identified only as Sade — popping her head out of the classroom after Martinez Garcia wanders off.

The student then turns around and heads back to the room.

The chilling clip cuts to Martinez Garcia, then 16, struggling with the educator before he violently drags her back into the classroom.

The video then jumps to 3:05 p.m., nearly an hour and a half after the teen launched his attack, walking out of the classroom with his head down.

Separate bodycam footage from a Clark County School District Police officer, also obtained through a public records request, shows Martinez Garcia being apprehended later in the day.

“Possible suspect sighting, he sees the suspect right outside of his residence right now,” the officer, who eventually arrested the unhinged teen, hears over the radio.

The teen was sitting in a tinted-out vehicle as the arresting officer approached.

“Hey, driver, turn the car off. Turn the car off. Jonathan, step out of the car,” the CCSDPD officer commands, adding, “You know why we’re here?”

Now changed into his high school’s ROTC uniform, Martinez Garcia exits the car and calmly says, “No” before the video ends.

During his June 2023 sentencing, the teen smirked as his teacher recounted the sickening and depraved assault.

“Since it happened, there hasn’t been a single night I haven’t dreamt of the attack,” Sade said in her harrowing statement.

“I would wake up in a new spot and position each time knowing that he’d just drag my limp, and near lifeless body to a different part of the classroom to do whatever he so chose to do with my body, as I lay unconscious,” she continued.

“He’d beat my body so badly that I could no longer fight.”

Sade told police that she came to at one point and asked her student why he was attacking her — and he chillingly responded that he “didn’t like teachers” so he was “getting revenge.”

Martinez Garcia then choked her unconscious. When she awoke, her pants and underwear had been pulled down and he was pouring liquid over her.

Sade told investigators that Martinez Garcia said he was going to “set something on fire” before toppling a heavy bookshelf on top of her.

The twisted teen then sat down on top of the bookshelf and tried to slash her wrists.

“I was being crushed to near death,” the traumatized teacher recounted.

Clark County Chief Deputy District Attorney William Rowles also told the court during sentencing that Martinez Garcia asked Sade, “why won’t you just die?”

Garcia previously pleaded guilty to attempted murder, battery with use of a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm, and attempted sexual assault.

The teen claimed he “blacked out” during the attack but later told police he raped his teacher and remembered trying to strangle her.

“I regret what I’ve done,” Martinez Garcia told the court in June.

“I also regret the things I should have done, but didn’t do.”

Martinez Garcia’s attorney, meanwhile, argued that an asthma drug the teen was taking caused severe mood swings and delusions.

The drug, Singulair, is the focus of a number of lawsuits over severe mental health problems users have experienced, the public defender said. The drug is also known as Montelukast.

“He had no history of anything but being a perfect, loving kid,” Tyler Gaston told the court.

Judge Kathleen Delaney sentenced the teen to up to 40 years in prison.

“It is the most heinous type of crime there could be,” she said."

“The atrocities that we saw on Oct. 7 are almost beyond description or beyond our capacity to digest,” Blinken said in a Sunday interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.

“And we’ve talked about them before, but the sexual violence that we saw on Oct. 7 is beyond anything that I’ve ever seen, either.”

Blinken said the failure to condemn, and in some cases failure to even believe, the reports of sexual violence is something about which “these organizations, these countries need to ask themselves.”

Blinken was asked whether he thought the UN’s stalled acknowledgment was because of antisemitism.

“I don’t know why countries, leaders, international organizations were so slow to focus on this, to bring it to people’s attention,” Blinken responded. “I’m glad it is finally happening.”

Blinken said the widespread sexual violence committed by Hamas is “beyond anything I’ve ever seen.” CNN

Reports of widespread rape in Israel during Hamas’ attack were first reported last month, when the Physicians for Human Rights Israel published its initial assessment.

“What we know for sure is that it was more than just one case and it was widespread, in that this happened in more than one location and more than a handful of times,” said Hadas Ziv, the group’s policy and ethics director.

One combat medic told The Associated Press how he came across at least a half-dozen bodies of women and men with possible signs of sexual assault.

The bodies had mass bleeding around the groins, he said, with limbs distorted at odd angles.

Israeli police say they are combing through about 60,000 videos seized from terrorists’ body cameras, from social media and from security cameras, as well as 1,000 testimonies, to bring the perpetrators to justice.

But it has been difficult to find the rape survivors, as many were killed afterward.

At first, several lawmakers questioned the reports, and US Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) even called for “balanced” criticism when asked about the rapes.

But House Democrats are planning to introduce a resolution condemning Hamas’ use of rape against Israelis as a weapon of war.

Meanwhile, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it requested access to Israel and the Palestinian territories to allow it to collect information about the events of Oct. 7, but a rep for the agency said Israel has not responded to the requests.

The Jewish nation has previously said the UN has pre-existing biases and that Israel will not cooperate with the body.

Instead, Israeli officials said they will consider all options for independent international groups to investigate.

Well, actually, the world’s. On Monday, the California-based tech giant released its “Year in Search,” a roundup of 2023’s top global queries, ranging from unforgettable pop culture moments (hello, Barbenheimer ), to the loss of beloved figures and tragic news carrying worldwide repercussions.

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war topped news trends in 2023, per Google’s global data, followed by queries related to the Titanic-bound submersible that imploded in June, as well as February’s devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.

Damar Hamlin was Google’s top trending person on search this year.

A safety with the NFL’s Buffalo Bills, Hamlin experienced a near-death cardiac arrest on the field during a January game, but has since completed a celebrated comeback.

Actor Jeremy Renner, who survived a serious snowplow accident at the start of 2023, followed. Meanwhile, the late Matthew Perry and Tina Turner led search trends among notable individuals who passed away.

In the world of entertainment, “Barbie” dominated Google search’s movie trends this year — followed by Barbenheimer co-pilot “Oppenheimer” and Indian thriller “Jawan.”

In TV, “The Last of Us,” “Wednesday” and “Ginny and Georgia” were the top three trending shows in 2023.

Yoasobi’s “アイドル (Idol)” was Google’s top trending song on search.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg for Google’s 2023 global search trends. Bibimbap was the top trending recipe. Inter Miami CF, the new home of Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi, led Google’s sports teams trends.

And in the U.S. specifically, many consumers spent 2023 asking why eggs, Taylor Swift tickets and sriracha bottles were so expensive — while “rizz” (recently named Oxford’s word of the year ) was a frontrunner for trending slang definition inquires.

Israel has pledged to keep fighting until it removes Hamas from power, dismantles its military capabilities and returns all of the scores of hostages still held by Palestinian militants after being captured during the Oct. 7 surprise attack into Israel that ignited the war.

The US has provided unwavering diplomatic and military support for the campaign, even as it has urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties and further mass displacement.

The war has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and driven nearly 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million people from their homes.

Residents said there was heavy fighting in and around the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli ground forces opened a new line of attack last week, and battles were still underway in parts of Gaza City and the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, where large areas have been reduced to rubble.

“The situation is extremely difficult,” said Hussein al-Sayyed, who is staying with relatives in Khan Younis after fleeing Gaza City earlier in the war. “I have children and I don’t know where to go. No place is safe.”

He and his three daughters are staying in a three-story home with around 70 others, most of whom have fled from the north, and said they have been rationing food for days. “Over many days, I have eaten just one meal a day to save food for the girls. They are still young,” he said.

Another Khan Younis resident, Radwa Abu Frayeh, witnessed heavy Israeli strikes around the European Hospital, where the UN humanitarian office says tens of thousands of people have sought shelter. She said a strike hit a home close to hers late Sunday.

“The building shook,” she said. “We thought it was the end and we would die.”

FEARS OF PERMANENT DISPLACEMENT

With very little aid allowed in, Palestinians face severe shortages of food, water and other basic goods.

Some observers openly worry that Palestinians will be forced out of Gaza altogether in a repeat of the mass exodus from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation.

“Expect public order to completely break down soon, and an even worse situation could unfold including epidemic diseases and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a forum in Qatar, a key intermediary, on Sunday.

Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, called allegations that Israeli intends mass displacement from Gaza “outrageous and false.”

But other Israeli officials have discussed such a scenario, raising alarm in Egypt and other friendly Arab countries that refuse to accept any refugees.

At the same time, it’s not clear when or if Palestinians would be allowed to return to Gaza City and much of the north — home to some 1.2 million before the war — where entire neighborhoods have been flattened.

The fighting in and around Khan Younis threatens to bring similar destruction to the south, and has already pushed tens of thousands toward the town of Rafah and other areas along the border with Egypt.

It has also hindered the delivery of humanitarian aid to most of Gaza, putting even more pressure on people to head south.

HARSH CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH

Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas, saying it endangers residents by fighting in dense areas and positioning military infrastructure — including weapons, tunnels and rocket launchers — in or near civilian buildings.

The military said Sunday that troops killed armed men as they left a clinic, and that forces operating in Jabaliya found a truck full of long-range rockets near a school.

In a home in Jabaliya, soldiers found a rifle, two rocket-propelled grenade launchers and explosives, it said.

Israel has urged people to flee to what it says are safe areas in the south but has continued to strike alleged militant targets throughout the territory.

Associated Press reporters saw nine bodies brought to a local hospital on Monday after an airstrike hit a home in Rafah overnight.

The aid group Doctors Without Borders said people in the south are also falling ill as they pack into crowded shelters or sleep in tents in open areas.

Nicholas Papachrysostomou, MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza, said “every other patient” at a clinic in Rafah has a respiratory infection after prolonged exposure to cold and rain.

“In some shelters, 600 people share a single toilet. We are already seeing many cases of diarrhea. Often children are the worst affected,” he said.

With the war in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,900, the majority women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory.

The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

Some 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed during the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas and other militants also captured more than 240 people, including babies, women and older adults.

More than 100 captives were released during a weeklong cease-fire late last month in exchanges for women and minors held in Israeli prisons.

Israel says Hamas still has 117 hostages and the remains of 20 people killed in captivity or during the Oct. 7 attack.

Most remaining hostages are soldiers and civilian men, and the militants hope to exchange them for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

The military says 101 Israeli soldiers have died since the start of the Gaza ground offensive.

Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets at Israel, though the vast majority have been intercepted or landed in open areas without causing casualties or damage."

The body of 17-year-old Brandon Smith was discovered Sunday but details surrounding his “untimely” death, including the cause, remain unclear.

“We are heartbroken to hear the news of the tragic and untimely death of one of our student-athletes, Brandon Smith,” Manchester Schools Superintendent Robert Griffin and Manchester High School Principal Suze Neal said in a joint statement posted on the school’s website.

“Manchester High School’s celebration of playing for the Georgia 1-A State Football Championship has unfortunately turned into something none of us could have fathomed.”

The school leaders said the tragedy was being probed, with more information expected to be released by the authorities.

The crash happened the night of Dec. 6 on I-275 at the Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg, according to Florida Highway Patrol.

Troopers responded to assist Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office deputies regarding a stolen Ford Mustang that they had unsuccessfully attempted to stop.

The driver, identified as 22-year-old Leosvany Roman, allegedly crashed into two HCSO vehicles before fleeing the scene, the sheriff’s office said.

According to FHP, Roman led officers on a chase in which he collided with an FHP trooper’s vehicle, then turned around, rammed the vehicle again, then sped off before hitting a Dodge Caravan head-on.

The driver, who FHP confirmed was an Uber operator, was pronounced dead at the scene along with one of three passengers, with a second passenger later dying at a hospital from her injuries.

“This criminal had no regard for human life. Our deputies, facing danger, had to jump out of the way of a man they feared would run them over to get away,” HCSO Sheriff Chad Chronister said. “The additional charges he faces will ensure the only road he’s ever on again is the one that leads straight to jail.”

The Dodge driver was identified as a 33-year-old man from Bradenton, Florida. The passenger who died at the scene is said to be a 52-year-old man from Ohio.

FHP said they could not confirm whether the Dodge driver was on duty for Uber at the time.

Uber said in a statement to Fox News Digital that they have no record of the trip, and that the crash “does not appear to be connected to the Uber platform.”

A 24-year-old passenger from Ohio was last said to have suffered a serious injury, and a 27-year-old trooper who is a two-year veteran with the department, also suffered minor injuries as a result of the incident, FHP said.

Roman is charged with felony murder, vehicular homicide, aggravated fleeing and eluding involving death, driving while license suspended involving death and battery on a law enforcement officer."
101,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Jury trial will decide how much Giuliani must pay election workers over false election fraud claims,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/jury-trial-will-decide-how-much-giuliani-must-pay-election-workers-over-false-election-fraud-claims/,"A trial set to get underway in Washington on Monday will determine how much Rudy Giuliani will have to pay two Georgia election workers who he falsely accused of fraud while pushing Donald Trump’s baseless claims after he lost the 2020 election.

The former New York City mayor has already been found liable in the defamation lawsuit brought by Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, who endured threats and harassment after they became the target of a conspiracy theory spread by Trump and his allies.

The only issue to be determined at the trial — which will begin with jury selection in Washington’s federal court — is the amount of damages, if any, Giuliani must pay.

The case is among many legal and financial woes mounting for Giuliani, who was celebrated as “America’s mayor” in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attack and became one of the most ardent promoters of Trump’s election lies after he lost to President Joe Biden.

Giuliani is also criminally charged alongside Trump and others in the Georgia case accusing them of trying to illegally overturn the results of the election in the state.

He has pleaded not guilty and maintains he had every right to raise questions about what he believed to be election fraud.

He was sued in September by a former lawyer who alleged Giuliani only paid a fraction of roughly $1.6 million in legal fees stemming from investigations into his efforts to keep Trump in the White House.

And the judge overseeing the election workers’ lawsuit has already ordered Giuliani and his business entities to pay tens of thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees.

Moss had worked for the Fulton County elections department since 2012 and supervised the absentee ballot operation during the 2020 election.

Freeman was a temporary election worker, verifying signatures on absentee ballots and preparing them to be counted and processed.

Giuliani and other Trump allies seized on surveillance footage to push a conspiracy theory that the election workers pulled fraudulent ballots out of suitcases.

The claims were quickly debunked by Georgia election officials, who found no improper counting of ballots.

The women have said the false claims led to a barrage of violent threats and harassment that, at one point, forced Freeman to flee her home for more than two months.

In emotional testimony before the US House Committee that investigated the US Capitol attack, Moss recounted receiving an onslaught of threatening and racist messages.

In her August decision holding Giuliani liable in the case, US District Judge Beryl Howell said he gave “only lip service” to complying with his legal obligations and had failed to turn over information requested by the mother and daughter.

The judge in October said that Giuliani had flagrantly disregarded an order to provide documents concerning his personal and business assets.

She said that jurors deciding the amount of damages will be told they must “infer” that Giuliani was intentionally trying to hide financial documents in the hopes of “artificially deflating his net worth.”

Giuliani conceded in July that he made public comments falsely claiming Freeman and Moss committed fraud to try to alter the outcome of the race while counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

But Giuliani argued that the statements were protected by the First Amendment."

“[The Detroit Police Department] can confirm that a person of interest has been taken into custody in furtherance of the investigation into the murder of Samantha Woll,” the department said in a statement to The Post.

“In an effort to ensure the integrity of this ongoing investigation, no further details will be released at this time. Additional information will be released in the near future.”

Woll, president of the Isaac Agree Downtown Detroit Synagogue, was found stabbed to death outside her home on October 21.

A suspect was taken into custody in November but was later released without being charged.

The latest possible suspect, an unidentified man, was not an acquaintance of Woll and appears to be a total stranger, the Detroit News reported, citing two sources familiar with the investigation.

The man detained Sunday is also not the same person who was taken into custody last month, sources confirmed to the newspaper.

Woll, 40, was killed as the US has faced a wave of antisemitism following the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict, but authorities have stressed the slaying was not driven by hate.

The sources also told Detroit News Sunday there is no evidence her homicide was a hate crime.

Woll was at a wedding in the hours leading up to her murder. Police believe she was stabbed inside her home before stumbling outside.

The 911 call reporting an unresponsive person at her address came in around 6:30 a.m., cops said. Woll had left the wedding at about 12:30 a.m., according to friends and police."
103,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Movement to give ‘nature’ same rights as humans gains steam in US,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/movement-to-give-nature-same-rights-as-humans-gains-steam-in-us/,"Legislation that grants nature similar rights to humans is becoming more popular across the globe, with multiple countries and localities approving nature rights laws and several more considering similar legislation.

Panama, Ecuador and Bolivia have all moved to recognize the rights of nature with national legislation, a movement that has gained traction around the world and in the United States, with 10 states having some form of legal protections for nature, according to a report by CBS News.

The most recent country to join the movement was Panama, where the new law was used to shut down one of the largest copper mines in the world.

Behind the effort in that country was Callie Veelenturf, a 31-year old American marine biologist from Massachusetts who has spent much of her career studying and advocating for the protection of sea turtles.

But a legal battle to protect herself from sexual harassment in 2018 became a turning point for Veelenturf, who realized nature did not have the same legal recourse she had as a human.

“I realized that we can’t defend the rights of nature as I had just defended my rights, because nature largely has no rights in our legal systems,” Veelenturf told CBS News.

The marine biologist said a book, “The Rights of Nature: A Legal Revolution That Could Save the World,” helped solidify the idea in her mind, causing her to make it “a mission” to advance the concept across the globe.

“It prioritizes the needs of the ecosystems and not the needs of humanity,” Veelenturf said.

“I realized that we can’t defend the rights of nature as I had just defended my rights, because nature largely has no rights in our legal systems,” Callie Veelenturf said. Callie Veelenturf

The marine biologist brought the idea to Panama’s first lady and parliament, where it gained widespread support and eventually became law.

The law has since been used by the country’s Supreme Court to shut down a $10 billion copper mine that opponents claimed would threaten tropical jungles and water supplies.

In the U.S., Seattle recently recognized the rights of salmon to pass through the city’s dams, according to the CBS News report, while North Carolina has begun considering giving rights to the Haw River ecosystem.

The trend has been encouraging to Veelenturf, who argued humans need “a different way of interacting with nature.”

“It’s just exciting every time. It never gets old,” Veelenturf said. “What we’re doing now is obviously not working, and so this provides a different way of interacting with nature. I think we’re at a point now where it’s worth a shot.”"
104,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Divers recover the seventh of 8 crew members killed in crash of a US military Osprey off Japan,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/divers-recover-the-seventh-of-8-crew-members-killed-in-crash-of-a-us-military-osprey-off-japan/,"Divers on Sunday recovered the remains of the seventh of the eight crew members from a US military Osprey aircraft that crashed off southern Japan during a training mission.

The Air Force CV-22 Osprey went down Nov. 29 just off Yakushima Island in southwestern Japan while on its way to Okinawa.

The bodies of six of the crew had since been recovered, including five from the sunken wreckage of the aircraft.

The US Air Force Special Operations Command said in a statement that the body found by Air Force divers was one of the two crew members still missing.

The identity of the airman had been determined but the information was being withheld until next of kin could be notified, the command said.

“Currently there is a combined effort in locating and recovering the remains of our eighth airman,” it said.

A week after the crash and repeated reminders from the Japanese government about safety concerns, the US military grounded all its Osprey V-22 aircraft after a preliminary investigation indicated something went wrong with the craft that was not a human error.

The U.S.-made Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster, like an airplane, during flight.

The crash raised new questions about the safety of the Osprey, which has been involved in multiple fatal accidents over its relatively short time in service.

Japan grounded its fleet of 14 Ospreys after the crash.

Japanese defense officials say Ospreys are key to the country’s military buildup especially in southwestern Japan, in the face of a growing threat from China.

But the crash has rekindled worries and public protests in areas where additional Osprey deployment is planned.

Japanese residents and media have criticized Japan’s government for not pushing hard enough to get Ospreys grounded sooner or gain access to information about the crash."

The unidentified man’s legs became pinned beneath a boulder in an accident while he was hiking the Inyo Mountains on Tuesday afternoon, according to Inyo County Search & Rescue — which was called to respond.

Nine volunteer crew members made their way out to the stranded hiker below the Santa Rita Flat via helicopter and four-wheel drive vehicles, arriving well after dark, the rescue team said.

They found the hiker “in great pain with his left leg pinned beneath a large boulder on a steep hillside.”

They estimated the boulder crushing his leg weighed between 6,000 and 10,000 pounds, Inyo County Search & Rescue said.

The rescue team crafted “a system of ropes, pulleys, and leverage” to shift the giant rock just enough to free the man’s leg. They then assessed his crushed leg and stabilized the injury until medics arrived via helicopter.

“Due to the seriousness of the hiker’s injuries and the difficulty of the terrain, it was decided to extricate the hiker despite the darkness using a helicopter from US Naval Air Station Lemoor,” Inyo County Search & Rescue said.

The helicopter was unable to land due to the hilly terrain so a US Navy medic rappelled down to the injured hiker and both were hoisted up into the aircraft.

The hiker was flown to a hospital in Fresno for treatment after midnight.

The Inyo County Search & Rescue crew members headed out of the mountains and signed off at 4 a.m.

The team said the difficult mission included several challenges along the way including “coordination of multiple agencies and resources; accessing an accident scene in steep, loose rocky terrain; using limited resources to move a large boulder; managing a severely injured patient for several hours while awaiting the helicopter extrication; assisting in a nighttime helicopter hoist; all in chilly December darkness.”

The nonprofit did not provide an update on the hiker’s condition."

Amy and Chris Hillyard, the owners of Farley’s East in Oakland, posted on social media Sunday that the employees’ behavior seen on the video berating the customer “was shocking and unacceptable” and they are now jobless due to their actions.

“We do not tolerate any behavior at Farley’s that makes people feel unwelcome or unsafe. Because this act was not aligned with our values, the employees involved in the incident are no longer employed by Farley’s,” the Hillyards posted on the shop’s social media.

“Events like these strike fear in the Jewish community and perpetuate the rise of anti-Semitism in our community and around the world.

“We can and must do better — and this starts with us creating a safe space for anyone who patronizes our coffeehouse.”

The video, recorded by the customer, showed three of the cafe’s employees blocking her from using the shop’s restroom.

6 The owners stated that acts of hate would not be tolerated in their business.

6 One worker tells the woman, “I know Israel loves taking private property and saying it’s their own.”

The customer, who claims to have gone into the bathroom beforehand and noticed antisemitic graffiti written on the mirror saying, “Zionism = fascism” and “Your neutrality/apathy is enabling genocide” scribbled on a diaper-changing station, was attempting to re-enter to document the remarks when the employees prevented her.

One of the employees started telling the customer the café was “private property” and she needed to leave.

As the customer stands her ground, insisting on using the public restroom, another employee says, “I know Israel loves taking private property and saying it’s their own, but we got to head [out],” while gesturing his hand toward the door.

The customer tells the employees she is a “patron” at the shop and has a “right” to use the bathroom, but the male employee doubles down and tells her they “have a right to refuse service.”

As the customer goes back and forth with the Farley’s employees, a woman who works at a neighboring business offers her the use of its bathroom.

“I should not be excluded when other people are allowed,” she tells the employee from the neighboring business.

6 “Your neutrality/apathy is enabling genocide” scribbled on a diaper-changing station

One of the coffee shop employees tells her she can “use the other restroom” in the café, but the customer insists on using the one with the graffiti.

“All you’re going to get is a video of us saying that ‘Zionism is antisemitism’ because it is,” says the employee.

“If you agree with [the graffiti], why are you afraid that I take a picture of it?” the customer responds.

6 A woman who works at a neighboring business offered the Jewish café patron the use of its bathroom next door.

The staff suddenly gives in and allows the patron into the bathroom.

As she enters to film the bathroom, the male employee rudely claims that “history didn’t start in 1948, lady,” seemingly referring to the year in which Israel was established.

“Free Palestine. Now please go,” one of the staffers chimes in, as the male employee repeats the phrase, adding, “It’s always … great, we LOVE it.”

The employees also accused the woman of “misgendering” an employee during the altercation.

The video gained more than 2.6 million views when it was posted Tuesday by StopAntisemitism.

Before the three employees were fired, Farley’s issued an apology Thursday after growing outrage from the viral video.

“The staff handled the situation poorly and we apologize for this error and the distress caused to the customer. We’ve taken corrective measures with our staff and removed the offensive graffiti,” the coffee shop said in its initial apology.

“We’re committed to ongoing staff training for a safe and welcoming environment. Thank you for understanding that we are a small business doing our best to operate a community business in a difficult environment.”"

The privately-funded trucks read “FIRE GAY” and were accompanied by photos of Gay during her appearance before Congress last week, according to Fox News.

The Havard president, Magill and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth have been under criticism after failing to condemn students’ calls for the genocide of Jews.

One truck was seen driving around the campus, while another was positioned at the school’s main gate blaring Gay’s exchange with New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, in which the Harvard president said calls for genocide only qualify as harassment or bullying “depending on the context.”

The unidentified private funder of the billboards will also deploy a plane over campus later this week with a banner reading: “HARVARD — STOP JEW HATRED,” Fox News reports.

“One down, two to go,” the private funder told Fox.

His remarks echoed those of Stefanik, who called on Harvard and MIT to “do the right thing” in the aftermath of Magill’s resignation.

She warned that the two schools can now “anticipate a robust and comprehensive Congressional investigation of all facets of their institutions’ negligent perpetration of antisemitism including administrative, faculty, funding and overall leadership and governance.”

The group StopAntisemitism also wrote, “Let’s hope Harvard’s President Gay is next.”

“The system at Harvard along with the ideology that grips far too many of the students and faculty, the ideology that works only along axes of oppression and places Jews as oppressors and therefore intrinsically evil, is itself evil,” David Wolpe wrote.

He praised Gay as a “kind and thoughtful” person but said her congressional comments were “painfully inadequate” in addressing spiraling antisemitism on the Cambridge campus and elsewhere.

In response to the backlash for her testimony, Gay apologized for her remarks.

“I am sorry. Words matter,” Gay said during an interview with the Harvard Crimson on Thursday.

“When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret,” she added.

But as the trucks circled on Sunday, the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers convened Sunday to discuss Gay’s leadership, the backlash to her response to Congress and whether the school should issue a public statement, according to the Harvard Crimson.

Sheriff deputies found Father Stephen Gutgsell with stab wounds around 5 a.m. after he was allegedly attacked by Kierre Williams inside St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office said.

Gutgsell was rushed to University of Nebraska Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Williams, 43, of Sioux City, Iowa, was still in the rectory when authorities arrived, and was arrested for homicide and use of a weapon to commit a felony, the sheriff’s office said.

Law enforcement were initially called to the scene for an attempted break-in at the church located in Fort Calhoun, a city of about 1,000 that is 20 miles north of Omaha.

The Archdiocese of Omaha said in a statement Gutgsell was assaulted during an “invasion at the rectory” at the church.

“Please join Archbishop George Lucas in prayer for the repose of Father Gutgsell, for his family and for the St. John the Baptist parish community in this tragic time,” the archdiocese said in a statement, according to Omaha World-Herald.

St. John the Baptist parishioner Mike Fitzgerald told the Omaha-World-Herald the usual 8:30 a.m. Mass was called off. He remembered Gutgsell, who was at the church for 11 years, as a “very holy man.”

“He did a lot of things for the community,” he said. “He always made sure that the (church) bulletin had everything we needed to know about things going on at the church.”

More than a decade ago, Gutgsell pleaded guilty to theft by deception in 2007 for embezzling $127,000 from an area church and was sentenced to probation and restitution.

He was reassigned to another church after church leaders said then he learned his lesson and sought forgiveness.

Washington Sheriff Mike Robinson told WOWT-TV his office did not believe Gutgsell’s death was related to his past criminal trouble.

Authorities said Sunday further information would come from the Washington County District Attorney’s Office.

The unidentified — and supposedly heavily armed — conspirator landed on Cuba’s northern coast and made his way inland to his native Cienfuegos, where he tried to rally others to his cause, Cuba’s communist regime said.

The notoriously paranoid government leadership maintains that the supposed recent one-man invasion force was just the latest Miami-based plot to wreak havoc on the island, according to the newspaper Diario de Cuba.

“The Cubans involved in these events residing in the United States have links with terrorists who live in that country and who publicly promote violent actions against Cuba,” regime flak Humberto Lopez told the Spanish-language outlet.

“People who have gotten military training in the United States, who have been armed and prepared, and who have resources to carry out these plans in Cuba,” he said.

State-run media claimed two Florida-based groups, La Nueva Nacion Cubana and La Nacion Cubana en Armas — the New Cuban Nation and the New Cuban Nation in Arms — were behind the alleged plot.

But the outlets have been sketchy on the details, according to Reuters.

The notoriously paranoid Cuban socialist regime has long claimed it was the target of invasion plans from Miami exiles. stock.adobe.com

Cuba has long claimed that exiles who fled to South Florida following the ouster of US-backed leader Fulgencio Batista have since planned to invade Cuba. Batista was overthrown by socialist revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro.

The claims, bolstered by the failed US-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, have since been at the heart of ongoing government propaganda to keep dissent on the island in check.

Exiles in Miami and surrounding cities in South Florida have remained havens for anti-Castro sentiment in the wake of the 1959 revolution that snuffed out democracy on the island.

The cumulative harvest rate — the percentage of tagged bears on state land — reached 17.8% by the end of the season Saturday, according to data from the state Division of Fish and Wildlife website. That figure was the highest since 2016 but was still below the 20% threshold required to prevent an extension.

The hunt will resume Wednesday and continue through Saturday with the same regulations as the shotgun session last week. Only hunters with a valid permit who did not kill a bear during the regular session can hunt during the extension, according to the DFW website.

There were 137 bears killed in Segment B of the bear hunt: 86 in Sussex County, 23 in Warren County, 15 in Morris County and 13 in Passaic County. Segment A, the archery session in October, resulted in 331 bears killed.

The DEP estimates that the black bear population in Sussex, Morris, Warren and Passaic counties has doubled in the past five years, from 1,500 in 2018 to 3,000 today. That total is expected to grow to more than 4,000 in the next two years.

""In the absence of population control measures, the rate of population growth will compound in future years as a greater number of female bears reproduce,"" the DFW said. The agency called the hunt ""the only scientifically sound method of restraining unchecked growth and dispersal."""

114,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,Judge throws out suit that tried to block changes to NJ campaign finance law,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/11/nj-campaign-finance-law-changes-lawsuit-dismissed/71772174007/,"A Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit Friday challenging the constitutionality of a recent campaign finance overhaul, brought by the former head of the elections agency that oversees the rules.

This was the second of two lawsuits filed by Jeff Brindle, the former executive director of the Election Law Enforcement Commission, or ELEC, in the past year against Gov. Phil Murphy before Brindle retired in October.

In the case filed in April and dismissed Friday, Brindle sought to block controversial sections of the Elections Transparency Act (S2866), signed into law April 3, including:

a provision that allowed Murphy to directly appoint the four members of the agency board without the advice and consent of the Senate within a temporary 90-day period.

a clause that slashed the amount of time the commission has to investigate campaign finance violations from 10 years down to two years after a violation was committed. The law made the change retroactive, clearing nearly half of the agency's caseload of allegations being investigated, including four 2017 complaints against the Democratic and Republican leadership committees.

""The legislation advanced several valid purposes that pertain directly and appropriately to its subject matter,"" wrote Judge Robert Lougy, a former acting New Jersey attorney general.

""Eliminating any ELEC commissioner vacancies and avoiding, at least for the initial appointments, any delays inevitably attendant to the nomination and advice and consent process help to enforce New Jersey's campaign finance laws, which in turn increases the trust of the public in their government,"" Lougy wrote.

He dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning Brindle cannot file the same lawsuit again.

The governor's office declined to comment on the judgment.

Appeal seen as likely

""We respectfully disagree with Judge Lougy's decision because we feel it ignores the corrupt buildup to this statute that was plainly intended to punish the former commissioners because they would not go along with the plan to force Brindle's removal,"" said Bruce Afran, Brindle's attorney.

""I don't know whether Mr. Brindle will want to appeal,"" Afran said. ""I imagine he will, because this is a significant public policy question.""

The lawsuit alleged that the Elections Transparency Act was “special legislation,” designed to target one agency for special treatment, and that the Legislature interfered with ELEC’s independent enforcement powers.

The state Attorney General’s Office asked the court to dismiss the case in September, arguing that the constitution doesn’t require ELEC members to be appointed with advice and consent of the Senate, and that because ELEC was created by the Legislature, lawmakers can change the commission as it sees fit.

“It really just boils down to — that I believe that plaintiff is alleging — that if the Legislature harbors impure thoughts when it passes a bill, therefore the law is special,” Peter Slocum, an attorney with Lowenstein Sandler arguing on behalf of the state and Murphy, said in oral arguments Friday.

“The court should not turn into an inquisitor of legislators demanding certifications or cross-examination to ask each politician why did he or she vote a particular way,” Slocum said.

Afran, Brindle’s attorney, argued that the judge couldn’t look at that law in isolation, and needed to consider “a pattern of activity in which the governor targeted Jeff Brindle for removal” after he wrote a satirical article about dark money — political spending paid for by donors whose identity is not required to be reported to the public.

Tried to get Brindle to resign

Earlier this year, three top Murphy staff members presented Brindle with a written resignation letter on the governor’s letterhead and accused him of having made an anti-gay comment, according to the lawsuit.

Brindle sent an email to a staffer on Oct. 11 in response to an announcement about National Coming Out Day, writing, “Are you coming out? No Lincoln or Washington’s Birthday’s [sic] but we can celebrate national coming out day.”

After Brindle refused to resign, Chief Ethics Officer Dominic Rota called ELEC commissioners and said he wanted Brindle fired because of an ""anti-gay"" and ""racist"" statement. The commissioners refused to take action.

In February, an amendment tucked into the proposed Elections Transparency Act gave the governor power to appoint the executive director, instead of having the four ELEC commissioners do so.

After the Senate and Assembly postponed votes on the bill days after the amendments were added, a new version of the bill allowed the governor to vacate the current ELEC board — where three commissioners were serving in holdover capacity and there was one vacancy — and allow the governor to choose the bipartisan appointments without Senate involvement for a temporary period.

“We can't ignore this pattern, which demonstrates an illicit purpose of the bill,” Afran said.

Legislation 'serves a valid purpose'

The judge wrote that ""the Court concludes that the legislation serves a valid purpose, concerns valid subjects, does not unreasonably exclude any person or entity, and employs a reasonable classification in limiting its scope to ELEC.""

Brindle filed another lawsuit in March alleging a civil rights violation against Murphy, Murphy's counsel Parimal Garg, former Chief of Staff George Helmy and Rota in a “conspiracy to extort and force” his resignation.

The lawsuit was dismissed due to a clerical error, and Afran plans to file a motion to reinstate the case."

In a social media post that announced his candidacy, Sweeney, 64, recalled his years as a union ironworker and described his inspiration to become a public servant after his daughter was born with Down syndrome.

“She was the spark, inspiring me to fight for a better NJ,” the veteran South Jersey politician wrote in his announcement post.

In a video that accompanied his announcement, Sweeney explained that he was driven to get involved in state politics after seeing just how tough it was to get support services to help his daughter.

He talked about being proud of what the state has accomplished for people with disabilities, but said that more needs to be done.

A glimpse at Sweeney's campaign priorities

Sweeney also highlighted legislation passed during his time leading the state Senate, including bills that increased New Jersey's minimum wage and expanded family leave. Still, Sweeney said, New Jersey continues to face challenges the Legislature and the next governor must tackle.

“We need a tax system that works for New Jersey families and retirees, not big corporations, a first-class education system for pre-K to 12 and a constitutional amendment to protect a woman’s reproductive freedom,” he said.

Loss to Durr acknowledged

Acknowledging the loss of his seat in the Legislature — a shocking upset in 2021 by an unknown truck driver, now state Sen. Ed Durr — Sweeney said that “sometimes in life, we face setbacks,” but he noted that New Jerseyans “get back up” and “dust ourselves off, because that’s who we are.”

Sweeney served as Senate president for 12 years. Since his loss in 2021, he has been the director of a bipartisan think tank at Rowan University. Before his time in Trenton, Sweeney was a member of the Gloucester County Board of Chosen Freeholders.

Professionally, Sweeney is an ironworker and serves as general vice president of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers, overseeing union locals in New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania.

Sweeney crossed party lines to work with former Gov. Chris Christie in 2011 to raise the retirement age and teamed up with him again to charge workers more for pensions, which brought tens of thousands of workers to protest in Trenton.

He also has released a transportation plan.

116,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,Mission to the moon: Rutgers geologist helps NASA plot future Artemis moonwalks,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2023/12/11/this-rutgers-geologist-is-plotting-future-artemis-moonwalks/71650546007/,"The email that changed professor Juliane Gross’s life hit her inbox at Rutgers University over the summer with the simple subject line: “Guys, we got it!”

“It” was an offer by NASA for Gross and colleagues at other universities to form a geology team and train the crew of astronauts who will be making the first moon landing in more than 50 years.

“We just all freaked out,” Gross said last week from Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We’re going to be part of history. This is insane.”

Gross is a member of the Artemis III team that will explore more of the lunar surface than ever before and bring back more than 200 pounds of rocks and other materials. It's an ambitious and historic mission, marking humankind's first return to the moon since the famed Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The mission may have suffered a recent problem. The Government Accountability Office said setbacks with contractors have likely pushed the mission back to 2027, a two-year delay.

Plotting out future moonwalks

Still, that hasn’t slowed the work Gross and her fellow geologists are doing in Houston.

They are developing much of the astronauts’ science activities during their moonwalks in the lunar south pole region, far from the landing spots of the six Apollo missions, the last of which was in 1972. The Artemis mission will have two astronauts land on the moon and stay for about a week.

Story continues below photo gallery.

“If you land all six of your missions in Yellowstone National Park, you’ll be able to get some really interesting geological samples, but they’re not representative of the rest of the North American continent,” said Gross, who is on leave from her teaching position at Rutgers. “You’re missing a lot of area. The same thing holds for the moon.”

More:Want to shoot the moon? Here's how you can

This region contains some of the oldest parts of the moon, estimated at almost 4 billion years old. One of the goals is to ascertain the depth, distribution and composition of ice at the south pole that could help later missions extract oxygen and hydrogen from moon ice for life support systems and fuel.

Extracting rocks in low gravity

But for now, Gross is spending long days mapping out paths the astronauts will take when they land on the surface.

They're also training the crew on what rocks to look for and how to carefully extract them. The latter is a learning curve for everyone, because the moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, the astronauts will be wearing bulky spacesuits, and even the smallest misstep can be catastrophic in what is essentially a vacuum at the lunar surface.

Gross and her team are finding ways to work around challenges that they wouldn't have in a geologic field study on Earth, such as the fact that astronauts will not be allowed to walk on a slope greater than 20 degrees for safety reasons. ""You have to tailor the plan to the environment,"" Gross said. ""And this is unlike any environment the team has ever experienced.""

When the astronauts return, Gross and the team will begin examining the samples.

The rocks will be much more than just display items at the Smithsonian. Gross calls them a ""history book"" or preserved pieces of evidence, since the moon has essentially been frozen in time with little disturbance. They can be used to find everything from how the moon formed to what produced water and ice on its surface and how long the moon has been volcanically active.

Celestial collision with Earth formed the moon

The rocks can also help scientists learn more about the history of Earth, which is intertwined with the history of the moon. Debris from a celestial collision with Earth 4.5 billion years ago likely formed the moon, according to NASA.

""It’s so great to have something in your hand that is essentially a history book,"" Gross said. ""My job is to learn how to read that book and extract all these formation and evolution stories from it.""

When Gross was growing up in Germany, her two career goals were at opposite ends of the spectrum: farmer or astronaut. Instead of toiling in the earth or blasting off from Earth, she is somewhere in a hybrid of her childhood dreams. ""This is as close to being an astronaut as you can get,"" she said.

Having already spent time in recent years at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Gross has met some of the scientists who worked on the Apollo missions a half-century ago.

""I was always jealous of them, because I didn't know if we'd ever get back to the moon,"" she said. ""But here we are. And it's so exciting because this is our Apollo."""

But, some school districts say they are still waiting for millions more in reimbursements from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The total cost for all repair projects for schools related to Hurricane Ida is approximately $42 million, said Sgt. Joseph Walsh, a spokesman for the New Jersey state Office of Emergency Management.

After the September 2021 storm, 49 schools and nine colleges and universities filed for more than $83.6 million in public assistance from the federal government to cover losses and damage. However, the number was based on preliminary damage assessments completed by the school and district officials.

The preliminary estimates did not consider reductions for insurance payments, Walsh said.

Englewood Public Schools reported the highest damage estimate at $24.2 million in November 2022. That sum represented approximately 34% of the district’s total operating budget for the 2021-2022 academic year.

The total estimated damage wound up being adjusted to $4.4 million, said Cheryl Balletto, the district’s business administrator.

The original estimate was based on the preliminary assessment the district could not reopen John Grieco Elementary School, which sustained major flood damage, Balletto said.

However, once the district had a cleanup and restoration services company come through, it was determined the building wasn’t as damaged as originally estimated. The field house and Winton White Stadium was also less damaged than originally thought, she said.

The district has received all of the $4.4 million it was expecting from FEMA, Balletto said.

Similarly, Elizabeth Public Schools had an initial damage assessment of more than $16 million for the Dr. Orlando Edreira Academy School No. 26 and Dr. Antonia Pantoja School No. 27 school. That was about 3% of the large Union County district’s operating budget at the time.

The district later adjusted its total estimated damage to about half that amount.

“The initial estimate was high due in part to the supply chain issues at the time. The damage costs were revised downward as the work was done,” said district spokesman Pat Politano.

The district received a total of $8.8 million in reimbursement, of which $7.36 million was from an insurance carrier, $1.4 million from FEMA, and an additional $900,000 from the federal government through the city of Elizabeth to cover the cost of shuttle buses for students between hotels and schools after the storm, according to Politano.

The district has been fully reimbursed for damage incurred during Ida and is not expecting additional reimbursement.

However, some school districts are still waiting to receive millions from the federal government.

Another $18 million in reimbursement requests are still undergoing final reviews by FEMA, state officials said.

Officials are also awaiting documentation for another $5 million in school repair projects before the districts can be reimbursed, said Walsh, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Management.

Cresskill Public School District in Bergen County has spent $17 million on repairs due to Hurricane Ida, according to Superintendent Peter Hughes.

The money needed to fix the damage in Cresskill was the equivalent of more than half of the small district’s yearly operating budget. Cresskill Middle/High School was the hardest hit, with widespread flooding affecting nearly every inch of the building and displacing 1,000 students in grades 6 to 12.

Students who were desperate to rejoin their classmates in-person after COVID-19 were forced to resume their coursework on Zoom, to the frustration of some parents. For 5 1/2 months, middle and high school students learned remotely, attending class in-person once a week at a local parochial school.

In mid-February 2022, students were able return to classes in-person from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Thursday after a Presbyterian church in the neighboring town of Northvale let Cresskill Public Schools use its facility for the remainder of the 2021-2022 school year at no cost.

The Cresskill Middle/High School eventually reopened on Sept. 9, 2022, over a year after Hurricane Ida made landfall.

The district has received $716,191 from FEMA for Ida-related damages, according to school officials. Cresskill’s largest application — for approximately $11.2 million to repair the middle and high school building — has not yet been “obligated” by FEMA, the superintendent said.

The obligation of funds, which means the agency commits to paying the money, is step five in FEMA’s complex seven-step reimbursement process.

Under the system, applicants must first pay for the repair work, then submit documents to prove the work was done and get the federal government to reimburse the costs, said Walsh, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Management.

Because FEMA-eligible recovery projects at schools often take months and sometimes years to complete, there is often a delay in payments, Walsh said.

There has been a delay in Cresskill getting its FEMA reimbursements partly because it had to replace essential equipment that was too costly for the district to purchase on its own, including boilers and a ventilator system that totaled more than $7 million. The district needed insurance money and help from FEMA to make the purchase.

Because the school is located in a flood zone, insurance would cover only up to $2 million of damage, school officials said.

While FEMA policy is to cover 75% of remaining costs, Cresskill Public Schools had to front the cost of repairs before seeing a penny of federal funding. It was an insurmountable amount of money for the small school district, which held up the restoration and reopening process.

“It’s no one’s fault, but it opened up a problem that exists right now — if a hurricane or damage comes to a school, there was no mechanism by which you can acquire money,” said then-Superintendent Michael Burke, who retired at the end of 2022.

After attempting multiple sources for borrowing money, the Cressskill voters approved a $21.6 million bond proposal in January 2022 so the district could place orders for the necessary equipment and begin the rebuilding.

“The district opted for short term notes over long term bonds with the assumption of FEMA reimbursements to be processed efficiently,” said Hughes. “However, to date, the district has spent $785,600 in interest financing the repairs.”

Cresskill has had to make budget cuts in order to pay the interest out of its operating fund, according to the superintendent.

“The interest may not even be reimbursable by FEMA,” said Hughes.

While FEMA says $23 million has already been paid to New Jersey educational facilities to assist with recovery efforts related to Hurricane Ida, the state Office of Emergency Management has a slightly different estimate of $19 million.

When asked why the the agencies reported different payouts, a FEMA spokesman said the state and federal government have different systems for calculating total payouts.

The alleged porch pirate, identified as Ebony Gomez, has been charged with multiple counts of theft, eluding, aggravated assault against law enforcement and endangering the welfare of a child, Gloucester Township police said in a statement.

U.S. Marshals took Gomez, of Jacksonville, Florida, into custody Monday in Monroe Township, Gloucester County, officials said. She was sent to the Camden County jail ahead of a first appearance in court. Attorney information wasn’t immediately available.

Gloucester Township police got a tip around 1:40 p.m. Friday that a vehicle being sought in package thefts a week earlier was on Jarvis Road in the township, officials said.

Police stopped the car, but the driver quickly fled. Minutes later, officers saw the car parked on nearby Parsons Court with the driver and two children inside, police said.

When an officer approached the SUV and gave the driver commands to stop, Gomez accelerated and struck the officer, authorities said. Other officers pursued the vehicle, but the chase was called off for safety reasons.

The police officer was taken to an area hospital and was in stable condition, officials said.

The suspected thief was seen on home surveillance cameras Dec. 1 and Dec. 2 stealing packages from three separate homes in the Cherrywood and Mayfair Woods developments, Gloucester Township police said.

In one incident, she knocked on a door and swiped a package, police said. When a resident confronted Gomez, she said she worked for UPS and delivered it to the wrong home.

Notorious dangling chair on way to Jersey Shore finally falls.,https://www.nj.com/cape-may-county/2023/12/chair-watch-is-over-notorious-dangling-chair-on-way-to-jersey-shore-finally-falls.html,"The notorious chair perilously perched on the edge of a weather-beaten New Jersey home for years and the main star of the popular “Chair Watch” Facebook group has finally fallen to the combination of gusty winds and gravity.

The news was reported like a doctor may pronounce the time of death.

“Chair is down 7:10 a.m.,” wrote one member of the “Chair Watch” Facebook group, an 11,900-member strong following dedicated to keeping an eye on the mysterious chair turned roadside attraction on the much-traveled Route 47 path to Jersey Shore communities in Cape May County.

“Glad it came to a natural end and the chair came down due to the forces of nature in a storm,” said Tony DiMeglio, who created the “Chair Watch” Facebook group after driving past the house during his regular trips to the beach. “But sad the whole thing that grew way out of proportion is over.”

Over the years, beachgoers stuck in traffic in Dennis Township have become captivated by the miscellaneous furniture and personal belongings that lay untouched on the home’s top floor, which can be seen from the roadway after a storm tore its roof off.

Amid all the visible appliances and old clothes, one item in particular stood out — an impossibly balanced chair perched on the very edge of the decaying floorboards on top of the house.

The chair was perched on just a few inches of splintered wood, but somehow withstood nor’easters, snowstorms and summer thunderstorms without so much as a wobble.

That is, until Monday, when the chair roofline was minus its most famous resident.

“It probably blew down in the storm, it was raining a lot last night,” said Mike, the property’s current owner, who asked that his last name not be used. “That chair was on the edge. I have no idea how it stayed up as long as it did.”

Mike is a fisherman who does not use the house, but uses the surrounding property as a work site. The chair fell as Mike was due to demolish the home.

The 1940s home located near the Pinelands National Reserve in Cape May County is a relic of its previous owner’s life, mostly untouched since a fire broke out on the third floor in the late 1970s.

The home was further damaged when a massive storm in 2020 tore the roof clean off, leaving all of its forgotten contents exposed, said Mike.

The chair caught the attention of people crawling by the property on their commute to work or the Jersey Shore, he said.

Lots of people have pulled over to take photos with the house over the years. Mike said someone recently took a photo of outside the home in a Santa costume. Some have even filmed their own YouTube videos about the property.

While it can be odd to have visitors ogling his property, Mike said, “everyone’s been respectful.”

Given the public interest in the chair, Mike said he always intended to retrieve it before beginning demolition.

When asked about rumors of auctioning the chair off to raise money for a local cause, Mike said he had not yet been contacted regarding any plans, but would be open to the idea.

“I’m not looking to get anything out of it, I’m looking for other people to get enjoyment out of it and for our community of Dennis to benefit,” he said. “Because the whole thing has never been about me, it’s been about the chair.”

134,[New Jersey] https://www.nj.com/,2 N.J. men charged for role in dog fighting ring that was livestreamed,https://www.nj.com/news/2023/12/2-nj-men-charged-for-role-in-dog-fighting-ring-that-was-livestreamed.html,"Federal authorities announced charges Monday against two South Jersey men allegedly involved in a dog-fighting operation in which the suspects livestreamed dog fights, shared videos training dogs to fight, and filmed the killing of “underperforming dogs.”

Tommy J. Watson, 43, of Clayton and Johnnie Lee Nelson, 34, of Bridgeton, violated the Animal Welfare Act by fighting, training, transporting and possessing pit bull-type dogs, from August 2017 through March 2019, according to charging documents from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

The pair operated a dog-fighting venture called “From Da Bottom Kennels,” which posted bloodline information of fighting dogs owned by the kennel on the dog fighting website “Peds Online,” charging documents allege.

READ MORE: Sick puppies. Healthy profits.

Watson and Nelson worked with others to develop and maintain “properties for housing and training pit bull-type dogs for use in dog fights, and for using and storing dog fighting equipment,” according to the state.

They also acquired and maintained medical equipment, including skin staplers, suture removers and veterinary injectable medications, for the purpose of attempting to treat dogs injured during dog fights, in order to avoid a veterinarian, prosecutors allege.

The men communicated using the “DMV Board” on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app that allows users to send messages, create groups and send videos.

Watson, also known as “Snakes,” and Nelson, who also goes by “Johnny,” used the Telegram group to transmit videos of live dog fights, of training dogs for fights, and of the killing of underperforming fighting dogs, including by hanging, according to charging documents.

The men often filmed dog fights at an auto repair garage located on Center Road in Upper Deerfield Township in Cumberland County, authorities said. Over the years, they worked to evade authorities.

On March 23, 2019, a co-conspirator placed a 911 call, falsely reporting a robbery at a business near the auto repair garage, for the purpose of attempting to divert police from the dog fight, prosecutors allege.

Through the scheme, the men “sought to enrich themselves by placing wagers on dog fights, taking steps to collect bets, collecting bets, and distributing proceeds,” prosecutors allege.

Watson is facing additional charges under the Animal Welfare Act for fighting two pit bull-type dogs in dog fights on Dec. 2, 2018. He is also charged with transporting a third dog, Rambo, along with do-it-yourself veterinary equipment, for a dog fight law enforcement prevented from occurring on March 23, 2019.

At that location, law enforcement discovered, concealed in a car, two other dogs that had already fought, according to the U.S District Attorney’s office. Both Watson and Nelson are charged with possessing and training Rambo for the March 23 fight.

Watson is also charged with one count of possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.

Watson surrendered to authorities Monday, officials said. Nelson was arrested Dec. 5.

A judge also ordered Erich A. Bennett, 47, to surrender all his guns and issued a permanent restraining order that bans him from ever contacting the victim, the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office said. Bennett will also have to pay about $4,800 in restitution and can never again hold a publicly funded job.

The victim appeared at Bennett’s sentencing on Friday and read a statement.

“This defendant swore an oath to keep the public safe from individuals capable of the type of conduct he ultimately committed, marking an egregious betrayal of the public’s trust,” Monmouth County Prosecutor Raymond Santiago said. “We strongly commend the victim’s courage and fortitude in this matter.”

Bennett pleaded guilty in the summer to computer theft, criminal mischief, hindering apprehension and stalking.

He was originally charged with a pattern of official misconduct, two counts of official misconduct, two counts of computer theft, criminal mischief, making terroristic threats, cyber harassment, hindering apprehension, identity theft and stalking.

Court documents filed in support of those charges detailed multiple allegations of harassment and threats, including a time in December 2022 in which he threatened to attack her with a knife.

Bennett also assumed a fake identity on Facebook and sent her threatening messages advising his former girlfriend to stay out of Sea Bright, authorities said.

Bennett and the woman broke up in October 2022, then briefly reconciled before the woman again ended the relationship after Thanksgiving, authorities said.

He began texting her on Nov. 28 and showed up unannounced at her home in a nearby town on Dec. 5, when he threatened to slash her, authorities said.

The woman blocked Bennett on social media and had security cameras installed on her property. She also obtained a restraining order against him, authorities said.

The Facebook messages from the fake account began in January and Bennett drove by the woman’s home in a Sea Bright police vehicle despite being warned by his sergeant to avoid contact, authorities said in the court documents. The next day, her vehicle was keyed, her tires were slashed and the security cameras were disabled, authorities said.

Investigators got a search warrant to check Bennett’s phone and found he was on her street around the time someone tampered with the cameras, authorities said.

On Jan. 16, Sea Bright Police Chief Brett Friedman called Bennett into his office and asked if he slashed the woman’s tires.

Bennett responded that “he would not be seen doing that as he had moved the cameras,” court documents said. Bennett also admitted to threatening to slash the woman but claimed he was “joking.”

Bennett accessed police databases on more than 30 occasions between October 2022 and January to find personal identifying information on the woman’s acquaintances, authorities said.

The databases are to be used for official police business only, officials said.

Bennett, of Sea Bright, was suspended without pay from his job after being charged. Hired as a police officer in 2002 he was paid $119,318 per year, according to state pension records.

Spencer Finch took the witness stand for a second day in state Superior Court in Passaic County, charged with striking Brandon Cosby 14 times with an oversized flashlight and then kneeing him in the face after he was in handcuffs. Finch and another Paterson police officer, Edwin Martinez, were responding to a domestic violence call at an Atlantic Street apartment building on the night of May 26, 2021.

Under questioning from defense attorney Eric Kleiner, Finch told the jury he encountered an “enraged” Cosby in the hallway, who clenched his fists as if readying for a fight. Video from a hallway security camera showed Finch as he fell to the floor as he and Martinez grappled with the suspect. Finch then picked his flashlight up off the floor and beat Cosby with it.

“I was trying to get him on the ground,” Finch said of the 14 blows he delivered to Cosby’s head, shoulders and back. After Cosby was in handcuffs and on the floor, video from Martinez’s body camera shows Finch kneeing Cosby in the face.

“He wasn’t subdued,” Finch said. “He was still fighting.”

Finch told the jury that he kneed Cosby to make sure he didn’t try to get up again. Finch said after Cosby was seated on the floor in handcuffs, he felt Cosby’s leg press against his, and he thought the suspect was trying to get to his feet to escape.

“He was attempting to get up, move, get away from us,” Finch told the jury, adding that he put his knee to the suspect’s face “to stop him.”

Cosby was arrested and taken to St. Joseph’s Regional Medical Center, where he was treated for bruises. Police charged him with aggravated assault on a police officer, resisting arrest and making terroristic threats against a woman at the apartment building who is the mother of his two children.

All criminal charges against Cosby were later dropped. Cosby has filed a civil suit against the Paterson Police Department and is seeking damages.

Finch, a 17-year veteran of the Paterson police force, was fired after he was charged and later indicted for aggravated assault, possession of weapon for an unlawful purpose, perjury, falsifying public records, and official misconduct.

Six months before the incident, then Paterson Police Chief Mike Bakora issued an order that limited the size of police flashlights to 8 inches. But Finch told the jury the regulation wasn’t enforced, so he kept carrying the same flashlight he had used on the job for 17 years.

Finch, who is testifying on his own behalf, told the jury that he had saved lives using a bigger flashlight. He said the heavier flashlight was better at breaking car windows at accident scenes, and more effective in giving chest rubs to people who overdosed on drugs.

Finch is expected back on the witness stand on Tuesday to finish his direct testimony. After that, he will face cross-examination by Assistant Prosecutor Peter Foy.

Officers from the Elizabeth Police Department responded at 5:42 a.m. to a call reporting the sound of gunfire in the area of Fourth and Center Streets in the city, according to a statement from the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office, which is investigating the incident.

The officers briefly followed a vehicle of interest, which then collided with a taxi at the intersection of Grand Street and Routes 1 and 9, the office said. The taxi driver and a female passenger, who was the only other person inside the cab, died in the crash.

Neither the driver nor the passenger were identified Monday night.

Two of the three occupants of the other vehicle were arrested and later hospitalized with injuries that were deemed non-life-threatening, authorities said. A third person exited the car, left the scene on foot and remained at large Monday night.

The occupants of the car were not identified, and it was unclear what charges, if any, they were facing.

The incident was still being probed by the state attorney general’s office, which investigates any time a person dies during an encounter with police or while police are involved in a pursuit of any type.

Once the investigation is completed, the findings will be presented to a grand jury to determine if the evidence supports the return of an indictment against the officers involved.

“The Union County Prosecutor’s Office is also investigating potential criminal conduct pertaining to the fatal accident and events preceding it,” the attorney general’s office said.

171,[North Carolina] https://carolinapublicpress.org/recent-news/,Habitat in Virginia turns to 3D printing. Would it work in NC?,https://carolinapublicpress.org/62458/habitat-for-humanity-3d-printing-charlotte-nc/,"By Lexi Wilson, WCNC Charlotte

CHARLOTTE — During the 2023 Local News Impact Summit, presented by the Charlotte Journalism Collaborative, housing advocates, community leaders, nonprofit organizations and local journalists focused on current trends in affordable housing and the potential solutions that exist.

During the summit, Charlotte’s affordable housing leaders posed the question, can Charlotte use 3D printing?

These days, the technology behind 3D printing is being tapped to create more affordable housing.

In 2021, a Virginia family got the keys to Habitat for Humanity’s first 3D-printed home in the nation, and now they’re building two more.

Their goal is to use the technology to make building quicker and cheaper.

“If we can build faster, we can create more affordable housing for these families with low to moderate income,” Janet V. Green, CEO of Habitat for Humanity Peninsula and Greater Williamsburg in Virginia, said.

The 3D printer looks like a giant robot. It builds the wall system of a home with a concrete mixture. Traditional construction is used for other things like the roof, wiring, and plumbing.

Green said printing the walls is faster than wood framing.

“We think this reduced our standard construction schedule by at least four weeks using this innovative technology,” Green said.

WCNC Charlotte’s Lexi Wilson went to Bob Glusenkamp, senior VP of construction operations for Habitat for Humanity of the Charlotte Region, to see whether this could be a solution to adding more affordable housing in Charlotte.

“One of the big challenges is that not all of the code officials have been exposed to it yet, so it’s not really in our North Carolina building code,” Glusenkamp said.

He said like any new building material or building technology, people in the industry have to get used to it and right now, it’s still new — and printers of this size are few and far between. But there’s hope one day, 3D printing will become mainstream in Charlotte.

“I think it will be part of the future of all Habitat affiliates in the U.S., it just needs to get more affordable and produce at a large enough scale that we can all use it,” Glusenkamp said.

Right now, there is also a labor shortage of construction workers. Green said adding 3D printing as another tool for creating housing opens the door for the next generation to get involved in construction.

“I like to say my grandson has no desire to work in the construction industry but he’s good with technology, so he was very interested in this,” Green said. “So we are hoping this gets people more involved in the labor force of how to build homes differently.”

Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its historic assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier around the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history. Traders earned millions anticipating the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, a study found.

Choose your plan ArrowRight For civilians in Gaza, there’s increasingly nowhere to go. Israel’s campaign against the militant group Hamas has already driven out most of the population in the territory’s north, turning some of the densest urban areas on the planet into hollowed-out moonscapes. The focus has shifted to the south, where battles are intensifying around the city of Khan Younis, forcing hundreds of thousands more Palestinian civilians to flee their homes.

Israel has killed more than 18,000 people in Gaza since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants operating in the enclave carried out an unprecedented strike on southern Israeli towns and kibbutzim, marking the bloodiest day in the history of the Jewish state. Even according to Israeli analyses, civilians, mostly women and children, may account for some two-thirds of that Palestinian death toll.

Roughly 1.9 million people in Gaza, or 85 percent of the territory’s population per United Nations data, are displaced. They are being crammed into facilities and spaces that cannot accommodate them close to adequately. Sanitation conditions are deplorable, clean water is difficult to find, disease is spreading, and hunger is rife. An analysis by the U.N. World Food Program found that half the population of Gaza is starving and 9 out of 10 people cannot eat every day. Aid workers operating in a tiny stretch of bare land by the sea known as al-Mawasi, where Israeli authorities urged Palestinians to go for safety, said they encountered people who had not eaten for three days.

U.N. officials across the organization’s agencies say the ongoing fighting prevents them from doing their jobs and providing critical humanitarian relief. The infrastructure that existed in the Gaza Strip has almost wholly collapsed. Health care in the territory is “on its knees,” World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned Sunday, as supplies and hospital beds dwindle rapidly amid reports of bombardments around medical facilities.

At a regional forum in Doha, Qatar, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres warned of the possibility of mass displacement into Egypt. “There is no effective protection of civilians in Gaza,” he said. “I expect public order to completely break down soon, and an even worse situation could unfold.”

But to many in the Arab world, the idea of a Palestinian exodus pouring into Sinai is a nonstarter. For weeks, Arab governments have rejected the prospect of taking in refugees from Gaza — partially because of economic and security considerations, but primarily out of fear that Palestinians who flee Gaza will not be allowed to return. Given the 75-year history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, their concerns are not without credence. Numerous Gazans speaking to journalists say they would rather die in their own land than leave for a life in indefinite exile, a fate that has befallen generations of Palestinians elsewhere.

Some Arab officials accuse the Israelis of deliberately engineering this outcome. “What we are seeing in Gaza is not just simply the killing of innocent people and the destruction of their livelihoods, but a systematic effort to empty Gaza of its people,” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said over the weekend, arguing that Israel’s conduct of the war was “within the legal definition of genocide.”

In an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, noted how many U.N. member states, including the United States, are adamantly opposed to the forcible displacement of Gazans out of the Gaza Strip. “But the developments we are witnessing point to attempts to move Palestinians into Egypt, regardless of whether they stay there or are resettled elsewhere,” he added.

Israeli officials deny these claims. “There is not, never was and never will be an Israeli plan to move the residents of Gaza to Egypt,” a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Ministry told reporters. “This is simply not true.”

Aware of the chatter, Egyptian officials have issued their own stern warnings. “It is not the way to deal with the conflict,” Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said at a panel event in Washington last week. “Palestinian civilians should not be penalized and should not leave their territory.” In private, Egypt has communicated that a wave of Palestinian refugees entering its territory would lead to “a rupture” in relations with Israel, according to Axios’s Barak Ravid.

Egypt’s championing of Gaza’s plight has also buoyed support for President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi during a three-day presidential election that began Sunday. Victory for the coup-plotting strongman is not in doubt, but the crisis next door has helped shift voter concerns away from the country’s dismal economic situation and toward Palestinian suffering.

On Monday, a delegation of a dozen U.N. Security Council ambassadors went to the Egyptian side of Gaza’s Rafah border crossing to better understand the depths of the humanitarian calamity unfolding. “The reality is even worse than what words can speak,” Ecuador’s U.N. representative, Jose De La Gasca, told reporters after attending a briefing.

The envoys’ visit came after the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution Friday that was otherwise backed by 13 of the body’s 15 members, calling for an immediate cease-fire. The move intensified scrutiny on the Biden administration’s approach to the crisis, which involves shielding Israel from international censure and supporting its military with arms while privately cajoling Israeli counterparts to limit civilian harm in their campaign against Hamas.

On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered a curiously elliptical rebuke of Israel. “I think the intent is there” to ensure civilian safety, Blinken told CNN, speaking of Israel’s actions, “but the results are not always manifesting themselves.”

Other top diplomats are mincing their words less. “This is a war that cannot be won,” Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister, said at the forum in Qatar. “Israel has created an amount of hatred that will haunt this region, that will define generations to come.”"

Dear Amy: My best friend of many years, “Alexis,” dated married guys for years during her young adult life, basically pulverizing several marriages. This behavior continued during the early years of her own marriage. Our group of girlfriends has tried to “right her ship” throughout these years. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Last week I learned during a group dinner that Alexis had an affair with my former boyfriend “Sam” while he and I were together. Sam and I shared a significant long-term relationship. It sounds like their affair lasted for several months. During my dating years with Sam, Alexis constantly pressured me to drop him. I did not know why at the time, but now I wonder if she had an agenda.

To be honest, I am less mad at him and absolutely furious with Alexis now. This feels traitorous. After I asked her to detail this affair, she admitted to it and downplayed it. She then attempted to gaslight me by saying that I was jealous and overreacting. My biggest takeaway: I watched her wreck other marriages, but somehow never thought she would harm ME.

If Alexis had admitted to this, apologized and asked for forgiveness, I would definitely get there, but she says she has nothing to apologize for, is being flippant with me and is telling others in our social group that I must be a nut case, because this was YEARS ago and thus too infantile to discuss. Yes, I am angry, and this is NEW information for me! I loved the guy, and Alexis knew it! Where do I go from here?

— Betrayed

Betrayed: From here, you should go to your room, your car, your treadmill, your coffee shop or any place where you go to lick your wounds, ponder the events of your life, and attempt to make sense of things. Yes, this is brand new information for you, and your reaction to this revelation seems completely rational.

You have also identified your own hubris in believing this best friend would carom her way through other relationships and marriages like the giant boulder in “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” while also believing that you, like Indiana Jones, could somehow successfully outrun her.

Yes, best friends trust one another. This basically defines the sort of intimate friendship you and Alexis have shared. I would characterize her friendship style as scorched earth. In my opinion, no one gets to brand an upset and struggling person as a “nut case” with no consequences. Once you clarify your own feelings, decide what those consequences will be.

Dear Amy: After they had arrived at our home for a scheduled visit of several days, our friends told us about a bedbug infestation in their apartment. I think it rude and inconsiderate not to give us the heads up before their visit so we could decide whether we wanted to risk a visit with them. I prefer to no longer be friends with them. Am I overreacting?

— Itching to Know

Share this article Share

Itching to Know: I do not know if this is a friendship ender (that is up to you), but I completely agree with you that these friends should have given you advance notice and lots of reassurance that this infestation had been completely dealt with. Unfortunately, bedbugs do seem to travel aboard soft-sided suitcases and duffel bags. They can live for up to a year.

Now that I (and scores of readers) are experiencing a case of sympathetic itching, I highly suggest that you do some research on how to check for bedbugs, perform a thorough scan of your own place, then make your decision about this friendship.

Dear Amy: My wife and I eat out at restaurants frequently. I know the waitstaff rely on tips as part of their compensation. I often tip between 30 percent and 50 percent of the bill. I think this is generous and should be acknowledged by the server.

Just a simple “thank you” would suffice. My wife says it is my choice to tip generously and I should not expect a thank you. With all the discussions on tipping lately, I think it is a two-way street, and a good tip deserves a thank you.

— Unappreciated Tipper

Unappreciated Tipper: It may overall be good for business if a server noticed your generous tip and responded by saying, “I am happy you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to seeing you again!” but the server may not see the amount of the tip right away, or they may have been trained not to comment on tips to the customer."

Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: How can I find a “family of choice”? I’m divorced. The marriage was, if not downright abusive, extremely damaging. Yes, I’m in therapy, and yes, choosing that marriage was just the tip of the iceberg. That I am gainfully employed, and fairly well-liked, and not a bitter human being is something of a miracle. I honestly think reading a lot as a child saved me.

I don’t have much family left: a brother I like but with whom I have little in common except genes. We are on friendly terms, but not at all close.

The marriage left me with no support system, so I am carefully rebuilding one. The thing is, all of my new friends have complete lives and families. They don’t need to ask people outside of their family circle for help. Any time I need a second pair of hands for something, I have to make an ask, and I fear burdening people. How can I build a network around me and not feel like a leech?

— Rebuilding

Rebuilding: So, I’m thinking as I read this about suggesting X, then Y, then Z, and now I think your best approach is all of them. Or 10 approaches, or however many you have the energy for, to maximize your exposure to potential connections, since only some will pay off.

That can include even the friends who don’t “need” people outside their family circles. For one, it's not all about need for help (see next paragraph), and for the other, you are in a perfect position to know that a life that appears complete from the outside can be different from the inside, or in an instant.

Too vulture-y. Sorry.

Point is to work on your relationships for the sake of them — as social exchanges, lunch or coffee or walks or listening to live music or whatever connection develops organically — without assuming any outcome besides company. You’re right not to overload anyone, but I think even more important is the giving of your friendship for the sake of it. Meetings for a cause or organization, classes, or some other regular proximity to others can stand in as the “give” in the give-and-take you want.

Also, don't assume you're not wanted in “complete” circles. People tend to be inclusive but don’t always notice opportunities, or don’t know they need you till they know.

Readers’ thoughts:

· There are plenty of weekends where my husband just wants to sit around the house, and my kids all have plans with their friends, and I feel really lonely and long for the days of youth when a friend would say, “Hey, do you want to go to Target with me?” Please ask people to do things with you. You might be doing them a favor, too.

· I felt like the only single, family-less person I knew, and made a Meetup group for single people (not for dating). I made GREAT friends. There’s more of you out there!

· A lot of your friends who have “complete” circles can easily expand that circle to fit one more. Give warmly and be present, and see what develops. If it turns out not to work, that’s fine — you’ve still built some connections, and you can keep meeting new people you may mesh more closely with."

Dear Miss Manners: I am in a pickle. Every year, my family hosts a formal, multiple-course Christmas dinner for our closest friends. We are limited to nine couples at the table. We usually have more friends than we have seats. We request RSVPs early so we can invite other couples in case somebody cannot make it.

This year, we invited two new couples (having to remove two couples who attended prior). One of them replied that just one person is attending because her significant other will not be around. What do I do now? Throw the party even though she will be the only “solo” person, or explain it is a couples party and move to the next couple?

What you can do is to rid yourself of the concept of a “couples party.” Miss Manners doubts you are playing bridge on Christmas and can think of no other decent activity that requires guests to attend in pairs.

Dear Miss Manners: When I refer to doctors, whether in an email or in person, I use “Dr.” and their last names, as I assume most people do. What is the proper way of addressing a nurse, nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant?

They have all put a lot of effort into earning their degrees, but “Physician’s Assistant Smith” seems awkward, and the usual “Ms./Mr.” does not acknowledge their degrees at all. Even though they want to call me by my first name, I prefer not to do the same. Would Miss Manners offer a solution?

“Physician’s assistant” only sounds awkward until everybody gets used to it. The profession ought to be teaching them to do so. On a letter, you could put “P.A.” Miss Manners is less interested in professionals displaying what degrees they earned than she is in patients knowing where they are in the medical hierarchy.

Badges and explanations help, but a title establishes the answer to, “Who is this person in the examining room?” First names are not the solution for anyone involved in this situation. When you are concerned about your health, you want a skilled professional, not a new friend. And when you are wearing a hospital gown, you are in severe need of whatever dignity an impersonal, professional attitude can confer.

Dear Miss Manners: I am a receptionist at a surgical center who checks in many patients each day. On occasion, the person I check in turns out to be a doctor and often becomes offended that I do not address them as “Dr.” rather than by their name.

There is not any indication of their profession on their licenses or insurance cards (I have checked!), and that is usually the only information I have about them, so I am unsure how they think I would know. These doctors get so upset and it sets us off on the wrong foot. Do you have any advice for how to repair the unavoidable insult?

Are they really that haughty as to assume you would recognize their status without any documentation or other signs? Just by the authoritative aura they admit you have not insulted these people. It is only necessary to say, “Yes, doctor.” And Miss Manners hopes that they address you formally as well.

PHILADELPHIA — Here are a couple of images that burned into the retinas of the Washington Wizards on Monday night during the team’s third meeting with the Philadelphia 76ers — without looking at the score. Uncover your Newsprint: Find out what your 2023 reading says about you. ArrowRight First, a hulking Joel Embiid walking — no lumbering — down the court to join his team on offense. The proceedings necessitated such a lack of urgency that he might as well have been moving backward. This was at the end of the first quarter.

Second, the Wells Fargo Center scoreboard, which showed the home team with 19 of the game’s first 21 points. Finally, a first-half stat sheet, which offered this gem: 17 first-half field goals for the visitors compared with 14 first-half three-pointers for the 76ers.

That’s pretty much how things went in a 146-101 Wizards loss, Washington’s worst defeat since a 47-point rout by the Utah Jazz more than six years ago. It was their fifth straight loss.

At least at the home of “The Process,” Washington (3-19) might be able to take inspiration from this Philadelphia organization, which suffered through sub-20-win seasons nearly a decade ago at the start of their rebuild before Embiid took the court.

“Coach used to tell us, ‘Put in work, and good days add up,’ ” said Philadelphia’s Robert Covington, a veteran of the worst of those Process years. “Sometimes it’s going to be ugly, but you can’t let the ugliness get to you. I’ve been on that side. Winning 10, 18 games, 28 games [a season]? You’ve got to weather the storm. You can’t get caught up in the losing aspect; it’s about, are we getting better?”

Covington, who had practice perfecting his positive attitude amid multiple depressing seasons, can say that now, with his team improving to 15-7 and near the top of the Eastern Conference.

The Wizards, understandably, are still working on it.

Washington was without starting center Daniel Gafford (hip contusion) on Monday, leaving veteran big man Mike Muscala to fill in at the five spot. The Wizards mixed up their defenses against Embiid and crew but were rattled early when Philadelphia decided it wanted to make up for its 0-for-13 start from the three-point line from Wednesday’s game (also a 76ers win) at Capital One Arena. The 76ers hit four straight from deep to open the game and led 14-0 after two minutes and 19-2 less than four minutes in.

“We’re all human. You can be frustrated; that’s fine. But how do you respond to that? That’s the question, in my opinion,” Coach Wes Unseld Jr. said. “We didn’t respond well enough.”

There was nothing the overmatched Wizards could do to slow Philadelphia. Embiid rattled off 34 points in 30 minutes, a conservative output considering he scored 48 against Washington on Nov. 6 and 50 on Wednesday. Tyrese Maxey had 24 points in 25 minutes and was responsible for five of the 76ers’ 20 three-pointers.

Although it seemed as if they never missed — the 76ers shot 54.7 percent from the field — they still managed to outrebound Washington 47-44.

The Wizards showed their frustration as much as they have all season. A horde of downtrodden faces marched to the locker room at halftime, and Corey Kispert took his anger out by bouncing the ball harder than he needed to during timeouts. It wasn’t much by way of emotion, largely because this locker room understands the situation and knows the front office is building for the long term. Kyle Kuzma was still the first to run off the bench late in the fourth quarter to greet his teammates.

But you can only swallow pride for so long. Philadelphia led by 47 points early in the fourth quarter.

“I mean, when you get your face beat in by 50, it’s never fun,” Kuzma said. “It’s been like a recurring theme for us all year. Something’s got to change.”

Kuzma led Washington with 21 points and nine rebounds, and Jordan Poole had 11 points. Rookie Bilal Coulibaly added 13 points, eight rebounds and four assists off the bench before he joined his teammates in the locker room postgame, where his was one of many sullen faces."

Before Earth had biology, it had chemistry. How the one followed from the other — how a bunch of boring molecules transformed themselves into this special thing we call life — is arguably the greatest unknown in science. It’s also a big reason NASA sent a robotic spacecraft, OSIRIS-REx, on a multiyear journey around the sun to fetch some crumbly material from an ancient asteroid named Bennu and then bring it back to Earth.

On Monday, the scientific community got its first description of that precious, exotic stuff, revealed by the mission’s top scientist, Dante Lauretta, at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.

Lauretta, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona, showed slides with a long list of intriguing molecules, including carbon-based organics, in the grains and pebbles retrieved from Bennu. They will shine light on the molecular building blocks of the solar system and “maybe — still early phase — maybe insights into the origin of life.”

Advertisement

This analysis has only just started. The team has not yet released a formal scientific paper. In his lecture, Lauretta cited one interesting triangular, light-colored stone, which he said contained something he’d never seen before in a meteorite.

“It’s a head-scratcher right now. What is this material?” he said.

In an interview after the lecture, Lauretta said almost 5 percent of the sample is carbon. “That is a very carbon-rich sample — the richest we have in all our extraterrestrial material. … We’re still unraveling the complex organic chemistry, but it looks promising to really understand: Did these carbon-rich asteroids deliver fundamental molecules that may have gone on to contribute to the origin of life?”

The laboratory analysis is searching for other molecules and compounds important to life on Earth, such as amino acids, lipids, sugars and the bases of the genetic code, Lauretta said, adding that the results so far are exciting. The team is still refining its report, which will be discussed at a scientific meeting early next year, he said.

NASA chose to send a probe to Bennu in part because it is potentially the most dangerous asteroid in the solar system. Its orbit around the sun is similar to that of Earth. Every six years the rock, which is about three-tenths of a mile in diameter (large enough to get your attention, but not nearly big enough to deliver an extinction-level impact) crosses our planet’s orbital path.

A calculation published in 2021 estimated that Bennu has a 1-in-2,700 chance of slamming into Earth in September 2182. That estimate will be refined after the asteroid makes a close pass in 2135.

On the very off chance that earthlings will want to knock the rock off course, they’d definitely like to know precisely what they’re hitting. A telescope doesn’t deliver as much information as a robotic visitor. Hence, OSIRIS-REx (which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security – Regolith Explorer).

Even before the scientists began analyzing the samples, one thing had been firmly established: Bennu is very, very black.

“It’s super black. It’s so black it’s hard to take a picture of,” project scientist Jason Dworkin said in advance of the meeting. The material includes “all kinds of different shades of black” — plus mysterious glints of yellow and red and pink, he added.

A career’s worth of material

NASA launched the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft in 2016, and it reached Bennu in 2018. In 2020 it performed a series of delicate maneuvers to touch the asteroid with a sampling device on the end of a robotic arm. The arm plunged unexpectedly deep into the asteroid, which turned out to be what scientists call a rubble pile, made of loosely aggregated material held together by gravity.

The spacecraft then returned to the vicinity of Earth and released a capsule containing the sample. On Sept. 24 it landed almost perfectly on target on a military bombing and training range in western Utah. The capsule showed no sign of stress from its long voyage and, indeed, sat upright on the desert floor just a few convenient paces from a road.

Share this article Share

The carefully sealed capsule was then transported to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Next came the very delicate work of retrieving the material from Bennu. Inside the capsule was a canister that, in turn, held a sampling device. The canister was opened, but the sampling device proved uncooperative. It was sealed by 35 specially designed fasteners, two of which wouldn’t budge.

NASA is designing a new tool that should get the job done in coming weeks. In the meantime, according to a NASA blog post, the sampling device has been transferred to another container and is “surrounded by a sealed Teflon bag to make sure the sample is kept safe in a stable, nitrogen-rich, environment.”

Still, no one panicked: A member of the team realized that it would be possible, using tweezers and scoops, to retrieve some of the trapped material from inside the device. As a result, the team obtained 70 grams of sample, exceeding the official mission requirement of 60 grams.

“This is a career’s worth of material for thousands of researchers all over the world. So we’re ecstatic,” Lauretta said. “I fully expect the cosmochemistry community is going to go to town on this.”

“We’re getting a lot of information from a very small amount of sample,” NASA astrobiologist Danny Glavin said in advance of the meeting.

Looking for life

Bennu is a fragment of a larger object that was shattered during a collision early in the history of the solar system, scientists believe. The parent body, heated by radioactive decay, would have been warm enough for interior water to be in liquid form.

“If you add water, you can do a lot of interesting chemistry,” Glavin said.

It is not prejudicial to say that chemistry gets more interesting when it somehow produces a living thing. Paleobiologists know that life existed on Earth, as bacteria, at least 3.5 billion years ago — relatively soon after the planet survived a long period of violent bombardment from rocks that cluttered the solar system in its youth.

It’s unlikely that Bennu’s parent body had anything alive in it, but it may have cooked up interesting compounds akin to the ones that formed the building blocks of life on Earth, which, as Dworkin put it, “had to have started with chemistry that happens in space.”

Prebiotic chemistry, however, is a long way from a bacterium — “about as far as a bottle of vitamins from Thanksgiving dinner,” Dworkin said.

This space dirt has astrobiological import, though. By looking at prebiotic chemistry on Bennu, scientists will have a better idea what they are looking at if and when they find suspicious molecules elsewhere in the solar system, such as on Mars, Jupiter’s moon Europa or Saturn’s moon Enceladus.

“This is almost the perfect laboratory control from non-biological chemistry,” Glavin said. “This better prepares us for our search for life on Mars, or Europa or Enceladus — places that might have had life at one point.”"
179,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Climate talks enter last day with no agreement in sight on fossil fuels,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/climate-talks-enter-last-day-with-no-agreement-in-/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Hopes for finishing a critical climate summit on time were fading early Tuesday as countries were still far apart on key issues, including an agreement on what to do about the fossil fuels that are causing dangerous global warming.

The United Nations-led summit known as COP28 was scheduled to end around midday after nearly two weeks of speeches, demonstrations and negotiations. But the climate talks often run long, and Monday’s release of a draft agreement angered countries that insist on a commitment for rapid phase-out of coal, oil and gas.

Instead, the draft called for countries to reduce “consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner.”

Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, ridiculed the document as “a meaningless wish list” that “questions the science” and said it doesn’t address the Paris agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Earth is on its way to smashing the record for hottest year, endangering human health and leading to ever more costly and deadly extreme weather.

“There is no justice in a result from this COP that condemns my country’s future,” said Stege, whose country is one of the many island nations most at risk from rising seas.

Europeans also pushed for a stronger document.

“It is difficult to come to a result here by midday (Tuesday),” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. “This is not a problem for the European delegation. We have time and we are prepared to stay a little longer.“

Bangladesh climate envoy Saber Chowdhury said a revised text would be presented Tuesday morning that takes into account the comments from the many participants .

“It’ll be new. To what extent it’s improved remains to be seen,” he said shortly after discussions ended at around 2 a.m. on Tuesday.

Final decisions by COPs have to be by consensus. Activists said they feared that potential objections from major oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia, had watered down the text. The head of OPEC, the powerful oil cartel, was reported to have written to member countries last week urging them to block any language to phase out or phase down fossil fuels.

Saudi Arabia’s Noura Alissa said the deal “must work for all.”

“It must be relevant, it must make to sense to accelerate action for every single country in this room, not some over others,” she said.

Some developing nations resisted a fossil-fuel phaseout on the grounds that it was unfair for wealthy nations, after centuries of using and profiting from coal, oil and gas, to deny them the same.

That included Botswana, whose environment minister, Philda Nani Kereng, said her country is “still, you know, exploiting natural resources for economic development, for livelihood improvement, for job creation and so forth.”

It’s important that any agreement is “not going to sort of stop us from developing our people,” she said.

China and U.S., the world’s two biggest sources of planet-warming emissions, both spoke against the draft text.

Zhao Yingmin, China’s vice minister for Ecology and Environment, said at the meeting that “the draft fails to address the concerns of developing countries on some key issues” and in particular the idea that greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025.

United States climate envoy John Kerry said the language on fossil fuels in the text “does not meet the test” of keeping 1.5 alive.

“I, like most of you here, refuse to be part of a charade” of not phasing out fossil fuels, Kerry said. “This is a war for survival.”

Kerry’s remarks received a round of applause from the room. But he was confronted as he left by climate activists who called for more action, saying their future is at stake.

In the 21-page document, the words oil and natural gas did not appear, and the word coal appeared twice. It also had a single mention of carbon capture, a technology touted by some to reduce emissions although it’s untested at scale.

COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber told a plenary session on Monday that “the time to decide is now.”

“We must still close many gaps. We don’t have time to waste,” he said.

On that point, critics agreed.

“COP28 is now on the verge of complete failure,” former U.S. Vice President and climate activist Al Gore posted on X. “The world desperately needs to phase out fossil fuels as quickly as possible, but this obsequious draft reads as if OPEC dictated it word for word. … It is deeply offensive to all who have taken this process seriously.”

180,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"In Hong Kong, ‘patriots-only’ local elections see record-low voter turnout",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/in-hong-kong-patriots-only-local-elections-see-rec/,"Hong Kong saw a record-low voter turnout for Sunday’s ​closely watched District Council elections, after a process that saw only those with “patriotic” credentials allowed to​ run for office.

According to the Hong Kong elections website, voter turnout was ​just 27.5​%. That contrasts with a 71.2​% turnout in the last district elections in 2019, according to the Hong Kong Free Press, a Hong Kong-based ​activist news website.

​It was the first District Council elections held after the Beijing government passed a stringent new security law for the onetime British colony, an attempt to rein in Hong Kong’s boisterous tradition of local democracy and the enclave’s rising resistance to control from the ruling Communist Party. A ​new requirement that candidates secure endorsements from at least nine members of government-appointed committees before being allowed to join the race led to a clean-sweep for pro-Beijing candidates Sunday.

The low turnout came despite significant efforts​ by authorities — including carnivals and free concerts — to encourage voters to go to the polls. A glitch in the electronic voting systems also​ led to the polls being opened an hour later than had been planned.​ Six arrests were reported.

The district councils, ​whose jurisdiction includes local issues such as building projects and approving public facilities, are Hong Kong’s last major political bodies mostly chosen by the public.

​Watershed

Pro-democracy forces saw the turnout and the result as a watershed moment for Hong Kong. In 2019, ​the city was shaken by massive, disruptive and sometimes violent demonstrations opposing the extradition of ​local residents to face trials in ​mainland China​, seen as a direct challenge to Hong Kong’s long-independent local institutions.

The protests empowered pro-democracy groups and activists​, and that year’s District Council vote saw 17 out of 18 districts​ captured by pro-democracy candidates.

Beijing reacted. In 2020, the passage of a powerful “National Security Law” significantly chilled Hong Kong’s political climate. Changes to electoral districts and processes followed.

​Some 88 seats out of a total of 470 in the District Council were up for grabs in Sunday’s direct election, with ​4.3 million voters able to cast ballots. The number of directly elected council seats was a cut of 20​% from the 2019 election.

Electoral boundaries had also been redrawn. Those seats that are not occupied as a result of direct vote are chosen by the city’s ​Beijing-friendly chief executive and government committees. ​There were significant vacancies as well: A large number of district councilors who declined to take a new oath of allegiance resigned from their seats in 2021.

With all the newly filled seats occupied by pro-Beijing candidates, ​the central government pronounced itself satisfied with Sunday’s results.

A spokesperson for the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region called ​the results “a fair, just, open and high-quality election with wide participation of the society,” the​ Chinese Communist Party-controlled People’s Daily reported.

The ​liaison ​office is the de facto representative of Beijing in Hong Kong, ​which, since handover ​from Britain to China in 1997, has been run as a Special Administrative Region, or SAR.

The spokesperson added that “this election has completely excluded anti-China rioters from the​ … governance system, effectively implemented the principle of ‘patriots administering Hong Kong,’ and opened a new chapter in district governance.”

Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive John Lee ​told the Xinhua News Agency that the new councilors will be “patriots administering Hong Kong​,” ensuring that the entire governance system complies with ​principle of “one country, two systems​.”

​But some said there was no way to sugarcoat the plunge in voter enthusiasm reflected in the low turnout numbers.

“The record low turnout must be hugely humiliating for the government and its allies given the unprecedented propaganda campaigns and ubiquitous mobilization,” Kenneth Chan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s government and international studies department, told The Associated Press.

​Party-centric ‘patriotism’

Chinese President Xi Jinping​ has embarked on a campaign to promote “patriotism​” across the land, with a law on ​patriotic ​education being enacted in October this year.

​But some academics see the push by the powerful Chinese leader as party-centric nationalism​ by another name, designed more to cement the regime’s hold on power than to teach ordinary Chinese about their country’s past.

At a time when China is expanding ​economically and militarily around the region and the world, a key aim of patriotic education has been to remind the Chinese of the humiliations their country suffered at the hands of colonial powers in the 19th and 20th centuries.​ Foremost among them was Britain, which won Hong Kong as a colony after victory in the ​one-sided First Opium War in 1842.

After the U.K.’s historic lease expired, it handed the colony — by then an Asian powerhouse that was home to vibrant financial, service and movie industries — back to China amid great fanfare in 1997.

​Hong Kong has since been ruled under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle that recognizes the differences between ​the city and the mainland. But the watershed year of 2019, and multiple events since, have cast doubts among many Hong Kongers and outsider observers about Beijing‘s commitment to the principle.

Mr. Lee was the only candidate approved by Beijing for Hong Kong’s chief executive position in 2022. A former policeman and security official, he greenlighted the arrest of scores of pro-democracy figures in 2021.

​The fallout from Sunday’s vote and the shrinking sphere for civil liberties in Hong Kong could have some aftershocks.

The events in Hong Kong ​are being closely followed in Taiwan. ​With relations with China dominating the campaign, the democratic island goes to the polls in January to vote for a new president.

181,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Ship attacked off Yemen, private intelligence firms say, as Houthi rebel threats grow",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/ship-attacked-off-yemen-private-intelligence-firms/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A ship off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea has been attacked, private intelligence firms said Tuesday.

The attack on the vessel comes as threats have increased from Yemen‘s Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the area over the Israel-Hamas war raging in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack, though rebel military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said an important announcement would be coming from them soon.

The private intelligence firms Ambrey and Dryad Global confirmed the attack happened near the crucial Bab el-Mandeb Strait separating East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula.

Dryad Global identified the vessel attacked as the Strinda, a Norwegian-owned-and-operated ship that had broadcast it had armed guards aboard as it went through the strait. The ship’s managers did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Tuesday. The vessel, an oil-and-chemical carrier, was coming from Malaysia and was bound for the Suez Canal.

The U.S. and British militaries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which provides warnings to sailors in the Middle East, earlier reported a fire aboard an unidentified vessel off Mokha, Yemen, with all the crew aboard being safe.

The coordinates of that fire correspond to the last known location of the Strinda. It wasn’t immediately clear what kind of weapon was used in the attack.

The Iranian-backed Houthis have carried out a series of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and also launched drones and missiles targeting Israel. In recent days, they have threatened to attack any vessel they believe is either going to or coming from Israel, though there was no immediate apparent link between the Strinda and Israel.

Analysts suggest the Houthis hope to shore up waning popular support after years of civil war in Yemen between it and Saudi-backed forces.

France and the U.S. have stopped short of saying their ships were targeted in rebel attacks, but have said Houthi drones have headed toward their ships and have been shot down in self-defense. Washington so far has declined to directly respond to the attacks, as has Israel, whose military continues to describe the ships as not having links to their country.

Global shipping has increasingly been targeted as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to become a wider regional conflict - even as a truce briefly halted fighting and Hamas exchanged hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The collapse of the truce and the resumption of a punishing Israeli ground offensive and airstrikes on Gaza have raised the risk of more sea attacks.

In November, the Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship linked to Israel in the Red Sea off Yemen. The rebels still hold the vessel near the port city of Hodeida. Separately, a container ship owned by an Israeli billionaire came under attack by a suspected Iranian drone in the Indian Ocean.

A separate, tentative cease-fire between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition fighting on behalf of Yemen‘s exiled government has held for months despite that country’s long war. That’s raised concerns that any wider conflict in the sea - or a potential reprisal strike from Western forces - could reignite those tensions in the Arab world’s poorest nation.

In 2016, the U.S. launched Tomahawk cruise missiles that destroyed three coastal radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory to retaliate for missiles being fired at U.S. Navy ships at the time.

“They destroyed the Gaza Strip. There is no opportunity to live,” Yousef al-Mansi said during questioning by Israel‘s Shin Bet security agency.

As Israel continues its campaign to destroy Hamas, Mr. al-Mansi said Yahya Sinwar, the group’s current leader, has lost the support of those living in the Palestinian enclave. Israeli Defense Forces officials believe Sinwar was the mastermind behind the attack that resulted in the death of more than 1,200 people and about 240 others taken hostage.

“I have not seen anyone in the Gaza Strip who supports Sinwar. Nobody likes Sinwar,” Mr. al-Mansi told his Israeli interrogators, according to the Times of Israel. “There are people who, day and night, pray that God will free us from him.”

Israeli security officials released a 14-minute video of the interrogation that was conducted Sunday. They did not release further details about Mr. al-Mansi‘s detention, the Times of Israel reported.

“People in the Gaza Strip say that Sinwar and his group destroyed us. We must get rid of them,” Mr. al-Mansi said.

183,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Dutch official says Geert Wilders and 3 other party leaders should discuss forming a new coalition,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/dutch-official-says-geert-wilders-and-3-other-part/,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The far-right party led by Dutch election winner Geert Wilders should open negotiations with three other parties on forming a new government, the official appointed to investigate possible coalitions said Monday.

Ronald Plasterk, who acted as the “scout” in two weeks of preliminary talks, said it was “too early” to say how long it might take to form a new government amid significant policy differences between some of the parties.

Wilders’ Party for Freedom won 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house of the Dutch parliament in the Nov. 22 election, making it the biggest party and putting the veteran anti-Islam lawmaker in pole position to form the next ruling coalition.

Plasterk said that Wilders should hold coalition talks with New Social Contract, a reformist party formed over the summer that won 20 seats, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, or VVD, which was led by outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and the Farmer Citizen Movement, or BBB.

Together, the four parties have 88 seats — a comfortable majority in the lower house. However, the four parties don’t have a majority in the Dutch Senate.

Coalition talks will be tricky as the parties have significant ideological differences to bridge if they are to form the next Cabinet. Wilders is likely to have to convince potential partners that he will shelve some of his controversial policies — including his call for a ban on mosques, Islamic schools and the Quran — which breach the freedom of religion that is enshrined in the Dutch Constitution.

Plasterk’s report acknowledged the issue and said that the first stage of the coalition talks should be to investigate if the leaders can agree “on a common baseline for guaranteeing the constitution, fundamental rights and the democratic rule of law.”

The aim of the initial round of negotiations that should be completed by the end of January is to “establish if there is a basis for a next round (of talks) about a form of political cooperation that would form the foundation of a stable Cabinet,” Plasterk said in his report.

That could be a minority administration without the VVD. The party’s new leader, Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, said shortly after the election that she wouldn’t join a coalition led by Wilders, but would be prepared to support it from parliament.

Plasterk said that if the leaders can agree on the constitutional issues, then they should move on to discuss whether there is “a real perspective” for cooperation on key election issues, including migration, good governance, foreign policy, climate, pollution and agriculture.

Plasterk held several days of talks with political leaders before writing his report. The recently installed lower house of parliament will debate his findings on Wednesday and will then likely appoint an “informer” to lead the coalition talks over the next two months and report back to parliament by early February.

Coalition talks after the last Dutch general election were the longest-ever in the Netherlands at nearly nine months."
184,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Russia attacks Kyiv with ballistic missiles, but Ukraine says it intercepted all of them",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/russia-attacks-kyiv-with-ballistic-missiles-but-uk/,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia fired eight ballistic missiles at Kyiv early Monday, all of which were shot down, Ukraine’s Air Force said. The thwarted attack still left one person injured by shrapnel and three more suffered severe stress reactions, officials said.

A series of loud explosions rang out in Ukraine‘s capital just after 4 a.m., as the city was under its nightly curfew, followed by air raid sirens.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that in the Darnytskyi district of eastern Kyiv the debris of an intercepted missile fell without catching fire, and elsewhere in the capital the explosive wave damaged the windows of a house.

The attack also left 120 households in the city without electricity, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said. Last winter Russian troops were deliberately targeting the Ukrainian energy system causing power outages and blackouts across the country.

Over the weekend the U.K. defense ministry noted that Russia last week used its heavy bomber fleet for the first time since September. It predicted the start of a more concerted campaign aimed at degrading Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as winter sets in.

Kyiv is routinely targeted by Russian drone and missile attacks.

Just over two weeks ago, Kyiv came under what Ukrainian officials said was the most intense drone attack since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 75 Iranian-made Shahed drones against the capital, of which 74 were destroyed by air defenses.

Monday’s attack on the capital happened as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Argentina, where he attended the swearing-in of the country’s new president, Javier Milei. It was the Ukrainian leader’s first official trip to Latin America as Kyiv continues to court support among developing nations for its 21-month-old fight against Russia’s invading forces.

Zelenskyy met with Milei as well as with the presidents of Uruguay, Paraguay and Ecuador. During the inauguration ceremony, Zelenskyy could be seen exchanging words with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, widely considered one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest allies in Europe and one of the few European leaders who hasn’t sided with Ukraine in the war.

In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said he had a “highly straightforward conversation” with Orban, “focused on our European affairs.”

He said he also spoke by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen “about joint work at the EU level and about the joint defense of Europe.”

EU leaders are meeting later this week in Brussels. Orban has demanded that EU membership talks with Ukraine and billions of euros in funding meant for Kyiv be taken off the agenda.

Zelenskyy was due to travel to Washington for meetings Tuesday with President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials.

“Volodymyr Zelenskyy will focus on ensuring unity among the United States, Europe and the world in supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian terror and strengthening the international order based on rules and respect for the sovereignty of each nation,” his office said in a statement.

Biden has asked Congress for a $110 billion ($61.4 billion) package of wartime funding for Ukraine and Israel, along with other national security priorities. But the request is caught up in a debate over U.S. immigration policy and border security.

Elsewhere in Ukraine on Monday, Russia fired 18 drones overnight, and the Air Force intercepted all of them, mostly over the southern Mykolaiv region."
185,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,McConnell says border security ‘not a sideshow’ as Schumer blames GOP for failed Ukraine funding,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/mcconnell-says-border-security-not-sideshow-as-sch/,"Senate leaders remained at an impasse Monday over proposals to secure the U.S. southern border, despite continued negotiations on ending the logjam over a national security spending package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.

The stalemate comes as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet Tuesday with leaders in Washington, marking his most consequential visit as Congress struggles to pass more war aid.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accused President Biden and Democrats in Congress of wearing blinders when it comes to fixing the record flow of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border.

“When it comes to keeping America safe, border security is not a sideshow. It’s ground zero,” the Kentucky Republican said in a floor speech. “Senate Republicans have no more spare time to explain this basic reality. We cannot convince anyone who doesn’t want to acknowledge the glaring facts on the ground. The Senate has to act.”

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer pointed the finger at Republicans for “insisting on Donald Trump’s border policies.”

“They will be at fault when a deal for Ukraine, Israel, and humanitarian aid to Gaza all fall apart,” the New York Democrat said. “Republicans would be giving Vladimir Putin the best gift he could ask for.”

Mr. Zelenskyy will have an all-senators meeting Tuesday morning on Capitol Hill, followed by a one-on-one session with House Speaker Mike Johnson. He will also meet with Mr. Biden at the White House.

Mr. Biden’s national security package failed in the Senate last week when it was blocked by Republicans. It would provide $110 billion that included roughly $60 billion for Ukraine.

The U.S. has already approved $111 billion for Ukraine, money that will run dry by year’s end. But Congress is likely to punt any decision on additional money into next year as lawmakers head home for the holidays later this week.

Republicans’ insistence for the inclusion of border security policies, coupled with Democrats’ refusal to address a problem that U.S. officials say jeopardizes national security, has created a weeks-long standoff.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young urged Senate negotiators to quickly reach a resolution, but charged Republicans with asking for too much on border control.

“You can’t have everything your way in a negotiation. Democrats and Republicans have to vote for this bill,” Ms. Young said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation. “I agree, it’s time to cut a deal that both sides can agree to.”

Republicans’ latest proposal included several Trump-era border policies and changes to the asylum and parole processes that they say would slash the amount of illegal crossings and keep migrants out of the country while waiting for their day in immigration court.

The offer included shutting down the border if crossings reach a certain threshold, reviving the so-called Title 42 pandemic policy to quickly turn back migrants before they cross, limit parole authority and require ankle monitoring for those who are allowed to leave detention centers, and an expedited removal authority that Mr. Biden rescinded.

The Republican-controlled House passed a standalone aid bill for Israel last month, which Senate leaders have dismissed over their preference for a broader package. Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, is open to such legislation but warned there are hurdles among his conservative members over Ukraine funding.

Some Senate Democrats acknowledge the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border is dire.

During a trip to Guatemala over the weekend by Senate Democrats to learn more about the migration crisis, second-ranking Senate Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois told Punchbowl News: “We cannot ignore the reality of the numbers and where they’re coming from. We didn’t design the border policies for the volume of this nature. And we have to find a way, as painful as it may be, to bring some order.”

186,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Zelenskyy issues plea for support during Washington visit as Ukraine funding stalls in Congress,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/volodymyr-zelenskyy-pleads-for-support-during-wash/,"WASHINGTON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy kicked off a quick visit to Washington on Monday, warning in a speech at a defense university that Russia may be fighting in Ukraine but its “real target is freedom” in America and around the world. He also issued a personal plea for Congress to break its deadlock and approve continued support for Ukraine.

His time in Washington, which will include meetings on Tuesday at the White House and with Congress, is part of a last-minute push by the Biden administration to convince lawmakers to pass a supplemental funding bill, as officials warn that the money for Ukraine is running out.

President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $61.4 billion for wartime funding for Ukraine as part of a $110 billion package that also includes money for Israel and other national security priorities. But the request is caught up in a debate over U.S. immigration policy and border security. The U.S. has already provided Ukraine $111 billion for its fight against Russia’s 2022 invasion.

“If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill, it’s just (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his sick clique,” Zelenskyy told an audience of military leaders and students at the National Defense University. “Ukrainians haven’t given up and won’t give up. We know what to do. And you can count on Ukraine. And we hope just as much to be able to count on you.”

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who introduced the Ukrainian president, said America’s commitment to Ukraine is unshakeable and supporting the war is critical to ensuring the security of the U.S. and its allies.

“America’s commitments must be honored. America’s security must be defended. And America’s word must be kept,” Austin said.

He said Zelenskyy is “living proof that a single person’s leadership can help rally an embattled democracy and inspire the free world and change the course of history.”

With Congress in its final week before leaving for the holidays, questions remain as to whether Republicans will be able to come to an agreement on any rounds of future funding for Ukraine or Israel without White House concessions on border security as illegal crossings surge. But any border package also runs the risk of alienating some Democrats.

This is Zelenskyy’s third visit to Washington since the war began, and he appeared at NDU wearing his trademark Army green long-sleeve shirt - emblazoned with “I’M UKRAINIAN.” His lobbying task, however, has gotten increasingly difficult, from the hero’s welcome he received in the Capitol last year, to the bitterly divided Congress this year.

He noted that 82 years ago on this day the U.S. went to combat in Europe, as then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the declaration of war against Germany. Now, he said, as war rages in his country, though the U.S. has no troops on the ground in Ukraine, it is supplying critically needed weapons and equipment.

“Every one of you here understands what it means for a soldier to wait for ammunition, waiting for weeks, months without knowing if support will come at all,” he told the university audience. “When the free world hesitates, that’s when dictatorships celebrate.”

According to the Defense Department, there is about $4.8 billion remaining in presidential drawdown authority, which pulls weapons from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front, and about $1.1 billion left in funding to replenish the U.S. military stockpiles.

John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, told reporters Monday that Zelenskyy’s visit comes at a critical time.

“This is exactly the right time to be having President Zelenskyy in town to have these discussions, because of what’s going on in Ukraine, the increased activity we’re seeing by the Russian armed forces as winter approaches, but also what’s going on on Capitol Hill,” said Kirby.

He said Biden will make clear to Zelenskyy when they meet that the White House is standing firm on the supplemental budget request. White House spokesman Andrew Bates said top Office of Management and Budget, National Security Council and White House legislative affairs officials have continued to press the case for the funding.

187,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Voter turnout plunges below 30% in Hong Kong election after rules shut out pro-democracy candidates,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/hong-kong-voter-turnout-plunges-below-30-after-rul/,"HONG KONG — Voter turnout plunged below 30% in Hong Kong’s first district council elections since new rules introduced under Beijing’s guidance effectively shut out all pro-democracy candidates, setting a record low since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

According to official data on Monday, 27.5% of the city’s 4.3 million registered voters cast ballots in Sunday’s polls - significantly less than the record 71.2% who participated in the last elections held at the height of anti-government protests in 2019. The pro-democracy camp won those polls in a landslide victory, in a clear rebuke of the government’s handling of the protests.

Beijing loyalists are expected to take control of the district councils after Sunday’s elections, with results showing big pro-government parties winning most directly elected seats.

“The newly elected district councilors come from diverse backgrounds,” Hong Kong leader John Lee said. “They will make the work in the districts more multidimensional … better aligning with the interests of the citizens.”

The district councils, which primarily handle municipal matters such as organizing construction projects and public facilities, were Hong Kong’s last major political bodies mostly chosen by the public.

But under new electoral rules introduced under a Beijing order that only “patriots” should administer the city, candidates must secure endorsements from at least nine members of government-appointed committees that are mostly packed with Beijing loyalists, making it virtually impossible for any pro-democracy candidates to run.

PHOTOS: Voter turnout plunges below 30% in Hong Kong election after rules shut out pro-democracy candidates

An amendment passed in July also slashed the proportion of directly elected seats from about 90% to about 20%.

Many prominent pro-democracy activists have also been arrested or have fled the territory after Beijing imposed a harsh national security law in response to the 2019 protests.

Critics say the low voter turnout reflects the public sentiment toward the “patriots” only system and the government’s crackdown on dissent.

The previous record low for participation in the council elections since the handover to Chinese rule was 35.8% in 1999.

The electoral changes further narrowed political freedoms in the city, following a separate overhaul for the legislature in 2021. Following those changes, turnout in the last legislative election two years ago plunged to 30% from 58% in 2016.

Lee on Sunday said the council elections were the “last piece of the puzzle” in implementing the principle of “patriots” administering the city.

Government officials have downplayed turnout as a measure of the overhaul’s success, but stepped up efforts to promote the polls. Lee’s administration held carnivals, an outdoor concert and offered free admission to some museums to encourage voting.

Kenneth Chan, professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s government and international studies department, said the low turnout was not the result of political apathy or a coordinated boycott, but rather “a widespread political disengagement by design” under the revised rules, with most people understanding that they were “disinvited.”

“The record low turnout must be hugely humiliating for the government and its allies given the unprecedented propaganda campaigns and ubiquitous mobilization,” he said.

Sunday’s elections were extended by 1 1/2 hours because of the failure of the electronic voter registration system. Multiple politicians said the glitch would affect their chances of winning because some residents gave up voting before authorities implemented a contingency plan.

David Lok, chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission, refused to comment on the turnout and said it was unclear whether some voters were unable to cast ballots due to the system failure.

“I can’t rule out this possibility,” he said. “If they can’t vote due to our errors, I feel remorseful.”"
188,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Biden is hosting a Hanukkah ceremony at the White House as fears mount about rising antisemitism,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/biden-is-hosting-hanukkah-ceremony-at-white-house-/,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is hosting a White House reception Monday evening to mark Hanukkah, celebrating the festival of lights as he has continued to denounce rising antisemitism in the U.S. and abroad amid the Israel-Hamas war.

The president, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will attend the event with nearly 800 guests. Invitees include Holocaust survivors, members of Congress, state and local officials, entertainers, and leaders from across the Jewish religious denominations, the White House says.

A menorah is lit nightly during the eight-day Jewish festival, which this year is being celebrated from Dec. 7 until Friday.

The White House reception will be led by Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, Senior Rabbi at Central Synagogue in New York City, and feature menorah lighting by Emhoff and White House staff that are descendants of Holocaust survivors.

Biden plans to talk about how Hanukkah is a timeless story of miracles, and that - even in dark times - we can find the light, the White House says.

The Biden administration in May announced what it called the first-ever national strategy to counter antisemitism. That laid out more than 100 actions, including a series of steps to raise awareness and understanding of antisemitism and the threat it poses around the U.S.

Still, antisemitism has only intensified in some quarters since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other militants sparked Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, which faces heightened criticism for the mounting Palestinian death toll. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned of an impending “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and urged its members to demand an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.

The husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, Emhoff is the first Jewish person to be the spouse of one of the country’s nationally elected leaders. Last week, he presided over the lighting ceremony of a massive menorah in front of the White House to mark Hanukkah’s first night, saying then that American Jews are “feeling alone” and “in pain.”

The White House supported a since-expired, temporary pause in the fighting as Hamas released some of the hostages it held in Gaza, and is pushing for another truce - but the fighting continues in the meantime.

On Saturday, Liz Magill, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, resigned amid pressure from donors and criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy.

Emirati authorities did not immediately respond to questions over the report by the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a group run by Emirati Hamad al-Shamsi, who lives in exile in Istanbul after being named on a terrorism list by the UAE himself. The state-run WAM news agency also has not run a report on the trial.

Al-Shamsi gathered the information from multiple individuals with direct knowledge of the trial.

Those on trial face charges of “establishing a terrorist organization, supporting and financing it,” the center said in a statement. The center “is highly troubled by the UAE’s apparent fabrication of new charges to extend the sentences of those already released, reflecting the Emirati authorities’ ongoing suppression of dissent and civil society.”

Among those charged in the case is Ahmed Mansoor, the recipient of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015. Mansoor repeatedly drew the ire of authorities in the UAE by calling for a free press and democratic freedoms in the autocratic federation of seven sheikhdoms.

Mansoor was targeted with Israeli spyware on his iPhone in 2016 likely deployed by the Emirati government ahead of his 2017 arrest and sentencing to 10 years in prison over his activism. On Saturday, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch held a demonstration in which they displayed Mansoor’s face in the U.N.-administered Blue Zone in a protest carefully watched by Emirati officials.

Others among the 87 charged include the activist Nasser bin Ghaith, an academic held since August 2015 over his tweets. He was among dozens of people sentenced in the wake of a wide-ranging crackdown in the UAE following the 2011 Arab Spring protests. Those demonstrations saw the Islamists rise to power in several Mideast nations, a political bloc that the UAE government views as a threat to its system of hereditary rule.

The UAE, while socially liberal in many regards compared with its Middle Eastern neighbors, has strict laws governing expression. That’s been seen at COP28, where there have been none of the typical protests outside of the venue as activists worry about the country’s vast network of surveillance cameras.

“The UAE has attempted during its COP28 presidency to persuade the world of its openness to different perspectives,” said activist James Lynch of the group FairSquare. “The decision to lay new terrorism charges on this scale in the middle of the talks, when UAE is under the global spotlight, is a giant slap in the face to the country’s human rights community and the COP process.”"
190,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Critics pan draft text at U.N. climate talks as watered down as COP28 nears its finale in Dubai,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/critics-pan-draft-text-at-un-climate--writethru-12/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Countries moved closer to reaching what critics called a watered-down final deal Monday, avoiding calls from more than 100 nations to phase out planet-warming fossil fuels as United Nations climate talks in Dubai neared their culmination.

A new draft released Monday afternoon on what’s known as the global stocktake - the part of talks that assesses where the world is with its climate goals and how it can reach them - called for countries to reduce “consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner.”

The release triggered a frenzy of fine-tuning by government envoys and gimlet-eye analysis by advocacy groups, just hours before the planned late morning finish to the talks on Tuesday - even though many observers expect the finale to run over time, as is common at the annual U.N. talks.

Activists said the text was written by the COP28 presidency, run by an Emirati oil company CEO, and pounced on its perceived shortcomings. It called for “phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption” but fell fall short of a widespread push to phase out fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal altogether.

The COP presidency, in a statement, countered that the text was a “huge step forward” and was now “in the hands of the parties, who we trust to do what is best for humanity and the planet.”

COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber skipped a planned news conference and headed straight into a meeting with delegates just after 6:30 p.m.

“We have a text and we need to agree on the text,” al-Jaber said. “The time for discussion is coming to an end and there’s no time for hesitation. The time to decide is now.”

He added: “We must still close many gaps. We don’t have time to waste.”

Critics said there was a lot to do.

“The word ‘phase-out’ has been phased out,” said Li Shuo, director of the Asia Society Policy Institute. “We need to phase in the word phase-out. I think there’s still a chance for countries to do so.”

Added Andreas Sieber, a climate activists with 350.org: “What we have seen now is our fears come true.”

Jean Su from the Center for Biological Diversity said the text “moves disastrously backward from original language offering a phaseout of fossil fuels.”

“If this race-to-the-bottom monstrosity gets enshrined as the final word, this crucial COP will be a failure,” Su said.

The text “is extremely disappointing, concerning, and nowhere close to the level of ambition people around the world deserve,” said Rachel Cleetus, from the Union of Concerned Scientists.

But Mohamed Adow of Power Shift Africa said the “text lays the ground for transformational change.”

“This is the first COP where the word fossil fuels are actually included in the draft decision. This is the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era,” he said.

The draft noted that some $4.3 trillion needs to be invested annually through 2030 in order to reach ambitions of net-zero emissions of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere by mid-century. It said financing needs for adaptation were but a fraction of current outlays.

Earlier Monday, visibly tired and frustrated top U.N. officials urged COP28 climate talks to push harder for an end to fossil fuels, warning that time is running out for action that could keep the world at or below the internationally agreed-upon warming threshold.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it was “time to go into overdrive, to negotiate in good faith, and rise to the challenge.” He said negotiators at the COP28 summit in particular must focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and climate justice.

“We can’t keep kicking the can down the road,” Guterres said. “We are out of road and almost out of time.”

Emirati officials cancelled a hastily called news conference with al-Jaber, then cancelled another with another official in the early afternoon. They offered no explanation for the cancellations, which drew into question an earlier promise by al-Jaber to bring the COP to an end sharply at 11 a.m. Tuesday. They were part of a series of cancellations by prominent negotiators.

At one event that did still take place that included members of the presidency of the current and previous COP, climate activist Licypriya Kangujam came on stage to protest against the use of fossil fuels before being ushered away.

The presidency of the conference “recognizes that for this to be viewed as a success, we need to find some agreement on fossil fuels,” said Steven Guilbeault, Canadian environment minister and one of eight super-negotiators tasked with helping find common ground. “I think if we can’t do that, people will see this as a failure, even though we’ve agreed on lots of other good things.”

Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told journalists Monday morning that “we do not have a minute to lose in this crucial final stretch.”

“One thing is for certain: I win, you lose is a recipe for collective failure,” he said.

Negotiators from powerhouses United States and China were working together Monday morning.

One of the major players in all this is India, which in 2021 torpedoed the idea of a “phase-out” of coal but then in 2022 proposed the idea of phasing out all fossil fuels, not just coal, which never got on the agenda in last year’s climate talks.

The world’s most populous nation, and No. 3 carbon dioxide emitter, is trying to be both ambitious yet keep the backbone of its economy, coal, said Vaibhav Chaturvedi of New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water. Earlier this month, Raosaheb Danve Patil, India’s junior coal minister said that they will increase coal production to 1.5 billion tons by 2030 to meet growing demand.

Alden Meyer, an analyst with climate think tank E3G, said Saudi Arabia was trying to mobilize the other members of the OPEC oil cartel to object to any inclusion of fossil fuels in the text.

Canada’s Guilbeault said OPEC countries are “being very unwilling to even contemplate even a conversation, and I think that’s unhelpful.”

Seve Paeniu, Finance Minister of Tuvalu, said states at a press conference calling for a fossil fuel phase out were “addressing the oil producing states, particularly the Arab States, the Saudis in particular. We wanted them to come on board, we recognize that their countries and their economies depend very much on fossil fuel.”

Authorities were alerted to a wounded person in a parking lot in Sion, the capital of Valais canton (state), at 7:15 a.m., police said in a statement. They found a woman with a fatal gunshot wound. A man was shot dead a few minutes later and a woman was wounded.

Police launched a manhunt and issued an appeal for people to come forward with any information on a 36-year-old believed to be the gunman. They warned that the suspect, who could be on the run in his locally registered cabriolet, may be armed and dangerous and that people shouldn’t approach him.

They said that he appears to have known his victims, but didn’t give further details. They didn’t say what motive he might have had.

Oscar Davila, of the Greater Stockholm fire department, told Swedish public broadcaster SVT that there were five people inside the elevator “and they are seriously injured.” Further details about their injuries weren’t immediately available.

The construction elevator plummeted 20 meters (66 feet) in Sundbyberg, in the north of the city, Kurt Jonsson, a spokesman for the rescue service, told Swedish news agency TT.

Police said that no foul play was suspected and a preliminary investigation has been launched into “work environment violations.”

Swedish media carried photos of first responders at the site and the area cordoned off.

A spokesman for the company that manufactured the elevator told the Aftonbladet tabloid that that type has been used around the world for more than 20 years, and the company had never been involved in such an incident before."

Putin‘s trip to the Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk in Russia‘s northwestern Archangelsk region comes three days after he declared his intention to seek another six-year term.

Putin announced his decision to run in the March 17 presidential election, which he is all but certain to win, while speaking to soldiers who fought in Ukraine after a Kremlin award ceremony - a setting that underlined his focus on the military action in Ukraine.

Monday’s visit to Sevmash, where Putin oversaw raising the navy’s flag on the newly built Emperor Alexander III and the Krasnoyarsk nuclear submarines, also appeared to emphasize his focus on bolstering Russia‘s nuclear forces amid the tensions with the U.S. and other NATO allies over Ukraine.

Putin has cast his decision to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 as a response to what he described as Western efforts to threaten Russia and undermine its security, while Ukraine and its allies have denounced the action as an unprovoked act of aggression.

Speaking at the shipyard, Putin pledged to carry out plans to modernize the Russian navy.

The Emperor Alexander III is the seventh Borei-class atomic-powered submarine to enter service. Each of them is armed with 16 nuclear-tipped Bulava intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Putin announced that three more such submarines are under construction. They are part of Russia’s nuclear triad, which also includes land-based nuclear missiles and nuclear-armed strategic bombers.

The Krasnoyarsk is a nuclear-powered submarine of the new Yasen type. It’s armed with cruise missiles and torpedoes, and is designed to hunt for enemy submarines and is also capable of attacking ground targets. Putin said that another five Yasen-class submarines are being built."
194,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Rohingya Muslims in Indonesia struggle to find shelter. President says government will help for now,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/rohingya-muslims-in-indonesia-struggle-to-find-she/,"BANDA ACEH, Indonesia — His face showed exhaustion, restlessness, and confusion. It has been more than 36 hours since Muhammad Amin landed in Indonesia. He arrived in a wooden boat with 136 other Rohingya Muslims who left their refugee camp in Bangladesh. Their boat had been at sea for nearly 1 1/2 months, with no water or food for days.

Amin, 27, wore a Paris Saint-Germain soccer jersey that bore the marks of being worn for days. He, together with his wife, his children and hundreds of other Rohingya refugees, tried to get some rest as they waited at a skateboard park in the city of Banda Aceh, next to the governor’s office. They have been relocated five times in less than two days and are yet to find shelter.

Two boats carrying two groups of more than 300 Rohingya Muslims, including emaciated women and children, reached Indonesia’s northernmost Aceh province on Sunday. A third boat, carrying more refugees, remains missing. The U.N. refugee agency warned that people onboard could die if more is not done to rescue them.

Amin and his family left the refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh and arrived at Lamreh village in Indonesia’s northmost Ache province.

“It was not safe at the camp in Bangladesh,” he said while holding his two toddler daughters to calm them down. “ We, the Rohingya men, had to keep on guard every night. We couldn’t sleep.” Amin claimed that they were being shot at, and one night a couple of Rohingya refugees got killed.

About 740,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, following a brutal counterinsurgency campaign. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and the burning of thousands of Rohingya homes, and international courts are considering whether their actions constitute genocide.

The refugees have been trying to find shelter in other countries including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia.

After their boat docked at Lamreh village, Amin and the other Rohingya refugees saw the locals were unwelcoming of their arrival.

On Sunday evening, residents loaded the Rohingya Muslims in four trucks and took them to the place near the governor’s office, about 1.5 hours from where they landed.

When they arrived, police officers drove them for another hour to a scout camp in Pidie regency, only for residents there to block the camp’s entrance and deny them entry. Authorities escorted them to a convention center run by the Ministry of Social Affairs, but locals still wouldn’t allow them to stay.

Finally, the refugees were driven back to where the governor’s office was located. They stayed overnight in a convention hall complex in Banda Aceh city owned by the government.

Shahidul Islam, 34, arrived with Amin. He said they came to Indonesia after seeing some Rohyinga Muslims, including his relatives, safely arriving in the Southeast Asian country.

“I came here to reunite with my family. But now they are not allowing us in. So many people are sick, more than before” Islam said. He added that he is looking for a better life and asked the Indonesian governmnet to help.

Since November, more than 1,500 Rohingya refugees have arrived by boat in Indonesia’s Aceh province. Some were denied landing by the residents in Aceh Utara district and Sabang island, sparking concerns from human rights organizations.

Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo on Monday said that the Indonesian government will still help the refugees temporarily.

“For now we will accommodate them, temporarily. We are still talking to international organizations, such as UNHR, etc., since the locals don’t accept them,” Widodo told reporters in Jakarta.

On Sunday Ann Maymann, head of UNHCR representative who was in Banda Aceh told reporters Sunday that Rohingya refugees needed a safe place with help from Indonesia’s government.

“It is the government that should decide (where refugees should stay). That is their authority. And when they decide, it will work. So I am sure we can manage this,” Maymann said

Indonesia’s government suspected a surge in human trafficking because of the growing number of Rohingya Muslims who entered the country over the past few weeks, especially in Aceh.

Most of the refugees leaving by sea attempt to reach Muslim-majority Malaysia in search of work. Indonesia, where Muslims comprise nearly 90% of the country’s 277 million people, has been detaining them.

Transfer of the two Sandown class vessels, which are designed to help clear mines from coastal waters, comes as Britain and Norway announce plans for a new maritime coalition to increase support for Ukraine in the war with Russia.

The coalition will work with the Ukrainian navy to expand its forces in the Black Sea, develop a Ukrainian Marine Corps and enhance the use of river patrol craft to defend inland and coastal waterways, British authorities said.

“These minehunters will deliver vital capability to Ukraine, which will help save lives at sea and open up vital export routes, which have been severely limited since (Russian President Vladimir) Putin launched his illegal full-scale invasion,’’ Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement.

Britain first announced a deal to sell the two mine-hunting ships to Ukraine in June 2021, before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers began training on the ships last year in Scotland."
196,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"In latest crackdown on violence, Greece bans fans at all top-flight matches for two months",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/in-latest-crackdown-on-violence-greece-bans-fans-a/,"ATHENS, Greece — All top-flight soccer matches in Greece will be played without fans in the stadiums for the next two months, in the latest crackdown on supporter violence following a sport-related riot last week that left a police officer with life-threatening injuries.

The government said Monday that it would introduce emergency legislation to make the ban on supporters effective immediately. It will end on Feb. 12 with a possible extension to follow.

This past weekend’s professional soccer matches were postponed following a series of violent incidents at matches and last week’s riot that occurred outside a volleyball game believed to be led by organized soccer fan groups.

The 31-year-old police officer who was injured in the clashes remains hospitalized in a coma after being hit in the left leg by a flare, causing extensive bleeding and cardiac arrest.

“This murderous attack against a policeman is not the first incident of extreme fan violence in recent years. Criminals in the guise of sports fans are committing serious offenses, seriously injuring and killing people,” government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis told reporters.

He said all 14 clubs competing in the top-flight Super League will have to install surveillance cameras inside stadiums and use personalized ticketing systems that require the holder to show identification upon entry before being allowed to admit supporters.

The security systems, including a network of high-resolution surveillance cameras inside stadiums, would have to adhere to standards set by soccer’s governing body in Europe, UEFA, Marinakis said.

An 18-year-old man has been arrested and taken into police custody in connection with the police officer’s injury to face charges of attempted murder. The man, who has not been identified, appeared at an arraignment hearing Monday after being escorted to court in handcuffs by police. He was given until Thursday to prepare his defense.

Violence has plagued Greek soccer for decades despite repeated efforts to crack down on the supporters’ associations blamed for the attacks, mostly outside stadiums.

Olympiakos, under new Portuguese head coach Carlos Carvalhal, will face Serbia’s Backa Topola in the Europa League at home Thursday without fans as a result of the decision.

But Greek clubs Panathinaikos and PAOK will conclude their European matches with fans. Panathinaikos hosts Maccabi Haifa in Athens Thursday in the Europa League and PAOK hosts HJK Helsinki in the Conference League also on Thursday in Thessaloniki."
197,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Iraq scrambles to contain fighting between U.S troops, Iran-backed groups, fearing Gaza spillover",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/iraq-scrambles-to-contain-fighting-between-us-troo/,"BAGHDAD — Dozens of attacks on U.S. military facilities by Iran-backed factions in Iraq over the past two months have forced the government in Baghdad to perform a balancing act that is becoming more difficult by the day.

A rocket attack on the sprawling U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Friday marked a further escalation as Iraqi officials scramble to contain the ripple effects of the Israel-Hamas war.

Iran holds considerable sway in Iraq and a coalition of Iran-backed groups brought Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to power in October 2022. But at the same time, there are some 2,000 U.S. forces stationed in Iraq under an agreement with Baghdad, mainly to counter the extremist Islamic State group.

Baghdad also relies heavily on Washington’s sanctions waivers to buy electricity from Iran, and since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraq’s foreign currency reserves have been housed at the U.S. Federal Reserve, giving the Americans significant control over Iraq’s supply of dollars.

Al-Sudani’s predecessors also had to walk a delicate line between Tehran and Washington, but the Israel-Hamas war has considerably upped the stakes.

Since the onset of the war on Oct. 7, at least 84 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria have been claimed by an umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militants dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. The militants say their attacks are in retaliation for Washington’s backing of Israel and its military presence in Iraq and Syria.

Al-Sudani has condemned the attacks and U.S. counter-strikes as a violation of his country’s sovereignty. He also ordered authorities to pursue militants involved in the attacks, most of which did not cause injuries or major damage. His office declined further comment.

Washington has sent messages that its patience is wearing thin.

After the embassy attack, the Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “made clear (to al-Sudani) that attacks against U.S. forces must stop.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told al-Sudani that Washington expects Iraqi officials to take more action to prevent such attacks, and believes they have the capability to do so, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.

During a recent trip to the region, CIA Director William Burns warned al-Sudani of “harsh consequences” if Iraq does not act to stop the attacks, an Iraqi official said.

The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.

In a call with the Iraqi premier earlier this month, Blinken said that the Americans would take matters into their own hands, arguing that Baghdad had not done enough to pursue the perpetrators, according to two Iraqi officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Two days later, a U.S. strike on a drone launch site near the Iraqi city of Kirkuk killed five militants.

The U.S. and much of the international community have scrambled to prevent the war in the besieged Gaza Strip from expanding across the region.

Analyst Renad Mansour said he believes Iran is making sure the attacks remain below a threshold that would provoke a major U.S. response.

“Both Iran and Iraq have maintained thus far a clear line that, at the moment, Iraq cannot turn into a playground that could destabilize the Sudani government,” said Mansour, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House think tank.

He said that’s partially due to Iraq‘s role of passing messages between Washington and Tehran.

Sometimes the messenger is al-Sudani.

In early November, Blinken met with al-Sudani in Baghdad a day before the Iraqi prime minister was set to visit Tehran. Al-Sudani had won a specific promise from the militias that no attacks would be launched during Blinken’s visit, according to an Iraqi official and a member of the Kataib Hezbollah militia. Following the visit, al-Sudani carried a message from Blinken to Iran to restrain the militias.

Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

A week after the Iraqi premier’s diplomatic efforts, the United States extended Iraq’s sanctions waiver by four months to purchase Iranian electricity. Iran-hawks in Washington criticized the move, saying it would shore up revenue for Tehran while its proxies are at war with Israel.

Mansour says the U.S. has used the sanctions waiver as “one of its cards” in economy-centered efforts to pressure Iran and Iraq.

Unlike Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, seen as Iran‘s most powerful proxy in the region, Iraq’s militias have so far only played a limited role in the conflict.

For now, only small number of militiamen from Iraq are in southern Lebanon, near Israel‘s northern border, said the official from the Kataib Hezbollah group. He said the Iraqis are working on “battle management” alongside Hezbollah and representatives of Hamas, the militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years and is currently battling Israel.

He said the Iran-backed groups in Iraq do not want the conflict to spread across the region, but are prepared to respond with force to any attacks.

Should Iran and allies choose to escalate, al-Sudani’s government will likely be unable to rein them in or prevent consequences on Iraqi soil, said Iyad al-Anbar, a political science professor at Baghdad University.

“And this is why all al-Sudani has been able to do is try to bring some calm through statements,” said al-Anbar.

198,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"A day of two prime ministers in Poland begins the delayed transition to centrist, pro-EU government",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/day-of-two-prime-ministers-in-poland-begins-delaye/,"WARSAW, Poland — A power transition began Monday in the Polish parliament, where the outgoing national conservative leaders made their farewell statements as a majority of lawmakers prepared to elect a new prime minister, the centrist, pro-EU political veteran Donald Tusk.

The power transition comes two months since Poles turned out in huge numbers to vote for change in a national election. The transition was delayed for weeks by the president, who chose to keep his political allies in office as long as possible.

“READY, STEADY, GO!” tweeted Tusk, who - if all goes as planned - will be chosen as the new prime minister by bedtime.

Szymon Holownia, a former TV showman who leads a party allied with Tusk, became the speaker if parliament last month and has been trying to encourage more dignified behavior in the sometimes raucous assembly. Parliamentary proceedings have ignited widespread curiosity and emotions, and led to a spike in the number of subscribers to the Sejm’s YouTube channel.

A Warsaw cinema which livestreamed Monday’s proceedings drew dozens of spectators who munched popcorn and erupted in laughter as the outgoing prime minister spoke.

The change of power in Poland is felt as hugely consequential for the 38 million citizens of the central European nation, where collective anger produced a record-high turnout to replace a government that had been eroding democratic norms.

There is relief for many women who saw reproductive rights eroded and LGBTQ+ people who faced a government hate campaign that drove some to leave the country.

Law and Justice supporters, however, fear the new government will promote more liberal policies that conflict with many of their conservative views on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

The change holds important implications for Ukraine and the EU as well.

Tusk, a past EU leader, is expected to improve Warsaw’s standing in Brussels. His leadership of the EU’s fifth largest member by population will boost centrist, pro-EU forces at a time when euroskeptics, such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, are gaining strength.

Poland’s outgoing nationalist government was initially one of Kyiv’s strongest allies after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but ties have worsened as economic competition from Ukrainian food producers and truckers has angered Poles who say their livelihoods are threatened.

A blockade by Polish truckers at the border with Ukraine counts among the many problems Tusk will have to tackle immediately. The protest has held up the shipment of some military equipment that charities are importing, and Tusk has accused the outgoing government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of mishandling the situation.

In a speech that traditionally launches a government in power, but was in fact a parting speech, outgoing Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki described what he viewed as the successes of his government and his desire for reconciliation in a society so divided it seems sometimes at war with itself.

“We must end the Polish-Polish war,” Morawiecki said, to applause from his supporters but laughter from the others “Let’s choose dialogue, let’s look for what unites us.”

Morawiecki’s government will later face a confidence vote he is expected to lose, bringing an end to his premiership exactly six years after he assumed the office on Dec. 11, 2017.

Simple arithmetic indicates he has no chance of surviving the vote. His Law and Justice party won more seats than any other party in the Oct. 15 election but lost its parliamentary majority. A bloc of parties allied with Tusk that range from left-wing to conservative won a majority of 248 seats in the 460-seat body.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the Law and Justice leader who has been the driving force in the country for the past eight years, pledged that no matter what happens his party would pursue its goals until another victory is possible in the future.

The Sejm is scheduled to elect Tusk later Monday. He is to address lawmakers Tuesday and he will face a confidence vote which he seems sure to win given that he is backed by a majority.

It’s a day keenly awaited by former President Lech Walesa, the anti-communist freedom fighter who had despaired at the unraveling of the democracy he fought for under Kaczynski, his bitter foe. Though Walesa was hospitalized last week for COVID-19 and remains weak, he traveled early from his home in Gdansk to attend the parliamentary session.

Walesa arrived wearing a sweatshirt with the word “Constitution” - a slogan against Law and Justice. He sat in a balcony above the lawmakers with other dignitaries. Many stood to applaud him, chanting his name.

Law and Justice lawmakers did not clap and remained seated.

The final act in the transition of power will take place when President Andrzej Duda swears in Tusk and his government, expected on Wednesday.

Tusk plans to fly to Brussels for an EU summit later in the week where discussions critical for Ukraine’s future are expected as the nation fights off the Russian invasion. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Russia’s closest ally in the EU, is demanding that Ukraine’s membership in the EU and billions of euros in funding meant for the war-torn country be taken off the agenda.

Morawiecki’s government reacted to an economic dispute with Kyiv during the election campaign by banning Ukraine food imports and saying it had stopped sending military aid to Ukraine. Last week, Tusk said he would seek solutions to the truckers’ protest that take into account their financial needs but also regional security.

Drew Dickinson, an analyst with the Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission, told lawmakers that the organization is recommending action to give state facilities more leeway to turn away certain patients and encourage private hospitals to take more in.

Currently, state hospitals are required to admit patients even if they are unable to appropriately care for them. Dickinson said that’s meant hospitals frequently admit individuals with neurodegenerative disorders or developmental disorders — such as dementia or autism — who would be better served elsewhere. He noted that these people are more likely to be the target of violence in state hospitals than other patients.

In addition, JLARC found that law enforcement officers were often dropping off patients subject to Temporary Detention Orders at state hospitals before the facilities had an opportunity to evaluate if they could properly care for the patient.

More than 1,400 people were dropped off in such a way from July 2021 through June 2023, concentrated in Western and Southwest Virginia. Sometimes, patients needed nonpsychiatric medical treatment that the hospitals weren't equipped for.

“That puts their life in danger, and we heard many examples of that,” said JLARC Associate Director Tracey Smith.

The state Office of the Attorney General issued an opinion in January stating that exactly such drop-offs were illegal in the commonwealth, but JLARC found they continued to happen. To counteract them, the commission is recommending the General Assembly pass a bill allowing state hospitals to turn patients away if they haven’t been medically cleared.

“So, what would happen is, because they have to remain in law enforcement custody, law enforcement essentially would have to take them back to the hospital to receive the urgent medical treatment that they need,” Smith said.

While state hospitals have been dealing with overcrowding, private psychiatric hospitals in Virginia have been operating below capacity. JLARC staff said it’s considered best practice for hospitals to operate at about 85% of staffed capacity.

All but one state psychiatric hospital has operated above that 85% threshold in each of the last three years, while only 12 of 43 privately owned psychiatric facilities in Virginia did so in 2022.

JLARC

Dickinson said the state could consider funding programs to help private facilities take on more patients or using its existing powers to require them to do so. The Virginia Department of Health must issue a Certificate of Public Need to private hospitals before they can open, and Dickinson noted VDH has already used this process in the past to address patients subject to Temporary Detention Orders.

JLARC directed VDH in its report to ensure that facilities that have agreed to take in those patients are actually doing so. The report also said the General Assembly could consider making such agreements a requirement to receive a Certificate of Public Need.

“I think it's helpful to reiterate that none of our recommendations would require private hospitals to accept patients who they do not have the capability or capacity to treat,” Dickinson said. Private facilities in Virginia can turn patients away if they would put the hospital above the 85% threshold.

Another issue contributing to the overcrowding is an increase in the number of people receiving competency restoration services. That's when a facility assists someone who has been charged with a crime to understand both the charges against them and the legal process to come.

Dickinson said the number of people ordered by courts to seek these services has tripled in the last 15 years, following a national trend. He said the services are only offered at state hospitals, but noted they are sometimes handled in an outpatient setting. In Virginia, about three-quarters of competency restoration services are handled inpatient. That’s in spite of inpatient services costing about $110,000while the outpatient equivalent costs just over $1,000.

JLARC’s report suggested Virginia better utilize outpatient services to reduce costs, but made no specific recommendations on how to do so. Instead, the report directed the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services to solicit private facilities to provide inpatient services and help with capacity issues.

It also noted a worker shortage to evaluate people who’ve received services to see if they are ready for trial. JLARC said that’s led to delays in the competency restoration process.

“State hospitals have delayed admitting some defendants for competency restoration because of capacity limitations, which creates risks that the state will be sued for violating defendants’ due process rights,” the report said. “At least 16 states have been sued because of delayed inpatient competency restoration services for defendants.”

State psychiatric hospitals also face staffing shortages of their own, with about 1 in 6 positions vacant as of June 30. While that’s down about 30% since the year prior, Dickinson noted the number would be even greater if the state hadn't hired contractors to fill vacancies. In total, state hospital spending on contractors increased from $4 million in fiscal 2013 to $47 million in FY 2023. (Virginia’s fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30.)

Dickinson said high turnover — especially among nurses — is contributing to the shortage. Staff who spoke with JLARC reported low pay and unsafe working conditions; about 50% of nurses surveyed said they do not feel safe at work. While inadequate pay was the top issue listed among all workers leaving their jobs at state hospitals, nurses cited poor management most frequently.

JLARC

Dickinson added that even if hospitals were fully staffed, they don't receive enough funding to provide necessary care. The number of nursing hours funded in fiscal 2023 was about 25% fewer than what nurse leadership determined was necessary for adequate care — even in the least intensive units.

Patient safety was a concern for JLARC at several facilities as well, with Dickinson reporting the issues are most prevalent at the Commonwealth Center for Children and Adolescents in Staunton — the state’s only psychiatric hospital for minors. He said violence between patients and self-harm were more common at the Staunton facility than other state hospitals, as was violence from patients to staff.

Additionally, Dickinson said JLARC found that the facility was more likely to seclude and restrain patients than other state hospitals or similar facilities in other locations. From January 2022 through May 2023, CCCA was 40 times more likely to restrain patients than the national average among children ages 13–17 at inpatient psychiatric facilities and eight times more likely to seclude them.

JLARC

Nelson Smith, DBHDS’ commissioner, acknowledged the facility’s shortcomings at Monday’s meeting. He said it’s been working to fix those since before nonprofit accreditor The Joint Commission (tJC) reviewed the hospital in May and found 28 deficiencies that made it “an immediate threat to the health and safety of patients.”

“Which means we just had to move faster to fix it for these kids. … We've been working aggressively, we did not take it lightly. We removed the leadership there,” Nelson Smith said. “Through addressing these findings, along with accelerating the strategies that we had already had underway, The Joint Commission has since reduced those deficiencies to two.”

Nelson Smith said use of restraints decreased significantly in 2023, something JLARC also noted in its report.

JLARC added, however, “the 2023 rate of restraint reported by DBHDS (8 hours per 1,000 patient hours) remains almost 20 times higher than the tJC-reported average.” It noted other issues at the Commonwealth Center, including the highest vacancy rate of any state hospital, excluding contractors, and ballooning costs. Dickinson said the facility’s cost-per-bed has nearly tripled since 2013.

As a result, JLARC recommended the state shut down CCCA and find alternative placements for children who would be admitted there. Dickinson noted relatively few states operate their own psychiatric facilities for minors. Instead, most contract with private hospitals for children experiencing severe mental health crises, an approach Dickinson said Virginia could follow.

JLARC’s report also noted Virginia has dedicated funds to crisis stabilization centers that could serve children in need of less intensive care. Dickinson said referring children to facilities closer to their homes would benefit care, something Nelson Smith agreed with.

“Kids in crisis should be able to get help as close to home and their families as possible,” he said. “Youth need to receive care within their communities where they live, learn and play.”

CCCA is a small facility with enough staff to serve about half of its 48 beds, Dickinson said, so relatively few people would need to be relocated in the event of a shutdown."
200,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Opponents say Dominion’s offshore wind farm endangers whales. Scientists say it doesn't.,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-11/dominion-energy-whale-deaths-wind-farm-renewable-energy,"Read the original article on WHRO's website.

A series of whale deaths along the East Coast early this year has spurred an ongoing dispute over the burgeoning offshore wind industry.

Several of the deaths happened in Virginia Beach and Cape Charles. Two were humpbacks; one was a critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, later determined to have been struck by a vessel. Another right whale was also caught entangled in fishing line off the Outer Banks in North Carolina.

Around the same time, more than a dozen humpback whales were found dead along the coasts of New Jersey and New York over the span of a few months — the latest in what scientists call an “unusual mortality event” stretching back to 2016. Warming waters driven by climate change are bringing humpbacks closer to shore, while cargo shipments carried on big ships are also on the rise.

Scientists later said most of the deaths were caused by ship strikes.

But some local politicians and national conservative pundits pointed the finger somewhere else: offshore wind development.

More than a dozen offshore wind projects are in various stages of permitting along the East Coast. The Biden administration considers the nascent industry a key part of its climate policy, setting a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of electricity generated from offshore wind farms by 2030, or enough to power more than 10 million homes.

In January, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson accused offshore wind projects of killing “a huge number of whales” on his show. Fox News also linked the right whale death in Virginia Beach to Dominion Energy’s project.

Thirty mayors in New Jersey called for a moratorium on offshore wind activity until further investigation into the whale deaths. The uproar also fueled a few “save the whales” rallies, including in New Jersey and Rhode Island.

But scientists say there’s nothing to back up such claims.

“There’s no scientific evidence that even a single whale death has been linked to offshore wind energy development,” said Andrew Read, a marine biology professor at Duke University who also serves on the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission, an independent government agency that advises on federal policy affecting marine mammals.

The biggest proven threats to whales are vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear —often tied to existing industries like shipping and commercial fishing, Read said.

Now, two conservative think tanks have notified the government they plan to sue to halt Dominion Energy's planned wind farm off Virginia Beach, arguing the project threatens the endangered right whale.

The two think tanks — the Illinois-based Heartland Institute and the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow — have a long history of rejecting the scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activity, primarily burning fossil fuels like oil and gas. Both groups have opposed efforts to shift to renewable energy.

James Taylor, president of Heartland, said he views renewable energy as the wrong direction for the country economically.

""We're looking to protect [the] American standard of living. We're looking to protect affordable, reliable energy,” Taylor said. “But when you also see this environmental devastation, it just begs for us to get involved and to stand up for wildlife as well.”

Critics, meanwhile, say the groups are spreading misinformation about the threat to whales as a tool to stop wind projects from moving forward.

“It’s utilizing something that is perceived as environmentally-friendly,” said Ruth McKie, a senior lecturer in criminology at De Montfort University in the U.K. who studies organized opposition to climate action.

If filed, the lawsuit would be one of the first to test the argument in court. Lawsuits from landowners and fishing businesses in the Northeast have mentioned whales in a few other recent cases, some of which were already dismissed by a judge.

The controversy is one of several roadblocks the U.S. offshore wind industry faces as it finds its footing.

And Dominion’s Virginia Beach project — which is set to be the nation’s largest commercial wind farm — is now at the forefront.



A strategy to halt renewable energy?

Critics question whether the new legal action is really about wildlife.

“I would be pleased to learn they are concerned about whales, but I’m sure it isn’t so,” Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication, wrote in an email. He cited the Heartland Institute’s history of “ignoring science.”

McKie, the U.K. researcher, said Heartland is known for a decadeslong campaign to discredit the science behind climate change, including annual climate conferences and policy briefs “debunking the myth of global warming.”

The institute had donors in the fossil fuel industry at least up until the mid-2000s, she said. (Heartland denies accusations that former funding from the industry has any influence on its current activities.)

McKie sees the focus on whales as part of a shift in strategy. The new “save the whales” campaign could represent a shift from targeting climate science to undermining climate action, such as the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

“It’s not necessarily going to stop it. It’s about delaying it as long as possible,” she said. “Every time you can stop an offshore wind development, you’re delaying that energy transition.”

Taylor, the president of Heartland, said protecting vulnerable species “should stand regardless of who is on what side,” accusing environmentalists of “turning a blind eye” in order to safeguard wind projects.

Heartland has been critical of the Endangered Species Act in the past, sometimes even calling for its repeal. Now, the group is taking a page out of environmentalists’ playbook.

“If there's anything that environmental groups used to tell us is that, ‘look, if there's a reasonable chance that you're going to do harm to plants, to animals, to wildlife — at the very least, slow down, take a time out and look at it,’” Taylor said. “And that's a standard that should apply here.”



Endangered whales and wind farms

Read, of Duke University, said he’s glad endangered whales are getting so much attention. But he’d like the public to focus on proven threats to the species, like boat strikes and fishing entanglement.

“In terms of whale conservation, wind energy development is not very high on my list of things to keep me awake at night,” Read said.

There are fewer than 350 North Atlantic Right Whales left in the ocean. Their dwindling population makes losing even one of the whales a major concern.

The whales’ annual migration takes them up the East Coast, from their breeding grounds off Florida and Georgia to summer feeding grounds off eastern Canada, Read said.

Under the Endangered Species Act, federal officials have to weigh impacts on right whales when considering offshore wind projects. The government’s biological opinion found that the Virginia project is not likely to jeopardize the whales’ population.

That’s based on analysis from federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that says the creatures can be adequately protected by mitigation measures. Scientists say they plan to research more about potential impacts from offshore wind infrastructure on whales’ food supply of tiny zooplankton.

The Heartland Institute and the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow argue the government’s analysis is flawed and therefore violates the Endangered Species Act.

They recently notified the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and National Marine Fisheries Service of their intent to sue in 60 days — a step required by law before filing suit. (BOEM declined to comment, citing pending litigation.)

Collister Johnson, a senior adviser with the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow and former board chair of the Virginia Port Authority, said federal officials haven’t sufficiently considered the cumulative effects of building multiple wind farms in the Atlantic, rather than looking at each individually.

“It doesn't take a scientist to understand that if you're putting thousands of these giant wind turbines out in the migratory path of the right whale, you're going to have a negative impact,” Johnson said.

Johnson and other opponents argue that site surveys done by offshore wind companies ahead of construction could have played a role in this year’s whale deaths.

But marine officials say the acoustic energy used in those surveys is weaker than those used by oil companies that need to penetrate deep into the seafloor, and no stronger than beams used by fishing vessels. The Heartland Institute has in the past supported oil and gas exploration along the Eastern Seaboard — citing federal analysis concluding seismic surveys pose no significant threat to marine life.

In a page on its website responding to concerns about offshore wind and whales, NOAA Fisheries officials acknowledge that acoustic trauma in whales is very challenging to assess, but say they plan to keep looking at samples from necropsied animals.

“Strandings and inconclusive necropsies have occurred long before offshore wind was a factor, so correlating the two now is not based in science,” NOAA wrote.

Dominion Energy declined to comment specifically on the pending litigation. But the utility’s federal permitting requires that it take several actions to protect marine life including whales, said environmental manager Mitchell Jabs.

“North Atlantic Right Whales were a consideration from the very beginning of the project,” she said.

Those measures include using “bubble curtains” to reduce underwater noise during pile-driving, maintaining lower vessel speed limits and using visual and acoustic monitoring to spot whales nearby.

The Nature Conservancy and NOAA also announced they plan to study fish behavior around the Virginia turbines through 2027, including their responses to construction noise.

Dominion has already started receiving some wind turbine foundations and plans to start installing them in the water in the spring.

201,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Heart of Hawaii's historic Lahaina reopens to residents and business owners,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-12/heart-of-hawaiis-historic-lahaina-reopens-to-residents-and-business-owners,"LAHAINA, Hawaii — The heart of Lahaina, the historic town on the Hawaiian island of Maui that burned in a deadly wildfire that killed at least 100 people, reopened Monday to residents and business owners holding day passes.

The renewed access marks an important emotional milestone for victims of the Aug. 8 fire, but much work remains to be done to safely clear properties of burned debris and rebuild.

The reopened areas include Banyan Tree Park, home to a 150-year-old tree that burned in the fire but that is now sprouting new leaves, Lahaina's public library, an elementary school and popular restaurants.

An oceanfront section of Front Street, where the fire ripped through a traffic jam of cars trying to escape town, reopened Friday.

Authorities are continuing to recommend that people entering scorched lots wear protective gear to shield them from hazards.

On Sunday, the state Department of Health released test results confirming the ash and dust left by the fire is toxic and that arsenic is the biggest concern. Arsenic is a heavy metal that adheres to wildfire dust and ash, the department said.

The tests examined ash samples collected Nov. 7-8 from 100 properties built from the 1900s to the 2000s. Samples also showed high levels of lead, which was used to paint houses built before 1978.

The clean up is still in its early stages. For the past few months, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been removing batteries, propane tanks, pesticides and other hazards from the town's more than 2,000 destroyed buildings.

Residents and business owners have been able to visit their properties after the EPA has finished clearing their lots. In some cases, residents — often wearing white full-body suits, masks and gloves — have found family heirlooms and mementos after sifting through the charred rubble of their homes.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will begin hauling away the remaining debris and take it to a landfill after it gets permission from property owners.

The EPA and the state's health department have installed 53 air monitors in Lahaina and Upcountry Maui, where a separate fire burned homes in early August. The department is urging people to avoid outdoor activity when monitor levels show elevated air pollution and to close windows and doors.

202,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,'I ain't found it yet.' No line this mother won't cross to save her addicted daughter,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-12/i-aint-found-it-yet-no-line-this-mother-wont-cross-to-save-her-addicted-daughter,"Renae moves hedge clippers, gloves and used coffee mugs off a table in her backyard and wipes it down. She scans the lawn behind her modest home in the rural South for folding chairs and pulls up three. There are paper plates for pizza. Renae is about to host a gathering with a singular goal: saving lives.

""Hey baby, you sit right here,"" Renae says to Christina, the first guest to arrive. ""Just get your stuff ready.""

Christina opens a Mountain Dew and arranges her supplies: a new syringe, a lighter, a tiny metal cup and a baggie with brownish powder clumped in one corner. A test strip will confirm it includes fentanyl, the opioid that's driving overdose deaths in the United States to record highs — an estimated 112,000 lives lost in the latest 12-month period.

Christina will use the powder anyway to appease her addiction and numb the pain of abuse, lost children and despair. On fentanyl, Christina gets temporary relief from three mental health diagnoses she struggles to manage: depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder.

Renae occasionally monitors illegal drug use at her home for Christina and a few dozen other people she's grown close to over the years. It's an informal, rarely discussed version of the controversial overdose prevention centers, also known as supervised consumption sites, where trained staff supervise people using drugs. Those clinics are endorsed by the American Medical Association and other leading medical groups but condemned by critics who say they sanction, even endorse, drug use.

Renae bustles around, looking for her glasses, pulling back her hair and chatting with a few other guests who have now arrived. But Christina's in a hurry. It's been nine hours since her last shot of an opioid. She's anxious and has that feeling she's going to be sick — the early signs of withdrawal.

Still, Christina has taken the time to come to Renae's backyard because she trusts Renae to keep her alive.

Much of what happens next may be illegal, so this story will not include full names, locations or detailed timelines.

/ /

Renae, who has medical training, pulls up a stool next to Christina. She watches as Christina pours the powder into the aluminum cup, melts the contents with her lighter and draws the liquid into a syringe. The injection is over in seconds.

After the shot, Renae chats with Christina about whether she's drinking enough water on this warm day. She turns a fan on Christina to help cool her down. Renae has Narcan handy, a brand of naloxone, the drug that can reverse an overdose. But this time, she doesn't need it. About five minutes later, Christina stands up.

""I'm OK,"" Christina says, and Renae agrees. Christina did not take a fatal dose of fentanyl today. Christina says thanks, the two women hug, and Christina walks away.

/ /

""This is seriously all it takes to keep somebody alive,"" Renae says, hands spread toward her home-based supervised consumption site. ""People die of overdoses because they're by themselves.""

Nationwide, more than half of people found dead after an overdose were alone. Renae is determined to make a dent in those numbers by intervening when people stop breathing and helping them start treatment for their addiction if they are ready. In the meantime, she makes people comfortable if they nod off, checks vital signs and provides rescue breathing or Narcan when needed.

Renae is cautious about who she lets into her home, and there are rules. Call or text before you come. Only one person uses at a time. No drugs left behind. By Renae's tally, she's reversed at least 30 overdoses in the past few years. She's never had to call 911. She's never lost anyone.

What Renae sees as a life-saving mission is likely a violation of a federal law passed in 1986, during a surge in crack cocaine use. It says allowing illegal drug use in any designated space is against the law. At least one U.S. city and a few states are testing this law and have opened or plan to open supervised consumption clinics. It's unclear whether federal agents will move to shut them down.

Opponents argue that Renae and others should focus on sending people with an addiction to treatment, not enabling their use.

""Yes, I enable, I absolutely do."" she says. ""I enable them to leave of their own volition and not on an ambulance gurney or in a body bag.""

Many Americans condemn what Renae does. She understands why. Some years ago, when Renae's daughter began using drugs, Renae would have condemned her own behavior too.

Keeping Brooke alive

Renae's transformation from anxious mom to intrepid overdose prevention advocate started in her daughter's early teens with lots of mother-daughter fights. Brooke would break a rule. Renae would respond like many parents do. She would ground Brooke and take away her cell phone. As she puts it, ""I was wanting to force her to do what I wanted her to do.""

/ /

Renae says her approach ""bombed."" She pushed and punished, and lost Brooke's trust. Brooke says her mom's demands — go to school, get a job, do the ""right"" things — were reasonable. But Brooke didn't want to or didn't feel like she could.

""I got tired,"" Brooke says. ""I didn't want to let her down, so I just left.""

/ /

Brooke moved out at age 16. By 18, she was using opioids regularly. Renae often didn't know where she was or whether she was alive or dead. Her despair is familiar to many parents of children with an addiction.

Renae imagined spotting Brooke somewhere, swooping her into a big bag and racing home, like scenes from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.

Then one day, after a month of unanswered texts and calls, Renae saw her daughter walking down a street, and something inside Renae flipped. All the fights, fury and disappointment melted into ""pure joy."" Brooke was alive.

/ /

""That's all that counts,"" Renae remembers saying to herself. Her baby was still breathing.

Brooke didn't want to talk and wouldn't come home. Renae watched her go. But for Renae, everything had changed. She would give up on trying to control Brooke's life. She would figure out how to keep Brooke alive instead.

A gut-wrenching dilemma

Renae's new mission started with a simple step: She stocked up on Narcan for Brooke. It was a way back into her daughter's life.

/ /

During each delivery, Renae did a quick scan. Brooke seemed reasonably healthy, and not too thin, but open wounds on her arms were getting worse. Renae could imagine why: Needles get dull with repeated use. Searching for a vein with a blunt needle creates bruising and wounds. And Renae assumed Brooke was sharing needles with friends who could have hepatitis C, HIV and other viruses. Transmissions are common among people without access to clean needles.

Renae knew clean needles could improve her daughter's health. She also knew a needle she dropped off might deliver her daughter's final shot of opioids, the one that would slow her breathing to a stop, turn her lips blue and end her life.

What was the lesser of two evils? Would Renae be encouraging, even sanctioning, Brooke's drug use by giving her needles, or helping prevent injury and disease? Was she using needles as a way to see her daughter more often?

""The swirl of emotions was just insane,"" Renae says. ""The guilt, the anxiety, the fear.""

Renae ruminated for weeks. ""It f****** spun like a record.""

In the end, the public health messages, and Renae's need to see Brooke, won out. She placed an order online.

/ /

When the syringes arrived, Renae drove to the trailer park where Brooke was staying and handed her daughter the box. Brooke doesn't have a clear memory of this moment that was so fraught for her mother. Renae remembers Brooke looking surprised, thankful and a little ashamed. Renae didn't stay long. But she found she was too sick to drive. The debate kept pounding in her head.

""What did you just do?"" Renae says she asked herself, again and again. ""My nerves were shot.""

But in the weeks that followed, Brooke's bruises disappeared and her wounds healed. Renae ordered more needles.

Possession of drug paraphernalia is a crime in many states. Renae didn't know if what she was doing was allowed. She decided she'd ask for forgiveness if she got caught.

Renae's effort would eventually become a registered syringe services program — a public health project to provide clean needles, medical care and referrals to treatment for people who use drugs.

Renae began adding items to her order, like alcohol pads and wipes, and increasing the quantities. Brooke kept giving away her needles and Narcan. Renae realized that trying to keep Brooke alive would mean supplying a whole bunch of other people, as well.

Renae was desperate to know the people her daughter shared food, shelter, drugs and Narcan with. Renae was counting on them to watch out for Brooke and save her daughter's life if needed. But Brooke was keeping her friends away from Renae. So Renae found a way to introduce herself.

Hot dogs, soda and chaos

On a sweaty summer afternoon, Renae filled one cooler with ice, beer, bottles of water and soda. She used another to keep hot dogs and burgers from a local place warm.

Renae drove to the edge of a vacant lot between some cheap hotels and tents, the area of town where Brooke was living. It's a predominantly Black neighborhood. Renae and her family are white. She pulled out a few lawn chairs, opened her trunk with the coolers, blasted her '80s rock playlist and lounged back with a can and dog.

/ /

Renae's rationale: ""Everybody likes to eat, and hell, everybody's nosy.""

Renae returned for several Saturdays, same drill. Eventually, people emptied her coolers and began to talk. Renae learned about another world of drug use. The people stopping for a burger and soda weren't injecting opioids. They were using ""bowls,"" or glass pipes, to smoke methamphetamine. Some passed around glass tubes called ""stems"" or ""roses"" for smoking crack, or straws for snorting cocaine.

Renae suspected this meant sharing diseases, as well. She made lists of new items to order. And she kept handing out Narcan because fentanyl was showing up in meth and coke — killing unsuspecting people.

At home, Renae searched for the best deals on supplies for people who use stimulants. More boxes arrived. Her credit cards were almost maxed out. And she was, too. Lots of people had her cell phone number. They'd call in the middle of Renae's work day or the middle of the night demanding needles, Narcan or some other kind of help.

/ /

""People expected I would drop what I was doing and go,"" Renae says. ""They'd say, 'If you don't come immediately then I'm going to die.' I played into that for a while. Then I realized it wasn't sustainable.""

That's when Renae opened her laptop and discovered a national network of current and former drug users, their allies and families doing many of the same things she was doing. The work had a name: harm reduction.

Organizing to show love

Renae's search connected her to groups offering free or discounted Narcan, needles and pipes. She made some new ""besties"" — veterans of the work she'd stumbled into. They helped her figure out how to run a program delivering care and supplies to hundreds of people who use drugs in her city — and try not to lose her mind.

/ /

Today Renae has a small team of volunteers. They set up in parks and vacant lots, where people move down a buffet line of crates and buckets. They fill plastic bags with drug supplies, condoms, dental dams, tampons, diapers and sometimes toothbrushes that a local church collects and donates.

Some people come just to say hi and get — or give — a hug. Renae's face lights up.

""The stuff is just the carrot I dangle before the horse so I can make a connection,"" Renae says. ""I want my community to know what it feels like to be really loved so they never settle for anything less.""

Renae scans arms and legs for wounds that need care. She gets updates on medical appointments, arrest warrants and rehab wait times. If Renae runs out of supplies or has to change locations, she sends an alert online.

Local police haven't blocked her outreach efforts. The county where she lives has seen an increase in overdose deaths since just before the pandemic, in line with a national rise, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

She still makes some on-demand deliveries, but very few.

""We're doing it right,"" she says.

But programs like the one Renae runs are illegal in parts of the country. Opponents say handing out needles enables drug use, addiction and death.

Brooke worries about her mom. Renae works in neighborhoods where gangs are active and people may be desperate for money. And Brooke says her mom ""takes s*** she don't deserve.""

Like the time a woman confronted Renae, saying Renae gave the woman's son a needle he used in what turned out to be a fatal overdose.

""Survivors' guilt is real,"" Renae says. ""And it broke my heart because he was dead. But I would still give him the needle because it might have saved his life too.""

About 200 people stop by the parks and vacant lots where Renae distributes needles and other supplies every week. She spends about a quarter of her income, or more than $1,200 a month. Renae doesn't like paperwork, but she might apply for nonprofit status to get a break on taxes. This would also make it easier to seek grants and accept donations.

These days, Renae laughs at the mama who drove around thinking she could scoop up her daughter and force her to stop using drugs. It's one version of tough love — an approach many parents, addiction counselors and former people who've used drugs say works. For Renae, ""tough love was torture."" But endless compassion, she says, can be pretty damn hard, too.

Inviting Brooke to use in the breakfast nook

Brooke would come home every now and then, in between her periods of sobriety, including four trips to rehab. Research suggests it can take people with a severe addiction four to five attempts at treatment over eight years on average before they achieve one year without drug use.

One afternoon about three years ago, Renae was in the kitchen when Brooke shuffled past her toward the bathroom. Renae could tell Brooke was in withdrawal and planning to use.

Many family members tell stories of trailing a child, spouse or parent to a bathroom or bedroom and listening — ear pressed to the door — for signs of life. Some were lucky to have naloxone with them. Others didn't get into the room until it was too late. Renae didn't want that to happen to Brooke.

/ /

""Why don't you just sit down in here,"" Renae remembers saying to Brooke. ""It's OK, I won't watch.""

Brooke hesitated. She wanted to use alone, but Renae would know what to do if Brooke needed help. Brooke went back to the table.

/ /

""It was weird though,"" Brooke says. ""I ain't going to lie, it was weird.""

Renae turned to face the kitchen sink. In a few minutes, when she heard whimpering, Renae looked back. Brooke had poked herself many times in her unsteady state. Renae saw blood on the floor.

""At that moment, I didn't feel like her mama,"" Renae says. ""She was a patient. She needed help.""

/ /

Renae wiped the blood off her daughter's arms and helped her calm down. Then, Renae did something else she'd never done before. She sat with Brooke for the shot, and stayed by Brooke's side until Renae was sure Brooke was not going to overdose. For this decision, Renae says, there was no time for internal debates.

""It's just what I knew had to happen,"" she says.

The afternoon cemented an unusual mother-daughter bond.

""For her to have the heart to do that for me?"" Brooke says and then pauses. ""I can't promise I could do that for my child. That takes some strong will.""

Years later, Renae continues standing watch, without judgment, for people using drugs.

In Renae's kitchen or backyard, people won't be robbed or raped while they are too sedated to fight off an attacker. They don't have to worry about heat stroke, drenching rain or cold nights.

If a guest nods off, Renae lets them sleep, on their side in case they throw up. If the person needs oxygen, Renae starts rescue breathing. She uses Narcan when breathing assistance isn't enough.

To Renae's way of thinking, the country already has supervised consumption sites. They're called bars. There are significant differences, but Renae is making a point heard often among people who use drugs. Addiction is the same disease — but alcohol is legal, while many other drugs are not.

There's no database of people like Renae — parents, friends and outreach workers who monitor drug use for people they care about. Those who have done it say it happens quietly, with little guidance and some shame, in bedrooms, cars and alleys.

""What I'm doing is not unusual. No, no, no,"" Renae says. ""My willingness to talk about it? Now, that's a different story.""

If there's a line Renae is not willing to cross to keep her loved ones alive, ""I ain't found it yet,"" she says.

Helping clients start treatment, even when that, too, may be illegal

Late in the afternoon, when Renae's backyard-based overdose prevention effort is wrapping up, a woman Renae's known for years comes by. Renae would be happy to monitor her use, but the woman says she just needs some needles and Narcan. A. tells Renae she's struggling to wean herself off fentanyl, and is only using enough of the powerful opioid to avoid withdrawal.

""But it's scary,"" A. says. ""If you're doing it, you're putting yourself at risk. And I'm fully aware of that every time.""

NPR/WBUR agreed to use A.'s first initial because she has a distinctive name.

A. recently tried to stop using fentanyl altogether and start treatment with Suboxone, a brand of the addiction medicine buprenorphine. But A. says a local treatment program required a 72-hour wait between her last shot of fentanyl and the first dose of Suboxone. It's a rule addiction specialists say is outdated. A. couldn't make it.

/ /

""I tried, but the withdrawal was so bad I wanted to kill myself,"" A. tells Renae. ""People say, 'Just get sick and get it over with,' but I can't.""

Renae listens, her hand on A.'s knee, as A. starts to cry. Then, here in her backyard, Renae offers another service aimed at keeping A. alive, one that also comes with legal risks. Renae shifts from monitoring drug use to offering treatment.

""When you're ready, I got you,"" Renae tells A., and explains her plan.

It's a technique called microdosing that is increasingly being used at many medical centers. A. would take tiny doses of Suboxone while she's tapering off fentanyl, which can ease the transition to the new drug. Renae isn't licensed to prescribe Suboxone, but either she or A. will find a way to get some. Renae says a half-dozen people she coached through microdosing Suboxone are still on it, and not fentanyl, two years later.

A. weighs Renae's offer. She isn't ready for another painful withdrawal, but with Renae's guidance, she's ""close, really close.""

""It does give me hope that she hasn't given up on me,"" A. says. ""It's just hard to believe I'm worth that.""

For Renae, this is the core of her work — relieving shame and helping restore dignity.

A. says lots of people are willing to help her as long as she does ""this or that."" With Renae, A. says, there are no expectations or judgment, just kindness and compassion.

""If there was more of that,"" A. says, ""I can't imagine how different things could be.""

No end in sight, but Brooke is alive

When A. leaves, Renae reviews the week ahead. She may have to cancel deliveries. An agency that was supposed to send needles isn't coming through, and she's out of money.

There are many weeks when Renae learns someone she knows has died after an overdose. Some days, it's hard to get out of bed. Seeing Brooke lifts Renae's spirits.

/ /

Brooke is no longer using opioids but says she smokes weed and takes other drugs recreationally. The mother and daughter still annoy each other sometimes, but they're repairing their relationship.

""Not everyone's got a mama like my mama,"" Brooke says with a laugh.

Renae used to think her goal was to keep her work going as long as Brooke needed help. But now Renae can't imagine stopping.

""I never intended to have this life. I thought I'd give her some Narcan to keep her alive, she'd go to rehab and everything would be OK,"" Renae says. ""Now, I can't turn away. I'm in it forever — or as long as I last.""

203,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,A jury decided Google's Android app store benefits from anticompetitive barriers,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-11/a-jury-decided-googles-android-app-store-benefits-from-anticompetitive-barriers,"SAN FRANCISCO — A federal court jury has decided that Google's Android app store has been protected by anticompetitive barriers that have damaged smartphone consumers and software developers, dealing a blow to a major pillar of a technology empire.

The unanimous verdict reached Monday came after just three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial revolving around a lucrative payment system within Google's Play store. The store is the main place where hundreds of millions of people around the world download and install apps that work on smartphones powered by Google's Android software.

Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed a lawsuit against Google three years ago, alleging that the internet powerhouse has been abusing its power to shield its Play Store from competition in order to protect a gold mine that makes billions of dollars annually. Just as Apple does for its iPhone app store, Google collects a commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within apps.

Apple prevailed in a similar case that Epic brought against the iPhone app store, but the 2021 trial was decided by a federal judge in a ruling that is under appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court.

But the nine-person jury in the Play store case apparently saw things through a different lens, even though Google technically allows Android apps to be downloaded from different stores — an option that Apple prohibits on the iPhone.

Just before the Play store trial started, Google sought to avoid having a jury determine the outcome, only to have its request rejected by U.S. District Judge James Donato. Now it will be up to Donato to determine what steps Google will have to take to unwind its illegal behavior in the Play Store. The judge indicated he will hold hearings on the issue during the second week of January.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney broke into a wide grin after the verdict was read and slapped his lawyers on the back and also shook the hand of a Google attorney, who he thanked for his professional attitude during the proceedings.

Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the trial's outcome.

204,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Children of jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi accept her Nobel Peace Prize,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-11/children-of-jailed-iranian-activist-narges-mohammadi-accept-her-nobel-peace-prize,"Typically, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize gives their acceptance lecture at the awards ceremony in Oslo, Norway – but this year's recipient, Narges Mohammadi, couldn't. She remains behind bars for her long-time human rights work advocating for women's rights and democracy in Iran.

So, at Sunday's ceremony, she was represented by her twin 17-year-old children — Ali and Kiana Rahmani — who delivered the speech on her behalf.

""I write this message from behind the high, cold walls of a prison,"" they read. ""I am an Iranian woman, a proud and honorable contributor to civilization, who is currently under the oppression of a despotic religious government.""

In the wake of the 2022 death of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, a 22-year-old who died while in custody of Iran's morality police, thousands of Iranians inside the country and around the world took to the streets in protest. Such protests have since escalated into calls for regime change. Mohammadi — who is vice president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center — has long campaigned against the death penalty of protestors, even while serving multiple sentences.

In her speech, Mohammadi paid tribute to those protestors, stating that she is just one of ""millions of proud and resilient Iranian women who have risen up against oppression, repression, discrimination, and tyranny.""

The prize was awarded to Mohammadi ""for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all,"" according to this year's announcementby Berit Reiss-Andersen, Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

""Her brave struggle has come with tremendous personal cost,"" Reiss-Andersen said.

Mohammadi has been arrested by the Iranian regime 13 times, convicted five times, and sentenced to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes for charges of ""spreading anti-state propaganda,"" according to the committee.

Mohammadi has been arrested by the Iranian regime 13 times, convicted five times, and sentenced to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes for charges of ""spreading anti-state propaganda,"" according to the committee.

In her closing thoughts, Mohammadi wrote she was confident ""that the light of freedom and justice will shine brightly on the land of Iran. At that moment, we will celebrate the victory of democracy and human rights over tyranny and authoritarianism, and the anthem of the people's triumph on the streets of Iran will resonate worldwide."" The speech was met with a standing ovation.

Mohammadi is the second Nobel Peace Prize recipient from Iran, after her mentor and colleague Shirin Ebadi, who won in 2003 and was in attendance at the ceremony.

205,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,"Here's the latest fallout at Harvard, MIT and Penn after the antisemitism hearing",https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-11/heres-the-latest-fallout-at-harvard-mit-and-penn-after-the-antisemitism-hearing,"Controversy over last week's congressional hearing regarding antisemitism on college campuses continues to play out at Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania.

Over the weekend, Penn President Liz Magill resignedafter calls mounted for her removal among students, faculty and donors. Now, all eyes are on Harvard and whether its president, Claudine Gay, will also step down amid intense pressure.

Critics say Magill, Gay and MIT president Sally Kornbluth failed to convince Congress and the public that they can adequately protect their Jewish students. Those concerns largely erupted after the university presidents were asked whether ""calling for the genocide of Jews"" would violate their school's code of conduct. Many felt their answers were too legalistic and lacked moral clarityat a time when both antisemitism and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim incidents are on the rise in the country.

But not everyone is in favor of their departure. A growing number of students and faculty oppose the calls for the presidents to go, arguing that such measures go against school values around independence and freedom speech.

Here's what to know:

Calls for Gay and Kornbluth's removal remain firm

On Monday, New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer told Morning Edition that he supported Gay's removal.

""This wasn't the first incident,"" he said. ""Despite the fact that these incidents have been brought to the attention of the president of Harvard and the other presidents, there's been no action.""

Gottheimer was one of the 74 members of Congress who signed a letter last week urging the governing boards of Harvard, Penn and MIT to remove their presidents. Congress continues to investigate their policies and disciplinary procedures.

In an open letter on Sunday night to Harvard's governing boards, alum and billionaire investor Bill Ackman also accused of Gay damaging the university's reputation.

""Knowing what we know now, would Harvard consider Claudine Gay for the position? The answer is definitively 'No,'"" he wrote, adding that the decision of whether to fire Gay ""could not be more straightforward.

Earlier on Sunday, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who posed the question around the schools' code of conduct, ominously wrote on X: ""One down. Two to go."" She added, ""@Harvard and @MIT, do the right thing. The world is watching.""

Support grows for MIT and Harvard presidents

On Monday, the executive committee of the Harvard Alumni Association expressed its support for Gay and asked the university's governing boards to publicly do the same.

""President Gay is the right leader to guide the University during this challenging time,"" the committee wrote. ""We are confident President Gay will address antisemitism, and other forms of hate, effectively and courageously.""

Similarly, over the weekend, more than 650 Harvard faculty members signed a letter to the university's top governing board, urging it to keep Gay as president, The Harvard Crimson reported. They stressed that yielding to such political pressures is at odds with the school's values around academic freedom.

""The critical work of defending a culture of free inquiry in our diverse community cannot proceed if we let its shape be dictated by outside forces,"" they wrote, according to The Crimson.

At MIT, the university's board said last week it stood by Kornbluth, adding that it has faith in her leadership, judgement and moral compass.

""She has done excellent work in leading our community, including in addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate, all of which we reject utterly at MIT,"" the MIT Corporation wroteon Thursday. ""She has our full and unreserved support.""

A moment unlike any other in college history

College campuses have long been a flashpoint for political controversies but the turmoil unfolding on school grounds over the Israel-Hamas war is also unprecedented in many ways.

Angus Johnston, a historian of American student activism at Hostos Community College of The City University of New York, said no issue in recent decades has divided student activists within the same school like the Israel-Hamas conflict.

""It is rare for there to be simultaneous protests on many American campuses where students are taking diametrically opposed positions,"" he said.

That's not only a challenge to navigate for peers, but also for university presidents, who are balancing the interests of students, faculty, donors and even lawmakers.

""The presidents of MIT, Harvard and UPenn were under fire in a tense, polarized Congressional hearing. That's a unique and different environment for most college presidents,"" said Jason Shepard, a communications professor at California State University, Fullerton.

He added that the current political climate is also complicated by social media, which can produce viral moments and knee jerk reactions.

""Ten-second snippets of viral videos can move like wildfire, and this sets up a whole new world for university presidents to effectively communicate with a broad and diverse range of constituencies,"" Shepard said.

This moment in higher education might become even more perilous with the fall of another university president, Johnston said.

""There is a huge amount of pressure right now on college presidents to restrain student protests,"" he said. ""If we see the departure of another very high profile university leader, then that pressure is going to mount even further.""

Fatal shooting in Largo leaves 1 man dead, another injured

The incident, the department said, occurred around 12:30 p.m. Monday in the 600 block of Harry S. Truman Dr. near the Truman Manor community. When officers arrived at the scene, they located two men suffering from gunshot wounds. First responders pronounced one man dead, while the other was taken to a hospital in stable condition.

Detectives are asking anyone who has any information related to the shooting to contact them.

That’s an idea Montgomery County officials considered in a hearing Monday.

A new bill #38-23, called the Right of First Refusal to Buy Rental Housing legislation, would do two things: if the owner of an apartment building wants to sell, Montgomery County could get first refusal on the property, and it would make it easier for tenants to buy a building themselves.

Council president Andrew Friedson says that under the current law, the county has to lay out millions of dollars to buy a building, then sell it to a non-profit group or tenants.

But as affordable housing is top of mind in Montgomery County, supporters say this bill could help meet demand.

""We want to address preservation with all the tools that we can and make sure that we’re doing so in a thoughtful way that puts the county and our non-profit partners in the best position possible without causing overly burdensome and unnecessary disruption in a fragile housing market,"" said Friedson."

The crash was reported Monday morning along the northbound lanes of the highway at Shady Grove Road in Gaithersburg.

Montgomery County Fire and Rescue spokesperson Pete Piringer said as many as 10 vehicles may be involved. At least one person was extracted.

All express lanes were also blocked while fire and rescue crews evaluated and transported drivers, Piringer posted online.

Piringer said crews are still evaluating those hurt, but it appears any injuries were not life-threatening.

Parts of Maryland, including Gaithersburg, saw some of their first snowflakes of the season early Monday morning. According to the National Weather Service, about 1.5 inches of snow was reported in the Gaithersburg area.

""I inherited the worst financial situation the state had ever been in and now, I'm turning it over to Governor Moore in the best financial state it's been in,"" said Hogan.

However, Governor Wes Moore is painting a far more troubling picture of the state's finances.

""Our budget problems started long before I took office. Of the last 20 state budgets, 17 needed cuts to stay balanced. We might not have caused this problem but we will address the problem,"" said Governor Moore in a speech to county administrators last week.

In a speech to county administrators last week, Governor Moore pointed to billions in federal COVID dollars which the state received during the Hogan administration.

""Extra money in the short term could pad the budget but extra money in the short term never fixed the budget. It was a mirage. Now we're forced to reckon with structural challenges that have plagued our state for years,"" said Governor Moore.

""It's not, as if, we don't have the money to spend. What we need is a little bit of fiscal responsibility. I think these excuses are an indication that they don't want to do that. They don't want to question their priorities they just want to raise taxes,"" said Del Robin Grammer.

The woman's story is one of several recent incidents painting a picture of growing frustration surrounding juveniles and crime - from assaults to armed robberies to carjackings.

For Miss Trudy, going by only her first name, a day of shopping turned into an evening nightmare.

""(They) said, where's the money, where's the money, where's the money. I started to get nervous at one time. One (suspect) came to the front and had here a gun and the other two, with the two bags I had, took it from me,"" said Miss Trudy.

The 79-year-old woman details what police are calling an armed robbery.

She had just arrived at her home on Raymonn Avenue near Sinclair Lane at about 6 p.m. Saturday, December 9. She was walking to her front door when she says she noticed three individuals, maybe 15, 16-years-old across the street.

""They run across the road and surrounded me around, asking, where's the money, where's the money? One came to the front and had here, a gun,"" she said.

Miss Trudy stood with one thought running across her mind.

""I'm going to die because the gun is at my head and the other two guys were around me,"" she said.

The young suspects demanded money but she had left her purse in the car. She was holding two shopping bags--the other two already placed on the porch.

Thinking quickly, Miss Trudy called the young suspects' attention to the bags on the steps.

""They probably didn't know it was groceries because I had them in the shopping bags. The grocery bags (were) inside the shopping bags, so they didn't know what was in it. The one with the gun just went and took the other two bags that were sitting there (on the porch) and they just ran up Sinclair Lane,"" she said.

The suspects ran off, and the victim left shaken and looked for family.

""I'm banging on the door, thinking somebody was home. Nobody was home at the time when I came. Usually, everybody's home,"" she said.

It was another frightening ordeal for a victim allegedly involving young thieves.

""Easy money, you know. (Those kids) don't want to work and they don't want to go to school and that's the problem,"" she said.

So far no arrests in this case. But police say they did arrest two 15-year-old boys in connection with an armed carjacking of a woman in northwest Baltimore that happened that same night.

According to the office, 29-year-old David Lee Bradby, of Baltimore, pleaded guilty Monday to making interstate threatening communications, related to text messages he sent to Victim 1, a woman living in West Virginia.



The guilty plea was announced by Erek Barron, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, and Acting Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office.

According to his guilty plea, between February 13, 2022, and May 24, 2022, Bradby sent 12 text communications to Victim 1 from six different mobile numbers to which Bradby subscribed. In the text messages, Bradby threatened to kill the victim and to assault her family members. Neither Bradby nor Victim 1 knew each other.

As detailed in his plea agreement, Bradby, a Black man, also admitted that in February 2022, he made threats to Victim 2, a Black female who lived in the Baltimore area. In making the threats to Victim 2, Bradby posed as J.M.S. and made virtually the same threats to Victim 2 as he had to Victim 1, who was also Black. Bradby also threatened to blow up Victim 2’s house, claimed to know where Victim 2 worked and included pictures and symbols used by the Ku Klux Klan in his messages to Victim 2. Bradby admitted that he sent the messages to Victim 2 to implicate J.M.S. Bradby and Victim 2 did not know each other.

217,[Maryland] https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local,Mayor Scott and leaders unveil $3 billion plan to address vacant property issue,https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/mayor-scott-and-leaders-unveil-3-billion-plan-to-address-vacant-property-issue,"Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, BUILD, and the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC) announced a landmark agreement to aggressively combat Baltimore City’s vacant and abandoned properties over the next 15 years. The agreement calls for strategic public investment to redevelop a minimum of 37,500 properties, with a clear plan to address as many as 45,000 properties.



The Scott administration pledged city investment of $300 million over 15 years to spark the project. That money – and other funding to be sought from the state of Maryland and private sector – will be used to generate as much as $3 billion to finance the redevelopment work over the course of effort.

“This historic partnership and the plan we’re putting forward is designed to fully address Baltimore’s vacant housing crisis for the first time in our city’s history,” said Mayor Brandon M. Scott. “The era of piecemeal work and backwards-looking strategies is over. With this partnership and the plan we’ve designed together, Baltimore City finally has a roadmap for solving this crisis once and for all, utilizing both innovative funding streams and tried-and-true development strategies. For me, this work is personal. Vacant properties and the challenges they pose to neighborhoods have been a constant backdrop for my entire life. We now know the path forward, and with the City’s partnership with BUILD and GBC, we will use every tool at our disposal to get it done.”

The agreement commits to meeting key community development standards and values, including a commitment to leverage at least $2 in direct private investment for every $1 of public money spent.

An analysis by Public Financial Management, national experts in public financing tools, determined that the public investment required – a minimum of $3.0 billion over the next 15 years – would more than pay for itself over time by expanding the city’s and state’s tax base while generating significant new economic activity for the city and state.

“This is a landmark day for the city of Baltimore and its residents. For far too long, vacant and abandoned properties have plagued our neighborhoods, leading to increased violence and stripping wealth from residents,"" said BUILD Clergy Co-Chair Rev. George Hopkins. “BUILD, GBC, and Mayor Scott are proud to have a firm, working agreement that – when fully implemented – will end this crisis once and for all. It will take all of us, as well as many other partners, to do this, but BUILD is committed to seeing this work through.""

For the last two years, BUILD has made addressing the city’s vacant and abandoned housing crisis citywide a top priority, building off the organization’s decades of work related to housing in different neighborhoods across the city. The new plan is the direct result of an agreement by the three parties in July 2023 to work together to address the crisis. The three entities came together to plan and hired consultants to support the work. This is the first time that BUILD, the GBC, and Baltimore’s Mayor have announced joint work since the creation of the College Bound Foundation 35 years ago.

""PFM's analysis demonstrates the long-term economic impact of prioritizing community revitalization and makes the case for the public and private investment needed to drive transformation in Baltimore's underserved neighborhoods. By partnering with the Mayor's Office, BUILD, and the many stakeholders who are deeply passionate about this issue, today marks progress toward the types of scalable solutions needed to address and combat long-standing complex challenges,"" said Greater Baltimore Committee President & CEO Mark Anthony Thomas. ""The GBC is honored to be a part of this work and we've made a long-term commitment to the multi-year effort required to create the impact necessary to meaningfully address this important issue.""

Baltimore has roughly 13,000 vacant and abandoned houses and structures, more than 20,000 vacant lots, and tens of thousands more homes that are affected because they are next to vacant and abandoned properties.

Vacant and abandoned homes directly impact the safety, health, and wealth of families. The same neighborhoods most impacted by the vacancy crisis have also been historically impacted by racially discriminatory housing policies and redlining practices in Baltimore.

Mayor Scott’s administration has already taken major steps to address Baltimore’s vacant and abandoned property crisis, a problem that has plagued the city for decades. Due to those efforts, the number of vacant properties in Baltimore is now the lowest it has been in decades.

The new plan seeks to leverage the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development’s (DHCD) existing slate of tools to expand ongoing redevelopment work, but will also introduce two new funding sources.

Under the new plan, the City of Baltimore will implement two novel strategies to facilitate the $300 million commitment: non-contiguous tax increment financing bonds (TIF) and reinstating the city’s Industrial Development Authority, which has not been utilized in more than 40 years. Notably, the TIFs, which have historically been primarily utilized in Baltimore to generate development of waterfront neighborhoods and large-scale downtown commercial projects, will now to be applied to the redevelopment of vacant properties in historically disinvested-in neighborhoods.

Additionally, the partnership will seek to obtain additional state housing funds, work to obtain a new public revenue stream – such as a share of state sales tax receipts – and secure new private and philanthropic investments.

The new plan sets key goals, including: “community-led development without displacement, building equity, and addressing the wealth gap through homeownership” – which will help create thriving mixed-income neighborhoods and housing that is safe and affordable. The plan also calls for a “whole-block” approach that invests in an entire neighborhood, with a focus on building on existing neighborhood assets.

In order to ensure the longevity and consistency for this long-term project over the course of 15 years, the parties will seek to utilize an existing “special purpose entity,” such as the Maryland Stadium Authority or Maryland Economic Development Corp. (MEDCO), to help facilitate some of the funding streams and ensure the agreement is maintained.

After losing their homes to a massive sinkhole last July, last week, the city finally agreed to reimburse them for their losses.

But their excitement was short-lived once they saw the dollar amount being offered.

“I miss it a lot, I miss it a whole lot,” said homeowner Quentin Bell as he looked out over the empty lot where his home once stood. Now, Bell stands alone, paying a mortgage on a home that no longer exists.

“You might think I’m joking, but I’m not,” says Bell.

FOX45’s cameras have followed along, capturing the collapse and changes to Bell’s property. What started as a three-story row home became a construction zone overnight. When construction closed, a patch of dirt was all that was left behind. A dirt patch that eventually turned into a plot of weeds. Weeds that continue to grow with Bell’s frustrations.

“It doesn’t make sense,” said Bell.

Bell says it feels like a lifetime ago that a 115-year-old stone arch storm drain crumbled beneath the ground, causing a massive sinkhole that forced the demolition of his home and several others.

And yet, when it comes to compensation, Bell still hasn’t been provided a penny. Not from his insurance, who found the city’s failing infrastructure at fault. And not from the city, which claimed North Avenue residents should have given

“Which we couldn’t do because we can’t see through the ground,” said Bell, “It’s ridiculous for taxpayers like us to have to go through something like this. I pay my taxes, I pay my water bill, and I try to do everything the right way, and then, something like this happens. To me, as a citizen, it should be faster.”

ALSO READ |

Out of options, Bell ended up hiring a lawyer to sue the city. A lawsuit the city attempted to dismiss, then delayed.

“Got a trial date; that was postponed,” said Bell.

Months later, the city is now refusing to hand over critical documents to Bell’s lawyer. Many of them are simple requests, including any prior records of the storm drain’s needed repairs, all internal communication following the storm drain's collapse, and copies of the storm drain’s inspection reports. According to the city, those claims would be “unduly burdensome” to fulfill.

This, as a

“They didn’t do nothing. Just string us on, string us on, string us on,” said Bell.

And now, what should be a welcome surprise is only adding insult to injury.

“It was just so low it didn’t even feel like an offer,” said Bell.

The city appraised Bell’s home at $120,000 and offered to reimburse him $90,000 for his losses. Far less than Bell was expecting.

“The appraisal that my lawyer did was based on a three-story row home. The city went out and did an appraisal on a two-story row home,” said Bell, “That’s like saying an apple is the same as an orange. You can’t do that!”

Bell’s lawyer ordered an independent appraisal from Lipman Frizzell & Mitchell LLC, a local real estate valuation and consulting firm. They claim Bell’s home was actually worth $315,000. A whopping $225,000 more than what the city is offering to pay.

“That’s just ridiculous!” exclaimed Bell, “All this pain and suffering that me and my neighbors doing, they should pay us whatever our house is worth and plus more.”

Feeling abandoned, short-changed, and strung along, Bell just has one question left for the city.

“How would they feel if they was in my shoes?” he asks."

The amendments would be made to a bill two years in the making that was meant to strengthen the inspector general’s office. But just before the bill was brought to a vote last Monday, Jones suggested a slew of amendments that would instead weaken the office. However, Jones has since walked back at least one of the changes.

The advisory board Jones was proposing included mostly county officials. Those officials would be tasked with reviewing and approving the IG’s reports before they were published. It would mean that the very people the IG is supposed to be investigating for waste fraud and abuse would be the ones overseeing the IG's work.

Following backlash from critics pointing out the direct conflict of interest, Jones is now proposing an advisory board of mostly private citizens, apart from the Executive Director of the Baltimore County Ethics Commission serving as the board’s chair.

However, Baltimore County Inspector General Kelly Madigan is still against any and all amendments. She sent the following statement to FOX45 in response to Jones’ revisions:

The Office of the Inspector General continues to oppose the recent amendments to Bills 83-23 and 84-23, which were recently made public by County Council Chairman Julian Jones. These amendments do not reflect the recommendations made by the Blue Ribbon Commission for Ethics and Accountability and are not consistent with best practices within the inspector general community. The Office continues to urge all Baltimore County residents to contact their local councilmember and voice their opposition to any changes to Bills 83-23 and 83-24.

Madigan also isn’t alone in her outrage; the Association of Inspector General’s made an official announcement condemning the amendments, arguing they would “undermine the well-supported findings of the Commission and restrict the Office of the Inspector General’s ability to perform its work in an effective and independent manner.”

Through a public records request, FOX45 News learned more about what was going on inside and outside the Belair Edison Safe Streets site before the FBI came knocking on Oct. 26, 2023.

In August, the Belair Edison Neighborhoods, Inc. sent emails to LifeBridge Health Center for Hope – which manages the Belair Edison Safe Streets site – asking about late rent payments.

“We have reached out on multiple occasions to resolve the late payment issue and have not received any correspondence or resolution,” one email dated Aug. 3 read.

That email continued that because “every rent has been more than 20 days late we will be requiring a security deposit with the lease renewal.” It was also revealed in the documents that the water bill for the Safe Streets site had not been paid since October 2022.

ALSO READ |

LifeBridge Health is one of two non-profits awarded contracts to operate the Safe Streets program. The Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, MONSE, awards the contracts and provides support to the program as it’s implemented. In addition to LifeBridge Health – which runs six Safe Streets sites -- MONSE awarded contracts to Catholic Charities to manage the other four Safe Street sites in Baltimore.

At one point, state Sen. Cory McCray, D-Baltimore City, was copied on the emails and was involved in communication with MONSE executive staff, facilitating a response. Sen. McCray’s district includes the Belair-Edison neighborhood.

In an email, Adam Rosenberg, who is the executive director for LifeBridge Center for Hope, apologized for the late payments and assured the folks at Belair Edison Neighborhoods, Inc. that the past due amount would be swiftly resolved.

“I do not have an adequate explanation,” Rosenberg wrote.

In a statement to FOX45 News on Dec. 11, a spokesperson for LifeBridge Health said all bills had been paid and accounts are up to date.

ALSO READ |

“We have put procedures in place to ensure timely payment moving forward. Regarding operations at the site, we are working with MONSE and community members to address staffing levels at the Belair-Edison site to ensure that the site can be operated safely,” the statement continued.

Questions about what procedures are now in place were not immediately answered by LifeBridge Health.

Meanwhile, after the FBI executed the search warrant at the Belair Edison Safe Streets site, staffers within MONSE were working to update other staff and craft a public response, according to internal communications obtained by FOX45 News.

In a draft letter dated Nov. 2 – one week after the federal search warrants were executed – staff with LifeBridge planned to alert community partners about what happened at the Belair Edison Safe Streets site. Based on versions reviewed by FOX45 News, MONSE staff provided edits to the statement. It’s not clear what version was eventually released.

In addition to the Safe Street site, the FBI also executed search warrants at two Belair Edison Safe Streets employees’ homes; David Caldwell, the site supervisor, was one of those employees. He’s currently facing state-level charges after law enforcement allegedly found ammunition in his home during the search. Caldwell is currently on unpaid leave while his legal trouble unfolds. Caldwell is set to go to trial on Jan. 3, 2024 after his original trial date was postponed due to the federal search warrant remaining sealed.

It’s unclear who the other Safe Streets employee who had federal agents show up at their home. Mayor Brandon Scott, MONSE staff, and LifeBridge Health have refused to provide the names of the Safe Streets employees.

Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman encourages residents to bring reusable bags with them to shop, in an effort to help protect the environment.



“Our residents take pride in the beauty and natural resources of the land and water where we live,” said County Executive Pittman in the news release. “This bag ban is a collective act that will make this place both cleaner and healthier for our residents and our wildlife.”

Retail establishments may provide paper carry-out bags and reusable carry-out bags at no cost until Feb. 1, 2024, after which they must charge at least 10 cents to cover the cost of each paper bag. There are exceptions to the plastic bag ban for certain approved uses, including for bags that contain, package, or wrap raw meat.

The new law aims to significantly reduce the contribution to plastic waste, litter, and pollution by reducing the number of single-use plastic carryout bags. The plastics typically used in bags contain chemical additives that become microplastics that pollute the environment and pose serious health threats to both humans and wildlife.
