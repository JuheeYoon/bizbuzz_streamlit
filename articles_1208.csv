On December 6, 2023, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose W. Fernandez hosted the Economic Health Dialogue of the Americas (EHA) Strategic Summit alongside Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Minister of Health for Uruguay, Karina Rando, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) with country representatives from 18 countries.

Presentations were made from EHA co-lead countries of Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, and the United States on the advancement of our work in four key workstreams – smart spending for health and health resource analysis; prioritization of health sector transformation; social protection in emergencies; and foundations for strengthening supply chains. The meeting served as an opportunity for countries to learn more about the progress of the EHA and begin strategic planning for the next EHA Ministerial Meeting in March 2024.

The EHA comprises a series of official sector-only meetings aimed at fostering the political will and commitments necessary to strengthen public health systems and protect economies in the region. Launched by Secretary Blinken at the Ninth Summit of the Americas in June 2022, the EHA actively supports countries in the region in coordinating efforts for health system resilience, as well as in identifying and leveraging best practices in the public sector, with a focus on the intersections of health and the economy. This initiative receives joint support from the U.S. Department of State, PAHO, the IDB, and the Organization of American States."
5,Secretary Antony J. Blinken and Human Rights Leaders Before Their Meeting,https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-human-rights-leaders-before-their-meeting/,"Secretary Antony J. Blinken and Human Rights Leaders Before Their Meeting

SECRETARY BLINKEN: All right, well, good afternoon, everyone. I just had a few words I wanted to say at the top of our meeting, and I’m grateful to see each and every one of you. Seventy-five years ago in the aftermath of World War II, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, nations came together from around the world to affirm what was then a radical idea: that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and in rights. Those are the words at the heart of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.

Delegates from around the world defined the rights in the Universal Declaration. And in a sense more than a declaration, it was a commitment, a commitment to actually promote human rights, to prevent violations, to defend victims, to hold perpetrators accountable. That is at the heart of what the world came together to agree to.

In the decades since, the United States has worked to make real our own commitment to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights – both here at home but also around the world. Defending human rights, affirming human dignity, simply put, reflects our values, reflects who we are. And at the same time, it advances our interests. When more people in more places have their rights respected, we know – we know from experience that the world is more peaceful, it’s more secure, it’ more prosperous, and so it’s a better world for us as well.

President Biden has made promoting and defending human rights a priority for our foreign policy, and it’s a priority for this department. It’s a priority in every – in every bureau of this department, in every part of the world. Our efforts are especially important as the universality of human rights is under severe challenge and rights are being violated in far too many places. We see repression by autocratic regimes. We see the denial of opportunities because of people – because of who people are, where they were born, what they believe. And of course we see atrocities in the midst of conflict.

Just yesterday we made a determination that both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces in Sudan are engaged in war crimes. We’re also seeing different forms of abuse being committed, including the misuse of emerging technologies to repress the rights of people.

I think as you look back at 75 years ago and what was on the minds as well as in the hearts of the drafters of the Universal Declaration, one of the things that they understood – and it’s clear from the history of that period – is that there was a recognition that realizing human rights was going to be an ongoing process. It was not flipping a lightswitch. It is constantly a process. And in that process, we always have to strive to hold ourselves to the standards that we aspire to.

Human rights organizations like the ones represented at this table today and that I look forward to hearing from in just a couple of minutes are absolutely essential in that effort. They’ve been partners for decades, and they play a critical role, maybe a leading role in holding us accountable and making sure that to the best of everyone’s ability the gap between our ideals and what we aspire to and the reality of what we’re doing is as narrow as possible, if not completely eliminated.

So I just want to say to each and every one of you representing so many of your colleagues, we’re grateful for the work that you do – the truly courageous work that you do – because you have so many people in areas of conflict doing the work, doing the reporting, bringing out the facts, bringing out the truth.

And I can tell you that from our perspective, from my perspective, that’s absolutely essential to making the world a better place, a safer place. There’s no better way to mark the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration than meeting with the people who are actually on the front lines of human rights every single day, on the front lines of trying to make the commitments that were made so many years ago real. And so thank you for being here, and I look forward to the conversation."
6,Secretary Antony J. Blinken at the Anti-Corruption Champions Award Ceremony,https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-anti-corruption-champions-award-ceremony-2/,"ASSISTANT SECRETARY ROBINSON: Good morning, everybody. Before we get started this morning, I’d like to acknowledge the tragedy in the Seychelles. Commissioner De Silva, our thoughts are with you and your country, your people, at this time.

It’s an honor to welcome this year’s Anti-Corruption Champions Award honorees. Thank you for joining us here today and from across the globe. My name is Todd Robinson, the assistant secretary of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, or INL as it’s better known. And let me give you just a little bit of an overview of what we’re going to do this morning.

We have, as you see, a high-powered lineup for you today – (laughter) – starting with Secretary Antony Blinken, who has made it his business since day one to place the fight against corruption at the center of our foreign policy. We also have here from – we will also hear from Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Uzra Zeya, a diplomat with three decades of experience around the world, and my boss. (Laughter.) And Richard Nephew, our global anti-corruption coordinator, is going to introduce our honorees today. We will also have an opportunity to hear from one of our inspiring award recipients.

As I mentioned, the fight against corruption is front and center in our U.S. foreign policy. As I’m sure our honorees can attest, this fight is a difficult one, but from Europe to Africa to Central America, we have seen remarkable wins in 2023.

In Guatemala, there was an election victory by a presidential candidate, Bernardo Arévalo from the Semilla party, who ran on a platform of weeding out corruption.

In Ukraine, INL works closely with anti-corruption investigators and prosecutors, who this year alone have opened cases against over 20 high-level government officials, including the former chief justice of the supreme court. Since the summer, Ukraine has advanced significant reform measures, including requiring government officials to declare their assets and adding judges to the High Anti-Corruption Court.

In Liberia, our embassy’s stalwart support for action against corruption has put compromised officials on the defensive and is fueling the Liberian public’s desire for increased accountability and sanctions.

As you’ll see shortly, the tenacious men and women with us here today are responsible for successes like these. Tenacious, but also – let’s not forget – fearless. Corruption is silent, secret, and corrosive. People know it’s out there but it’s difficult to root out. That has not deterred our honorees, who have joined this fight at great personal and professional risk, but not without recognition. To today’s honorees, we see what you are doing and we applaud it.

With that, I would like to invite Under Secretary Zeya. (Applause.)

UNDER SECRETARY ZEYA: Thank you to my dear friend, Assistant Secretary Robinson. Your leadership on this issue set has been indispensable. Secretary Blinken, Coordinator Nephew, colleagues and friends, I am delighted to be here today to celebrate these courageous honorees.

This weekend, we will commemorate the 20-year anniversary of the first and only global anti-corruption instrument, the UN Convention Against Corruption, or UNCAC. This distinguished group, through their advocacy and actions, embodies the central message of that consequential document: The betrayal of the public trust will no longer be tolerated.

The drafters of UNCAC, which included the United States, understood the corrosive impact of corruption and recognized it as a transnational challenge. It affects all countries, regardless of the level of development, political system, or history. Thus, preventing and countering corruption is a shared responsibility among all countries.

UNCAC responded to these threats by providing governments with the tools to counter this scourge at the global level. The convention endures. Its comprehensive set of standards, measures, and rules are even more relevant today than they were 20 years ago. What we’ve learned since the UNCAC’s adoption is that while corruption is a cross-cutting global challenge, every country experiences it in different ways, which requires tailored solutions.

For example, in Moldova, through the courageous work of President Sandu’s administration, the country is countering Russia’s interference and the actions of other corrupt actors by fortifying its democracy, modernizing its economy, and aligning its institutions with its European neighbors. I myself had the privilege of visiting Moldova last week, and I was honored to meet with Minister of Justice Veronica Mihailov-Moraru, who is on the front lines of these efforts and is one of the champions that we are celebrating here today.

For our part, President Biden has elevated anti-corruption as a core national security interest. We’re actively implementing the first-ever U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption that the President issued two years ago. Now, this strategy has domestic and international components, acknowledging that we must combat corruption here at home as well as prioritize it in our foreign policy. We’re also committed to working with all of you, the honorees here today and all of those who stand with us across the globe, dedicated to shining a light on corrupt behavior.

When Secretary Blinken launched the Anti-Corruption Champions Award in 2021, we not only wanted to celebrate you, but we also want to learn from your invaluable expertise and experience. The fight against corruption is a collective effort, and thus we must foster critical engagement across public and private institutions and across borders. This will bolster our policies and advance the unshakable principles of accountability and integrity ingrained in the UNCAC.

So thank you all for joining us here today, and congratulations again to our honorees.

I now have the immense honor of introducing an admired friend and a phenomenal boss, Secretary of State Antony Blinken. (Applause.)

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.

AUDIENCE: Good morning.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: So this is a day, a moment I’ve been looking forward to. And we’ll share the reasons why in just a minute. But first, let me say to Under Secretary Zeya, to Assistant Secretary Robinson, to our Coordinator Nephew: Thank you not just for today, but for the extraordinary work you’re doing every day, including and notably on taking the fight to corruption.

In public service – whether in government or in civil society – I know it can feel at times like the challenges are just too big; the forces arrayed against change too strong, too entrenched to make meaningful progress.

One of the things that I love most about this ceremony each year is that every one of our awardees has proved that idea wrong. There is no force against progress that is actually immovable. You’ve demonstrated with your work, with your courage, with your commitment that it can be done. Even in places where impunity is the rule, you’ve shown how determined individuals can tip the balance, make the difference toward justice.

Today, we gather not only to honor these extraordinary champions, but to learn from them. Corrupt officials and their partners are constantly borrowing from each other’s playbooks. Well, governments, organizations, citizens committed to fighting corruption need to do the same thing, because in so many different ways, in so many different places, each of you has found a particular angle, a particular way of being effective in combatting corruption. And so the more we’re talking to each other, the more we’re listening and learning from you, the more effective we are going to be.

Now, before speaking to the accomplishments of the awardees, let me underscore that no matter who they are or where they work, none of them does this alone – and I know you would be the first to say that.

Indeed, one of the reasons that these leaders are so effective is because they inspire others to join them. So today, we’re honoring not only these 11 champions, but all of their partners.

Including their teammates here at the State Department. Every awardee was nominated by American diplomats around the world, most of whom work side-by-side with all of our champions to advance our shared priorities.

Take any goal of our foreign policy, anything that we really care about – expanding economic opportunity, empowering underserved communities, enhancing security, defending human rights – all of them are served by building more accountable institutions, more accountable societies, more transparency.

So we have an abiding interest in rooting out corruption – both to improve lives in local communities and to build more prosperous, more secure, more rights-respecting partners for the American people.

As we were looking at the awardees and learning from their stories, I think what’s powerful is you can really draw lessons from each of their work. And I’ve seen, as we’ve been talking about this together, maybe five things that really jump out. So let me share those with you in talking about the awardees.

First, a key part of combatting corruption is working to reform corrupt institutions from within wherever possible. That’s a very powerful thing.

You heard reference to Veronica Mihailov-Moraru and what she’s done in the Republic of Moldova. Having worked as a public defender, she knew firsthand how broken her country’s justice system was, but that didn’t stop her from working to overhaul the justice ministry when offered the chance to lead it. That’s change from within. Veronica designed and implemented a rigorous vetting process to root out corrupt judges, corrupt prosecutors; she helped reform the country’s anticorruption agencies. She’s made a point of pursuing these reforms out in the open, not a secret, modeling the transparency she’s trying to foster, and that in turn has allowed her to build broad public support for this work.

Vladimir Novovic made a similar leap when he left his post as a judge to become Montenegro’s chief prosecutor for organized crime, corruption, war crimes, terrorism, and money laundering. That’s a portfolio. He inherited an ineffective and an infiltrated institution, in a country where citizens were disillusioned by graft that they were experiencing every single day in their institutions. By pursuing investigations of corrupt judges, of national security officials, senior police, Vladimir showed citizens that even the most powerful people are not above the law. Since he took office, public trust in the corruption prosecutor’s office has doubled.

As Liberia’s anti-corruption commissioner, Marc Kollie led a series of investigations that uncovered bribery of powerful politicians in exchange for favors. Despite being threatened, Marc pursued his work. He testified in the case, and then went on to lead other groundbreaking investigations, including one in which he froze bank accounts being used by organized crime to launder money. His efforts demonstrated how a few committed individuals can turn government institutions from sources of corruption into sources of accountability.

Second broad lesson that I’m drawing from our awardees: When they’re informed, when they’re empowered, citizens – citizens – are our most effective anti-corruption allies.

So Nikhil Dey has spent more than four decades in India working with and for those harmed by corruption, and those particularly who are harmed most by it: underserved, marginalized populations. Nikhil has helped communities in Rajasthan demand access to essential services and rights – education, health care, fair wages, better working conditions. His organization pioneered the practice of public audits, in which local officials have to report to communities how and where they spend the resources, and citizens have a chance themselves to ask probing questions of these officials. As these public audits spread across India, more citizens started taking the lead in holding officials to account. And that, at its heart, is how democracy needs to work.

After decades of writing about corruption and organized crime for Ecuador’s newspapers, Arturo Torres founded an independent media site to report on these issues. In a series of articles, Arturo and his team combined rigorous analysis of publicly available information with deep investigations to uncover the corrupt ties of candidates for judges, for mayors, and other important public offices. In a country of 16 million people, the website’s reporting garnered 18 million views in just a couple of months – 16 million people in the country, 18 million views in a couple of months. That showed the public hunger for this information and for the incredibly powerful role it can play in informing voters.

Third, more than ever, if we’re going to address corruption effectively, we also have to address forces outside our countries that are looking to weaponize corruption for their gain.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jean-Claude Mputu has helped lead “Congo is Not for Sale.” That’s a civil society coalition that uncovers the way mining deals have benefitted foreign companies, governments, and corrupt officials at the expense of the people. By exposing the bribes that were used to win these contracts and the billions in lost revenue to the state, the investigations led the DRC Government to try to recover funds for the Congolese people, and has resulted in international sanctions against corrupt businesses and corrupt investors.

In Timor-Leste, reporting by Francisco Belo Simoes da Costa showed the way a Beijing-based company used bribes to win a contract to digitize the country’s national television broadcast corporation. Francisco uncovered the way a corrupt official profited by awarding the contract with no competition. His reporting also showed the way the agreement would have allowed the Chinese Government to disseminate propaganda throughout the Timorese nation. Francisco’s reporting prevented the tainted deal from going forward, it sparked an investigation by Timor-Leste’s anti-corruption commission, which is ongoing.

For advocate Stanislau Ivashekvich, fighting for accountability, for transparency, for space for civil society in Belarus has long meant taking on the country – excuse me, he’s taking on the country working with Belarus’s dictator to try to quash it, and that is Russia. Stanislau’s organization, the Belarus Investigative Center, has shone a spotlight on the ways that Russia and Belarus collaborate to try to evade sanctions, to enrich oligarchs, to fuel Moscow’s war of aggression against Ukraine. His organization’s reporting has been critical to closing sanctions loopholes, seizing the illicit assets of Russian officials and oligarchs.

Fourth broad lesson: Every individual that we’re honoring today has made educating, inspiring, and mentoring young people a key part of their work.

With Anette Plannells leading civil society campaigns resulting in the first-ever prosecution of high-ranking officials in Panama – even as she was doing that, she also helped build a youth wing of the nation’s anti-corruption movement. Thanks to her trainings, thanks to her workshops, not only are countless Panamanians more engaged citizens, but scores of young people have now been inspired to pursue careers in advocacy and in elective office. And so a whole new generation is coming up at the same time thanks to her work that she was engaged in, the work of the of the moment.

As the Seychelles anti-corruption commissioner, May De Silva – you already heard reference to her before – has built an unprecedented case against businesses and former officials for international tax evasion. At the same time, she’s designed and implemented seminars, conferences, workshops, an anti-corruption curriculum – all of this for students in schools and for colleges across the country. She says her goal is to show how corruption eats away at societies, but also what every citizen can do to fight it.

In Kyrgyzstan, Ali Toktakunov leads MediaHub. This is an independent news outlet that exposes corruption and shows corrupt actors and how they’re using social media to try to hide, to obfuscate their crimes. A key part of MediaHub’s efforts is building greater digital literacy among young people, something that they’re doing by holding workshops across the country’s universities, so that individuals are better prepared, better equipped to detect and call out online disinformation.

Fifth and finally, every one of these champions – every one – has in some fashion been subject to repression, to threats, to persecution for their work. Several had been forced into exile. Many are subject to ongoing legal proceedings. Some had been locked up. Their families have also been threatened. One of our awardees said that his small children can no longer play in public playgrounds and parks because of targeted threats.

And yet, each and every one of them persists. They continue to do the work. As awardee Arturo Torres said, “It’s part of the job.”

To all of today’s awardees, your bravery, your commitment to truth, to justice – it humbles us, it inspires us to do more, and it adds even greater urgency to the enduring effort to strengthen protections for advocates, for human rights defenders, for journalists, for educators around the world who are threatened and attacked for the work they’re doing to fight corruption and to better their societies.

As you’ve heard from Under Secretary Zeya, Assistant Secretary Robinson, this has been a top priority for President Biden, for this administration, for this department from day one. We’ll keep working to build effective ways to have the backs of those who are at risk and to hold perpetrators to account.

I know that there are folks watching today who are leading hard fights for transparency and good governance in hard places. And I know there have to be days when you feel disillusioned, when you feel isolated, when you feel fearful.

So I hope, if nothing else, you’ll take heart from today, you’ll take heart from the stories of your colleagues around the world who are doing such remarkable work in the ways that you are – doing it a great cost, at great risk, but doing it.

And I hope that today’s ceremony reminds us that, again, the actions of determined individuals can make a difference, are making a difference. They can puncture the seemingly impenetrable walls of impunity. They can rekindle citizens’ faith in their own capacity to make governments and institutions work for them.

Indeed, they and you are often the only way that change effectively happens.

To all the anti-corruption champions far beyond this room, please know you have a partner in the United States.

With that, it is my honor to give the floor to one of our awardees so deserving who can speak most effectively for all of our awardees, Minister Mihailov-Moraru.

Minister, congratulations. The floor is yours. (Applause.)

JUSTICE MINISTER MIHAILOV-MORARU: Good morning. Honorable Secretary Blinken, colleagues and new friends, ladies and gentlemen, I am very honored to be with you here and be among of this group of all about – with all remarkable activists, journalists, and public officials you have brought together from all around the world. Thank you very much for all the appreciation. I am not sure I actually deserve this recognition or to be in the company of this inspiring group of people, but I am very grateful for the honor and I will use it as a reminder and motivation when I need it to persist and to press forward against the resistance we encounter every day in fighting corruption in Moldova and around all the world.

The Republic of Moldova is currently undergoing broad reform in its justice sector, addressing challenges relating to integrity, accessibility, efficiency, and widespread lack of trust. Corruption remains, unfortunately, a central obstacle to the formation of trust in government in Moldova. But one of our main goals in my country is to improve living standards, to change society’s perception of the independence of the judicial system in order to ensure transparency, but also their responsibility, and ultimately to increase trust in the acts of justice. And this can only be happen by fighting everywhere and with increasing success against corruption.

Corruption, of course, is not unique to Moldova. It is a global problem that affects us all. Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gains, and it undermines the rule of law, the legitimacy of government, and the trust of citizens. Corruption is a threat to the realization of the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to create a better and more sustainable future for all.

But I am sure that corruption is not inevitable. It can be prevented and combated through effective anti-corruption policies, practices, and a lot of courage. Anti-corruption efforts vary in scope and strategy and include both preventive and reactive measures – preventive measures to reduce the opportunities for – of corruption actions, but reactive measures – detect, investigate, prosecute, and sanction corruption and return stolen assets.

In Moldova, we have committed to implement de-oligarchization measures to eliminate excessive influence of powerful and at times dangerous vested interest in economic, political, and public life. We have taken action to fortify our agencies charged with responsibility for investigation and prosecution of high corruption act cases. We have modernized our legislation for combating money laundering and terrorism financing, and also we are in the process to improve our asset recovery mechanism.

But this is only the beginning, and we in Moldova cannot do this alone, of course. None of us can. So we are committed to increasing our mutual legal cooperation, including on financial investigations, international and organized crime cases, to identify and to recover criminal assets. But we also need, as do anti-corruption fighters in every country, the commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders, including the international community, the private sector, civil society, journalists, and academia.

So I really believe that every effort counts. Only together we can make a difference and create a more transparent, accountable, and inclusive society for ourselves and for future generations.

During IVLP meetings throughout this week, I was inspired by some quotes. Finding and fighting corruption – your anti-corruption fight is our fight. And I want to thank to the American people for the inspiration and all the support toward rule of law.

Let me please on behalf of all the IVLP group to receive our gratitude to all of you for your attention, and for the honor you bestow, and the kindness, and the continuing support you have shown to all of us. Thank you very much. (Applause.)"

8,U.S. Commitments at the 2023 Accra Peacekeeping Ministerial,https://www.state.gov/u-s-commitments-at-the-2023-accra-peacekeeping-ministerial/,"The United States thanks the Republic of Ghana for hosting the 2023 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial in Accra on December 5-6, 2023. We and other participating Member States are united behind a common cause to strengthen UN and regional peace operations by pledging willing and able uniformed forces, enhanced capabilities that promote the highest standards of performance and accountability, and new capacity building resources to enable peacekeepers to safely and effectively implement their mandates. Our collective efforts seek to uphold and expand our commitments under the UN’s Action for Peacekeeping agenda, operationalize the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women in peace operations, and enhance environmental management in the field.

Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s participation at the Ministerial highlights U.S. leadership and commitment to improving peacekeeping effectiveness. The United States believes in the critical importance of UN peacekeeping as a tool to prevent conflict and protect civilians. The United States further upholds the strategic and operational imperative of women in leadership and decision-making roles in the peacekeeping context, and in a demonstration of U.S. support for UN gender goals, the U.S. Ministerial delegation was led by and largely comprised of powerful women leaders.

The United States is equally striving to achieve climate-related targets in peacekeeping. Toward this end, we hosted a ministerial side event on improving environmental management in UN peace operations. The event explored innovative partnerships that support troop and police contributing countries’ (T/PCC’s) efforts to address UN environmental goals, with a focus on transitioning contingent owned equipment to more sustainable technologies. The event also looked forward to new and emerging partnerships that contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals through T/PCC and donor partnerships across energy, water, and sanitation initiatives that promote cleaner and greener UN peacekeeping.

Reflective of our commitment to these peacekeeping objectives, the United States is the world’s single largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping, as well as the largest provider of peacekeeping capacity-building support. Since 2005, we have invested nearly $1.8 billion in assistance specifically focused on enhancing T/PCC capabilities and performance in UN and regional peace operations. In fiscal year 2023 alone, we committed more than $74 million through our two primary peacekeeping capacity-building programs: the U.S. Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) and the International Police Peacekeeping Operations Support Program (IPPOS). And the United States plans to sustain our investments in the development of critical mission capabilities assisting partner T/PCCs with training, equipment, infrastructure improvements, and institutional capacity building to effectively prepare, deploy, and sustain peacekeeping units.

To continue our robust and longstanding peacekeeping capacity-building efforts, address UN Action for Peacekeeping priorities, and support ambitious action globally, on December 6, 2023, the United States pledged to:

1) Operationalize our Commitment to Women, Peace, and Security Objectives through the Establishment of a New Partnership to Implement a Women’s Body Armor Pilot Project. The United States continues to prioritize and undertake initiatives that promote the full, equal, and meaningful participation and operational imperative of women in peacekeeping. In recognition of Ghana’s and Zambia’s leadership in expanding the meaningful participation of women in UN peacekeeping deployments, the United States, the Netherlands, Ghana, and Zambia are partnering on a quadrilateral women’s body armor pilot program.

This partnership is being launched in response to needs cited in relevant studies and barriers-to-women assessments regarding the issue of ill-fitting equipment and, specifically, the inadequacy of “unisex” protective equipment for women peacekeepers. The United States and the Netherlands will provide an initial investment of nearly $3 million that will equip deployed women peacekeepers from Ghana and Zambia with women-specific body armor.

2) Support Efforts to Address Persistent Peacekeeping Capacity Gaps to Enhance Peacekeeper Safety and Security and Protection of Civilians. High demand peacekeeping capabilities, including aviation, intelligence, and explosive ordnance disposal, are vital to bolstering mission capacity, reinforcing peacekeeper safety and security, and enabling the protection of civilians.

Aviation : Building on past aviation commitments, this year the United States is committing over $10 million in support of the Republic of Korea helicopter donation pledge made at the 2021 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial in Seoul.

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) : The United States will continue to focus on and invest in assisting partners with ISR capabilities, which are critical for improving situational awareness, supporting information driven operations, and enhancing peacekeeper safety and security and the protection of civilians. We have invested more than $30 million in support of a previous ministerial pledge to enable Bangladesh’s development of an Unmanned Aerial System for UN peace operations. Recognizing that improved situational awareness and actionable information can greatly enhance protection of civilians and performance in mission, the United States is now committing more than $20 million to assist Nepal with the development of a reconnaissance unit capability for UN peace operations.

Recognizing that improved situational awareness and actionable information can greatly enhance protection of civilians and performance in mission, the United States is now committing more than $20 million to assist Nepal with the development of a reconnaissance unit capability for UN peace operations. Explosive Hazard and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Awareness Training : Explosive hazards, including unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, are a serious and expanding threat to peacekeepers and the populations they are deployed to protect. The United States has consistently and routinely invested and led on this issue. Following through on previous ministerial pledges, the United States has invested over $1.2 million to support the UN Mine Action Service’s (UNMAS’) development of standardized IED disposal and explosive hazard awareness training materials, and we fulfilled our 2021 ministerial pledge with the delivery of $2.5 million of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) equipment to enhance Ghana’s capabilities. The United States remains focused on addressing and mitigating the explosive hazard threat and is now committing nearly $2 million to support UNMAS’s fielding of a threat mitigation advisory team. The team will support mission-specific explosive hazard awareness training during troop contributing countries’ pre-deployment training and exercises, enhancing both the safety and security of peacekeepers and protection of civilians.

3) Invest in Cleaner and Greener UN Peacekeeping as a U.S. Priority. Environmental management in peacekeeping is a cross-cutting issue that impacts peacekeeper safety and security and mission operations, as well as the legacy that peacekeepers leave behind. Cleaner and greener UN peacekeeping is a priority for the United States and a shared commitment across UN Member States and the broader peacekeeping enterprise.

The United States has committed more than $5 million to follow through on our 2021 ministerial announcement to pursue a trilateral Nepal-U.S.-UN Hybrid Solar Power Generation Pilot Project. We are now fully realizing the project—next week, representatives from Nepal, the United States, and UNMISS will be preparing the equipment for shipment to South Sudan where it will replace traditional diesel generators.

In 2024, we will produce a lessons learned report stemming from our trilateral project with Nepal and the UN, and we will share the report to help inform other Member States as they consider similar partnership projects in peacekeeping missions.

This year, we are also providing an additional $2 million to expand this project to incorporate a solar energy storage system that is expected to further reduce the carbon footprint and the need for diesel fuel. We are further exploring the feasibility of replicating this project to support other UNMISS troop contributing partners.

While partnering with TCCs to improve environmental practices in mission is critical, the process starts in their home countries. Accordingly, we are planning to proactively incorporate environmental considerations and best practices into our infrastructure projects with partners, including environmental improvements for classrooms, barracks buildings, and dining facilities at partners’ peacekeeping training centers.

Finally, the United States is committing extra-budgetary funding to the UN Department of Operational Support’s Environment Section to sustain staffing support to ensure the team has sufficient capacity to facilitate partnerships and provide technical support for Member States interested in pursuing environmental projects.

4) Reinforce Support to African Partners to Enable Regional Peace Operations. A growing reliance on regional operations to address peace and security crises on the African continent reinforces the importance of further strengthening the peacekeeping capacity of African partners. The United States partners with several African troop and police contributing countries that deploy substantial numbers of uniformed personnel to UN and regional peace operations. This year, we are providing nearly $35 million through our peacekeeping capacity-building programs alone to support a variety of efforts for our African partners, including equipment to support critical mission capabilities, infrastructure improvements at partners’ training centers, peacekeeping and logistics advisors, mentoring and assisting partners’ pre-deployment training, funding participants in global and regional courses, and UN-led courses that introduce new materials and promote interoperability in UN peace operations.

5) Invest in Police Peacekeeping Capabilities. Police play essential roles in peacekeeping missions, including protecting civilians from threats in urban environments, where there can be a higher risk of civilian casualties from military operations. Police peacekeepers are also critical to strengthening accountability and effectiveness of local police.

The United States will continue to support and prioritize the launch of the UN Police Job Specific Training (JST) program. Our investment will include up to six UN-certified development courses in 2024, curriculum development expertise, and the provision of instructors for JST train-the-trainer events. The U.S. investment also includes funding women police peacekeepers attendance at the Women Commander’s Course and other training and events, enhancing the meaningful participation of women in UN peacekeeping.

6) Sustain Performance and Accountability Support to UN Headquarters. In addition to peacekeeping capacity building activities in support of partner T/PCCs, the United States is also investing in enhancing performance and accountability capacity at the UN Headquarters. This year, the United States is providing $1.6 million in extra-budgetary funding to sustain key staff positions, doctrine and standards development, and training courses. We are also providing subject matter experts to support the UN’s development of specialized training materials on countering mis- and disinformation—a challenging issue that increasingly impacts the safety and security of peacekeepers and the complexity of today’s peace operations.

I would like to welcome our participants dialing in from across the continent and thank all of you for joining this discussion. Today, we are very pleased to be joined by Paul Dean, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability at the U.S. State Department. Mr. Dean will discuss the groundbreaking initiative, the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, and its concrete measures to guide the responsible development and use of military applications of AI and autonomy. He is speaking to us from Abuja, Nigeria.

We will begin today’s call with opening remarks from Mr. Dean, then we will turn to your questions. We will try to get to as many of them as we can during the briefing.

As a reminder, today’s call is on the record, and with that, I will turn it over to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability, Mr. Paul Dean.

MR DEAN: Well, thank you so much, Tiffany, for that introduction, and thanks to all the journalists who are joining us today. As my team and I have been visiting Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and soon Cameroon this week, we’ve really been struck by how much interest and expertise that we’ve found on issues of reducing risk in the areas of emerging technologies and as well as nuclear threats. And as Tiffany mentioned at the top, when it comes to emerging technologies, a key point in the conversation has really been the Political Declaration on the Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy that last month we were honored to be joined by 47 partners in endorsing and launching the implementation stage of the declaration.

The African states that have joined us, which we are very pleased to partner with in this groundbreaking initiative, include Liberia, Malawi, Morocco, and Libya. And we are here this week in West Africa encouraging more states to join us. This is a real opportunity to set the framework of responsibility in guiding responsible development and use of military applications of AI. The declaration contains ten concrete measures that will guide responsible states in their use of AI and autonomy for military purposes in ways that will reduce risks and contribute to global stability.

We believe that the declaration and the measures that it outlines are an important step in building an international framework of responsible use that will allow all states to harness the great benefits of AI while at the same time managing and mitigating the risks. The declaration also provides a foundation for practical, tangible collaboration and exchanges, such as the sharing of best practices, expert-level dialogues, and capacity-building activities – all of which should be of interest to all states, including those who are just beginning their journey of determining what, if any, role AI and autonomy would play in their militaries. The declaration, I really want to emphasize, is intended to be the beginning of this effort and not an end unto itself.

The initiative that we are launching with the endorsement of this declaration to reduce risk in this area of emerging technology is a part of our larger effort to deter conflict and enhance strategic stability using arms control treaties, international agreements, and transparency and confidence-building measures, as appropriate.

We are deeply committed to engaging our partners in multilateral venues and bilaterally, in the UN First Committee, in the CD, and in the NPT, as well as in other fora. We strongly value engagement in these bodies, including with our African partners.

As one example in the nuclear space, we have recently engaged in intense coordination with UN member states at the General Assembly First Committee this year, in which we sponsored a new resolution on prohibiting the use of radiological weapons. We were very pleased that that resolution passed with an overwhelming margin, and we very much look forward to continuing to work closely with all of our partners again in Geneva, in New York, bilaterally, on both the radiological weapons, broader issues of nuclear stability, and of course this groundbreaking initiative to promote a normative framework for the responsible use of military AI and autonomy.

So with that, I will conclude my initial response. I really do want to thank everyone for taking the time to call in today. Thanks for your interest on these issues, and I am very happy to take some questions.

MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Mr. Dean. We’ll now begin the question-and-answer portion of today’s briefing.

Before we get started, I just wanted to just get a sense from you, what do you see as the next steps for this declaration?

MR DEAN: I think the immediate step is to begin under the framework of this declaration and the 10 measures of responsible use that it contains – the step is to begin the process of working in collaboration with all of our partners and all the stakeholders on this issue to strengthen the principles and, most importantly in my view, to build our mutual capacity to implement them in a practical and tangible way. We really – I think the spirit in New York last month among all of our partners who gave statements was a real shared commitment that this political declaration is the organizing principle for practical work to ensure that members of the international community who share a commitment to responsibility in this area have a forum and a mandate to begin putting their experts in touch, building capacity, strengthening the measures, and putting ourselves collectively in a position to implement them.

MODERATOR: Thank you. We have a question that was sent in advance from Mr. Vincent Owino from Nation Media Group in Kenya. He asks: “Are there any East African countries that have endorsed the initiative? Why is it important to the United States that African countries endorse it?”

MR DEAN: Well, taking that in reverse order, I think we were very pleased that this political declaration reflects a true, across regional, and emerging consensus in the international community, and we were joined by partners from all five UN regional groups. We think it is extremely important that a diversity of viewpoints be reflected. We have an opportunity now to work collaboratively to build from the ground up what the international framework of responsibility looks like, and we value the perspectives of our African partners and our partners across the globe in creating these rules of responsibility and moving to the next stage to implement them. So it’s extremely important to us that we have a wide range of participants, a wide range of viewpoints, and that we have a thoughtful, sustained dialogue that will point in the direction of strengthening these measures and ensuring their successful implementation.

I provided earlier as to the first half of the question that the list of African partners who have, at this point, endorsed the declaration. I would stress that the door is open to the constructive participation from all states who have a shared interest in developing this framework of responsibility. And we have many close partners in East Africa and very much I think their participation would be invaluable and highly constructive, because I know that many of our East African partners have a deep and sustained commitment to responsibility, and this is a real opportunity for all countries to demonstrate their leadership on this issue.

MODERATOR: Thanks. We’ll take one more that came in advance, and then we’ll take our live question. We have one from Mr. Sebastien Nemeth from Radio France International. He asks: “Among roughly 50 countries which signed the political declaration only a few are African countries. Why so few? And do you wish there would be more, and how are you going to convince them to join?”

MR DEAN: Well, I certainly – as I think I covered in the previous answer, we very much encourage other African partners to join in this important initiative. I think that there are many reasons states are so interested in working on this issue. I do think this is an opportunity to really collaboratively build what the rules of responsibility will look like in an area that will have increasing salience and increasing importance as this technology continues to develop and evolve.

I do think that one very attractive feature of the initiative that the political declaration launches is this relationship building, collaboration, and capacity building workstream that I think is a necessary component of ensuring that these ten measures of responsibility are not words on a page but are practical, tangible, concrete measures that guide states’ practical implementation. And to do that, we have to work together to build capacity and raise awareness of the risks and the solutions for resolving those risks.

MODERATOR: Thank you. We have a live question from Israel Ojoko from BNN Breaking in Nigeria. Israel, you are – your line should be open to ask your question.

QUESTION: Hello. Thank you. Can you hear me?

MODERATOR: Yes, if you could speak up a little. It’s a little bit cloudy, but please speak up.

QUESTION: Okay. Good afternoon from Lagos, Nigeria. And I’m so glad to be part of this – your meeting this afternoon. And thanks, Paul, for the explanation and clarity so far that you have given. It’s interesting to know that the technology is really helping in every areas of our lives today and not just in the advanced world. It’s also going broader to other African countries and deeper, not just in telephone but also our security, militarily, and all that.

However, I am just curious to know what is the purpose of this initiative? Okay. So I just want to know is it that the U.S. is trying to sell its military equipments to African countries or is it that the U.S. is preparing African countries for maybe a war in the nearest future? I’m just curious to know. And then number two, what is the benefit of this military AI for African countries? Thank you very much.

MR DEAN: Well, thank you, Israel, for the question. I would say that the benefits of AI to militaries will be quite profound. And this – these benefits are not limited to battlefield applications, and we very much wanted to design, in concert with our partners, these ten measures in the political declaration to apply much more broadly than battlefield applications. We wanted these responsibility principles to apply to the full range of military applications of AI.

And AI, as you allude to in your question, will be revolutionary in terms of military decision-making, in terms of logistics, in terms of communications, and in terms of planning. And we see great benefits in these applications. It’s certainly my view that artificial intelligence will help militaries deliver on their international humanitarian law obligations. It will help militaries increase their efficiency in sound, fact-based decision-making. And so we want the declaration to promote those positive uses of military artificial intelligence. We do not want to stifle innovation with the declaration.

However, when there – as with any new technology, there are potential risks, and this gets to the first half of your question. Our motive is to put forward a series of mutually accepted multilateral rules of responsibility that allow us to mitigate and eliminate the risks while promoting the benefits of artificial intelligence in the military. We think that there is a lot of advantage to be had in creating an initiative where states can collaborate on building awareness of those risks, and in taking concrete steps to address, manage, and eliminate those risks.

I’ll give you one example. I think that it’s very important – and this is a measure that’s reflected in the political declaration – to – for the international community and for militaries who will be incorporating artificial intelligence to have a rule of responsibility in which we all agree that AI in the military must be designed for a specific purpose. We don’t want states purchasing AI applications and incorporating them into their militaries for reasons they were not – for functions they were not designed to fulfill.

So it’s a basic principle, but there’s a lot to unpack there. And I think raising awareness of the risks of unintended consequences based on applications that are not designed for a specific purpose, and then developing rules, procedures, and technical solutions to ensure that states can deliver on that basic measure of responsibility, is one of the fundamental goals of this declaration and this initiative.

MODERATOR: Thank you for the thorough answer. At this point we don’t have any further questions. If there are journalists who would like to continue the discussion, please put your question into the Q&A, or please raise your hand; we’ll be happy to call on you. But if our – Mr. Dean, if you’d like to sort of wrap up and give some closing remarks, or any great other further examples, we’d love it. But yes, if you have any further information for our journalists, we will take your final remarks and close out.

MR DEAN: Well, thank you, Tiffany, and thanks to all of you who have taken the time to join today. Again, this is just really an exciting opportunity for the international community to project shared leadership, shared commitment to responsibility and stability in developing a normative framework that will address 21st-century military challenges. We very much look forward to working with all of our endorsing partners. We encourage additional states to endorse the declaration and work with us on this, and are very much continuing this conversation with our African partners to come in, support this declaration, and work with us to build our mutual capacity to implement it.

So thanks. I think I’ll stop there. But thanks to everyone for your interest on this issue.

MODERATOR: Well, just as you closed out we did get two questions. (Laughter.) If you have – you do have a few minutes, I think. So one of them is regarding enforcement, and it comes from Leslie Fauvel from AFP in Nigeria. She writes: “How compelling or compellent is the declaration to the countries who signed it? What if they do not respect its principles?”

MR DEAN: Well, I think that we are very fortunate and pleased to have a group of partners endorsing this who are extremely enthusiastic about working in a positive, collaborative way to implement these principles. I think that stems from a shared understanding that it is in our collective security interest to be on the same page regarding the norms and rules of responsibility as this new technology begins to emerge. So I’m quite optimistic and quite heartened by the positive spirit that was demonstrated in New York last month when states endorsed the political declaration. And I’ve been quite heartened by the positive reception that we have received in consultations with our West African partners on this trip and with our broader African partners in other engagements. So I think this is a real cause for optimism and positivity as we collectively begin to articulate some basic rules of responsibility on AI in military.

MODERATOR: Thank you. We have another question from – just trying to – Agostinho Leite from Lusa News Agency in Portugal. He asks: “Drones, among other unarmed weapons, give us an expression of the kind of war we will be facing in future where AI will have a major role. Would you have any comment on the recent attack by drones in Nigeria that killed 85 civilians?”

MR DEAN: Well, of course, at the outset, deepest condolences on this tragedy earlier this week. And I do go back to the conversation we had earlier on this call about the breadth of applications for artificial intelligence in the military context. And one, I think, immediate application with tremendous positive upside is how artificial intelligence can assist militaries with decision making. And I think there will be a tremendous amount of upside to be had with artificial intelligence.

But of course, we must always ensure that we are managing the risk and ensure that both as a policy matter, as a matter of our training, and as a matter of technical capabilities that we understand why the artificial intelligence application is making a recommendation that it is and that we are in a position to audit that, we are in a position to understand it, we are – we have safeguards in place, and that we are only using artificial intelligence applications for purposes that they are designed to fulfill.

You’ll note that many of the statements I just gave you are indeed separate measures of responsibility in the document. And I think it’s very, very important to have a continued dialogue on this so that states are, as we’ve talked about a couple of times today already, enjoying the benefits to artificial intelligence in the military through sound decision making, but also are doing this in a way that is minimizing and, to the best extent possible, eliminating the risk of unintended consequences.

MODERATOR: Thank you very much. And this time, it really does close out our questions. So you’ve already given us your final remarks, so I would like to thank you, and that will conclude today’s briefing. I do want to thank Mr. Dean, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability at the U.S. State Department, for joining us, and thank all of our journalists for participating. If you have any questions about today’s briefing, you may contact the Africa Regional Media Hub at AFMediaHub@state.gov. Thank you very much."

Tournear, director of the Space Development Agency, or SDA, who is tasked in partnership with industry, with getting those satellites in orbit, spoke virtually today at a National Security Space Association event.SDA has two capabilities it promises to deliver to warfighters, he said.The first is beyond line-of-sight targeting for moving targets, he said. For example, if there's a hostile ship or mobile missile launcher, it needs to be detected and tracked and a shooter needs to calculate a fire-control solution. It all needs to happen in near real time from space.The second capability is very similar to that of the first capability, but the targets are different. Instead of mobile missile launchers or ships, an adversary's hypersonic glide vehicle or advanced missile needs to be detected in flight and tracked, and a fire-control solution calculated and executed in near-real time, Tournear said.SDA is building these capabilities on two main pillars, he said.Pillar one is proliferation. ""We're not going to do this with a handful of very exquisite satellites. We're going to do this with hundreds and hundreds of satellites that are in a low Earth orbit. Now a lot of people are starting to accept that that is the future of space and space capabilities — proliferation in low Earth orbit,"" he said.""Not only are we doing that, but the commercial industry, which we're tailing off of, is clearly starting to build up more and more proliferation in low Earth orbit,"" Tournear added.Pillar two is spiral development. To get those capabilities as quickly as possible, it's not going to happen by waiting 15 years to reach full capability, he said.Spiral development, he explained, is buying and fielding satellites about every year or two in tranches, planned from now to the end of this decade. Every year, there should be commercial, state-of-the-art technological advances, called spiral development, so that satellites in follow-on tranches will field even better capability.Tranche 0 doesn't have enough satellites yet to be used in a combat setting, but troops can use this limited capability in demonstrations, training and exercises, he said.Tranche 1, slated for September 2024, will enable initial warfighting capability with up to 161 satellites operational, he said.Tranche 2 launches will begin in 2026, and tranche 3 will launch in September 2028, and tranche 4 in 2030, with ever-increasing capability for warfighters such as sustained capability and eventual autonomous operations by tranche 4, he said."

Good afternoon, everyone. I do have quite a few items at the top, so if you'll just bear with me, and then I'd be happy to jump in and start taking your questions.So earlier this week, as you may have seen, Secretary Austin gave opening remarks yesterday at the Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference held here in Washington, D.C. The conference connected relevant U.S. and Ukrainian industry and government representatives to discuss initiatives that could enhance Ukraine's defense industrial base and and build on momentum generated by a successful event Ukraine hosted in Kyiv in September, 2023, all of which signals strong U.S. support for enhanced industry partnership.As part of the conference, Dr. Bill LaPlante, Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment, convened the eighth meeting of the National Armament Directors under the auspices of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group today. The meeting is being held here at the Pentagon, the first time the forum has convened here in the United States. This meeting brings together more than 40 nations, NATO and the European Union to engage on industrial base and sustainment challenges in support of Ukraine both for their immediate requirements, while also supporting Ukraine's long-term defense and national security needs.Later in the day, Secretary Austin hosted Ukrainian Minister of Defense Umerov for a bilateral meeting. Secretary Austin highlighted the department's ongoing activities to meet Ukraine's urgent requirements, including the announcement of the 52nd tranche of security assistance from DOD inventories for Ukraine. The package included additional air defense capabilities, artillery ammunition, antitank weapons and other equipment to help Ukraine counter Russia's ongoing war of aggression. This package utilized assistance previously authorized for Ukraine during prior fiscal years under the Presidential Drawdown Authority, but it is critical, as you all know, that Congress pass the president's National Security Supplemental Request to ensure we can continue to support Ukraine.Security assistance for Ukraine is a smart investment in our national security because it helps prevent a larger war in Europe while strengthening our defense industrial base and creating skilled jobs back home here for the American people, and without additional funding, the department may soon reach a point where it can't sustain the current level of security assistance support to Ukraine.Also yesterday, the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, in coordination with the department's V-22 Joint Program Office, announced an operational stand-down for all Osprey variants in the wake of the November 29th CV-22 mishap off the coast of Japan. This action is being taken out of abundance of caution while the AFSOC investigation is conducted. As each service conducts operational safety reviews within their fleets, each will reevaluate their respective grounding bulletins, and then determine timelines for resuming flight operations in close coordination with the Joint Program Office.We'd also like to thank the government of Japan for all their assistance in the search and recovery efforts throughout this incident, and we will continue to work with them on sharing information and safety procedures during the investigation. Of course, our thoughts remain with the families of those airmen who were lost. Air Force Special Operations Command is investigating the CV-22 mishap, and I'd refer you to them for any additional questions.Switching gears to Congress -- earlier this week, the Senate confirmed over 420 of our highly qualified general and flag officers. These holds have dragged on for months, degraded our military readiness, and forced far too many of our military families to put their lives on hold and endure even greater sacrifices.And while this was welcome news, we still have dozens of officers that still have had holds placed on them, some of whom are four stars. We urge the Senate to confirm the remainder of our qualified military leaders as soon as possible so that we can have our team in place to meet this critical moment for our national security.And shifting gears again -- next week, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks will visit locations in Silicon Valley, California. She will visit the Defense Innovation Unit, where she will meet with DIU personnel who are accelerating the U.S. military's adoption of commercial technology to strengthen national security and she will also receive an update on DIU projects through a series of capabilities demonstrations. She will also meet with a wide range of industry leaders to discuss the department's Replicator initiative, discuss innovation across the department, and see demonstrations of A.I.-powered autonomous technologies.And just one more item. Earlier today, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called His Royal Highness Prince Khalid bin Salman, Saudi Minister of Defense, to discuss Houthi threats to freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. We will have a readout coming shortly, if you don't already have it in your inbox.And with that, I'd be happy to open it up to some questions. Tara, do you want to start us off?Q: Hi, Sabrina. First, on the Osprey...MS. SINGH: Yeah.Q: ...the Osprey makes up a sizable portion of the Marine Corps fleet -- air fleet. How is the Marine Corps and Air Force and Navy going to mitigate the loss of access to this aircraft while this investigation's going on?MS. SINGH: Well, because it's something that they are instituting, in terms of the stand down, I'd really refer you to them to speak to how they are managing this, this stand down, and how it's impacting or not their own operations. So I'd refer you to them to speak to that.Q: But is the Secretary concerned about a loss of this many aircraft at once, with so many things going on?MS. SINGH: The Secretary fully supports the services and their -- out of, you know, the abundance of caution to stand these -- these fleet -- these aircraft down. This is something that we've done before whenever there is a mishap that a Service feels needs either more investigation or just out of an abundance of caution. There have been stand downs of fleets before of other platforms. And so the Secretary of course supports the services' decision to do that. And again, I'd refer you to the services regarding their details on the pause of operations.Q: And then the last, the Pentagon, for more than a year, has been trying to stand up a flight safety office where all of this data is supposed to go to be able to look across services, see trends. What's the status of that office? And is it looking at this incident?MS. SINGH: I don't have a status update on the office, but as I mentioned in the beginning, we do have the Joint Program Office for this platform, that is coordinating with the Services and other customers who use the Osprey. So that is something that is, you know, a connecting office that is coordinating across the services and to our allies and partners, but I don't have an update for you on that particular office at this time.Q: It is supposed to be at a Deputy Secretary of Defense level to really elevate flight safety, and when concerns are raised by maintainers or units, elevate them to a point where you get a very high level visibility. But it's been more than a year since the office was supposed to be up and running.MS. SINGH: Yep. So again, I would say that, as you know, the Secretary takes safety and security as his -- one of his top priorities. We are -- the Services are, out of an abundance of caution, again, putting a pause on this platform.I don't have an update for you on that particular office but it's not to say that safety and security of our service members is not a concern. That's exactly why you're seeing the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force do what they are doing. But I'd refer you to them to speak to more details on that. Yeah, thanks.Lara?Q: Yeah, can you please give us an update on the attacks in Iraq and Syria? How many have we had? How many injuries have there been altogether? And have there been any more incidents in the Red Sea since yesterday?MS. SINGH: So in terms of any other additional instances or attacks since yesterday, I'm not tracking anything that's occurred in the Red Sea or at any of our bases. I believe as of today, there've been approximately 78 attacks on our bases, but I don't have anything that's happened within the last 24 hours.Q: Is the department assess that there has been a slowdown in the attacks in the last couple days, a week or so?MS. SINGH: Well, I mean, and I feel like I was asked this question a few weeks ago when there was, you know, an uptick in attacks, and yet we do have like, a day or two that we'll go without any attacks. So it's really hard to say.I would direct you to the forces, these hostile militant groups that continue to attack our coalition forces and our troops in Iraq and Syria on why they are, you know, doing what they're doing and when they decide to do it.But in the last 24 hours, we haven't seen any attacks on our forces. Should that change, of course we would let you know, but that's the latest that I have as of right now, when I'm standing up here.(CROSS-TALK)Q: ... the number of injuries?MS. SINGH: Oh, I'm sorry. As of December -- as of, I would say, December 4th, it's still about 66 of our folks who have received non-serious, non-life-threatening injuries, all who have returned to work. I know you'll probably ask about TBIs but I just don't have an update for you on that at this time.Janne?Q: Thank you, Sabrina. The United States indicted four Russians for war crimes. Is this just because they started (the) war in Ukraine?MS. SINGH: Yeah, that's something that I saw the Department of Justice announce yesterday. I'd direct you to them for more information.Q: ... name of those peoples?...MS. SINGH: I don't.Q: Was Putin included?MS. SINGH: Again, I would direct you to the Department of Justice, who launched -- or who announced that yesterday. I just don't have more information on those names.Q: One more?MS. SINGH: Sure.Q: OK. The United States Space Force Command announced that the possibility of destroying North Korea's military satellite. And when do you think that time will be coming?MS. SINGH: I'm sorry, I've not seen that report, but I don't have anything for you on that.I'm going to go to the phones here. Idrees, Reuters?Q: Hey, Sabrina. There have been a number of reports in the past couple of hours about the killing of the Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and injuring of other journalists in Lebanon in October, and one of the stories from Reuters says definitively that an Israeli tank was responsible for firing two shells that killed Issam. Does the DOD have an independent assessment of what happened that day? Secondly, have you talked to the Israelis about the killing? And thirdly, do you believe Israel kills journalists as a matter of policy?MS. SINGH: Thanks, Idrees. So in terms of an independent assessment, I just don't have that for you at this time. I've seen the reports out there but that's not something that we've been able to assess independently here in the building.Again, I think you've seen with all of our readouts that the Secretary has had with Minister Gallant, with other senior leader engagements from across this administration, we continue to urge Israel to conduct its operations in a targeted manner as it is seeking out and addressing a brutal terrorist organization within Gaza. We continue to urge Israel to uphold the laws of armed conflict and humanitarian law and the protection of innocent civilians, which includes members of the press. And so that's something that has come up that we've talked about publicly. It has come up privately as well, and I'll just leave it at that.Konstantin, Military Times?Q: Thanks, Sabrina. I wanted to -- going back to the Osprey, in August, you said that the department has confidence in the Osprey as a platform. Given everything that's come out this past week, is that still true? Is that still an accurate statement?MS. SINGH: Well, thanks, Konstantin, for the question, and I think as you heard me say to Tara earlier, again, we've seen this done before with other platforms. Out of an abundance of caution, the Air Force, the Marine Corps and the Navy are standing down their Osprey fleet. I would direct you to the Services to speak to of when they're going to be back up in the air.But as you can understand, there will always be an inherent risk in military aviation, and to mitigate that risk, we will continue to maintain the high level of operational standardization for all of our pilots and for all of the crew. As you probably know, the Osprey is one of the premier assault aviation systems that we have. It is versatile. Its speed and its vertical lift capabilities are not met by any other platform existing in fixed or rotary-wing platforms, and so it's an incredibly useful platform for all of our Services to use. Again, out of an abundance of caution there has been a stand-down, and I would direct you to the Services for when those will be back up in the air.All right.Q: OK.MS. SINGH: I will take one more from the phone, and then I'll come back in the room. Chris Gordon?Q: Thanks, Sabrina. Senator Warren expressed concern during a Senate Arms Services Committee hearing yesterday about too many service members are receiving lasting injuries or losing their lives due to accidents. Does the Pentagon share that view? And what could be done to make training safer broadly? Does the department need to review training accidents in whatever form, aviation or other?MS. SINGH: Well, thanks, Chris, for the question. Well, as you can see, I mean, the Air Force is doing an investigation right now into the mishap that happened off the coast of Japan. Safety/security of our personnel, whether it be in our Air Force, our Army, our Navy or our Marine Corps, we take that very seriously. That's something that the Secretary, I know, is a priority for him. And so we are evaluating any time that there is a mishap, and there is an investigation taking the lessons learned from that and applying it and making sure that safety protocols and procedures are followed and enhanced, if need be.All right, I'm going to come back in the room. Tom?Q: Thanks, Sabrina. A quick -- two questions. One, on the Osprey, do the services have a ability to do a standdown independently, or is that the to be Service wide?MS. SINGH: It -- they can do it independently, yeah.Q: So thanks. And the second question, unrelated to Osprey, the president of Guyana yesterday said that he's requesting U.S. military -- possible U.S. military support because of Venezuela's referendum and oil fields. This is not getting ahead of a decision, but this is the clarification. Would such a request stay at SOUTHCOM, or would it have to come to the Pentagon? How does that work?MS. SINGH: Well, of course, any decision where it's requesting military support, of course, would originate at the COCOM, and then of course, flow up through OSD.Q: Just thought I'd check.MS. SINGH: Yeah, great.Fadi?Q: Thank you, Sabrina. I want to go back to Idrees' question.MS. SINGH: Sure.Q: So this is the -- is the -- you saw the report I guess you're talking about, the Human Rights Watch and amnesty targeting Reuters photographer, my late friend, and some of the -- and six other journalists, including Jazeera and AFP. This incident happened in Lebanon; didn't happen in Gaza, where Hamas exists. According to the reports, it was deliberate and it amounts to a war crime.In addition to this discussion, does the Secretary support accountability when it comes to the killing of Issam Abdallah and the targeting of these journalists?MS. SINGH: Well, first, Fadi, I'm so sorry. I had no idea that you knew this journalist, and of course, our thoughts on behalf of the department are with you and, of course, the family.Look, we are in constant communication, near-daily communication with -- with the Israeli count- -- sorry, with the Secretary's Israeli counterparts, and also here from senior levels engaging with the Israeli government. You've seen all types, from the Vice President's Office -- her national security advisor was just in the region as well -- engaging with their -- his Israeli counterparts to discuss what is happening within Gaza and around Israel.We do not want to see this conflict spread out into a wider regional conflict. As you know, we've sent and surged assets into the region to bolster our deterrence and send a message that we do not want to see this conflict widen, and that also means any conflict or clashes along the northern border.I've said it before and I'll say it again: The targeting of innocent civilians is something that we take very seriously. And so we are, in all of our conversations with the Israeli government, urging that they always take into account innocent civilians as they are conducting their operations against a terrorist organization that is Hamas.Q: OK, and on a -- thank you.MS. SINGH: Yeah.Q: On a separate issue, Israeli forces announced yesterday that they had received so far almost 10,000 tons of equipment and ammunition, and almost 200 air shipment. Are you able to say whether all of that came from the U.S., or what -- how the proportion of U.S. aid as part of what was announced?MS. SINGH: I can't say for certain what part is U.S. support. We've been very clear that we're going to continue to support Israel with security assistance through FMS and FMF, and as long as, you know, they need that support to conduct their operations against Hamas. But in terms of the announcement that the Israeli government made, I can't tell you what specifically in that package that was delivered was U.S. military assistance. All I can tell you is that we are continuing to support Israel. I -- yeah, I'll just leave it at that.Q: OK. (inaudible)?MS. SINGH: Sure.Q: For the future -- this is not a question.MS. SINGH: Yeah.Q:  Would you be able to compile the amount of assistance that's been provided, whether in...MS. SINGH: Yeah.Q: ... dollar term or, I don't know, weight or whatever?MS. SINGH: Yeah, that's some -- I mean, that's something that I know you've asked about. That's something that we're working through. The difference in what makes it difficult is that the way we provide security assistance, let's say, to Ukraine, is through coming off of our stock shelves and it's through the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which is different from the funding mechanism such as FMS and FMF.We are working on it. It's not that I've forgotten. I certainly haven't. As you know, we've said that we're providing, broad strokes, Israel with ammunition, precision-guided munitions and then air defense, of course, as well.Nancy, yeah?Q: I just want to start by reading, in Fadi's point, the war's two months today, and I think the information we've been asking for a few weeks...MS. SINGH: Yeah.Q: ... given that at least part of it is paid for by tax dollars. I just want to reiterate how much we'd like to see that information as soon as possible.I had a question about the Biden administration’s announcement earlier this week kind of issuing a dire warning that if Congress has not passed funding for Ukraine by the end of the year it could affect resourcing for that war.Some Republicans are saying that the situation is not as urgent as the administration has presented it because there’s at least a billion in funds and given the pace of funding or weapons that have been provided so far that that money could stretch out for a bit of the time.I wanted to know if you could give me a Pentagon assessment in terms of when funds could run out and how urgently this funding needs to be provided for Ukraine. Is there a point where the Pentagon feels without that funding in the next weeks it threatens the war itself?MS. SINGH: Sure. So I think the assertion was that Ukraine doesn’t need this funding and that they could manage with what we have left. Is that what you were summarizing?Q: That the U.S. has enough funding. There’s still enough remaining funding that it could last for – it could be stretched out for a few more months that it’s not as urgent as the president presented yesterday.MS. SINGH: Yes.Q: He said it would be before the holidays --(CROSSTALK)MS. SINGH: Right, I would -- sorry, I didn’t mean to cut you off -- I would strongly push back against that assertion. The biggest problem that we are running up against is we don’t have enough money to backfill our own stocks, which means we don’t have enough to continue to supply Ukraine with what it needs because it is our weapons, our capabilities, our systems being pulled off our shelves and being shipped over to Ukraine.And so if we can’t backfill, that’s going to also impact our own readiness, which means that’s going to impact what we can provide Ukraine. And so I would really push back on that assertion. And, you know, till very recently we’ve enjoyed bipartisan support from Congress and that security assistance has been critical in providing Ukraine what it needs on the battlefield.And I would just remind you that everyone thought that Putin would Kyiv in three days. And the Ukrainians have done an incredible job of not only defending Kyiv but then there were other battles that they continue to push the Russians back, continue to push them into the east and into the south.They are making very good use of our capabilities and not just ours, allies and partners as well, providing them with the weapon systems that they need. And so you’ve heard the President, you’ve heard the Secretary say it; we’re in it with Ukraine for the long haul. It’s not just about making sure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself on the battlefield. It’s about making sure that Russia also gets the message that it cannot expand into other countries -- into other sovereign countries because that’s exactly what Vladimir Putin wants.And you know you’ve seen some support from both sides of the aisle in Congress. I think there’s a small majority that oppose sending more funding for Ukraine. We’re working through that. We believe that the urgent supplemental request that we submitted to 
Congress is the right thing for Congress to pass and we’re hopeful that it gets done.Q: One last topic.MS. SINGH: Sure.Q: Can we get some sense of the number of stories that the Ike and Ford strike groups have conducted. Just I think we haven’t had any real visibility as to how busy they’ve been as they have been in the Mediterranean. I’d love, if possible, something to add on that.MS. SINGH: Yes, we can take that. Yes, no problem. Yes, over here.Q: Thank you. Comparing to the last couple of weeks, we have very few attacks on international force and your force in Iraq. So do you believe it is because of your response to the previous attacks?And if I may add this, do you believe the Iraqi government can protect your forces that are in Iraq at the invitation of the government of Iraq?MS. SINGH: Well, just as you said, we’re in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government. They have been one our partners in the region and within Iraq in protecting our forces. And of course the mission, the reason why we are in Iraq is to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS. So the Iraqi military has been a partner in that effort.Look, in terms of the attacks on our forces, I think it’s important to remember that it’s good that we have not seen attacks on our forces in the last 24 hours. We would like to see that continue. I can’t speak to whether that will be the case. I can’t predict the future.But I would remind you that when we have decided to respond it has been deliberate, it has been effective, our strikes have been able to destroy weapons facilities, command and control node, storage facilities that these IRGC backed groups use.So I think it’s important that while we did see a spate of attacks against our forces, they were largely not successful with minor damage to infrastructure. And so of course we’ll always respond back at a time and place of our choosing but I’ll just leave it at that.Yes?Q: Thank you. I have two questions on Israel. Is this the first time for U.S. military to stop flying all Osprey variants at the same time? My second question, can you give us a sense of a rough timeframe of how long stand down will last. Is it likely to be a matter of weeks and months rather than days?MS. SINGH: I’d refer you to the Services to speak to how long the stand-down will last. In terms of if this has been the first stand down, this has not. We’ve done this with other platforms. We’ve done it with the Osprey before. But I’d let the services speak to that.Q: Thank you.MS. SINGH: Yes. And then I’ll come in the back.Q: Thank you, (inaudible).MS. SINGH: Sure.Q: Why did it take a week to, you know, reach the decision to stand down?MS. SINGH: Well, again, we started conducting the investigation as soon as the November 29th mishap happened. As the investigation was being conducted, the Air Force felt the need to issue that stand-down. But for more information I would direct you to the Air Force to speak to that.Q: What is the potential material failure that was indicated in the preliminary investigation? Could you give us kind of more specific or clarification?MS. SINGH: I unfortunately don’t have more information. I would direct you to the air force to speak to that. Again, this is an ongoing investigation. So I certainly wouldn’t want to get ahead of that at this time. Yes.(CROSSTALK)Q: As you mentioned at the opening when you came but there’s a call between Secretary Austin and his Saudi counterpart and they were talking about the Houthis. So today the NSC Coordinator, John Kirby, he said we are not in unarmed conflict with the Houthis. So does the DOD share with Mr. Kirby this view, you are not in a war with the Houthis? And how soon you can prevent this conflict from widening and escalating?MS. SINGH: Yes, absolutely we share that view. We’re not in an armed conflict with the Houthis. We have seen drones and missiles shot from Houthi controlled areas within Yemen.Not necessarily targeting our ships but of course targeting most likely commercial vessels that are transiting through the Red Sea. And so part of why we are in the region is to bolster our deterrence but to also ensure the free passageway of commercial ships that are transiting through one of the most vital water ways in the world.And so yes, I completely agree with what Mr. Kirby said earlier today. We don’t see conflict, we don’t want to see this widen out to a regional war or into the larger region and that’s why you’ve seen the Secretary make the decisions he did to send to carrier strike groups, one in the Eastern Med and then one of course in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, to deter, to send a message of deterrence, to send a message to Iran and its proxies who would want to inflict, whether it's damage or harm to U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria or disrupt commercial commerce in the Red Sea and in the region.So that was a very deliberate decision by the Secretary.Yeah?Q: Yeah, thank you. So just to circle back on Ukraine, the Ukrainians have admitted that their counter-offensive has failed. Do you agree with that assessment? And do you believe the war is a stalemate? And then how do you think the Ukrainians can break out of that? Does, like, more money and weapons help, or do you think they need a new strategy?MS. SINGH: I think your summary is a bit short. I don't think that they've -- would say it's failed. We have seen them make progress in the counter-offensive. It might not be the gains that they want to be making every single day but there is incremental progress. I think that's important to remember.I'd let the Ukrainians speak to their own operations and how they can change what they need to do for the next phase of the war which is entering into winter. We have provided them the training, the equipment, the support that they need to be successful, and we feel very confident that they will be successful.And part of that is also invigorating their defense industrial base, which is why you saw the Secretary speak at Commerce just yesterday about the need for industry to partner with Ukraine so they can have a robust defense industrial base as this war continues.But I would let the Ukrainians really speak to their own operations and characterize what they see as success on the battlefield.Q: Do you agree the war is a stalemate right now?MS. SINGH: I would let the Ukrainians speak to their own operations. Again, we feel confident that they have what they need to be successful on the battlefield. Great.I saw a question over here and then I'll wrap it up.Q: I have two questions on the Middle East. The first is the U.S. sanctioned 13 individuals and entities that are funding the Houthis in Yemen. Do you believe that will slow down the amount of attacks that we're seeing in the Red Sea and that region over the coming weeks or is that something that'll be more long-term in slowing them down?And then secondly, what is the Pentagon's assessment of Israel's campaign to eliminate Hamas in Gaza?MS. SINGH: So in terms of the -- I think you're referring to sanctions that were issued by the Department of Treasury? I would direct you to them to speak more to the sanctions that were placed on those 13 individuals.Look, when you're hitting a financial network, that has obvious effects. I can't predict that that slows down or stops any attacks. We can only continue to send the message that we do not want to see this war or a war widen into a regional conflict, and we will continue to respond, should our commanders of our ships feel the need to in self-defense.And I'm sorry, your second question?Q: Just the current assessment of Israel's campaign to eliminate Hamas in Gaza?MS. SINGH: Oh, sorry. Look, I'd let Israel speak to that. We continue to engage with the Israelis on their targeting of a terrorist organization in Gaza. We are talking to them. The Secretary is talking to Minister Gallant on an almost daily basis still, getting updates, but also voicing support and concern where he needs to.Did I see one more question? Nope. Yes, one in the back and then we'll wrap it up.Q: Thank you. (Inaudible) from (inaudible). So Director Wray from the FBI said a few days ago in a hearing on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate that the United States, especially the FBI, is seeing alerts -- terrorist alerts that are unprecedented, and he even compared them, or accepted the comparison, to what the United States was seeing before 9/11.Do you coincide with that? Are you also worried or are you concerned about an unprecedented level of terrorist threats, not only inside the United States but also to United States' interests abroad?MS. SINGH: I would let the Department of Justice really speak to that and the Department of Homeland Security speak to the level of terrorist threats within the United States. That's not something this building can really speak to.Of course, we always monitor threats around the world, threats to our partners and allies, and threats to our interests abroad. That's something that we're going to continue to do but I don't have anything to announce or read out in terms of anything that we've observed that would change our behavior.All right, thank you very much."
16,Chiefs Discuss Military Recruiting Challenges at Committee Hearing,https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3610846/chiefs-discuss-military-recruiting-challenges-at-committee-hearing/,"The military's recruiting chiefs said they are making progress in meeting recruiting goals for fiscal 2024 even in the face of what one called ""one of the toughest recruiting landscapes I've seen in over 33 years of service.""Army Maj. Gen. Johnny K. Davis, commanding general of the Army Recruiting Command made the comment before the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday.Davis testified alongside Navy Rear Adm. Alexis T. Walker, commander of the Navy Recruiting Command; Marine Corps Maj. Gen. William J. Bowers, commanding general of the Marine Corps Recruiting Command; and Air Force Brig. Gen. Christopher R. Amrhein, commander of the Air Force Recruiting Service.The Army, Navy and Air Force failed to meet recruiting goals in the fiscal year that ended in September. The Marine Corps and the Space Force made their goals, but the recruiting environment remains tough.""This recruiting crisis certainly did not appear overnight and cannot be repaired overnight,"" Davis said.All four men cited problems common to recruiting efforts across the services. They noted the percentage of American youths who qualify for military service has dropped, the COVID-19 pandemic limited the ability of recruiters to interact with potential recruits, the U.S. economy is booming with low unemployment, and the number of adult ""influencers"" with experience in the military continues to drop.The numbers are daunting. The Army, the largest service, has a goal of recruiting 55,000 active-duty soldiers during fiscal 2024 and roughly 60,000 for the reserve components. The other services have smaller numbers, but similar challenges.""The Army is an organization that teaches valuable skills and provides exceptional benefits,"" Davis said. ""I want our nation's youth to know the Army is a career accelerator, and I need them to lead us into the future.""The Army Recruiting Command seeks to attract talent and reintroduce the Army to the American public. ""We will not lower standards, we will not sacrifice quality for the sake of quantity,"" Davis said. ""Our main initiatives over the past year have shown real promise, such as the Future Soldier Prep Course."" The course has had 14,000 graduates, with 95 percent going on to finish basic training and become soldiers.""We're still in the first quarter of the fiscal year, and [it's] too early to estimate where we will finish it, finish in 10 months, but I will say we're seeing momentum, and we'll continue to build upon it,"" he said.The Air Force failed to make its requiting goals for the first time in 24 years, Amrhein said during his testimony. The Air Force recruiting chief specifically mentioned the declining propensity for young Americans to serve. ""We've seen a steady decline in the military even being an option for our youth as they contemplate the future, with propensity dropping from 13 percent four years ago to 10 percent.""Amrhein also noted that only 12 percent of American youths have a parent who served in the military, compared to 40 percent in 1995. DOD's Joint Advertising and Marketing Research Service characterizes the youth market as ""having transitioned from being disconnected with the military to mostly disinterested with it,"" the general said. ""Reconnecting with our youth and breaking down unnecessary barriers to serve in our Air Force and Space Force is our priority over the next several years.""The Air Force Recruiting Service put in place changes, and Amrhein said he is cautiously optimistic about fiscal 2024. ""We started with 32 percent of our active duty goal already identified and in the bank, compared to just 16 percent last year,"" he said.The Marine Corps made its recruiting numbers. ""Your Marine Corps exists to fight and win our nation's battles,"" Bowers told the senators. ""Our performance in recruiting speaks for us. Our combat heritage is embedded within Marine Corps Recruiting Command's DNA; we share the same fierce competitive spirit to win, no matter the challenge.""Over the years, Bowers said, the corps has invested in the Recruiting Command, with service as a Marine recruiter seen as a plus for career advancement. ""This has been and will continue to be our greatest source of strength, as we face what some have called the most challenging recruiting environment since the inception of the all-volunteer force,"" he said. ""Marine recruiters will continue to meet the expectations of our nation by holding true to our warrior ethos and our core values of honor, courage, and commitment. We compete for the best people in every zip code in our nation, and our Marine recruiters actively attract and inspire those young men and women of character to take up the challenge of earning the title Marine.""The Navy is in the midst of changes to recruiting and is adjusting in real time. ""While the Navy did not meet its recruitment goal for fiscal '23, we continuously adapted our processes to reduce an initially forecasted gap by 50 percent,"" Walker said. ""As we begin fiscal '24, we are again faced with a challenging environment and continue to scrub our processes to remove inefficiency, add recruiters, and expand the pool of qualified and interested candidates.""The Navy has placed more recruiters in the field and established a national recruiting operations center. The Navy is also launching a marketing campaign to target adult influencers in young people's lives. Finally, the Navy has instituted a Future Sailor Preparatory Course at Recruit Training Command, Illinois, ""to broaden the talent pool through physical fitness and academic enhancement ahead of recruit training,"" the admiral said.""Today, our advertising remains nearly 100 percent digital, resulting in a 30 percent increase in national leads, in taking the message to where our future sailors are operating, which is online,"" he said. ""Despite the recent and future challenges, our Navy team stands ready to take advantage of the opportunity to share positive military service experiences with future recruits and their influencers.""Walker called on the senators to do their part and asked each member to ""consider personally engaging with their constituents and the media in a national call to service. Your public support for military recruiting will make a positive difference."""

The BRAVO 11 Bits2Effects hackathon will occur at one of the DOD AI Battle Labs on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.Any American citizen is eligible to apply, regardless of whether they currently work for the federal government or possess a security clearance. Applications – available online here - will be accepted on a rolling first-come-first-serve basis with the first group of acceptances taking place in mid-December. Due to past events exceeding 400 participants, BRAVO has secured an over-flow room, although organizers still expect demand to exceed supply.Attendees are not required to hold a security clearance. However, certain spaces, use-cases, and datasets may require a U.S. secret security clearance or higher. Applicants may apply as an employee for the U.S. government, a U.S. government contractor working on behalf of a federal contract, or as U.S. citizen either affiliated or unaffiliated with a company. Any U.S. federal employees or federal contractors are eligible to submit potential use-cases and proposed collaborations within the application process. Sourcing a use-case to these hackathons often results in an operational prototype and feedback for the sourcing organization.Starting in 2021, the U.S. Air Force began organizing multi-service prototyping events, known as BRAVO hackathons, to expedite learning and capability development from classified and protected operational data. This year's BRAVO 11 Bits2Effects, the fourth BRAVO hackathon and first-held inside a combatant command, is seeking to produce solutions to combatant command challenges utilizing Indo-Pacific operational theater data. BRAVO utilizes a permissive software development environment that permits the co-mingling of classified and protected data with untrusted open-source and commercial software otherwise not approved for production systems within minutes.Prior hackathons have produced prototypes influencing major Defense Department programs in areas including large language models, space launch, flight telemetry and biometrics, unmanned systems, personnel recovery, security classification, sensing and targeting, and battle damage assessment among others.""In the early 1920s, Army Col. Billy Mitchell assessed battleships, a top military funding priority of the Department of War, could be sunk by bombers just 1/80th the cost,"" said Stuart Wagner, Chief Digital Transformation Officer for the Department of the Air Force and BRAVO AI Battle Labs Executive Agent. ""To disprove widely held resourcing beliefs of senators, four-star generals and the Secretary of War, Mitchell organized the Project B exercises where bombers repeatedly sunk German-captured battleships, changing warfare by turning investments to airpower in the leadup of World War II.The BRAVO DoD AI Battle Labs are again seeking to change how warfare is conducted by enabling innovators to develop and employ data driven effects during competition and conflict.""Applicants looking to participate may do so in one of three roles:Any federal government organization (contractor or government) is eligible to submit a use case, dataset, infrastructure, or potential collaboration with the hackathon by submitting a Hacker/HackerSME application to the event.

It is wonderful to be here with you at the Army Navy Country Club for this year’s annual meeting of the National Capital Council of the Navy League of the United States.I would like to thank Commander Tom Callender, President of the National Capital Council, for inviting me to join you for this event. Commander Callender, thank you for your leadership of this organization, as well as for your decades of service in our Navy as a submariner.Commander Callender also spent several years supporting the development of our Midshipmen at the Naval Academy, whether it was in the classroom as a physics instructor or on the Severn River as an assistant coach of the varsity lightweight rowing team.Commander Callender, thank you for your commitment to the moral, mental, and physical development of the future leaders of our Navy and Marine Corps.The sea has always been a vital artery of American prosperity. It has facilitated our economic engine and opportunities and shielded our borders from conflict throughout our history.The ability of our Navy and Marine Corps today to deter our adversaries, support our allies and partners, and, if necessary, fight and win our nation’s wars is not just a strategic advantage—it is an irreplaceable pillar in maintaining the international rules-based order that underpins security and prosperity around the world.The Navy League and other organizations like it play a significant role in advocating for our national maritime power and we will need that continued support well into the future.A ready, combat-credible, forward-deployed fleet is the most potent, flexible, and versatile instrument of military power. It ensures that the seas remain free and open, allowing for the peaceful flow of goods, ideas, and people.History has proven seapower to be cyclical. We cannot rely on maintaining our maritime power without the necessary national commitment—the future requires continued investment into advanced capabilities and improving our industrial base.We must continue, together, to provide the nation with a Navy that can deter high-end conflict with a rapidly improving peer competitor and protect the rules-based international order.Innovation and Shipbuilding EffortsTo that end, we have made significant strides and established new initiatives in the past year—including the Marine Innovation Unit, the Navy’s Disruptive Capabilities Office, our department’s Science and Technology Board, and four weeks ago, the Government Shipbuilder Council.Four different cabinet departments—Defense, Transportation, Homeland Security, and Commerce—came together to form the G-S-C because we recognize that we need a whole-of-government effort to rebuild our nation’s comprehensive maritime power.We recognize agility in ship production and design requires developing new, digital tools for our workforce to improve efficiency and capacity.The future of shipbuilding, maintenance, and repair looks much different than it did when I retired from the Navy twenty years ago—advances in modelling, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence will allow us to reduce costs, optimize systems, and improve collaboration.To that end, we must develop high-paying, high-skilled “new-collar” jobs that restore America’s manufacturing prowess by combining traditionally blue-collar trades with cutting-edge manufacturing technologies of today.As we gather here tonight, we have nearly 100 ships under contract and over 50 in construction, including USS Columbia, the future of our ballistic missile and strategic deterrence force and our number one acquisition priority.We’re building Ford-class carriers, Virginia-class submarines, Constellation-class frigates, San Antonio-class LPDs, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.This year, we commissioned the first Flight III destroyer, USS Jack H. Lucas, which marks an important milestone in that class’s already storied history and represents the most technologically advanced surface combatant ever built.We continue planning for DDG(X), the future of large surface combatants, as we usher our cruisers into a well and hard-earned retirement.Future Capabilities and Hybrid FleetAdditionally, we’ve laid the groundwork for tomorrow’s hybrid fleet. The hybrid fleet isn’t a pipe dream or a nebulous future state written in “somedays.” We’re already operating in and actively preparing the Navy to fight and win in that battlespace—in the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Fleet Areas of Operation.U.S. Fifth Fleet—through Task Force 59—has operated unmanned surface, air, and subsurface vehicles for over 55,000 hours. These platforms can be where our ships cannot, and deliver sustained all-domain awareness.They prove the Navy can procure and develop off-the-shelf technology quickly, effectively, and efficiently to free our more capable traditional naval forces to conduct more strategic missions—and so we can rapidly deploy manned platforms when keyed by indications from our unmanned force.During UNITAS 64, we operated seven separate robotic systems on, under, and above the seas, wholly integrated into the exercise’s command and control, and they executed missions alongside traditional forces.In fact, this summer we deployed four unmanned ships to Japan for the first time—and they participated in Large Scale Exercise and Integrated Battle Problem. Next year, they’ll again participate in RIMPAC.The work done across both theaters proves that our future hybrid fleet will expand and extend our Navy’s capabilities everywhere we operate.Through Force Design and the formal activation earlier this year of the Marine Innovation Unit, our Marines, too, are working to identify, develop, and field the operational concepts, strategies, and capabilities our nation needs now and in times of crisis or conflict.Force Design provides the vision for the future of our Marine Corps in our emerging era of strategic competition with the People’s Republic of China, and represents a transformational effort to bring our Marines back to their core maritime mission as part of our national vision for Maritime Statecraft.The Marine Innovation Unit and Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory’s Rapid Capabilities Office are working closely with their Navy counterparts in the newly-established Disruptive Capabilities Office and the Naval Innovation center at the Naval Postgraduate School, as well as industry partners to accelerate production and delivery of new capabilities for the Joint Force.Empowering Our PeopleWhile we take pride in our ships, submarines, and aircraft, the true strength of our Navy is our people. Our workforce—Sailor, Marine, and civilian; active and reserve—represents the full spectrum of 330 million Americans and come from every state and innumerable countries globally.As we continue building a culture of warfighting excellence, our Sailors and Marines will remain the backbone of the Department of the Navy. They are not only warfighters but diplomats, educators, and leaders.We owe it to those Sailors and Marines to provide them with support from the top of the mast to the keel to ensure they and their families are ready and resilient.Every Sailor, Marine, and civilian in our department deserves an environment where they feel valued, respected, and empowered to reach their full potential. We must recognize that our health and well-being, both physical and mental, is mission-critical.Deterring Adversaries and Current OperationsAs we tackle the challenges that come with maintaining a ready and resilient Fleet and Force, we remain locked in an era of strategic competition with the People’s Republic of China, Russia’s illegal war of aggression continues in Ukraine, Iran threatening global shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, and we continue to fight against violent extremist organizations.The PRC remains our pacing challenge and continues to behave provocatively and unsafely across the Indo-Pacific region, but especially in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.While we do not seek confrontation, we will continue to pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific.We will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.We strive to uphold the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea for the benefit of all countries and embrace all like-minded partners doing the same. We are committed to responding to aggression and illegal activities with our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, the Arabian Gulf, and Europe to ensure freedom of navigation globally.This fall, our ships—especially the Ford and Eisenhower Strike Groups, and their surface escorts—have proven indispensable to our national strategy and defending American interests around the world.Three destroyers have shot down missiles and armed drones launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen over the Red Sea and prevented the seizure of a commercial vessel by Somali pirates.USS Thomas Hudner, USS Carney, and USS Mason each performed with exemplary skill and professionalism—they prove that we stand ready to defend our interests and protect our allies in the Red Sea and around the world.We will continue to work with our allies and partners to counter the threats we face—and we will not hesitate to use force when necessary to protect our ships and our personnel.We operate forward so everyone else can, too.AUKUS and Strategic PartnershipsThe Department of the Navy is a global maritime power, but we cannot face these challenges alone. Our allies and partners around the world are the key to our shared security and prosperity.They are our greatest asymmetric strength and a true force multiplier.We continue to work to enhance strategic partnerships. We will always engage and welcome friends in plans, exercises, and operations wherever we operate.This year, we have continued developing our AUKUS trilateral strategic agreement with our Australian and British allies. We've seen Australia pledge $368 billion to the partnership, a portion of which will go into the U.S. submarine industrial base.We identified Pearl Harbor as the lead maintenance activity for the Submarine Rotational Force - West as part of the agreement. A joint Australian-American team will conduct maintenance on American submarines to help Australia develop the necessary skills to operate and maintain nuclear-powered submarines.We saw the first port visit since the announcement of the optimal pathway of an American submarine to Western Australia: the USS North Carolina to HMAS Stirling. Next year, Royal Navy submarines will begin making port calls as well.We saw the first Australians graduate from nuclear power school, the first step in learning to operate nuclear-powered submarines. Early next year, they will finish training and report to American submarines to continue developing these necessary, highly technical, skills.This August marked the 50th anniversary of the All-Volunteer force. Service to our country and service in the armed forces is central to who we are as a country and fundamental to our democracy.Every Sailor and Marine serving today chose to raise their right hand and swear an oath to defend the Constitution, just as I did on induction day at the Naval Academy in 1979 and six times in my 44 years since.We remain the strongest Navy in the world through our dedication to service.Our Sailors and Marines have faced and overcome countless challenges in the past 248 years, from fighting the world’s greatest naval power during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 in our nation’s infancy, to then-Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley evacuating General Douglas MacArthur from Corregidor or today’s environment of strategic competition.I proudly remember my time in command of USS Bulkeley as part of the great tradition of service.In the “Laws of the Navy,” an early 19th century poem by a royal navy officer, the fifth law begins “Upon the strength of one link in the cable dependeth the might of the chain.” We should all endeavor to remember all those who came before—we are stronger for all the previous links.Vice Admiral Bulkeley is one of my previous links.Many of you know that I immigrated from Cuba at 10 months old when my father was given 48 hours to leave the country. What you may not know is that around the same time, Vice Admiral Bulkeley was in command of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay – he was the CO that ordered the installation of desalination plants to make the base self-sufficient.Vice Admiral Bulkeley said, about his experiences in World War II, “You engage, you fight, you win. That is the reputation of our Navy, then and in the future.”That is the reputation of our Department now, still, 70 years later. It must remain our reputation throughout the next decade and into the mid-21st century.May God continue to bless our country with fair winds and following seas.  Thank you."
24,Naval Legal Service Command Commemorates 50th Birthday,https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3610099/naval-legal-service-command-commemorates-50th-birthday/,"Naval Legal Service – presently known as NLSC – was founded in 1973. In October of that year, the Secretary of the Navy, The Honorable John Warner, approved a plan to realign the Navy’s worldwide law centers under the authority, administration, and management of the JAG, Rear Adm. Merlin Staring. Then, on Dec. 3, 1973, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Elmo Zumwalt issued Notice 5450 in order to formally establish Naval Legal Service.

A cake-cutting ceremony honoring the organization’s milestone birthday took place on Dec. 1, 2023, aboard Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. Rear Adm. David G. Wilson, commander of NLSC, delivered the keynote remarks to the JAG Corps personnel – both past and present – assembled in person and participating virtually.

“I am excited to be celebrating NLSC’s 50th birthday,” said Wilson. “NLSC helps the Navy meet its mission defending the homeland forward, at sea, and ensuring Sailors stay focused ashore … [It] protects the legal rights and equities of those who protect America.”

During the past 50 years, NLSC has grown and changed in response to an evolving Navy, legislative reforms, world events, and threats to America’s national security. Today, NLSC is focused on delivering decisive legal solutions throughout the naval and joint force. By enabling operations, promoting force readiness, and preserving good order and discipline, NLSC materially contributes – every day – to the
Navy’s warfighting advantage.

NLSC is a dynamic and talented global team of nearly 900 dedicated professionals, including officers, enlisted members, civilians, and Navy Reserve personnel. Its legal expertise is vast – with leading experts in military justice, family law, and administrative law within its ranks. NLSC currently encompasses eight Region Legal Service Offices in 53 locations, four Defense Service Offices in 19 locations, and the Victims’ Legal Counsel Program in 28 locations.

“NLSC today looks nothing like NLSC 50 years ago; so, too, will NLSC continue to evolve and be responsive to the Navy’s needs in the future,” said Wilson. “Our people’s commitment to learning and innovation today will ensure the NLSC of tomorrow is prepared to meet future challenges, always remaining relevant and responsive to the Fleet.”

Throughout December, the entire Navy JAG Corps will mark the golden anniversary of NLSC – a watershed event in JAG Corps history – in myriad ways. Commemorative content will be shared via JAG Corps social media platforms.

Star Blizzard, formerly known as SEABORGIUM or BlueCharlie, is an organization with links to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) that targets specific individuals or groups perceived to have direct access to information of interest to Russia, including governmental organizations, the defense industry, academia, think tanks, NGOs, politicians, and others in the U.S. and UK, as well as targets in other NATO countries and countries neighboring Russia.



“Russia continues to be a threat. They continue to successfully use known spear-phishing techniques for intelligence gathering,” said Rob Joyce, Director of NSA’s Cybersecurity Directorate. “Those at risk should note that the FSB likes to target personal email accounts, where they can still get to sensitive information but often with a lower security bar.”



Following the previously published guidance in January 2023, the report details two new reported tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Star Blizzard to target individuals and organizations. The actor utilizes the open source framework EvilGinx, which enables them to harvest credentials and session cookies to successfully bypass multifactor authentication. According to the CSA, likely Star Blizzard activity expanded in 2022, to include defense and energy targets.



This advisory outlines mitigations to defend against Star Blizzard activity. These mitigations include using strong passwords, using multifactor authentication (MFA), completing network and device updates, exercising vigilance in identifying suspicious emails and links, enabling automated email scanning features, and disabling mail forwarding.

27,"Three Men Indicted for Environmental Crimes Committed in the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and Las Mareas Community of Salinas, Puerto Rico",https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-men-indicted-environmental-crimes-committed-jobos-bay-national-estuarine-research,"A federal grand jury in the District of Puerto Rico returned two separate indictments yesterday charging three individuals for violations of the Clean Water Act. The charges relate to the illegal construction and deposit of material into the wetlands and waters of the United States in the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (Jobos Estuarine Reserve).

Various federal agencies are involved in this ongoing investigation into environmental crimes in the Jobos Estuarine Reserve and Las Mareas community as part of the Caribbean Environmental Crimes Task Force, including the Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division (EPA-CID), FBI, U.S. Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division (Army-CID), U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Inspector General (DOC-OIG), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Law Enforcement (NOAA-OLE) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement (FW‑OLE).

According to the first indictment, from June 2018 to December 2023, Rafael Carballo-Díaz and Nathaniel Hernández-Claudio knowingly discharged fill material from excavation and earth moving equipment into the wetlands and waters of the United States in violation of the Clean Water Act. Carballo-Díaz operated a guesthouse business called El Cacique Resort on the property located at the southwest of Camino del Indio in the Las Mareas area of Salinas, Puerto Rico. Hernández-Claudio acted as a host and property manager at El Cacique Resort on the Property.

The second indictment charges Awildo Jiménez-Mercado with violations of the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act. Jiménez-Mercado knowingly discharged fill material from excavation and earth moving equipment into the wetlands and built a boat dock without authorization of the Secretary of the Army, in violation of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Jiménez-Mercado also operated a guest house business called “Hidden Paradise” on a separate property. Both El Cacique Resort and Hidden Paradise offered guests a pool, outdoor dining areas and housing units as short-term rentals.

The Clean Water Act was enacted by Congress in 1972 to protect and maintain the integrity of the waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act’s main purpose is to ensure the restoration and maintenance of the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the nation’s waters. It prohibits the discharge of any pollutant and fill material into waters of the United States except when a permit is obtained from the United States.

The Rivers and Harbors Act was originally enacted in 1899 and is generally considered the oldest environmental law in the United States. It serves to regulate and protect the navigable waters of the United States and prohibits the unpermitted construction of structures within those waters.

Both the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act protect the coastal waters within the Jobos Estuarine Reserve.

The Jobos Estuarine Reserve was designated as a National Estuarine Research Reserve by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1981 and is comprised of approximately 2,800 acres of coastal ecosystems in the southern coastal plain of Puerto Rico. The Jobos Estuarine Reserve contains mangrove islands, mangrove forests, tidal wetlands, coral reefs, lagoons, salt flats, dry forest and seagrass beds. It is also home to the endangered brown pelican, peregrine falcon, hawksbill turtle and West Indian manatee. The Jobos Estuarine Reserve is owned and operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PR‑DNER).

The three defendants were arrested and are scheduled to appear today before Magistrate Judge Marshal D. Morgan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico for their respective initial appearances. If convicted, the defendants are facing up to three years in prison for the Clean Water Act violations, fines and injunctive relief to remove violating structures. Jimenez-Mercado is also facing a maximum penalty of one year in prison for the River and Harbors Act violations.

Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) and U.S. Attorney W. Stephen Muldrow for the District of Puerto Rico made the announcement.

Senior Trial Attorney Patrick M. Duggan of ENRD’s Environmental Crimes Section and Environmental Litigation Coordinator and Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth A. Erbe for the District of Puerto Rico are prosecuting the case.

These indictments are part of an ongoing investigation that includes two indictments returned in May 2023. If you have any information related to this investigation or environmental crimes in the area, please contact enforcement officials, which may be done anonymously. The EPA can be contacted at (787) 977-5821 or at echo.epa.gov/denuncie-violaciones-ambientales. The FBI can be contacted at (787) 987-6500 or tips.fbi.gov/.

28,Two Russian Nationals Working with Russia’s Federal Security Service Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-russian-nationals-working-russias-federal-security-service-charged-global-computer,"A federal grand jury in San Francisco returned an indictment on Tuesday charging two individuals with a campaign to hack into computer networks in the United States, the United Kingdom, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries and Ukraine, all on behalf of the Russian government.

According to court documents, Ruslan Aleksandrovich Peretyatko (Перетятько Руслан Александрович), an officer in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) Center 18, Andrey Stanislavovich Korinets (Коринец Андрей Станиславович) and other unindicted conspirators employed a sophisticated spear phishing campaign to gain unauthorized, persistent access (i.e., “hack”) into victims’ computers and email accounts.

“The Russian government continues to target the critical networks of the United States and our partners, as highlighted by the indictment unsealed today,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. “Through this malign influence activity directed at the democratic processes of the United Kingdom, Russia again demonstrates its commitment to using weaponized campaigns of cyber espionage against such networks in unacceptable ways. The Department of Justice will respond to such behavior with an even more determined commitment to disrupt those activities and to hold accountable the individuals responsible.”

“Today’s indictment is part of a coordinated international response to send a message to the conspirators that the whole of the United States government stands together and with our partners internationally to identify and disrupt cyber espionage actors, particularly those seeking to obtain government information and attempting to create chaos in democratic processes,” said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. “We are grateful to all of our partners for their assistance in addressing these threats posed by the FSB’s action in the Northern District of California, across the United States and around the world.”

“The FBI will not stand idly by as Russia continues to perpetuate this type of targeted malicious activity,” said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “Russian interference through malign foreign influence campaigns is deplorable, and we will not tolerate it in the United States or directed against our foreign partners. The FBI is dedicated to combating this pervasive threat and will tirelessly seek to prevent and disrupt these criminal acts carried out by Russia.”

The indictment, which was unsealed today, alleges the conspiracy targeted current and former employees of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, Department of State, defense contractors, and Department of Energy facilities between at least October 2016 and October 2022. In addition, the indictment alleges the conspirators – known publicly by the name “Callisto Group” – targeted military and government officials, think tank researchers and staff, and journalists in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and that information from certain of these targeted accounts was leaked to the press in Russia and the United Kingdom in advance of U.K. elections in 2019.

As a common example, the conspirators used “spoofed” email accounts designed to look like personal and work-related email accounts of the group’s targets. The conspirators allegedly also sent sophisticated looking emails that appeared to be from email providers suggesting users had violated terms of service. These messages were designed to trick victims into providing their email account credentials to false login prompts. Once the conspirators fraudulently obtained the victim’s credentials, they were able to use those credentials to access the victims’ email accounts at will.

In addition to the indictment, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that it has sanctioned both Peretyatko and Korinets for their roles in malicious cyber-enabled activity. Moreover, the United Kingdom has issued sanctions of its own, and the U.S. Department of State announced rewards of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of Peretyatko and Korinets, as well as their conspirators.

In addition to the name “Callisto Group,” FSB Center 18 is known by cybersecurity investigators as “Dancing Salome” by Kaspersky Labs, “STAR BLIZZARD” by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center and “COLDRIVER” by Google’s Threat Analysis Group.

The defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, namely, computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison for PERETYATKO, and up to 10 years for KORINETS. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.

The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, the National Security Cyber Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division and the FBI San Francisco Field Office. The FBI’s Cyber Division, Cyber Assistant Legal Attachés, and Legal Attachés in countries around the world provided essential support. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.

An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

29,Georgia Motel Manager Sentenced for Trafficking and Forced Labor of Victim,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/georgia-motel-manager-sentenced-trafficking-and-forced-labor-victim,"A motel manager in Georgia was sentenced to 57 months in prison for trafficking a victim with respect to peonage, slavery, involuntary servitude or forced labor and ordered to pay $42,648 in restitution to seven individuals.

According to court documents, Shreesh Tiwari, 71, an Indian national and legal U.S. permanent resident, began managing the Budgetel Motel in Cartersville, Georgia, in 2020. Shortly thereafter, Tiwari hired the victim to work as a maid at the motel and provided her with a room where she could live. Tiwari knew that, prior to arriving at the motel, the victim had experienced homelessness, struggled with a heroin addiction and lost custody of her young child. Tiwari promised the victim that he would help her regain custody of her child by providing her with pay, an apartment and an attorney.

Instead of following through with his promises, Tiwari monitored the victim’s interactions with motel guests and employees and forbade her from speaking to them. He also discouraged the victim from communicating with her family and friends, falsely claiming that they did not care about her. Tiwari began making numerous sexual overtures to the victim. When Tiwari became angry at the victim, he threatened to evict her from the room he provided her at the motel, knowing that she would become homeless as a result. In addition, Tiwari threatened to report the victim’s drug use to law enforcement or child welfare agencies whenever he was angry at the victim. Eventually, Tiwari began to regularly “evict” the victim from her motel room, and even locked her out of her room at night without warning. Tiwari even threatened to call animal control to remove the victim’s dog despite permitting the victim’s dog to live with the victim in her motel room at first. Ultimately, Tiwari required the victim to perform sex acts with him to stay at the motel. If she did not, Tiwari removed her from the property, causing her to be homeless.

“Human trafficking can occur anywhere since traffickers are adept at identifying someone’s vulnerabilities and often fraudulently extend hope to someone looking for an opportunity to improve their dire circumstances,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “This sentence and the restitution secured for the survivors of this heinous labor trafficking scheme make clear that the Justice Department is committed to prosecuting anyone who flagrantly exploits their position of power. We will tirelessly seek restitution on behalf of the victims that traffickers callously exploit.”

“Tiwari used his position of power to ruthlessly abuse a victim he knew had already suffered immeasurably,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan for the Northern District of Georgia. “The level of this defendant’s callousness is shocking. But we are thankful that our community is now safer, and other potential victims spared, due to the excellent investigative work of our federal, state and local law enforcement partners who made Tiwari’s conviction possible. Our office also intends for Tiwari’s prosecution and sentence to provide a stark warning to other traffickers that these crimes carry especially serious penalties on account of the lasting harm done to victims and their families.”

“Tiwari preyed upon the victim’s difficult past and fear of homelessness to control and extort her, subjecting her to unspeakable horrors,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Travis Pickard of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Atlanta. “HSI Atlanta and our law enforcement partners will continue our efforts to ensure that predators like Mr. Tiwari will be held accountable for their actions.”

The HSI Dalton Office investigated the case, with assistance from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Bartow-Cartersville Drug Task Force.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Leanne Marek and Annalise Peters for the Northern District of Georgia and Trial Attorney Kate Hill of the Justice Department’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit prosecuted the case.

Anyone who has information about human trafficking should report that information to the National Human Trafficking Hotline toll-free at 1-888-373-7888, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

30,Antitrust Division Deputy Assistant Attorney General Michael Kades Gives Remarks at Annual CRA Brussels Conference 2023,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/antitrust-division-deputy-assistant-attorney-general-michael-kades-gives-remarks-annual,"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery

Thank you, Fiona, for the kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be here.

Given who is speaking and the expertise in the crowd, I fear the next 20 minutes will be obvious and basic (and devoid of humor).

But, that is the point. As an antitrust enforcer for most of my career, I am frustrated. Too often, the government has to litigate cases that should be obvious. The government constantly has to prove that water makes things wet.

There are many explanations: outcomes in litigation have a high variance, the law is not strong enough, the courts are too conservative, defense bar attorneys are better in the court room, the government is too theoretical, the government is too simplistic, we need less economics in the courtroom, we need more economics in the courtroom.

Yes. That was your joke, so if you did not laugh for the rest of speech, don’t blame me.

There is no single solution, but I want to focus on one specific area. If antitrust fights gave scars, I would have a deep one from the fight over merger enforcement in the hospital industry. Beginning in the 1980s, the government lost nine challenges in a role. Yes, it was corrected. But the empirical literature on the harms from horizontal consolidation in hospital markets is overwhelming.

A second scar would be from the fight over pay-for-delay patent settlements. After a ten-year battle with a serious of launches, the Federal Trade Commission convinced the Supreme Court (by a single vote) that a company with substantial market power paying a potential competitor not to enter the market can be anticompetitive.

In both those examples, the economics was clear. Economists found the results puzzling and were often surprised that the courts were relying on principles that were no longer valid, if they ever were.

So, one challenge is that antitrust law, how it is practiced, often clings to principles long after they have lost currency in the relevant field.

If we analogize courts to a policy making arm, the problem is not unique. In many areas, principles accepted by policy makers as indisputable turn out to have been rejected.

Economic propositions that were once taken as an article faith just a few decades ago now resemble discarded theories refuted by newer research: the minimum wage reduces employment or addressing inequality stifles growth.

That reevaluation is occurring in antirust policy as well driven, but not exclusively, by academic research. That research is driving changes in enforcement Good – and that is the critical word – economic analysis is and will continue to be critical for effective antitrust reform.

It should be obvious that the good research works it way into policy, but it turns out to be uncommon. As basic as it is, it is worth reviewing where and how economic research is affecting antitrust enforcement.

The 1990s and early 2000s were a heady time. Democracy had triumphed over Communism. The tech boom seemed to prove yet again the vibrance of western-style capitalism.

On economic policy, there was broad agreement. Clintonomics seemed to incorporate conservative critiques of big government while finding a role to address social and economic prices.

Antitrust law could be seen in the same light. In law schools, treatises, and in the bar, many celebrated a purported consensus one that mixed Chicago School and Post Chicago School ideas. There were debates still to be had, but they were on the margins and technical. In the late 1990s. I would have agreed. Spoiler alert – I was wrong.

Whatever consensus had existed was shattered by 2015. A broad public debate developed. No longer was antitrust enforcement a backwater involving a small group of experts.

Members of Congress began giving major speeches (or even wrote books) on the dangers of increasing market power and lax antitrust enforcement. The Economist and Time Magazine published stories on the growing monopoly threat. Congress investigated large Tech companies. Wildly divergent public figures from John Oliver to Tucker Carlson raised concerns about the lack of competition in U.S. economy.

The president of the United States created a competition council and discussed competition in his State of the Union.

I want to put the U.S. antitrust debate into a larger context. What is happening in antitrust discussions is part of a broader reevaluation. Take two principles – the minimum wage and the tension between growth and equality.

In 1946, George Stigler asserted confidently that the potential for the minimum wage to harm workers was “unusually definite for questions of economic policy.” Endorsed by many economists, that conclusion became a mainstay of microeconomics for decades.

This assumption remained largely unchallenged until studies repeatedly failed to validate its findings. In 1994, David Card and Alan Krueger published an article assessing the impact of New Jersey’s 80-cent increase in the minimum wage. They compared employment outcomes for fast food workers in New Jersey with Pennsylvania. The authors found no evidence that New Jersey’s increase in the minimum wage dampened employment in the fast-food industry; in fact, relative employment in New Jersey actually rose.

Thirty years later, few economists would contend unequivocally that raising the minimum wage is always bad policy. To the contrary, a review of the economic literature concluded that the effect of the minimum wage was so “muted” “that the minimum wage raises wages much more than it has any effect on jobs.”

With respect to economic growth, Professor Arthur Okun described redistribution programs as a “leaky bucket,” asking the question how much loss of water – of economic productivity – society was willing to tolerate to reduce inequality and poverty. That question haunted social welfare programs for decades. Yet new evidence suggest that the tradeoff is more complicated. As a 2014 OECD report concluded, “income inequality has a negative and statistically significant impact on medium-term growth.”

It would be shocking if those ideas – so central to policymaking from the 1980s to the mid-2010s – were questioned, limited, and even discarded, but the antitrust principles of the same provenance remained unscathed.

Indeed, many principles that have carried and continue to carry weight with many who practice antitrust law or judges who decide cases no longer should be accepted. Today, I will look at three of these principles that should no longer have currency in the law, identify the research, and how enforcement is changing.

The leader of the Chicago School, Robert Bork, contended that “changing market conditions and the temptation to ‘cheat’ frequently result in outbreaks of price competition that either destroy the cartel or must be repaired by further meetings and agreements.” This fragility, Bork posited, made cartels “easy to detect” and tacit agreements unlikely. In his view, “[i]f uncertainties and temptations break down even detailed and specific agreements on prices, what chance has an unspoken, detailed mutual restraint of surviving market pressures? The best guess seems to be none.” This admitted “guess” grew into a virtually indisputable presumption.

Even during this precept’s heyday, some scholars questioned whether cartels were really that unstable and competition that certain. And subsequent scholarship by Margaret C. Levenstein & Valerie Y. Suslow, among others, found that cartels have considerable longevity. Some cartels lasted decades. Often, only government enforcement terminated the cartel, not cheating or entry.

Two recent cases emphasize the ability of even a large number of competitors to coordinate over a long period of time. For example, the Antitrust Division has settled to date with four poultry processors over allegations that they collaborated, including during regular in-person resort trips, with their competitors in making decisions about worker compensation. The conduct persisted for at least 20 years without detection.

The Antitrust Division has recently brought an information-exchange case, alleging that the defendant has orchestrated for many years information exchanges among all the major chicken, pork, and turkey processors to exchange highly granular information related to price, output, cost (including labor), and other sensitive aspects of competition. The Division alleges that conduct began decades ago. That case is now ongoing.

As with traditional cartels, Bork asserted confidently “that we are entitled to be highly skeptical of the entire theory oligopolistic interdependence” and that he was “not persuaded that such behavior occurs outside of economics textbooks.” This critique, coupled with a broader attack on structural evidence in merger enforcement, drove the focus on unilateral effects.

The unilateral effects section of the Guidelines expanded from a brief paragraph in the 1982 Guidelines to “the theory . . . most often pursued by the Agencies.” Unilateral effects theories increased from “less than twenty percent of merger investigations at the start of the 1990s . . . to well over seventy-five percent of merger investigations by 2010.”

Not to be misunderstood, I am not a criticism of unilateral effects. The theory and its adoption by courts is an important victory for antitrust enforcement. It just should not be an either/or situation.

Recent empirical work has confirmed increasing market concentration can result in oligopoly price leadership. For example, one study found that, after the Miller-Coors merger in 2008, the two major American beer giants (ABI and MillerCoors) started pursuing oligopolistic pricing where, every year, one would publicize prices to take effect in a couple months that the other would follow. Ultimately, the study concluded that the price leader’s prices after the merger were about 9%. Similarly, a literature review of mergers in oligopolistic markets—which mostly examine airlines, banking, hospitals, and petroleum concluded that “[t]he empirical evidence that mergers can cause economically significant increases in price is overwhelming.” “Of the 49 studies surveyed,” which of course consisted mostly of mergers not challenged by the enforcement agencies, the authors found evidence of merger-induced price increases in 36.

We are beginning to see the impact of this work. Judge Pan, in United States v. Bertlesman, found the merger would raise the likelihood of tacit collusion relying, among other things, on the history of collusion in the industry. The Proposed Merger Guideline incorporate recent learning and research on coordinated effects.

A third area where economic realities have overtaken antitrust dogma is labor. Antitrust discounted the likelihood that workers or suppliers were victims of anticompetitive conduct or mergers. One argument is that labor markets are highly competitive, and some argued that monopsony power lowers cost to consumers.

Relatedly, In the past 40 years, courts in the United States are increasingly willing to enforce non-competes, whatever their breadth or questionable justification. Emblematic of this view, one prominent judge in the United States advocated for enforcement of such covenants on the ground that the employee is “an adult of sound mind who made an unequivocal promise, for which he was doubtless adequately compensated,” and that “[i]f covenants not to compete are forbidden, the employer will pay a lower wage, in effect charging the employee for the training.”

Those assumptions, highly competitive markets, benefits to consumers, noncompetes are a fair bargain and employees are adequately compensation all suggest that labor market are relatively free of anticompetitive conduct.

It turns out those assumptions were wrong. A recent literature review by Professor Alan Manning found market power among employers to be common: “All of these studies, including those with high quality research designs, show that firms have considerable monopsony power, even in online markets that, a priori, one might have thought would be very competitive.” A study by Professors Elena Prager and Matt Schmitt concluded that mergers dampened wages for specialized healthcare workers.

Nor has the theoretical support for monopsony power held up. Even if we set aside the legal rule that courts may not weigh benefits in one market against harms in another, monopsony power is unlikely at best to benefit the buyers downstream from the monopsonist. As Professors Scott Hemphill and Nancy Rose explain “when a merger suppresses competition between rivals for a seller’s business, ordinarily we may expect, in addition to the harm to workers or other sellers, inefficiency and consumer harm.” Increased classical monopsony power will harm have no effect on downstream purchasers if that market is competitive or exacerbate harms if the company has market power in the downstream market.

The research on noncompetes is more substantial. In the United States, noncompete agreements have become common even in low-wage fields, such as fast-food workers, which lack the traditional justifications for noncompetes. Several studies have shown that increased enforceability of noncompetes depresses – not increases – wages for employees.

Consistent with the literature, the Division has been active in addressing anticompetitive conduct affecting workers and suppliers.

Last year, the Antitrust Division prevailed in a labor-based merger challenge – blocking Penguin Random House acquisition of Simon & Schuster.

As I discussed above, we also brought a case alleging a 20-year agreement among chicken processors to collaborate on wage and compensation decisions. Those have led to consent decrees.

Last month, the Antitrust Division brought its first enforcement action challenging a de facto noncompete. This case reflected the many ways in which real-world experience departed from certain assumptions around noncompetes. The workers subject to the noncompete were contract farmers, not highly skilled workers or salespeople. The farmers received nothing for agreeing to the clause. And, as we alleged, the noncompete suppressed contract farmers’ wages by stifling competition among processors for their services.

If, as you listened to the last third of this speech, you thought something along lines of “Well, that point is obvious.” Exactly that is the point. Effective antitrust enforcement requires expunging ideas that, if they were ever valid, no longer are. Otherwise, we can’t hope to tackle the more complicated problems. I will now return you to regularly scheduled programing on cutting edge antitrust issues."
31,Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks at the White House Tribal Nations Summit,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-white-house-tribal-nations-summit-0,"Remarks as Delivered

Thank you. It is an honor to join this year’s Tribal Nations Summit, which is my third as Attorney General.

Thank you to President Biden for bringing us together and to Secretary Haaland for hosting us at the Department of the Interior.

I am especially thankful to the Tribal Leaders who have been participating in this summit for the past two days. I know you have had to take time away from your governance duties at home to be here. We appreciate your time and your commitment to the open and honest dialogue that we know is essential to our shared success.

To that end, I want to provide some updates on the Justice Department’s work over the past year on critical issues that are unique to Tribal communities, as well as how our broader work is taking into account Tribal interests.

First, I want to reaffirm that the Justice Department’s approach to our work together with Tribal communities continues to be guided by the core values of respect, humility, and honesty. We know that the strength of our government-to-government partnerships is critical to our shared future.

Second, I want to provide an update on a case that I discussed during last year’s Summit. I said then that the Justice Department had filed a lawsuit against the owners and operators of a hotel and bar in South Dakota for violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating against Native American customers.

As alleged in our complaint, the defendants both prevented Native Americans from booking rooms at the hotel and made public statements discouraging Native Americans from setting foot on the business’s property.

That kind of conduct is obviously unacceptable.

It is reminiscent of a long history of prejudice and exclusion that Native American communities have faced.

Last month, we announced that the Justice Department had successfully obtained a consent decree. The decree requires the hotel, bar, and individual defendants to issue a formal apology, and it stops one of those individuals from serving as an officer, exercising any management duties, or being on the premises for four years.

Moreover, our work to implement new policies, training, and a complaint process at that hotel and bar is ongoing. As I said last month, the Justice Department will continue to work alongside Native American communities to fulfill the promise of equal protection under the law.

I want to spend the rest of my time with you providing updates on the Department’s work in partnership with Tribal leaders and members to improve public safety in Tribal communities.

Central to that effort is our work to provide support to Tribal justice systems and Tribal law enforcement.

That is why, I am pleased to announce an important development in the partnership between the U.S. Marshals Service and Tribal law enforcement.

The U.S. Marshals Service has developed a legislative proposal to formalize its role in enforcing Tribal violent felony arrest warrants.

This would expand the practice that the Marshals Service has piloted over the last year to serve Tribal warrants at the request of, and in close coordination with, Tribal law enforcement and the Department’s Office of Tribal Justice.

This effort has successfully targeted extremely dangerous offenders.

We believe that expanding it and formalizing it will help to make Tribal communities safer.

This development also responds to a recommendation made last month by the Not Invisible Act Commission urging the Marshals Service to recognize Tribal warrants as they do state and local law enforcement warrants.

As another part of our effort to deepen the partnerships between federal and Tribal law enforcement agencies, we have expanded our Tribal Access Program. This program is an important tool for empowering Tribal law enforcement with access to the crime information they need to keep people safe. We now support 132 Tribes and more than 450 Tribal government agencies through this program.

The Justice Department has also continued to put its grant-making authorities to work to help strengthen Tribal justice systems and Tribal law enforcement. This year, the Office of Violence Against Women, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) provided more than $269 million, including over $70 million for the Tribal Victim Services Set-Aside Formula program.

In addition, these funds have gone toward improving the handling of child abuse cases, combating domestic and sexual violence, supporting Tribal youth programs, and strengthening victim services in Tribal communities.

Another important milestone in our work together this year was the launch of the Alaska Pilot Program, which was established by the 2022 Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. As many of you know, the program enables designated Alaska Tribes to exercise special Tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit certain crimes in their Villages.

This launch was possible because of the Department’s close coordination and cooperation with Alaska Tribes. I know that our ongoing partnership is key to making the program a success.

We have also continued our work to confront the persistent and unacceptable violence that Native American communities and families have endured.

Over the past year, we have significantly increased the number of Assistant U.S. Attorneys dedicated to Indian Country prosecutions.

And the FBI has increased its investigative resources in some of the Indian Country field offices that were in most need of personnel.

We have also dedicated more funding to FBI Safe Trails Task Forces to build on the success they have had in bringing together agencies, including Tribal police departments, to combat public safety threats, violent crime, and drug trafficking.

As part of our work together to improve public safety in Tribal communities, we remain committed to addressing the crisis of missing or murdered Indigenous persons.

In June 2023, the Justice Department announced the creation of a new Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Regional Outreach Program. That program will employ five Assistant United States Attorneys and five coordinators across the United States with the express mission of preventing and responding to these horrific tragedies.

The FBI also deployed Operation Not Forgotten across ten field offices from July through September of this year. That operation dedicated more than 40 agents, analysts, and specialists to investigating cases of missing women and children in Indian Country. It has already yielded results. Operation Not Forgotten has led to successful indictments, identifications of unidentified victims, and the recovery of one child victim.

Another area that requires our close coordination is responding to the fentanyl crisis, which is devastating communities in Indian Country and across the United States. I know many of you are working every day on the front lines to confront the fentanyl epidemic and save lives.

The Justice Department is committed to working with you to provide Tribes with information and resources to combat this deadly drug.

The DEA has been engaged in numerous cases in Tribal communities in coordination with Tribal law enforcement.

In just one example of that work, in April, the DEA and FBI worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Colville Tribal Police, Kalispell Tribal Police, and other law enforcement entities to conduct a multi-state operation. That action resulted in 17 arrests, 12 seized weapons, and the seizure of more than 160,000 fentanyl-laced pills, 80 pounds of methamphetamine, and other illicit drugs. Among the drugs we seized were several thousand of the rainbow-colored fentanyl-laced pills that the cartels design to attract young people.

In addition to coordinating our enforcement efforts, the Justice Department is also focused on supporting education and awareness efforts, as well as prevention, treatment, and recovery.

DEA’s Operation Engage has facilitated programs for Tribal youth, focusing on increasing drug prevention and awareness.

And our Bureau of Justice Assistance has provided training sessions for Tribal law enforcement, judges, and public safety personnel on our shared work to address fentanyl poisoning, including on the use of Narcan for fentanyl overdoses.

I want to thank all of you for being a part of this year’s Tribal Nations Summit.

More than that, I want to thank you for your commitment to working as partners to improve the safety and wellbeing of the Indian communities.

Your feedback and our ongoing dialogue inform so much of what we do as a Department, because we know that Tribes are navigating circumstances and complexities that can often only be understood through on-the-ground experience.

This was made very clear to me in August, when I went to Alaska and joined a roundtable with representatives of Alaska Native organizations in Anchorage. I had also planned to visit the Alaska Native Villages of Huslia and Galena to meet with Tribal leaders and representatives. I only made it to Galena.

We had a U.S. Marshals plane. We had a United States Air Force plane. And still, because of the weather, we were not able to get to Huslia. Had there been a law enforcement emergency, law enforcement would not have been able to get there. That experience made clear to me the challenges that Tribal communities face in a way that just reading a briefing paper would not possibly have done.

I have also held onto the conversations I had in October with the Justice Department’s Tribal Nations Leadership Council. We discussed a wide range of public safety issues, including law enforcement, funding, litigation, policy initiatives, and specific public policy concerns, including the crises of missing or murdered Indigenous persons, violence against women, and substance abuse.

I look forward to continuing these conversations.

In addition to my conversations, Department leadership has continued to engage regularly with our Tribal partners. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco spent important time in Oklahoma meeting with Tribal representatives. Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta also visited Alaska in October and went to Mille Lacs this summer. And Tracy Toulou, Director of the Office of Tribal Justice, joined me and the Associate Attorney General on our trips.

These visits have given all of us important frames of reference and personal connection to this work.

As leaders of your governments and representatives of your citizens, your insights are crucial.

I look forward to another year of working together as partners to create a safer future.

Thank you."
32,Brooklyn Hospital Dietician Found Guilty of Filing False Tax Returns and Obstructing the IRS,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/brooklyn-hospital-dietician-found-guilty-filing-false-tax-returns-and-obstructing-irs,"A federal jury convicted a New York woman today of filing and aiding in the filing of false tax returns, obstructing the IRS and willfully failing to file tax returns.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Ehrenfriede Kauapirura worked at a Brooklyn hospital as a dietician. Kauapirura filed a false amended 2015 tax return and a false original 2016 tax return. On both returns, Kauapirura reported hundreds of thousands of dollars in fictitious tax withholdings that she used to claim refunds of approximately $250,000 for each year, which the IRS paid her.

The evidence at trial proved that after determining that Kauapirura’s claims were fraudulent, the IRS began collection activity to recoup the funds it paid her. To thwart the IRS’s collection efforts, Kauapirura transferred money from her personal bank account to a bank account that she controlled held in the name of a purported trust. Kauapirura also submitted a bogus $1 million dollar check drawn on a non-existent bank as payment of her tax obligations. In addition, Kauapirura did not file individual tax returns with the IRS for the years 2017 through 2020, despite earning substantial income from her job at the hospital.

Kauapirura is scheduled to be sentenced on March 7, 2024, and faces a statutory maximum sentence of three years in prison for each false return and obstruction count and one year in prison for each count of willful failure to file a tax return. The defendant also faces a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division made the announcement.

33,Heritage-Crystal Clean LLC to Pay More Than $1.1 Million in Penalties and Implement Compliance Measures for Violations of Hazardous Waste Regulations,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/heritage-crystal-clean-llc-pay-more-11-million-penalties-and-implement-compliance-measures,"Today, the Justice Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement with Heritage-Crystal Clean LLC (HCC) to resolve pending claims of the United States on behalf of the EPA, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and the State of Indiana for violations of requirements governing management of hazardous waste, as well as a violation of used oil management requirements, at current or former HCC facilities located in Indianapolis; Shreveport, Louisiana; Atlanta; Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania and Denver. Under the settlement, HCC commits to pay civil penalties totaling $1,162,500 and to implement various measures to ensure that HCC facilities will not treat, store or dispose of parts-washing solvents that qualify as hazardous waste unless and until HCC receives a hazardous waste permit authorizing it to manage hazardous waste. Plaintiffs estimate that the compliance measures required under the settlement will cost at least $1,628,502.

“While federal law encourages responsible recycling of hazardous waste, recyclers must still comply with legal requirements designed to ensure the health and safety of our communities,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “This settlement reflects our commitment to ensuring that hazardous waste recycling operations are conducted in accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its regulations.”

“Companies that manage hazardous wastes for other companies are required to ensure that those wastes are handled properly, which Heritage Crystal Clean repeatedly failed to do,” said Assistant Administrator David M. Uhlmann of the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “EPA is committed to fair and robust enforcement of our hazardous waste laws to ensure that our communities and the environment are protected from mismanaged hazardous wastes.”

In January 2022, a 21-count complaint was filed against HCC in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and applicable state law. The complaint states that in the course of providing parts-washing services to customers throughout the United States, HCC accepted some used solvent that qualified as hazardous waste, but HCC did not transport and manage those solvents in accordance with applicable hazardous waste management requirements. In particular, the complaint states that HCC (1) transported hazardous waste without required hazardous waste manifests, (2) stored hazardous waste at various HCC facilities without required permits, (3) failed to make required hazardous waste determinations after mixing used solvents from different parts-washing customers, (4) failed to comply with certain requirements for reducing air emissions from certain hazardous waste tanks and equipment, and (5) failed to maintain adequate secondary containment for certain hazardous waste tanks. The complaint alleges that some used solvents managed by HCC were hazardous waste because HCC needed to subject the material to systematic gravity separation to make the used material suitable for resale. Plaintiffs contend HCC evaded hazardous waste requirements by improperly claiming that the unusable solvents were products instead of wastes.

As part of the settlement, HCC must perform compliance measures at multiple HCC facilities to achieve and maintain compliance with RCRA. As one element of the compliance program, the proposed settlement requires HCC to implement measures to ensure one type of used solvent referred to by HCC as “106 solvent” is acceptable for re-use without prior reclamation and that it is legitimately reused. The settlement will also prohibit gravity separation (removing water and solids while recovering the valuable solvent component) of used 106 solvent in order to meet re-use solvent customer product specifications or to otherwise render the material suitable for reuse. Used solvents that are legitimately reused for their solvent properties without prior reclamation are not subject to regulation as hazardous waste.

Another central element of the proposed settlement is a sampling program to determine whether another type of parts-washing solvent – referred to by HCC as “142 solvent” – exhibits hazardous waste characteristics. HCC must promptly remove from its facilities any 142 solvent drums and consolidation containers that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics, and HCC must thereafter manage such characteristic wastes in accordance with applicable hazardous waste management requirements.

The proposed settlement also requires HCC to apply for a RCRA permit at its Indianapolis facility. Pending issuance of the permit and construction of certain hazardous waste management units, the settlement requires HCC to implement specified interim measures at the Indianapolis facility, including frequent inspections of tanks and containers, as well as elimination of open venting of tanks containing used 142 solvent.

Finally, the proposed settlement includes numerous other provisions, including provisions that require HCC to distribute educational materials to parts-washing customers in specified circumstances, and provisions for HCC to retain a third party to conduct audits at designated HCC facilities to ensure future compliance.

The five HCC facilities included in this settlement are recognized by EPA to be located within communities with potential environmental justice concerns. Nearby communities will benefit from the improved controls and new work practices that will be implemented at HCC facilities as required by the consent decree. These new controls and practices will reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and reduce risk of exposure to hazardous wastes managed at these facilities.

The proposed consent decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, is subject to a 30-day federal public comment period and approval by the federal court. The consent decree can be viewed on the Justice Department's website at www.justice.gov/enrd/consent-decrees.

34,Florida Man Found Guilty of Trafficking Migratory Birds After Five Others Sentenced,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/florida-man-found-guilty-trafficking-migratory-birds-after-five-others-sentenced,"A federal jury in the Middle District of Florida last week convicted a Florida man of three counts of trafficking migratory birds.

Ernesto Gonzalez Campos is the most recent conviction in “Operation Ornery Birds II,” which has resulted in five other defendants being sentenced in the Middle District of Florida. Operation Ornery Birds II was a Florida-wide investigation conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

Painted bunting, Exhibit 36 in case 8:22-cr-00287.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Campos, 36, of Brandon, Florida, had engaged in the ongoing capture, sale and trade of protected migratory songbirds. On at least three occasions in 2020 and 2021, Campos sold and traded indigo buntings, painted buntings, rose-breasted grosbeaks and blue grosbeaks, all of which are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Campos trapped the birds from the wild, and once they were tamed, was able to sell them within the songbird community.

Prior to Campos’ conviction, five other Florida individuals pleaded guilty and were sentenced in U.S. District Court in Tampa. The defendants admitted to buying, selling or bartering a variety of MBTA-protected birds, all highly prized for their colorful plumage and singing abilities. The defendants acquired the protected wildlife through a variety of means, including the employment of baited bird traps and the barter, purchase and sale of specimens among like-minded individuals in person and internet sales sites frequented by traffickers. The following individuals were sentenced:

Jorge Luis Mena Graveram Sr., 59, of St. Petersburg, was sentenced on Aug. 8 to time served, one year of supervised release and a $200 fine.

Eliernesto Baez Garcia, 29, of St. Petersburg, was sentenced on Aug. 14 to time served, one year of supervised release and a $200 fine.

Ariam Rodriguez Diaz, 32, of Ocala, was sentenced on Aug. 18 to one year of probation and a $1,000 fine.

Jorge Alberto Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 57, of Tampa, was sentenced on Sept. 6 to one year of probation and a $1,000 fine.

Adrian Michel Ortega Rodriguez, 42, of Tampa, was sentenced on Sept. 11 to one year of probation and a $500 fine.

Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD), U.S. Attorney Roger B. Handberg for the Middle District of Florida, Assistant Director Edward Grace of the USFWS Office of Law Enforcement and Lt. Col. Randy Bowlin of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission made the announcement.

35,Justice Department Secures Agreement with Florida Restaurant to Resolve Claims of Employment Discrimination,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-florida-restaurant-resolve-claims-employment,"The Justice Department announced today that it secured a settlement agreement with OSI/Fleming’s LLC, which owns and operates the Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar (Fleming’s) restaurant in Sandestin, Florida. The agreement resolves the department’s determination that Fleming’s violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by discriminating against a lawful permanent resident when checking whether he had ongoing permission to work.

“Employers that discriminate against workers by rejecting their valid documents or requiring that they show unnecessary documents to prove they can continue to work violate federal law,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will continue to hold employers accountable for unlawfully discriminating against workers because of citizenship, immigration status or national origin.”

After opening an investigation based on a worker’s complaint, the department concluded that Fleming’s discriminated against a lawful permanent resident by rejecting the valid documents the worker originally provided and unnecessarily requiring him to present a document with an expiration date to prove his citizenship status. When he failed to do so, Fleming’s fired him, according to the department. Federal law allows workers to choose which valid, legally acceptable documentation to present to demonstrate their identity and permission to work, regardless of citizenship, immigration status or national origin. Employers cannot demand more documents than are necessary or specify documentation they prefer to see as part of this process.

After the department started its investigation, Fleming’s rehired the worker and paid him lost wages. Under the agreement, Fleming’s will pay a civil penalty to the United States, train its human resources staff on the INA’s requirements and provide an alternative way of accepting a worker’s documentation if the company’s software will not accept a worker’s valid documentation.

The Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) is responsible for enforcing the anti-discrimination provision of the INA. Among other things, the statute prohibits employment discrimination based on citizenship status and national origin in hiring, firing or recruitment or referral for a fee; unfair documentary practices; retaliation; and intimidation.

36,Director Rachel Rossi of the Office for Access to Justice Delivers Remarks at the OECD Global Policy Roundtable on Equal Access to Justice,https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/director-rachel-rossi-office-access-justice-delivers-remarks-oecd-global-policy,"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery

Thank you, State Secretary Kosi, and other distinguished representatives. Thank you to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for your leadership in advancing access to justice and for convening us here today. It is a delight to join you for this event, even if virtually.

This has been an exciting year for access to justice. At home, the Office for Access to Justice has grown from a handful of staff to over 40 public servants and has been firmly established as a fundamental component of the Justice Department’s mission. And our office has been pleased to collaborate with international organizations who have launched new initiatives, such as the OECD’s Recommendation on People-Centered Justice adopted in June, and the first-ever UN resolution on access to justice adopted in May in Vienna at the UN Crime Commission that establishes a first-ever meeting of experts on equal access to justice.

We believe that justice belongs to everyone. Yet, when communities do not equally access the promises and protections of our legal systems, it undermines trust in our institutions, diminishes the rule of law and weakens the freedoms which underpin democracy. Through data-driven people-centered justice, and broad collaboration, we can achieve equal access to justice for all.

People-centered justice requires improved data collection to better understand where access to justice gaps exist. Our office carries a critical mandate to assist with U.S. efforts to implement UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16. The Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development were adopted by all United Nations Member States to provide a shared blueprint and call to action for peace and prosperity for all people. Specifically, Sustainable Development Goal 16 is a commitment to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice to all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Every year, SDG progress is tracked based on global indicators, official statistics and other data and information. Data is available for many indicators, but there are still gaps.

Goal 16.3, in particular, utilizes criminal and civil justice indicators to determine the level at which a nation is providing equal access to justice for all, and measures civil and criminal justice needs. One way that our office is focused on improving better determining measures of civil justice is through a partnership with the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics to conduct the first civil justice survey of U.S. state courts since 2005. With our support, the Bureau of Justice Statistics will also award $2 million in funding for the Access to Justice Design and Testing Program — a multi-year initiative to expand the scope of publicly-available data on the civil legal system.

And while data is critical, it is one piece of a broader effort required to understand access to justice gaps and needs. To truly understand access to justice disparities, we must also center the voices and experiences of the communities we serve. As one example, our office staffs and directs the work of the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable, a collaboration of over 28 U.S. federal agencies, co-chaired by the Attorney General and White House Counsel. This broad agency partnership has recently focused on simplification of government processes to enable better access to resources that provide food security, housing and safety and more, by directly engaging with the communities we serve to understand barriers, especially barriers disproportionately faced by low-income communities, and communities of color.

Just yesterday, principal members of this interagency collaboration, led by Attorney General Garland and White House Counsel Ed Siskel met as part of the 2023 White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable convening at the White House and addressed agency efforts that further advance access to federal government programs, including through innovative community-focused models which support assistance by lawyers and non-lawyers alike.

Colleagues, our participation at this meeting today follows a long tradition of the Justice Department engaging with partners around the world to address shared challenges. In 1962, former Attorney General Kennedy affirmed this sentiment by stating: “Neither your nation nor mine can retreat within its own boundaries and seek a destiny merely for itself. In truth the world is now a seamless web from which no nation, large or small, young or old, can disassociate itself. Every attitude and every action of every nation can affect the welfare and security of every other nation around the globe.”

Indeed, this is why the OECD Roundtable is so vital. When we collaborate, we find that the barriers we face are not so different, and together, we are able to develop creative and innovative solutions. The Office for Access to Justice is committed to continuing this exchange ideas to drive progress.

Thank you."
37,Lead Defendant Pleads Guilty to International Human Smuggling and Cocaine Distribution Conspiracy,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/lead-defendant-pleads-guilty-international-human-smuggling-and-cocaine-distribution,"A Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty today to his role in a scheme to illegally smuggle Honduran nationals into the United States and distribute cocaine in the United States.

According to court documents, Carl Allison, 47, of Pittsburgh, conspired with at least seven others to bring Honduran nationals and cocaine from Honduras to the United States. In February 2022, Allison and others attempted to illegally bring 23 Honduran migrants and at least 24 kilograms of cocaine from Utila, Honduras, to Cocodrie, Louisiana, aboard the M/V Pop, a vessel co-owned by Allison. The migrants each paid up to $20,000 to Allison or his co-conspirators to be smuggled into the United States. At some point during a voyage in February 2022, the M/V Pop had engine trouble in the Gulf of Mexico. Allison and others chartered a boat to bring fuel to the disabled vessel so that it could complete its journey to the United States. Before the chartered boat reached the disabled vessel, the U.S. Coast Guard interdicted the vessel approximately 95 miles off the coast of Grand Isle, Louisiana, and towed it to shore.

For approximately three years, Allison participated in the scheme to bring Honduran migrants from Honduras to the United States via vessels such as the M/V Pop. Allison and his co-conspirators smuggled at least 15 migrants into the United States on each voyage. Once the migrants reached the United States, Allison and his co-conspirators placed them in factories and other businesses knowing that the migrants lacked authorization to enter, remain, or work in the United States.

Allison pleaded guilty to conspiracy to unlawfully bring aliens to the United States for financial gain and conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine hydrochloride. He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Three co-conspirators, all Honduran nationals, pleaded guilty earlier this year for their roles in the scheme. Darrel Martinez, 41, and Josue Flores-Villeda, 36, pleaded guilty to the same charges as Allison. Lenord Cooper, 40, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to aid and assist aliens to enter the United States unlawfully and attempting to bring aliens to the United States for commercial advantage and private financial gain.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans for the Eastern District of Louisiana, and Special Agent in Charge David Denton of the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New Orleans Field Office made the announcement.

HSI Houma, Louisiana, investigated the case, with assistance from HSI Pittsburgh, HSI Atlanta, and the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations, Louisiana State Police, Pennsylvania State Police, North Huntington Township Police, and Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office also provided valuable assistance.

The investigation is being conducted under Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). Attorney General Merrick B. Garland created JTFA in June 2021 in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security to strengthen the Justice Department’s efforts to combat the rise in prolific and dangerous smuggling emanating from Central America and impacting our border communities. JTFA is comprised of detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border. Dedicated support is also provided by numerous components of the Criminal Division that are part of JTFA, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and supported by the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training; Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section; Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section; Office of Enforcement Operations; Office of International Affairs; and Violent Crime and Racketeering Section. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in over 260 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of human smuggling; over 170 convictions; significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

The investigation is also supported by the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) and the Extraterritorial Criminal Travel Strike Force (ECT) program. OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level criminal organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies against criminal networks. The ECT program is a partnership between the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and HSI, and focuses on human smuggling networks that may present particular national security or public safety risks, or present grave humanitarian concerns. ECT has dedicated investigative, intelligence, and prosecutorial resources. ECT also coordinates and receives assistance from other U.S. government agencies and foreign law enforcement authorities.

38,Readout of Justice Department Participation in the 2023 White House Tribal Nations Summit,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/readout-justice-department-participation-2023-white-house-tribal-nations-summit,"Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and other senior Justice Department officials today participated in the 2023 White House Tribal Nations Summit. The summit reiterated the importance of Nation-to-Nation relationships and provided an opportunity for members of the administration to discuss key issues that the Tribal Nations face.

Attorney General Garland provided updates on the Department’s work over the past year on issues unique to Tribal communities and how the Department’s broader work is taking into account Tribal interests. In his remarks, he announced that the U.S. Marshals Service has developed a legislative proposal to formalize its role in enforcing Tribal violent felony arrest warrants, which would expand the practice that the Marshals Service has piloted over the last year to serve Tribal warrants at the request of, and in close coordination with, Tribal law enforcement and the Department’s Office of Tribal Justice. He highlighted how the Department has expanded the Tribal Access Program, supporting 132 Tribes and over 450 Tribal government agencies, and has significantly increased the number of Assistant U.S. Attorneys dedicated to Indian Country prosecutions. He also discussed the Department’s efforts to combat the fentanyl crisis in close coordination with Tribal law enforcement partners. In addition, Attorney General Garland provided an update on the Justice Department’s lawsuit against the owners and operators of a hotel and bar in South Dakota for violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And he reaffirmed the Department’s commitment to working alongside Native American communities to fulfill the promise of equal protection under the law.

Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta participated in a Nation-to-Nation Talk with Tribal leaders, along with Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Director Tracy Toulou of the Office of Tribal Justice, and Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Cohen of the Office of Justice Programs. These officials discussed a number of public-safety and justice issues with Tribal leaders, including special Tribal criminal jurisdiction, the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons crisis, law enforcement partnerships, and accessing funding and resources. Deputy Attorney General Monaco underscored the Justice Department’s commitment to working in partnership with Tribal law enforcement, including through the Tribal Special Assistant United States Attorney initiative and funding opportunities through the Office of Violence Against Women to support special Tribal criminal jurisdiction.

Associate Attorney General Gupta announced that the Environment and Natural Resources Division has established a dedicated email inbox for Tribal leaders to contact the Justice Department with litigation-related inquiries. She also described ongoing efforts to streamline the grantmaking process for Tribes and to explore the possibility of enhancing public safety in Tribal communities through Tribal compacting.

Associate Attorney General Gupta also spoke at a panel entitled “Substance Use and Mental Health in Tribal Communities,” alongside Tribal leaders and other senior administration officials. She emphasized the Justice Department’s commitment to supporting Tribal solutions for Tribal problems, and described how her meetings with Tribal leaders, including in Minnesota and Alaska earlier this year, have highlighted the importance of supporting Healing-to-Wellness Courts and other comprehensive services to address substance abuse and addiction in Tribal communities.

Associate Attorney General Gupta outlined ongoing efforts by the Justice Department’s grantmaking offices to make grants more readily accessible to Tribal communities, including through the Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation, which will be open in December 2023, and the Department’s Directory of Tribal Grants. She concluded by reaffirming the Justice Department’s commitment to supporting Tribes’ efforts not only in enforcement but also in prevention, support, recovery, and healing.

Yesterday, Director Rosie Hidalgo of the Office on Violence Against Women joined U.S. Attorney Alison J. Ramsdell for the District of South Dakota and Executive Assistant Director Timothy Langan Jr. of the FBI’s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch on a panel entitled “Next Steps to Address the Crisis of MMIP.” Director Hidalgo highlighted OVW’s commitment to addressing the crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons. Additionally, she announced that OVW released its first Notice of Reimbursement under the new Tribal Reimbursement Program, established in VAWA 2022, for expenses incurred in exercising special Tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit certain covered crimes in Indian country."

Focused on employers in Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, 3 Pacific territories

SAN FRANCISCO ‒ The U.S. Department of Labor announced that its Occupational Safety and Health Administration has launched a Regional Emphasis Program to promote workplace safety and protect people employed in the landscaping and horticultural industries in four western states and three Pacific territories.

From 2011-2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 1,072 work-related fatalities in the landscaping and groundskeeping industry. Of these, the 234 industry worker deaths in 2021 exceeded the national averages for fatalities, injuries and illnesses in other industries, a result that prompted OSHA’s action.

For most landscaping industry workers, a day on the job means facing the risk of amputations, falls, electrocution, excessive noise, heat illness and ergonomic injuries; dangers associated with motor vehicle and machinery operations; and harm caused by animals, insects, pesticide and other chemical exposures.

“By instituting a new regional emphasis program for landscaping industry employers in areas of federal jurisdiction, tribal lands, military bases and particular waterfront areas, OSHA aims to reduce the high fatality and injury rates we’ve seen in this industry while enhancing workplace safety,” said OSHA Regional Administrator James Wulff in San Francisco. “By intensifying our focus on the landscaping industry, we can show employers how they can protect their workers better and avoid needless tragedies.”

The new regional emphasis program includes employers in American Samoa, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, the Northern Mariana Islands and Nevada. Under the program, OSHA will conduct safety and health inspections of landscaping and horticultural industry employers and focus on tree care and related services, including tree and bush planting, pruning, bracing, spraying, removal and surgery; commercial lawn and landscape maintenance; and utility line tree-trimming services.

OSHA encourages small employers to use the agency’s On-Site Consultation Program, which provides no-cost assistance with safety strategies and compliance with federal safety and health standards."

The IHS-VA signed a Reimbursement Agreement on December 6, 2023, that establishes the terms for VA to reimburse IHS for health care services provided to eligible AI/AN veterans.
Through the new Reimbursement Agreement, VA will continue to reimburse IHS for health care and related services provided to eligible Native veterans by or through IHS-operated health care facilities and programs in the areas of direct care and outpatient pharmacy services. Under the new agreement, VA will also now reimburse IHS for purchased/referred care and contracted travel for eligible Native Veterans.
""Our American Indian and Alaska Native veterans deserve the best possible care available. Thanks to this updated agreement, they will now have access to even more high quality care,"" said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. ""The Indian Health Service has partnered with the Department of Veteran Affairs and tribal communities since 2012 to provide high-quality care to American Indian and Alaska Native veterans. I'm proud that we will continue to combine the expertise, services, and resources of our agencies to serve these American heroes, while also promoting cultural competence that reflects their needs.""
""This renewed agreement is a critical step toward ensuring that American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans can get the high-quality, affordable health care they deserve – no matter where they live – for years to come,"" said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. ""We are proud to work with Indian Health Service to serve these heroes, just like they've served us.""
This new agreement replaces and expands upon the prior agreement regarding reimbursement for direct health care services that both agencies signed on December 5, 2012. It also specifies reimbursement rates for direct care services; including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, ambulatory surgical care, home health, and medical equipment. In accordance with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act at 25 U.S.C. § 1645 and the VA Sharing of Health-Care Resources at 38 U.S.C. § 8153; VA is authorized to enter into reimbursement agreements to financially compensate IHS, tribal health programs and urban Indian organizations for health care and related services provided to AI/AN Veterans.
Since 2012, health care programs operated by IHS and tribal health programs have received over $186 million from VA for care to more than 15,000 American Indian and Alaska Native veterans enrolled in VA health care, across 74 participating IHS sites and 116 tribal health program sites.

44,HHS’ Office for Civil Rights Settles First Ever Phishing Cyber-Attack Investigation,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/12/07/hhs-office-for-civil-rights-settles-first-ever-phishing-cyber-attack-investigation.html,"Louisiana Medical Group settles after investigation reveals large cybersecurity breach  affecting nearly 35,000 patients
Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR), announced a settlement with Lafourche Medical Group, a Louisiana medical group specializing in emergency medicine, occupational medicine, and laboratory testing. The settlement resolves an investigation following a phishing attack that affected the electronic protected health information of approximately 34,862 individuals. Phishing is a type of cybersecurity attack used to trick individuals into disclosing sensitive information via electronic communication, such as email, by impersonating a trustworthy source. This marks the first settlement OCR has resolved involving a phishing attack under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Rules. HIPAA is the federal law that protects the privacy and security of health information. 
“Phishing is the most common way that hackers gain access to health care systems to steal sensitive data and health information,” said OCR Director Melanie Fontes Rainer. “It is imperative that the health care industry be vigilant in protecting its systems and sensitive medical records, which includes regular training of staff and consistently monitoring and managing system risk to prevent these attacks. We all have a role to play in keeping our health care system safe and taking preventive steps against phishing attacks.”
On May 28, 2021, Lafourche Medical Group filed a breach report with HHS stating that a hacker, through a successful phishing attack on March 30, 2021, gained access to an email account that contained electronic protected health information. When protected health information is compromised by a cyber-attack breach such as phishing, incredibly sensitive information about an individual’s medical records is at risk. The types of sensitive information can include medical diagnoses, frequency of visits to a therapist or other health care professionals, and where an individual seeks medical treatment.
Phishing attacks can result in identity theft, financial loss, discrimination, stigma, mental anguish, negative consequences to the reputation, health, or physical safety of the individual or to others identified in the individual’s protected health information. Health care providers, health plans and data clearinghouses regulated by HIPAA are required to file breach reports with HHS. Based on the large breaches reported to OCR this year, over 89 million individuals have been affected by large breaches. In 2022, over 55 million individuals were affected.
OCR’s investigation revealed that, prior to the 2021 reported breach, Lafourche Medical Group failed to conduct a risk analysis to identify potential threats or vulnerabilities to electronic protected health information across the organization as required by HIPAA. OCR also discovered that Lafourche Medical Group had no policies or procedures in place to regularly review information system activity to safeguard protected health information against cyberattacks. 
As a result, Lafourche Medical Group agreed to pay $480,000 to OCR and to implement a corrective action plan that will be monitored by OCR for two years. Lafourche Medical Group will take the following steps to resolve and comply with:
Establishing and implementing security measures to reduce security risks and vulnerabilities to electronic protect health information in order to keep patients’ protected health information secure;
Developing, maintaining, and revising written policies and procedures as necessary to comply with the HIPAA Rules; and
Providing training to all staff members who have access to patients’ protected health information on HIPAA policies and procedures.
OCR is committed to enforcing the HIPAA Rules that protect the privacy and security of protected health information. Guidance about the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rules can be found on OCR’s website. Additional cybersecurity resources may be found at:

(Photo: Damien Jemison)
  





Funding Supports Three Hubs to Build on DOE’s Groundbreaking Work in Fusion, Including Last Year’s Successful Ignition




WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced $42 million for a program that will establish multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary hubs to advance foundational inertial fusion energy (IFE) science and technology, building on the groundbreaking work of the Department’s researchers into harnessing the power of the sun and stars. The hubs will be led by researchers at Colorado State University, the University of Rochester, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where last year a team successfully achieved fusion ignition for the first time, proving that creating energy from fusion is possible. Fusion has the potential to provide abundant, reliable, and non-carbon-emitting energy, and President Biden has set a goal of demonstrating a proof-of-concept for several different types of fusion power plants in 10 years as part of the effort to achieve the Administration’s ambitious climate and energy goals.“Harnessing fusion energy is one of the greatest scientific and technological challenges of the 21st Century,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “We now have the confidence that it’s not only possible, but probable, that fusion energy can be a reality. The scientists in these hubs will be the vanguard of game-changing and planet-saving breakthroughs.”Projects funded by the program—known as Inertial Fusion Energy Science and Technology Accelerated Research (IFE-STAR)—will bring together expertise and capabilities across DOE’s National Laboratories, academia, and industry to advance IFE system components. Inertial confinement fusion is a leading approach to fusion that uses lasers or other technologies to compress and heat high-density plasmas. IFE-STAR projects will develop high-gain target designs; high-efficiency lasers at high repetition rates; and IFE-relevant fusion target manufacturing, tracking, and engagement. A major component of the funded projects is stewardship of the inertial fusion ecosystem, including the development of an inclusive and diverse workforce.“The University of Rochester’s Lab for Laser Energetics (LLE), fueled by its 400 Rochester workers, has long been on the cutting edge of energy, science and technology. Just last year scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, supported by Rochester’s LLE, produced a nuclear fusion reaction with a net energy gain – a major milestone in fight against climate change and creating cheap, clean power,"" said U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY). ""That’s why I’ve always fought to secure funding for the Lab and its innovative scientists and students as they work to advance the future of clean energy. As one of only three such hubs in the nation, this funding from the U.S. Department of Energy guarantees that Rochester’s LLE will lead the way towards a future no longer reliant on fossil fuels and ensures they can continue their vital work for years to come.”“Fusion energy has the potential to provide clean, safe, and bountiful energy to support America’s domestic energy supply and meet our climate goals,” said U.S. Senator Michael Bennet (CO). “I have no doubt that Colorado State University will play a key role in advancing important fusion energy breakthroughs and help Colorado continue to lead the country in clean energy innovation.” “This action from the Department is an important step to accelerate the advancement of inertial fusion energy solutions. I was happy to join the Secretary when she launched the IFE-STAR program during a celebration of the breakthrough achievement of fusion ignition at the National Ignition Facility last year. I am happy to see these research hubs launched across the country today,” said U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren (CA-18), Ranking Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. “I have been a strong advocate for the establishment of this very program for well over a decade. I’m encouraged that the Department is now following through on the strong direction provided by Congress in the bipartisan Energy Act of 2020 and the CHIPS and Science Act and look forward to continuing to track the progress of each of these impressive research teams.” ""I am thrilled that Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's National Ignition Facility (NIF)—a cutting-edge nuclear research facility located within my district—was selected to receive $16 million to advance fusion energy technologies,” said U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell (CA-14). “The Inertial Fusion Energy Science and Technology Accelerated Research (IFE-STAR) program will enhance global energy security, while highlighting the scientific advancements already made at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.""“I’m incredibly grateful to Secretary Granholm and the Department of Energy for recognizing the University of Rochester’s potential in the emerging field of Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) research,” said U.S. Representative Joe Morelle (NY-25). “For generations, Rochester has been synonymous with innovation, and it has long been my priority in Congress to launch our next chapter of regional growth and prosperity. This federal investment in our community’s scientific excellence will encourage our legendary innovation and unlock the next level of clean, safe, and carbon-free energy for the entire world.”Inertial confinement fusion has attracted greater interest and attention due to breakthroughs at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility, where on December 5, 2022, researchers achieved scientific breakeven, meaning more energy was released from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it. The researchers have since repeated the result three times(link is external).  The IFE-STAR projects aim to continue progress by addressing priority research opportunities outlined in the IFE Basic Research Needs Workshop report(link is external) as well as common scientific and technological gaps in the anticipated technology roadmaps of IFE fusion companies participating in the Office of Science’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program. Unlike magnetic confinement fusion, which aims to sustain a burning plasma for long durations, IFE will be repetitively pulsed. One of the goals is to develop the science and technology required to move inertial fusion from low-gain, single-shot experiments toward high gain and high repetition rates as required for a potential IFE pilot plant.  The 2013 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report An Assessment of the Prospects for Inertial Fusion Energy(link is external) recommended establishing a broad-based IFE program upon the achievement of laboratory fusion ignition. The Energy Act of 2020 and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 directed DOE to carry out an IFE research and technology development program. Now that ignition has been achieved and following the direction in the legislation, DOE is establishing an IFE program via IFE-STAR. The selected projects will build on and significantly leverage the world-leading capabilities, expertise, diagnostics, and facilities that exist due to sustained DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration investments in support of science-based Stockpile Stewardship, which uses scientific capabilities to certify America’s nuclear stockpile without nuclear explosive testing. IFE-STAR will also significantly expand upon IFE research that was jointly funded by DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) and Office of Science starting in 2020 under the ARPA-E Breakthroughs Enabling Thermonuclear-fusion Energy program.  The members of the three hubs are:  Inertial Fusion Energy-Consortium on Laser-Plasma Interaction Research hub University of Rochester (leader)Ergodic LLCUniversity of California, Los AngelesUniversity of Nebraska–LincolnXcimer Energy Corp.  Inertial Fusion Science and Technology hub Colorado State University (leader)Cornell UniversityGeneral AtomicsLos Alamos National LaboratoryMarvel FusionSLAC National Accelerator LaboratoryTexas A&M UniversityU.S. Naval Research LaboratoryUniversity of Illinois Urbana-ChampaignXcimer Energy Corp.  National Science and Technology Accelerated Research for Fusion Innovation & Reactor Engineering hub Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (leader) Focused EnergyFraunhofer ILTGeneral AtomicsLeonardo Electronics US Inc.Livermore Lab FoundationLongview Fusion EnergyMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyOak Ridge National LaboratorySavannah River National LaboratorySLAC National Accelerator LaboratoryTexas A&M UniversityTRUMPFUniversity of California, BerkeleyUniversity of California, Los AngelesUniversity of California, San DiegoUniversity of OklahomaUniversity of RochesterXcimer Energy Corp. The projects were selected by competitive peer review under the DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement for Inertial Fusion Energy Science and Technology Accelerated Research(link is external). Projects will last up to four years with total funding of $42 million, including $9 million in Fiscal Year 2023 and $33 million in outyear funding contingent on congressional appropriations. The list of projects and more information can be found on the Office of Science’s Fusion Energy Sciences homepage(link is external). Selection for award negotiations is not a commitment by DOE to issue an award or provide funding. Before funding is issued, DOE and the applicants will undergo a negotiation process, and DOE may cancel negotiations and rescind the selection for any reason during that time.

47,DOE Partners with Tennessee Valley Authority to Power Oak Ridge Facilities with 100% Carbon Pollution-Free Electricity,https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-partners-tennessee-valley-authority-power-oak-ridge-facilities-100-carbon-pollution,"Agreement Advances the Biden-Harris Administration’s Federal Sustainability Plan Goal of Powering All Federal Facilities with Clean Electricity by 2030   




WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced today they have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to provide DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and potentially other Federal facilities in TVA’s service territory, with 100% locally supplied carbon pollution-free electricity (CFE) by 2030. In December 2021, President Biden tasked the Federal Government with leading by example and leveraging its scale and procurement power to tackle the climate crisis, and the MOU will advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s Federal Sustainability Plan(link is external) goal of sourcing 100% CFE to power Federal facilities by 2030. “At DOE, we are on the cutting edge of researching and developing innovative clean-energy technologies, and it makes perfect sense that we partner with TVA to accelerate their deployment,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David M. Turk, who signed the MOU on behalf of DOE. “Together, we will show the Tennessee Valley Authority’s energy producers and consumers what is possible in the transition to clean energy.” “Energy must be a collaboration where we work together to find practical solutions that drive us towards a clean energy future,” said TVA President and CEO Jeff Lyash. “TVA is proud to be an industry leader in carbon reduction, and we are excited to work with the Department of Energy to explore options to provide 100% clean energy to crucial Federal operations.”   “Powering our government with clean energy in the Tennessee Valley Authority’s footprint is good for jobs, our economy, and our environment,” said Federal Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Mayock. “It is leadership and partnerships like this one that will accelerate our nation’s transition to a clean energy future.” While the MOU centers on DOE’s facilities in Oak Ridge, the two agencies will look to partner with other Federal properties in TVA’s service territory, which includes Tennessee and portions of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. TVA is a corporate agency of the United States, receiving no taxpayer funding, and is the nation’s largest public power supplier, delivering energy to 10 million people. It was established 90 years ago to serve the Southeastern United States and the nation by developing innovative solutions to solve complex challenges. In the coming months, DOE and TVA will develop a roadmap that could be implemented to provide DOE and potentially other Federal customers served by TVA with 100% CFE by 2030 on an annual basis, with at least 50% locally supplied CFE on an hourly basis to match Federal agency demand on a 24/7 hourly basis. The partnership between DOE and TVA supports President Biden’s December 2021 Executive Order 14057(link is external) reestablishing the Federal Government as a leader in sustainability and setting the example for the nation to meet the Administration’s goals of a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050. The agreement builds on the Federal Sustainability Plan, which aims to create demand for local clean energy and create a more stable and resilient grid while supporting well-paying jobs. Earlier this year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced similar agreements between Xcel Energy and DOE to provide CFE to facilities in Colorado and the U.S. General Services Administration for facilities in the Midwestern states(link is external) of Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. In July, DOE announced the Cleanup to Clean Energy initiative, an innovative effort to repurpose parts of DOE-owned lands—portions of which were previously used in the nation’s nuclear weapons program—into the sites of clean-energy generation. Initially the initiative will be focused on DOE facilities in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Washington.

49,No Veteran Dies Alone – Compassion and dignity in life’s final moments,https://news.va.gov/126613/no-veteran-dies-alone-compassion-final-moments/,"The “No Veteran Dies Alone” program’s aim is to ensure that Veterans are honored by a volunteer or staff member within 72 hours before their passing. It does this by meeting the unfulfilled needs of those Veterans who find themselves alone at the end of their life.

“In the tender and vulnerable moments of life’s closing chapter, solitude often looms for some of our nation’s finest heroes,” said Orlando VA Chaplain Eunice Smith. “These Veterans who have sacrificed so much of their lives to our nation find comfort in the compassionate arms of a dedicated team with the noble mission of ensuring their transition into the great beyond is met with the same unwavering commitment they once offered to us all.”

The program is personal

For Smith, the program is personal. Her brother, Elois Woodard, was one of five brothers drafted into the Armed Services. He was a Marine and Purple Heart recipient who served in the Korean War.



“Prior to passing away, he had wandered out of his home in the early morning hours in the cold streets of San Francisco and succumbed to the elements all alone,” she shared.



A poignant incident involving nurse Kiley Hilderbrandt caring for a Veteran also underscored the urgency of the program’s importance. Hilderbrandt recalled a situation with a Veteran’s daughter who needed to leave her father to tend to her young child. The Veteran eventually passed away with nursing staff by his bedside.



Due to Hilderbrandt’s experience, she reached out to Cristina Mercado Acevedo, Center of Development and Civic Engagement chief, to inquire about what options may be available for special circumstances.



“We deal with oncology patients and they sometimes don’t have families that are available toward the end of their life,” said nurse Allexius Harrell. “Especially during the midnight shift when families are not present. Having someone there for Veterans during this time makes a world of difference.”



Since June 2023, the program has grown significantly. “One hundred per cent of the Veterans who qualified for program have been served thus far. Plans for the expansion of the program are currently underway and there is no shortage of volunteers willing to help,” Hildebrandt said.



“Veterans weren’t alone in the battlefield, so they should not be alone at the end of their life,” Harrell said.

Volunteers provide activities and companionship

Numerous volunteers have voiced their eagerness to spend time with those Veterans who lack companionship before reaching the end of their life.

“We have established a new companionship program allowing volunteers to engage with Veterans, build meaningful relationships and provide comfort before the end-of-life process has begun,” Acevedo said. “Dedicated volunteers provide books, games, puzzles and other activities to share with Veterans to help with fostering connection and moments of companionship.”



The program upholds our organization’s sacred promise, “by honoring Veterans in their final moments, being present with them and expressing our genuine compassion, we ensure that a gentle embrace of humanity accompanies them as they leave their incredible mark in our memories,” said Hospital Director Timothy J. Cooke. “We should all be just as hopeful that when our time comes, others will extend a similar hand of dignity and compassion.”"
50,Don’t abandon your homeownership dreams to lender denial,https://news.va.gov/126824/dont-abandon-homeownership-dreams-lender-denial/,"When embarking on the journey to homeownership, don’t forget to focus on the most important step—ensuring you can secure the best loan. Not doing so could cost you money or even the ability to purchase your dream home.

To navigate the complex process of applying for a home loan, you need to be informed and be prepared. Understanding why loan applications are denied can save you from disappointment and keep your homeownership dreams alive.

Common reasons for denial

Application errors: Ensure your paperwork is accurate, consistent and complete. Inaccurate, unverifiable or missing information can derail almost any application. It is helpful to understand that your employment history, earning history and prior cost of living will be examined and verified throughout this process to ensure you can qualify for your proposed loan amount.

Credit rating: Regularly check your credit report for any errors or inaccuracies. You can obtain a free copy from major credit bureaus, like Experian, Equifax and TransUnion at AnnualCreditReport.com. If you find errors, dispute them through all three credit bureaus. Also remember, when you start this journey, if you incur new debt—like purchasing a new car or credit purchases—these impact your credit profile and could ultimately determine whether or you qualify.

Job stability: Lenders are typically looking for reliable and stable earnings, with two years of employment in the same industry. If you have been in your job for less than two years, you will need to illustrate how your prior education, training or experience has aligned you to promote your continued job stability. Be prepared to provide tax returns, pay stubs and additional employment verification documentation to support the loan request.

Appraisal issues: Understand the difference between an appraisal and a home inspection. VA-guaranteed home loans require that all purchase loans have an appraisal. This is required to confirm the home you are buying has the value to justify the loan amount. The appraisal will also ensure the home meets basic minimum property requirements, such as being safe, sound and sanitary. VA strongly recommends you also obtain a home inspection, which is your chance to inspect all features of the home you’re buying. This means an inspector will examine appliances, electric systems, plumbing systems and give you an idea of the overall condition of your future home.

Steps to take if denied

Consult with your lender: Seek out clarification on the denial reasons; lenders are legally obligated to inform you. Use this information to understand what potential credit improvements you need to undertake to be approved. This may mean to paying off certain obligations or making timely payments on all outstanding debt you have for potentially the next 12 months.

Apply with other VA-approved lenders: VA-guaranteed home loans are issued by various private lenders, and they may have differing requirements. If one lender denies you, consider applying elsewhere. Remember, interest rates fluctuate daily.

Don’t be disheartened if your application is denied. Take the time to understand why, remedy the issues and explore your options. By doing so, you bring yourself one step closer to homeownership.

51,No Veteran Dies Alone – Compassion and dignity in life’s final moments,https://news.va.gov/126613/no-veteran-dies-alone-compassion-final-moments/,"The “No Veteran Dies Alone” program’s aim is to ensure that Veterans are honored by a volunteer or staff member within 72 hours before their passing. It does this by meeting the unfulfilled needs of those Veterans who find themselves alone at the end of their life.

“In the tender and vulnerable moments of life’s closing chapter, solitude often looms for some of our nation’s finest heroes,” said Orlando VA Chaplain Eunice Smith. “These Veterans who have sacrificed so much of their lives to our nation find comfort in the compassionate arms of a dedicated team with the noble mission of ensuring their transition into the great beyond is met with the same unwavering commitment they once offered to us all.”

The program is personal

For Smith, the program is personal. Her brother, Elois Woodard, was one of five brothers drafted into the Armed Services. He was a Marine and Purple Heart recipient who served in the Korean War.



“Prior to passing away, he had wandered out of his home in the early morning hours in the cold streets of San Francisco and succumbed to the elements all alone,” she shared.



A poignant incident involving nurse Kiley Hilderbrandt caring for a Veteran also underscored the urgency of the program’s importance. Hilderbrandt recalled a situation with a Veteran’s daughter who needed to leave her father to tend to her young child. The Veteran eventually passed away with nursing staff by his bedside.



Due to Hilderbrandt’s experience, she reached out to Cristina Mercado Acevedo, Center of Development and Civic Engagement chief, to inquire about what options may be available for special circumstances.



“We deal with oncology patients and they sometimes don’t have families that are available toward the end of their life,” said nurse Allexius Harrell. “Especially during the midnight shift when families are not present. Having someone there for Veterans during this time makes a world of difference.”



Since June 2023, the program has grown significantly. “One hundred per cent of the Veterans who qualified for program have been served thus far. Plans for the expansion of the program are currently underway and there is no shortage of volunteers willing to help,” Hildebrandt said.



“Veterans weren’t alone in the battlefield, so they should not be alone at the end of their life,” Harrell said.

Volunteers provide activities and companionship

Numerous volunteers have voiced their eagerness to spend time with those Veterans who lack companionship before reaching the end of their life.

“We have established a new companionship program allowing volunteers to engage with Veterans, build meaningful relationships and provide comfort before the end-of-life process has begun,” Acevedo said. “Dedicated volunteers provide books, games, puzzles and other activities to share with Veterans to help with fostering connection and moments of companionship.”



The program upholds our organization’s sacred promise, “by honoring Veterans in their final moments, being present with them and expressing our genuine compassion, we ensure that a gentle embrace of humanity accompanies them as they leave their incredible mark in our memories,” said Hospital Director Timothy J. Cooke. “We should all be just as hopeful that when our time comes, others will extend a similar hand of dignity and compassion.”"
52,Don’t abandon your homeownership dreams to lender denial,https://news.va.gov/126824/dont-abandon-homeownership-dreams-lender-denial/,"When embarking on the journey to homeownership, don’t forget to focus on the most important step—ensuring you can secure the best loan. Not doing so could cost you money or even the ability to purchase your dream home.

To navigate the complex process of applying for a home loan, you need to be informed and be prepared. Understanding why loan applications are denied can save you from disappointment and keep your homeownership dreams alive.

Common reasons for denial

Application errors: Ensure your paperwork is accurate, consistent and complete. Inaccurate, unverifiable or missing information can derail almost any application. It is helpful to understand that your employment history, earning history and prior cost of living will be examined and verified throughout this process to ensure you can qualify for your proposed loan amount.

Credit rating: Regularly check your credit report for any errors or inaccuracies. You can obtain a free copy from major credit bureaus, like Experian, Equifax and TransUnion at AnnualCreditReport.com. If you find errors, dispute them through all three credit bureaus. Also remember, when you start this journey, if you incur new debt—like purchasing a new car or credit purchases—these impact your credit profile and could ultimately determine whether or you qualify.

Job stability: Lenders are typically looking for reliable and stable earnings, with two years of employment in the same industry. If you have been in your job for less than two years, you will need to illustrate how your prior education, training or experience has aligned you to promote your continued job stability. Be prepared to provide tax returns, pay stubs and additional employment verification documentation to support the loan request.

Appraisal issues: Understand the difference between an appraisal and a home inspection. VA-guaranteed home loans require that all purchase loans have an appraisal.

Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. This is the first time a FEMA Administrator has attended COP, demonstrating the agency’s commitment to climate mitigation and adaptation, and collaborating with the international community to combat the effects of climate change.

“We are already feeling the influence of climate change on a global scale as severe weather becomes stronger and more frequent,” said Administrator Criswell. “FEMA is typically recognized as a response and recovery agency, but now more than ever, we are a resilience agency. FEMA’s Year of Resilience is an opportunity to share best resilience practices, advance new innovative ideas and protect even more Americans against disasters. This was my first COP and I was excited to make new connections as well as strengthen existing partnerships with international colleagues. I’m looking forward to bringing the best practices we’ve learned back to the American people.”

While at COP28, Administrator Criswell had the privilege of meeting with UAE Civil Defense Commander in Chief His Excellency Major General Jassim Mohammed AlMarzouqi to discuss civil defense approaches in the UAE, the importance of readiness for complex crises and training standards for the emergency management workforce.

During her visit to the UAE, Administrator Criswell was also graciously welcomed by Deputy Director of Dubai Civil Defense and Deputy Commander of UAE Civil Defense His Excellency Major General Jamal bin Aded Al Muhairi. Administrator Criswell toured the UAE Civil Defense facilities and exchanged experiences on crisis management, including the importance of innovation and technology in support of management.

COP28 was a crucial opportunity for Administrator Criswell and FEMA leadership to meet with other global leaders championing climate resilience and adaptation. She also had the distinct honor of meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Deputy Minister of Environment and Energy Alexandra Sdoukou in a high-level dialogue about shared priorities, including preparing for, responding to and recovering from frequent and severe disasters including wildfires. Other meetings included bilateral engagements with the World Meteorological Organization, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, Japan and Chile among others.

57,EPA Enforcement Program Seeks Public Ideas for Supplemental Environmental Projects,https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-enforcement-program-seeks-public-ideas-supplemental-environmental-projects,"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a new effort to support the public in sharing their ideas for environmentally beneficial projects that could potentially be included in future enforcement settlements. These voluntary environmentally beneficial projects, called Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs), bring environmental and public health benefits beyond those required by law to communities impacted by a violation of an environmental law or regulation. “We want to hear from communities scarred by pollution about what projects best address the public health and environmental harms they have endured,” said Assistant Administrator David M. Uhlmann for EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “While supplemental environmental projects must be tied to the risk or harm caused by the violation, public engagement regarding possible projects should lead to better outcomes, particularly in environmental justice communities.”A SEP is an environmentally beneficial project or activity that is not required by law, but that a defendant voluntarily agrees to undertake as part of a settlement of an enforcement action. As it is tied to the settlement of violations, a SEP must reduce the risk or adverse impact to public health or the environment that the violations contributed to or reduce the likelihood of similar violations in the future. SEPs help secure real public health and environmental benefits for communities harmed by environmental violations that result in an enforcement action.  SEPs help address the disproportionate burden felt in many overburdened and underserved communities around the country by providing on the ground health benefits to address the harm caused by neighboring polluters. As a result, SEPs have been an important component of EPA’s enforcement program for decades. Over the past three decades, SEPs have been a part of over 2,800 settlements, bringing projects valued at over $860 million to communities and the environment.EPA has long encouraged defendants to reach out to the communities affected by their violations to discuss SEP ideas. In addition, if the Agency is aware of projects with community support, EPA can provide such information to defendants, upon request, for their consideration. However, the method for how the public could share potential SEP ideas with EPA has not been consistent or centralized over the years in part because the public cannot participate in confidential settlement discussions. EPA’s enforcement program is piloting the use of an email inbox to accept ideas from the public for potential environmental and public health projects that could be discussed during settlement negotiations. Anyone can submit an idea through this email address. Ideas for SEPs can be submitted to EPA at SEPideas@epa.gov. The following type of information would be useful to EPA and/or a defendant when evaluating a project idea:In addition, the email inbox will allow a person to provide contact information, if so desired, in the event a defendant or settling party wishes to learn more about a proposed project idea. More information about how to submit a SEP idea can be found on EPA’s SEP webpage. In the past, SEPs in EPA settlements have been used to support projects that bring significant benefits to communities, including projects that (1) abate lead paint hazards in housing by removing and replacing windows and doors coated with lead-based paint; (2) reduce emissions from diesel engines through retrofits or replacement with cleaner engines (e.g., electric vehicles); and (3) enhance the emergency response capabilities of local fire departments or hazardous emergency response teams through donation of critical equipment. Going forward, defendants who are interested in implementing a SEP as part of a settlement to resolve violations of environmental laws will have an additional resource to find suggestions for SEPs that may be appropriate for both the risk or adverse impact of the violation and the community impacted. Please keep in mind that a SEP project has to meet all the requirements of the Agency’s SEP Policy before it could be considered as part of a settlement, including that the defendant or settling party voluntarily agrees to do the project and the proposed project has a connection to the underlying violations, for example, fenceline air monitors to address Clean Air Act violations at a facility.  More information about SEPs, including EPA’s SEP Policy, Facts About SEPs and information about prior settlement agreements that include SEPs is available on EPA’s Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPS) web page."
58,EPA Releases Revised Policy on Consultation with Indian Tribes,https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-revised-policy-consultation-indian-tribes,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the revised EPA Policy on Consultation with Indian Tribes and the companion Guidance for Discussing Tribal Treaty or Similar Rights, reflecting the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to strengthening Nation-to-Nation partnerships. “From day one, President Biden committed to respecting Tribal sovereignty, honoring the federal trust responsibility, and engaging in regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with federally recognized Tribal governments,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. “With the release of our revised consultation policy, we’re delivering on the President’s promise to Tribes and I’m looking forward to EPA’s continued engagements with Tribes under this strengthened policy.”EPA has long been at the forefront of developing policy that ensures consideration of Tribal interests in making agency policy and managing environmental programs affecting Indian country. In 1984, EPA became one of the first federal agencies to develop a policy for interacting with Tribal governments, laying out how to consider Tribal interests in carrying out its programs to protect human health and the environment. In 2011, EPA was among the first federal agencies to issue a Tribal consultation policy and has since conducted more than 900 Tribal consultations. In 2016, EPA developed the Guidance for Discussing Tribal Treaty Rights, the first of its kind for any federal agency. Complementary to the consultation policy, EPA provides training to staff on working effectively with Tribal governments.  Successful implementation of EPA’s Consultation Policy is a top priority for the Agency.The current revisions were initiated by President Biden’s January 26, 2021 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation RelationshipsExit EPA’s website, which asked each federal agency to ensure regular and meaningful consultation with Tribal officials. EPA’s revisions incorporate standards developed by the White House and interagency workgroups to promote uniformity in the way the federal government conducts consultation with federally recognized Tribal governments. The finalized policy and guidance additionally reflect valuable input from Tribal officials and Tribal partnership groups. Key revisions include:Learn more about the EPA Consultation Policy."
59,"EPA Update on Sequential Sampling Study, Next Steps to Address Lead in Drinking Water in St. Croix",https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-update-sequential-sampling-study-next-steps-address-lead-drinking-water-st-croix,"NEW YORK - As part of its continuing partnership with the U.S. Virgin Islands government to address lead identified in the water distribution system of St. Croix, today EPA is announcing that it has concluded its sequential sampling study and made a series of preliminary recommendations to its partners. Initial samples taken in September by EPA, the Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR), the University of the Virgin Islands and the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (WAPA) at water distribution meters showed alarming levels of lead, but subsequent sampling data analyzed by EPA experts indicate the levels of lead at household taps are far lower than those found at the distribution meters. EPA has developed a preliminary list of recommended actions that the U.S. Virgin Islands government should take, including educating residents on steps they themselves can take at home to reduce exposure to lead, as well as improving the water system’s corrosion control treatment and replacing components that contain lead in the distribution system. A final report on the sequential sampling study will be available by mid-December.Of the 119 samples collected for the sequential sampling study at the 11 homes, three samples showed levels above the EPA’s 15 parts per billion (ppb) Lead Action Level. Two of those samples were from the first draw closest to the tap (28.8 ppb; 18.4 ppb); the third was from water closer to the meter (23.2 ppb).  The two first-draw results, closest to the tap, indicate the lead is likely stemming from the local plumbing within the faucet or the aerator; the third result, closer to the distribution meter, indicates the lead is likely stemming from the lead plumbing components in and around the distribution meter. The home with elevated lead closer to the distribution meter had a stagnation time of four days, versus the other homes with a six-hour stagnation, which may account for the lead levels in that sample.“EPA takes seriously any instance of lead or potential for lead in drinking water, and I commend the U.S. Virgin Islands government and WAPA for taking immediate action to advise people not to consume the water, to collect more samples, begin replacing components in the system and develop a voucher program,” said EPA Regional Administrator Lisa F. Garcia. “What we initially saw from samples collected in September showed very high levels of lead. While those samples were not from a part of the water system that is normally sampled, EPA and the Virgin Islands government had a responsibility to take decisive action and investigate the situation further.”Garcia added, “The levels of lead we have been seeing in subsequent sampling, including our detailed sequential sampling study, are much lower than those initial samples. But they do show some lead. This confirms the need to ensure that proper steps are being taken by the water provider and by consumers to protect people and reduce the potential exposure to lead.”As part of its work with the USVI government to better understand the contents of the red and brown water seen coming out of household taps on St. Croix, EPA analyzed samples taken at distribution meters to determine their metal content. These results showed high levels of lead and copper, prompting immediate action from both EPA and the U.S. Virgin Islands government.After examining the results of a November sequential sampling study and considering data generated from sampling since September, EPA is working closely with the Virgin Islands government to lay a path to lift the recommendation that people on St. Croix not consume WAPA water from the distribution system. “EPA has been working with the U.S. Virgin Islands from the very beginning to narrow down our understanding of what the sources of the high levels of lead were, and we feel we have sufficient information to guide the next steps,” Regional Administrator Garcia added.Levels of lead that were found at the private home taps during EPA’s sampling study are consistent with levels seen in other communities across the country. While no level of lead is safe, there are practical steps that people can take to reduce their exposure to lead from their household water. These include flushing their pipes before consuming water, regularly cleaning their aerators (faucet screen) to remove sediment and debris, and properly using and maintaining a water filter certified to remove lead.Before residents begin to consume water from the WAPA distribution system again, EPA is requesting that USVI regulatory agencies and WAPA develop and implement a comprehensive plan to educate the public about steps they can take to reduce their exposure to lead in drinking water. Implementation of this plan will help reduce the risk of lead in the drinking water and allow residents to resume consumption of the water if they follow guidelines provided in the educational campaign. EPA also recommends that WAPA address the lead from the distribution system, including optimizing corrosion control on St. Croix and replacing components containing lead in the distribution system. The U.S. Virgin Islands is already beginning to undertake EPA’s recommendations.The local and subsequent federal emergency declarations are focused on lead. While the red/brown discoloration issues with the water may not indicate an immediate health threat, EPA recognizes that these issues are still serious and need attention. Some of the measures being undertaken to reduce lead both by consumers and by the system may also help the red and brown discoloration and EPA will continue to consult with the U.S Virgin Islands to address that problem.EPA will hold a hybrid public meeting to update the public and will post the details of this meeting on its website.

60,North Denver waste solvent facility among several in proposed national settlement resolving alleged hazardous waste violations,https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/north-denver-waste-solvent-facility-among-several-proposed-national-settlement,"DENVER (December 7, 2023) -- Today, EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice announced a settlement with Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC (HCC) to resolve pending claims of the United States on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), and the State of Indiana for violations of requirements governing management of hazardous waste, as well as a violation of used oil management requirements, at current or former HCC facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Shreveport, Louisiana; Atlanta, Georgia; Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania; and Denver, Colorado.   Under the settlement, HCC commits to pay civil penalties totaling $1,162,500 and to implement various measures to ensure that HCC facilities will not treat, store or dispose of parts-washing solvents that qualify as hazardous waste unless and until HCC receives a hazardous waste permit authorizing it to manage hazardous waste.  Plaintiffs estimate that the compliance measures required under the settlement will cost at least $1,628,502.  “This settlement reflects our commitment to protecting communities, including North Denver, from the potential risk of exposure to hazardous chemicals,” said Suzanne Bohan, director of EPA Region 8’s Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division. “HCC’s compliance actions will ensure the safe handling of solvents and reduce potential harm to people and the environment.”   “While federal law encourages responsible recycling of hazardous waste, recyclers must still comply with legal requirements designed to ensure the health and safety of our communities,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “This settlement reflects our commitment to ensuring that hazardous waste recycling operations are conducted in accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its regulations.” In January 2022, a twenty-one-count complaint was filed against HCC in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and applicable state law. The complaint states that in the course of providing parts washing services to customers throughout the United States, HCC accepted some used solvent that qualified as hazardous waste, but HCC did not transport and manage those solvents in accordance with applicable hazardous waste management requirements.   Heritage-Crystal Clean, Denver facility The proposed settlement includes the resolution of alleged violations and remedies associated with the Denver Heritage Crystal Clean (HCC) facility at 5221 Monroe Street, located in the North Denver-Commerce City area, a historically overburdened neighborhood. HCC delivers solvent products to area customers from this facility which are used for parts washing. HCC’s Denver facility then brings used solvent from its customers back to the facility for transfer to other HCC facilities for reclamation. The primary solvent (142 Mineral Spirits) managed at the facility is an organic solvent with a claimed flash point of 142 degrees. An EPA inspection found that containers with used 142 Mineral Spirits on site exceeded the regulatory limit for tetrachloroethylene, making the solvent a characteristic hazardous waste subject to specific RCRA requirements.  EPA has determined the Denver HCC facility is not handling hazardous spent 142 Mineral Spirits solvent according to RCRA requirements. Specifically, EPA found that HCC transported hazardous spent 142 Mineral Spirits solvent without documentation required by RCRA and stored the hazardous waste solvent at the Denver facility without first obtaining a permit.

61,"Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC to Pay More than $1.1 Million in Penalties and Implement Compliance Measures for Violations of Hazardous Waste Regulations",https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/heritage-crystal-clean-llc-pay-more-11-million-penalties-and-implement-compliance,"WASHINGTON – Today, EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice announced a settlement with Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC (HCC) to resolve pending claims of the United States on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), and the State of Indiana for violations of requirements governing management of hazardous waste, as well as a violation of used oil management requirements, at current or former HCC facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Shreveport, Louisiana; Atlanta, Georgia; Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania; and Denver, Colorado.  Under the settlement, HCC commits to pay civil penalties totaling $1,162,500 and to implement various measures to ensure that HCC facilities will not treat, store or dispose of parts-washing solvents that qualify as hazardous waste unless and until HCC receives a hazardous waste permit authorizing it to manage hazardous waste.  Plaintiffs estimate that the compliance measures required under the settlement will cost at least $1,628,502.  “Companies that manage hazardous wastes for other companies are required to ensure that those wastes are handled properly, which Heritage Crystal Clean repeatedly failed to do,” said Assistant Administrator David M. Uhlmann for EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “EPA is committed to fair and robust enforcement of our hazardous waste laws to ensure that our communities and the environment are protected from mismanaged hazardous wastes.”“While federal law encourages responsible recycling of hazardous waste, recyclers must still comply with legal requirements designed to ensure the health and safety of our communities,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “This settlement reflects our commitment to ensuring that hazardous waste recycling operations are conducted in accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its regulations.”In January 2022, a 21-count complaint was filed against HCC in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and applicable state law. The complaint states that in the course of providing parts-washing services to customers throughout the United States, HCC accepted some used solvent that qualified as hazardous waste, but HCC did not transport and manage those solvents in accordance with applicable hazardous waste management requirements.  In particular, the complaint states that HCC (1) transported hazardous waste without required hazardous waste manifests, (2) stored hazardous waste at various HCC facilities without required permits, (3) failed to make required hazardous waste determinations after mixing used solvents from different parts-washing customers, (4) failed to comply with certain requirements for reducing air emissions from certain hazardous waste tanks and equipment, and (5) failed to maintain adequate secondary containment for certain hazardous waste tanks. The complaint alleges that some used solvents managed by HCC were hazardous waste because HCC needed to subject the material to systematic gravity separation to make the used material suitable for resale. Plaintiffs contend HCC evaded hazardous waste requirements by improperly claiming that the unusable solvents were products instead of wastes.As part of the settlement, HCC must perform compliance measures at multiple HCC facilities to achieve and maintain compliance with RCRA. As one element of the compliance program, the proposed settlement requires HCC to implement measures to ensure one type of used solvent referred to by HCC as “106 solvent” is acceptable for re-use without prior reclamation and that it is legitimately reused.  The settlement will also prohibit gravity separation (removing water and solids while recovering the valuable solvent component) of used 106 solvent in order to meet re-use solvent customer product specifications or to otherwise render the material suitable for re-use.  Used solvents that are legitimately reused for their solvent properties without prior reclamation are not subject to regulation as hazardous waste.  Another central element of the proposed settlement is a sampling program to determine whether another type of parts-washing solvent—referred to by HCC as “142 solvent”—exhibits hazardous waste characteristics.  HCC must promptly remove from its facilities any 142 solvent drums and consolidation containers that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics, and HCC must thereafter manage such characteristic wastes in accordance with applicable hazardous waste management requirements.  The proposed settlement also requires HCC to apply for a RCRA permit at its Indianapolis facility.  Pending issuance of the permit and construction of certain hazardous waste management units, the settlement requires HCC to implement specified interim measures at the Indianapolis facility, including frequent inspections of tanks and containers, as well as elimination of open venting of tanks containing used 142 solvent. Finally, the proposed settlement includes numerous other provisions, including provisions that require HCC to distribute educational materials to parts-washing customers in specified circumstances, and provisions for HCC to retain a third party to conduct audits at designated HCC facilities to ensure future compliance. The five HCC facilities included in this settlement are recognized by EPA to be located within communities with potential environmental justice concerns. Nearby communities will benefit from the improved controls and new work practices that will be implemented at HCC facilities as required by the consent decree. These new controls and practices will reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and reduce risk of exposure to hazardous wastes managed at these facilities. The proposed consent decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, is subject to a 30-day federal public comment period and approval by the federal court.  The consent decree can be viewed on the Department of Justice consent decrees websiteExit EPA’s website. For more information about this settlement, please visit Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC RCRA Settlement Information Sheet."

NASA Hubble Mission Team
Goddard Space Flight Center
NASA plans to restore the agency’s Hubble Space Telescope to science operations Friday, Dec. 8, following a series of tests to gain insight into the gyro performance that caused the spacecraft to pause science operations last week. 
After analyzing the data, the team has determined science operations can resume under three-gyro control. Based on the performance observed during the tests, the team has decided to operate the gyros in a higher-precision mode during science observations. Hubble’s instruments and the observatory itself remain stable and in good health. 
NASA is working to resume science operations of the agency’s Hubble Space Telescope after it entered safe mode Nov. 23 due to an ongoing gyroscope (gyro) issue. Hubble’s instruments are stable, and the telescope is in good health.
The telescope automatically entered safe mode when one of its three gyroscopes gave faulty readings. The gyros measure the telescope’s turn rates and are part of the system that determines which direction the telescope is pointed. While in safe mode, science operations are suspended, and the telescope waits for new directions from the ground.
Hubble first went into safe mode Nov. 19. Although the operations team successfully recovered the spacecraft to resume observations the following day, the unstable gyro caused the observatory to suspend science operations once again Nov. 21. Following a successful recovery, Hubble entered safe mode again Nov. 23.
The team is now running tests to characterize the issue and develop solutions. If necessary, the spacecraft can be re-configured to operate with only one gyro. The spacecraft had six new gyros installed during the fifth and final space shuttle servicing mission in 2009. To date, three of those gyros remain operational, including the gyro currently experiencing fluctuations. Hubble uses three gyros to maximize efficiency, but could continue to make science observations with only one gyro if required.
NASA anticipates Hubble will continue making groundbreaking discoveries, working with other observatories, such as the agency’s James Webb Space Telescope, throughout this decade and possibly into the next.
Launched in 1990, Hubble has been observing the universe for more than 33 years. Read more about some of Hubble’s greatest scientific discoveries.

The Autonomous Systems Laboratory team at NASA’s Stennis Space Center recently cleared a major milestone for a historic in-flight mission to demonstrate the capabilities of a site-developed autonomous software package.
The NASA Stennis team passed its software Flight Readiness Review for the first flight opportunity of ASTRA (Autonomous Satellite Technology for Resilient Applications), a partnership effort with Sidus Space. The aerospace company is set to launch its premier satellite platform, LizzieSat (LS), designed to provide turnkey access to space, in 2024. ASTRA Flight Software Version 1.0 now has been loaded on the ASTRA flight hardware and the ASTRA flight unit subsequently installed on the Sidus Space LS-1 satellite.
“This is a significant achievement,” Stennis Center Director Dr. Rick Gilbrech said. “This will be the first time NASA Stennis has flown software to space, and we are excited to join with Sidus Space for the mission. It is a great opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of the NASA Stennis software, as well as the center’s autonomous systems team.”
The recently completed Flight Readiness Review involved NASA Headquarters stakeholders and site engineers, as well as safety and mission assurance personnel, clearing the way for the mission to proceed. The review focused on verifying the baseline software version is ready to fly and is expected to function as needed.
The initial version of the software includes vehicle systems management capabilities, as well as the ability to update software versions and add capabilities during the mission, which could last for more than two years.
“The integration of the NASA Stennis ASTRA software will provide us with the necessary flight heritage for future deep space missions, and we are excited to begin this process,” stated Carol Craig, Founder and CEO of Sidus. “This is an important step for the two organizations and the industry as a whole as we step further into space and beyond.”
The ASTRA project began as a proposal by early career employees at NASA Stennis. Sidus Space is responsible for the launch, deployment, and mission operation of the LS-1 satellite, with the NASA Stennis ASTRA hardware/software flight unit scheduled as one of six planned payloads. At some stage of the mission, the NASA Stennis Autonomous Systems Laboratory team will have the opportunity for the ASTRA payload to send commands to the Sidus flight computer and have the ASTRA Flight Software perform targeted satellite mission operations.
“This is as real as it gets – a chance to truly ‘test as you fly,’” NASA Stennis Autonomous Systems Laboratory Branch Chief Chris Carmichael said. “It is a great opportunity to demonstrate the power and capabilities of our system and opens the door to continued work in intelligent and autonomous systems.”
Autonomous systems represent a new line of business for NASA Stennis. A recently released strategic plan calls for the center to accelerate the development of intelligent and autonomous aerospace systems needed for government and industry missions.

Air taxis hold the promise to revolutionize air transportation. NASA is working to make this vision a reality, collaborating with industry to reduce aircraft noise in our communities.
Quiet flight will be especially important when air taxis and drones take off and land in future airports called vertiports that can be integrated into both rural and urban communities. So, NASA is providing industry with the tools they need to predict noise as they’re designing their vehicles, well before they would apply for certification with the Federal Aviation Administration to fly in the national airspace.
In summer 2023, researchers from NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland traveled to Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport in Ohio to test an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) taxi produced by Moog. NASA’s team acquired data from the eVTOL during departure, landing, and while it hovered at 60 feet. A Moog operator remotely piloted the aircraft from a nearby ground station.
This was NASA’s second round of testing with Moog. In 2022, NASA researchers acquired noise data during an initial round of piloted testing, during which the Moog vehicle hovered in one location.
NASA will use the data from both tests to improve and validate noise prediction tools. The agency will provide both the tools and the dataset to U.S. industry to help with the design of quiet air taxis and drones.
This research is conducted by NASA’s Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) project of the agency’s Advanced Air Vehicles Program. RVLT supports NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility ​Mission, which is delivering data to guide the industry’s development of electric air taxis and drones.

The shipment to Israel arrived last month following coordination with Direct Relief — a California-based humanitarian aid organization — the Israeli Health Ministry, and IsraAID. The supplies to civilians in Gaza arrived earlier this week through coordination with Direct Relief. The delivery of supplies to Gaza was dependent on the opening of a reliable humanitarian corridor for aid, which occurred during the temporary cease-fire negotiated by the Biden-Harris Administration.

Amid heightened fears and concerns stemming from the conflict, Governor Newsom previously authorized the immediate expansion of funds to bolster the safety and security at religious institutions, places of worship, and faith-based institutions across the state and called on California’s university systems to take further steps to protect student safety. In October, the Governor traveled to Israel and also visited the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) disaster logistics warehouse in Solano County to help pack the supplies announced today.

The supplies delivered to the region are deemed surplus and do not impact the state’s ability to rapidly respond to any disasters that may occur in the state.

84,Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar Reminds Retailers of New E-Cigarette Law Designed to Protect Youth,https://comptroller.texas.gov/about/media-center/news/20231207-texas-comptroller-glenn-hegar-reminds-retailers-of-new-e-cigarette-law-designed-to-protect-youths-1701814424271,"December 7, 2023

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar Reminds Retailers of New E-Cigarette Law Designed to Protect Youth

(AUSTIN) — Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar is reminding retailers that beginning Jan. 1, 2024, it will be a crime in Texas to market, advertise, sell or cause to be sold an e-cigarette product in certain containers that are designed to appeal to minors.

“It is illegal to sale e-cigarettes to minors — these products are dangerous and most contain nicotine, heavy metals and cancer-causing materials — yet these products are intentionally designed to attract minors,” Hegar said. “Texas has taken action to deal with this kind of deceptive marketing and I greatly appreciate the partnership with retailers across this state to help us protect one of our most vital resources: our children.”

House Bill 4758 says a person commits a Class B misdemeanor that can lead to civil and criminal penalties if they market, advertise, sell or cause to be sold an e-cigarette product and the product's container meets any of the following criteria:

depicts a cartoon-like fictional character that mimics a character primarily aimed at entertaining minors;

imitates or mimics trademarks or trade dress of products that are or have been primarily marketed to minors;

includes a symbol that is primarily used to market products to minors;

includes an image of a celebrity; or

includes an image that resembles a food product, including candy or juice.

A violation can result in a Class B misdemeanor conviction punishable by up to 180 days in jail, a fine up to $2,000, or both. E-cigarette retailers also can face civil penalties up to $3,000 and a permit suspension or revocation for repeat violations.

More than 2.1 million high school and middle school students who participated in the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey said they use e-cigarette products, which were the most popular tobacco product among youth users for the 10th year in a row.

The Comptroller’s Tobacco Enforcement Program helps prevent children from obtaining cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. This vital public health mission requires constant vigilance and continuous effort on the part of parents, business owners, government officials and all concerned Texans. The Comptroller’s office and partnering agencies perform inspections for signage and employee compliance concerning the sale, possession and use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes and tobacco products.

Violations of tobacco control laws can be reported anonymously by calling the Texas E-Cigarette and Tobacco Hotline at 800-345-8647 or by emailing tobacco.enforcement@cpa.texas.gov."
85,Governor Hochul Announces Completion of 42-Unit Affordable Housing Development in Ithaca,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-completion-42-unit-affordable-housing-development-ithaca,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the completion of Marketview Apartments, a new four-story development with 42 affordable apartments on Ithaca’s waterfront. The all-electric, energy-efficient building stands in Cayuga Park next to the city’s community gardens and offers numerous family-friendly amenities.

“Our latest investment in Ithaca continues a pattern of sustained growth and provides an opportunity for more people to enjoy the benefits of this vibrant city and its wonderful waterfront,” Governor Hochul said. “The opening of Marketview Apartments demonstrates that commitment to addressing the housing crisis will benefit residents in communities across the state and ensure more New Yorkers have an affordable, modern, and secure place to call home.”

In the last five years, New York State Homes and Community Renewal has created or preserved more than 1,000 affordable homes in Tompkins County. Marketview Apartments continues this effort and complements Governor Hochul's $25 billion comprehensive Housing Plan to create or preserve 100,000 affordable homes across New York, including 10,000 with support services for vulnerable populations, plus the electrification of an additional 50,000 homes.

All 42 apartments are affordable to households with incomes at or below 60 percent of the Area Median Income. Residential amenities include a community room, laundry room, a patio, and playground. Each apartment has its own patio or balcony, and residents are provided with free high-speed broadband internet. The site also includes open green space, plazas for events/outdoor dining, and storm water management gardens featuring native plantings.

Marketview Apartments was awarded funding from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s New Construction Housing Program to achieve a high level of sustainability and carbon reduction. The all-electric development also meets green building standards required for Enterprise Green Communities Plus certification and US Green Building Council LEED standards. All apartments have ENERGY STAR rated appliances, equipment and lighting, low-VOC building materials and integrated pest management.

The developer is Rochester-based Park Grove Development, LLC, in alliance with Cayuga Medical Center of Ithaca, Inc. as non-profit partner.

State financing for the $14 million development includes nearly $9 million in federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and $2.4 million in subsidy from HCR. NYSERDA awarded $147,000. The Community Preservation Corporation provided a $1.8 million permanent loan insured by the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the Tompkins County Housing Trust Fund contributed $300,000.

New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “Under Governor Hochul’s housing plan, we are making strategic investments to accelerate affordable housing growth in communities across New York. The $14 million Marketview Apartments development is the latest addition to our portfolio in Ithaca, providing 42 safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly homes in a beautiful setting on the city’s waterfront. Congratulations to Park Grove and Cayuga Health, as well as our financing partners at CPC and Tompkins County, for working with us to create high-quality homes for New Yorkers.”

NYSERDA President and CEO, Doreen M. Harris said, “It is always rewarding to see the completion of residential projects like Marketview Apartments, which are paramount to achieving Governor Hochul’s commitment to providing all New Yorkers with access to affordable, comfortable and energy efficient housing. As we continue our comprehensive efforts to combat climate change, NYSERDA looks forward to working with stakeholders and our sister agencies to bring more projects like this to fruition, helping foster greener, more resilient communities across the state.”

Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said, “Every Ithaca resident deserves a safe and secure place to call home, and I am proud to see the completion of this affordable housing for Tompkins County. By using $9 million in federal Low Income Tax Credits, which I have long worked hard to strengthen, to create over 40 new affordable, accessible apartments for families in Ithaca, this new energy-efficient development will help lay the foundation for a more equitable future for all Ithacans. I applaud Governor Hochul's commitment to increasing access to affordable housing in Ithaca and across New York State, and I will keep fighting to increase the supply of housing and create a more affordable and livable New York for all.""

State Senator Lea Webb said, ""Access to quality and affordable housing is one of our most pressing issues across the Southern Tier. The completion of 42 units of housing for low-to moderate income households in the City of Ithaca will not only help us meet some of the ongoing need for affordable housing here in Tompkins County, but will also ensure that these households have easy access to grocery stores, the Ithaca Farmers Market, and other community resources. I am pleased that we were able to provide state support for this project to increase our affordable and sustainable housing supply, while strengthening our community.”

Assemblymember Anna Kelles said, ""New affordable workforce housing is exactly what our Ithaca community needs to release the intense pressure valve on our housing crisis that is contributing to the consistently rising cost of living and to help our residents thrive. By having affordable housing dedicated to households with incomes at or below 60% of the Area Median Income, some of the corresponding burdens associated with a lack of long-term housing will be alleviated. A lack of stable consistent housing is associated with decreased educational performance for children, mental health crises for children and adults, instability in job attainment and retention to name a few. Ensuring stable housing, in effective, is a prudent preventative measure to this myriad of public health issues. I thank the developers and NYS Homes and Community Renewal for funding this project and working to ensure this building achieves a high level of sustainability and carbon reduction by being designed in accordance with green building standards required for the Enterprise Green Communities Plus certification.”

Tompkins County Legislature Chairwoman Shawna M. Black said, 'Congratulations to Park Grove and Cayuga Medical Center for their excellent permanently affordable housing development. I’m proud that Tompkins County’s Community Housing Development Fund contributed to this project and grateful for the other public funding sources that helped to make this happen. This is an inspiring development that puts affordable housing close to amenities in our community, I hope more projects continue to take a similar approach to Marketview.""

City of Ithaca Mayor Laura Lewis said, “The City of Ithaca is excited and pleased to celebrate the ribbon cutting at MarketView Apartments. This component of the overall Cayuga Park project will serve those most in need in our community. It is fantastic that residents will have a new, high-quality, energy efficient home, that is close to so many amenities, including the newly-opened medical office facilities on the campus. We applaud the development team and Cayuga Medical Center for making MarketView a part of this important community development project.”

The Community Preservation Corporation Vice President and Mortgage Officer Miriam Zinter said, ""An affordable place to call home is the cornerstone of community stability, offering residents not just a place to live, but a foundation upon which they can build secure and fulfilling lives. When individuals and families have access to affordable housing, it fosters a sense of stability that is carried throughout the entire neighborhood. The Marketview Apartments brings that stability and opportunity to the Ithaca community and to the families who call it home. My thanks to Park Grove for their vision and dedication to bringing this project to fruition, to the team at NYS Homes and Community Renewal, and to all of our partners who are committed to creating a more affordable New York.”

Park Grove Realty Managing Partner Andrew Crossed said, “Marketview Apartments is a state-of-the-art apartment project that provides 42 units of desperately needed affordable housing in a very strategic location in Downtown Ithaca. The project would not be possible without the close collaboration of the public and private sectors, and we would like to thank the city of Ithaca, Tompkins County and the State of New York for their commitment and support to make this project a reality.”

Cayuga Health President and CEO Martin Stallone, MD said, “Cayuga Health recognizes access to high-quality, safe housing as a known social determinant of health. Affordable housing is a mark of a responsible community and an investment in our community’s health and wellness. Cayuga Health congratulates Park Grove on this milestone.”

86,"Video, Audio, Photos & Rush Transcript: Governor Hochul Updates New Yorkers on Incident at Albany Synagogue",https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-governor-hochul-updates-new-yorkers-incident-albany,"Earlier today, Governor Kathy Hochul updated New Yorkers on an incident where shots were fired on the premises of Temple Israel in Albany. The Governor has directed the New York State Police and New York National Guard to be on high alert and increase the existing patrols of at-risk sites planned for the Hanukkah holiday, including at synagogues, yeshivas and community centers. The Governor previously released an official statement regarding this incident, which can be found here.

VIDEO of the event is available on YouTube here and in TV quality (h.264, mp4) format here.

AUDIO of the event is available here.

PHOTOS of the event are available on the Governor's Flickr page.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Good afternoon. Today, I'm joined by our Director of State Operations, Kathryn Garcia, and our Deputy Secretary of Public Safety, Marcos Soler. At approximately 2:27 p.m. today, there was an incident at the Temple Israel in Albany, within the city of Albany's confines. Shots were fired outside the temple in the parking area. There were no injuries or fatalities.

The suspect is a 28-year-old local resident who was walking around outside the synagogue acting very suspicious, according to witnesses. He fired off a round from a shotgun while making threatening statements. After the shots were fired, the police were called, and on the premises was an early childhood center with at least two dozen children, preschoolers, who were on the premises. The parents were contacted, the facility went immediately into lockdown, and as of this time, the parents have been able to retrieve their children, and the lockdown has been lifted. All the children have been released safely.

Federal law enforcement is currently leading the investigation, with the support of New York State Police, who were on site at the time, immediately following the incident, as well as the Albany Police. The New York State Hate Crimes [Task Force] is involved.

I immediately called the Rabbi, I knew this Rabbi because literally on October 7th, after the horrific attack on Israel, I went to the synagogue, and I spoke. So, I spoke with Dr. Rabbi Anderson tonight and assured her that the State of New York will do everything possible to restore the sense of security that her congregation needs at this time.

I will also be planning to attend at this time, Shabbat Services at this temple Friday evening. As we've talked about before, after the October 7th attacks, I've directed our State Police, as well as the National Guard, to be on high alert. They have been conducting surveillance and created a presence at synagogues, yeshivas, museums, cultural centers, all vulnerable targets throughout the State of New York ever since October 7th. And especially during the holiday season. As we begin Hanukkah tonight, I directed earlier this week that they continue to actually increase their presence at all these locations.

This builds on the significant efforts that we’ve already undertaken, making sure that we've mobilized State Police, invested tens of millions of dollars in additional security devices and measures, developed online strategies to help suppress hate at the source. Also, $50 million to help local law enforcement so they can do their job to protect our communities who are under siege at this time. We also made sure that the threat assessment teams are activated at every college and creating 36 county-based teams operating across New York.

In addition, I had previously asked former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, Jonathan Lippman, to begin an investigation into antisemitism and hate crimes across SUNY and CUNY campuses.

The bottom line is this: the safety of Jewish New Yorkers is nonnegotiable. Every act, whether it's verbal or physical, any act of antisemitism is unacceptable and undermining the public safety at our synagogue on the first night of Hanukkah is even more deplorable.

The prospect of violence in a place of worship is not just an attack on the building. It's an attack on the very fabric of our society, our freedom to express our faith, our collective shared sense of safety. And I remind everyone, as New Yorkers, this is not who we are. This must stop. We reject hate, antisemitism, Islamophobia. All hate crimes must stop and all violence in every form must cease.

We have no tolerance for these acts of evil that have now permeated our society. And the rise in antisemitism that started centuries ago is dramatically on the rise in our own state since October 7th. It has increased and fueled the anxiety of Jewish New Yorkers throughout every corner of the state.

Thankfully, at this time, no one was injured in this incident. But the fear that it has wreaked, and the fear and the anxiety that it has caused, I know a lot of people are feeling really shaken right now. This wasn't the first incident at Temple Israel. In September, it was one of multiple synagogues targeted with bomb threats.

And now to know there's an individual who literally brought a gun – a loaded weapon – to their premises, shakes people to their core. They shouldn't have to be so frightened. At a time, with this beautiful holiday about to commence, people should be relishing in the light of the world. That's what the tradition is all about, the lighting of the candles.

This state must not descend into darkness. We need this light to shine bright. And if all New Yorkers stand up for each other, to defend each other's dignity, respect each other's differences – because that is what New York is to its very core and always will be. But we must protect it.

We will stand together against violence, bigotry and hatred, reaffirming our commitment to unity and understanding and protection. So, here's my commitment to Jewish New Yorkers: we will not be intimidated into silence, we will not be threatened into submission, and we will celebrate every aspect of the great Jewish traditions, starting here with Hanukkah because these must be kept alive as they have been through centuries of persecution before.

We will tolerate no hate in the State of New York, and I will use every single resource as Governor of the State of New York at my disposal to make sure that everyone in the State of New York is safe. At this point, I'm going to ask Eva Wyner, the Deputy Director of Jewish Affairs, to join me in lighting the menorah for this first night of Hanukkah.

Eva traveled with me to Israel in the aftermath of October 7th. I want to thank her for her courage and for her willingness to stand up as a proud Jewish woman here in the State of New York. Thank you for your service to millions of New Yorkers, Eva, and I'll let you have the honors."
87,Statement from Governor Kathy Hochul on Incident at Temple Israel in Albany,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/statement-governor-kathy-hochul-incident-temple-israel-albany,"“Earlier today, there was an incident where shots were fired on the premises of Temple Israel in Albany and federal, state and local law enforcement are conducting an investigation. We will update New Yorkers as we know more, but thankfully, there have been no injuries or fatalities. I have spoken to the Rabbi at Temple Israel and assured her the State will do everything in our power to restore the sense of security her community needs.

“I am immediately directing the New York State Police and New York National Guard to be on high alert and increase the existing patrols of at-risk sites we had planned for the Hanukkah holiday, including at synagogues, yeshivas and community centers, and working closely with local law enforcement. This builds on the significant efforts we have taken to protect religious communities in the wake of the October 7 attacks. Make no mistake: the safety of Jewish New Yorkers is non-negotiable.

“Any act of antisemitism is unacceptable, and undermining public safety at a synagogue on the first night of Hanukkah is even more deplorable. As New Yorkers, we must stand united: this is not who we are. We reject hate, antisemitism and violence in all forms. And we have no tolerance for the forces of evil who are trying to tear our communities apart.”"

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

I want to acknowledge that tonight is the first night of Hanukkah and it's been a challenge for members of the Jewish community, especially with the horrible rise in antisemitism. It's normally a time of light and joy, and I want to make sure we continue to bring light to everyone and let them know what the State of New York is doing to fight antisemitism.

Some horrible incidences not far from here at Cornell University a few weeks ago – students that were terrorized by online threats of harm to them. And so it's continuing all over the State of New York. We are investing in more resources, helping law enforcement – $50 million to secure locations that are vulnerable, making sure that we [are] investigating incidents of hate crime with our State Police all over New York and looking at our campuses, in particular.

So we're working hard to combat antisemitism, but what should be a joyful time, we're going to ensure that people are safe and that they can observe this beautiful holiday with their families knowing that the Governor of New York is looking out for them."
90,Governor Hochul Announces Year-End Results of Initiatives to Keep Highway Workers Safe,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-year-end-results-initiatives-keep-highway-workers-safe,"As construction throughout much of New York State begins to wind down with winter weather setting in, Governor Kathy Hochul today highlighted the year-end results of several initiatives designed to keep highway workers and motorists safe throughout New York State. These include a new work zone speed enforcement pilot program, a partnership between state transportation agencies in cooperation with state and local law enforcement entities, and a new law designed to better protect motorists in disabled vehicles. The legislature worked hard to introduce and pass these essential measures over the last several years, and the initiatives were then implemented with the support and assistance of the state’s partners in organized labor and the contracting industry, whose members also work in dangerous environments for the benefit of all New Yorkers.

“New York has zero tolerance for negligent or aggressive behavior that endangers our men and women in labor who work hard every day to keep us moving,” Governor Hochul said. “Work zone speed limits and other restrictions protect highway workers making our roads safer for everyone, and the actions we have taken this year are proving to be effective.”

Automated Work Zone Speed Monitoring Pilot Program

Speeding through highway work zones endangers workers and other motorists and is a common factor in dangerous work zone intrusions. In April 2023, as construction season was officially kicking off across the state, Governor Hochul announced the launch of an Automated Work Zone Speed Monitoring Pilot Program at 20 sites operated by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and 10 on the New York State Thruway. The Automated Work Zone Speed Monitoring pilot program was established by legislation signed into law by Governor Hochul and is intended to improve speed limit compliance and slow vehicles down in work zones. More information about the pilot program can be found here.

Through November 22, 133,640 notices of liability were issued to motorists across the state, including 95,861 from work zones controlled by the State Department of Transportation and 37,779 from work zones along the New York State Thruway. Both agencies encountered motorists driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through monitored work zones.

Notices of liability by region were distributed as follows:

Long Island – 41,709

Rochester/Finger Lakes – 32,578

New York City – 12,330

Albany/Capital Region – 4,616

Binghamton/Southern Tier – 1,200

Syracuse/Central New York – 1,140

Poughkeepsie/Hudson Valley – 1,016

Buffalo/Western New York - 849

Hornell/Western Southern Tier - 211

Watertown/North Country - 113

Utica/Mohawk Valley - 99

Thruway - 37,779

Fines through the pilot program are issued as follows:

$50 for first violation

$75 for second violation

$100 for third and subsequent violations within 18 months of the first violation

Unpaid fines may result in a vehicle registration hold and drivers will not be able to renew their registrations without first paying their fines. Owners may contest a violation within 30 days of when they received notice. As required by law, 60 percent of the funds collected by NYSDOT and the Thruway Authority through the program will supplement work zone safety projects.

Of the approximately 4.9 million vehicles that passed an automated work zone vehicle in a NYSDOT work zone during the first six months of the pilot program, less than two percent were issued violations. More than 7,500 or nine percent of all NYSDOT speed violations were repeat offenders.

Of the more than 2.3 million vehicles that passed an automated work zone vehicle in a Thruway work zone during the first six months of the pilot program, launched in May 2023, less than two percent were issued violations. During that period, the average speed in work zones with a posted 45 mph speed limit dropped from 47 mph in May to 43 mph in November. The average speed in work zones with a posted speed limit of 55 mph was approximately 50 mph. Despite the speed reductions, more than 1,500 or four percent of all Thruway speed violations were repeat offenders.

Operation Hardhat

Under “Operation Hardhat”, State Troopers or local police officers are dressed as highway maintenance workers in active NYSDOT or Thruway work zones across New York, identifying and citing motorists for a number of violations, including disobeying flagging personnel, speeding through work zones, cell phone and seatbelt use, and/or violations of the State’s Move Over law. In 2023, 2,919 tickets were issued by State Police and participating law enforcement agencies during 84 deployments across the state.

The 2,919 tickets issued during Operation Hardhat this year included the following violations:

Speeding - 1,048

Cell Phone Usage - 499

Seatbelt - 353

Failure to Move Over - 230

Failure to Obey Traffic Control Device - 18

Unsafe Lane Change - 3

Failure to Obey Flagger - 1

Other Violations - 767

Other violations may include but are not limited to tickets issued for cracked windshields, broken headlights, expired inspections, improper exhaust, and unlicensed operation.

Violations by region were distributed as follows:

Utica/Mohawk Valley - 504

Albany/Capital Region - 438

Long Island - 378

Syracuse/Central New York - 272

Binghamton/Southern Tier - 272

Thruway - 258

Rochester/Finger Lakes - 222

Hornell/Western Southern Tier - 198

Watertown/North Country - 174

Poughkeepsie/Hudson Valley - 105

Buffalo/Western New York - 98

New Move Over Law

In September 2023, Governor Hochul signed legislation enhancing the existing “Move Over Law” to require drivers to exercise due care to avoid all vehicles stopped on the roadway, including by changing lanes. The Move Over Law has been in place since 2010 and was originally designed to prevent collisions with emergency vehicles. In the years since, the law was expanded to cover hazard vehicles and other responder vehicles. Nearly 300 drivers are struck and killed roadside every year nationally, and 37 people were struck and killed outside of a disabled vehicle in New York from 2016-2020. The most recent amendment expanded the existing law to cover all vehicles stopped on the road.

The State’s Move Over Law is personal for Karen Torres, whose father was killed when he was struck by a cement truck while working as part of a NYSDOT road crew. Download her story.

State Department of Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said, “Our highway workers are absolutely critical to all we do here at the Department of Transportation, and I am calling on the very people they serve – the traveling public – to please respect our crew members and the important work that they do. All it takes is a moment’s glance off the road to turn a typical commute into a tragedy with lifelong consequences. I thank Governor Hochul for her unwavering support for the safety of our workers as well as our partners in government, the industry and labor, for their continued collaboration in preventing needless tragedies from occurring.”

Thruway Authority Acting Executive Director Frank Hoare said, “Over the first six months of the Automated Work Zone Speed Enforcement pilot program, drivers have noticeably decreased average speeds in our work zones and the Thruway Authority has seen a drop in average violations issued per month. This is tangible data that represents real change in drivers’ behavior leading to safer work zones for our employees and motorists. I want to thank Governor Hochul and her Administration for their steadfast dedication for protecting our workforce, and our state partners at NYSDOT, New York State Police, DMV and the Governors Traffic Safety Committee for working with us on initiatives like Operation Hard Hat and Move Over enforcement to make our state’s roadways safer for all.”

State Police Acting Superintendent Dominick L. Chiumento said, “The New York State Police is committed to keeping our roadways safe - for those who travel them, and for those who work on them, but this is a team effort. I thank Governor Hochul and our State Agency partners for their commitment to safety initiatives such as these, that have helped to make our roadways safer for all. We also urge drivers to continue to do their part by slowing down and moving over when they see an emergency vehicle or maintenance crew on the shoulder of a road, staying alert, and putting their electronic devices away. Taking these simple steps can and does save lives.”

Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles and Chair of the Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee Mark J.F. Schroeder said, “In this busy travel season and throughout the year, it is so important to drive safely and to protect our highway workers, whether it is crews working on the road, plow operators or people providing assistance to disabled vehicles. They are there to help, and their families want and need them to come home safely after a hard day of work.”

State Senator Timothy M. Kennedy said, “Highway workers dedicate their days to making our roads safer, and yet every day in doing so, they’re putting their own lives at risk. These initiatives are designed to strengthen safety standards, deter reckless driving, and above all, get these workers - and drivers across New York - home safe to their families at the end of the day.”

Assemblymember William B. Magnarelli, Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee said, “Safety for highway workers is of paramount importance, especially as winter weather creates dangerous environments on the roads and highways. I compliment the state and local law enforcement entities who are working together to ensure the safety of highway workers and disabled motorists. Laws like the pilot work zone camera law, which I initiated, along with law enforcement and union support will help keep our workers safe during the cold, wintery months ahead.”

Associated General Contractors of New York State (AGC NYS), President and CEO Mike Elmendorf said, “Safety is the top priority of the construction industry—and work zone safety is about keeping both workers and motorists safe. The construction industry and our public partners—NYSDOT, the Thruway Authority and State Police—along with organized labor, have had an unprecedented partnership in fighting for safer work zones across New York. We applaud Governor Hochul and her Administration for this great collaboration and for prioritizing work zone safety. We continue to appeal to drivers to slow down and pay extra attention in work zones so they and the men and women working out there all get home safely.”

CSEA President Mary E. Sullivan said, “We applaud Governor Hochul and the New York State Department of Transportation’s efforts to increase legislation and enact more meaningful workzone safety initiatives for those who work and travel on roadways across the state. This is one more step toward reassuring many of our union members who often risk their health and safety, work long hours, night and day and often in inclement weather conditions, that NYS government and law enforcement have their backs and care about their safety.”

Teamsters Joint Council 16 President Thomas Gesualdi said, ""New York's highway construction workers keep our state moving and their safety is paramount. Work zone speed enforcement and other safety measures make a real difference for the safety of our members and give them the peace of mind that they will make it home each day. We thank Governor Hochul for prioritizing the safety of construction workers with these initiatives.""

Recognizing and understanding signs leading up to and within a work zone is essential for the safety of all drivers and roadside workers. Motorists are reminded that fines are doubled for speeding in a work zone, and in accordance with the Work Zone Safety Act of 2005, convictions of two or more speeding violations in a work zone could result in the suspension of an individual's driver license. More work zone safety tips can be found at www.ny.gov/workzone .

Maintenance crews across the state work alongside fast-moving traffic each day, knowing their lives depend on drivers being alert, patient and cautious. It is critically important that motorists eliminate distractions, pay attention to driving and move over for workers. Throughout construction season, maintenance and work crews are out on the road performing repairs and improvements to ensure roads are safe for motorists. All travelers should be prepared to reduce speeds and to be alert when passing through work zones."

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Good morning, everyone. Please sit down. What a spectacular day. I have a couple of observations to make. In case you have not noticed, Central New York is literally reinventing itself, and business leaders across the globe are paying attention. And if you want to lead an industry into the 21st century, they're starting to wake up and say, “Yeah, Central New York is the place to be.”

This region is blessed with an abundance of people who have such ambition, who have such big dreams for this area. Just like the legacy they built for this great region, but there was a time when we sort of lost our mojo here, and people started feeling down and out. The better days were always going to be in the past. But this area never gave up and fought hard for recognition, fought hard for opportunities. And it is that a great ambition that brings us here today, as we break ground on a $74 million state-of-the-art, globally recognized STEAM school. Let's give that another round of applause.

And the announcement about how we're changing the curriculum to adapt to the needs, and it didn't happen by itself. I want to thank, first of all, Tony Davis, our Superintendent. It takes guts and vision to be a leader and to be first of one of a kind. So, thank you. Thank you. My partners in state government. We all knew what was happening in Washington. They're passing their own CHIPS Act. Well, that meant that companies would come to New York and come to the United States and develop in the United States. It didn't say New York would get an advantage, it just said the United States was now positioning itself to bring back, onshoring the jobs that we had lost for too long.

But I needed partners at the state level, and I want to thank our Senator John Mannion for his incredible leadership on this. John, thank you. Thank you. Senator Rachel May. Thank you, Senator May. And Assemblyman Al Stirpe, who was the sponsor of the Green Chips Bill in the Assembly, let's give him a huge round of applause. Assemblymember Pam Hunter as well.

The Mayor, I know this is a great day for you. We've walked past the empty steam building, and you always say, “We got to get this done. We got to get this done because it can come back and be such a magnificent credit to this community and give kids such an opportunity.” So, Mayor Walsh, your vision, the way I've seen it implemented, and I'm paying a close attention to this community. You know that. I commend you for your incredible leadership. Let's give another round of applause to Mayor Ben Walsh.

Our County Executive, Ryan McMahon, who knew he needed to find the place. If you get the land ready, they will come. And they certainly did. So, thank you for positioning ourselves to be so competitive in making sure Micron understood there's no place like Syracuse for building this magnificent place.

April Arnzen and Manish Bhatia, I want to thank both of you. We've become good friends with Micron. I'm reminded as I'm a little bit late today, flying planes in the snow is always a little longer than you think. I literally started this morning in New York City, in Manhattan. And I was with a crowd of business leaders, and when I mentioned I had to leave because I had to go to Syracuse because of another Micron announcement, they literally applauded in Manhattan. They know this is a big deal. I want you to know that. This is a big deal, and they're paying attention. So, to Manish and April, thank you.

And as I thought about flying in the snow, I thought about January 25, 2022. And I was supposed to come over from Albany, and the snow was coming down so hard, and my team says, “I'm not sure you should fly.” I said, “Micron's waiting for me in Syracuse. Sanjay's waiting for me to have a little conversation. We're going to take the plane; I'm going to get there.” And we ended up staying not for one drink and saying hello. We stayed three hours for the most incredible dinner. And I want to thank you. I will always get on that plane and go where I can help make a deal.

But I also knew walking out of that room, and we talked about the opportunity. And they said numbers I just never heard of in my lifetime – $100 billion investment, 50,000 jobs. They would need 50,000 well-trained workers. And I said, “Okay, I can do that, no problem. Okay, Mike, Randi, Andy, we have to get some people trained here, right?” We knew immediately, in order to make this happen, that we'd have to train the next generation of workers because when this is completed in 20 years, children born today are going to be walking in the doors and getting those great paying jobs and starting their own families. But educators were at the forefront. And I needed them. I needed Melinda Person, I needed Mike Mulgrew, I needed Randi Weingarten. I needed them to also share in this vision. And as Randi said, as a national leader, sitting here today. When she says this will be a national model, she means it because she can make that happen.

So, we're going to get it right here. We're going to make you proud. And show what we can do when people come together. The business community, government, labor, and all the teachers here today. I commend every single one of you. Let's give yourselves a round of applause as well. Thank you, thank you. And Amazon, thank you for stepping up.

Brad Griggs, also the Senior Manager of Economic Development at Amazon. Thank you for believing in us. For 70 years, Central Tech High School prepared kids for the future. That's what they did. People graduated there, started their families, were part of the local economy, part of the fabric of Central New York. But in 1975, it shuttered its doors. No more. Now, Fowler High School was great, a great replacement. But it has been 50 years, people have gone by this building, almost in a mocking way, a reminder, just saying, “Nothing here, nothing to see here, nothing going on here, nobody being educated here,” it was abandoned, hopeless.

And people said, “No, that can't be. This area is too important. It has too much value. It has too much character and charm. We can bring it back.” It just needed people to believe in its possibilities. Just like what else is going around here. Last time I was here was a major announcement on the progress we're making on I-81. That is one of the largest infrastructure projects in our state going on right now. And we're going to get it done. Dividing a community that was divided by racial injustice. And I called it out for what it was. No one cared back then when they built these highways. Whether it's the one in Buffalo, the 33 or 81 here.

No one cared that you're dividing through the heart of the Black and Brown communities because they didn't have political clout to stop it. And we said we're going to start healing our communities, bringing them back together, reuniting them. And that's why I brag about that project as well, going on simultaneously with this.

What I see with the Center City Innovation Hub, we've talked about this, it's becoming a reality. It's so exciting. The Tech Guard, I've walked through the halls there are so many times and I see the smartest people, so energetic, so excited about the future. And you want a great meal, just go over to Salt City Market, right? That is ingenious. And I encourage our out-of-town guests, like Randi and Mike Mulgrew, I know Melinda's been here, stop by there. It's like the United Nations. It's people from all around the world, and it's their first chance to really start a business.

When I go through that, I'm just so proud of this area. Because I know what it looked like. I went to school here. I came in on a bus from a gritty Greyhound station in Buffalo that I'm not sure my parents should have dropped me off at by myself. And I landed at one that was just as scary here in Syracuse, remember that one? But I came here, taking that bus across the State because I believed in it, that I could have a future with an education in this area.

But I saw the polluted lake I drove by, I'd say, “Why aren't people swimming in that lake?” “Oh, you don't want to swim in that lake.” We're cleaning up the lake, the lake is coming back, the downtown is coming back, the development. I never thought I'd live long enough to see the rebirth of this city and this region. And the icing on all of it is Micron. Micron, giving that sense of pride.

So, this building next door here, this is going to be a symbol. It's not just a place, it's a symbol. A symbol of rebirth, reimagining, and again, a faith that was not there before. When they open the doors in 2025, and the first students walk through into this beautiful place, it's going to have the state-of-the-art technology, it's going to say, the future is right here, just grab it, young people, grab it, it's waiting for you.

And their lives will be forever transformed, when they get the skills that are required to go work at Micron and all the other businesses that are finding their way here. They'll never have to – especially the kids coming out of poverty today, and we've got one of the highest childhood poverty rates in America. How do you solve for that? This is what keeps me up at night. How do we help those little kids? And we're doing so much: tax credit for families where there never was, helping with childcare costs, helping to increase the minimum wage, adjusting to inflation – we did all that. But I know if those children can find their ways to this STEAM school, they'll never, ever have to talk about how we can afford food for their families or be able to pay the rent for their families.

This will transform a generation of young people because the education's there, the skills are being taught, and the jobs are waiting for them. This is what the future looks like, my friends. This is the future. So, the State's investment of $71 million of a $74 million project, that's a lot. But I know that we'll get every dime out of this back when we change futures for young people. But I also want to make sure that they're being educated in a smart, smart way. And while we've made innovations in tech – and spoiler alert – we're talking about embracing AI in New York State here because there's jobs that are going to go somewhere, and I say they come to New York. We're going to be talking about that in my State of the State address. And why not have the epicenter be here in Upstate New York? This is what I believe can happen.

So, we're going to keep partnering with companies and partnering with labor and making sure this all happens. But as we continue to think about this, this announcement here today, that you heard about, what our unions have worked on, changing the curriculum, you know my friends, when you talk about changing curriculum, you're usually looking at a decade of work. I mean, this bureaucracy does not happen. Am I right about this? “Okay, let's change A to B here, okay, we'll get back to you in about ten years,” it doesn't happen, right? It doesn't happen. But we are going at rapid speed because the future is right there, and we have no time to wait. That's the urgency we bring to this. That's why having Randi Weingarten and Melinda and Mike on board. and all the people they represent. This is how you seize the future.

So, this commitment and $10 million from Micron to help us go toward educating – $10 million. That's a lot of money. Let's give them another round of applause. $10 million for educating generations of New Yorkers. Amazon stepping up, $1.75 million. Let's give a round of applause to Amazon. Thank you, Amazon. Thank you. This is what it's all about. And when we get, as I said, government and labor and business in a community. Elected officials working together. This new commitment of $2 million from the state matched by Micron.

I feel like I'm really almost have chills and I don't say this often. Things are finally happening. Happening to an area that just never had much going for it for a long time. And we're going to look back on this day and this time and this year and a half of the Micron announcements that keep rolling out and rolling out. And the community commitments and the partnerships you've built and say this is what every business should be doing. You have set the model. You've set the bar high. I talk about you all the time.

In fact, I have another call with Washington, too, and I say, as we talk about companies getting these government benefits, whether it's from the Federal CHIPS Act, the State CHIPS Act, you have a responsibility to the communities where you're investing in. Now, this was not a lesson that had to be taught to Micron. This was their culture, this was their identity, this is who they are. Every company that wants help from us; we need to ask them to do the same.

What are you doing about child care? Tell us what you're doing about childcare. I know we're already starting to build a childcare center on site. So, no parent has to say, I can't take that job because the cost of child care is too high. This is what the future of business should be here in the State of New York. Embracing the local community like it's your family. That's what I feel Micron has done. That's powerful. And it'll happen in a place called Clay. I think about the word, “clay,” back when people were, long time ago, and fire was still a mystery. Clay was a foundational material. They used to build things. You see the pots that are built today. Communities were built. It's something you built things out of. And from this little community of clay, here in Central New York, we're building the foundation of a brand-new economy.

A new life for people, new opportunities – and making New York embrace it, Central New York being at the forefront of this and building prosperity for generations to come. That's why this is such a big deal. Thank you, my friends, and let's go cut some ribbons."
92,Governor Hochul Announces $164 Million for Local Water Infrastructure Projects,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-164-million-local-water-infrastructure-projects,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the Environmental Facilities Corporation Board of Directors approved $164 million in financial assistance for water infrastructure improvement projects across New York State. The Board's approval authorizes municipal access to over $156 million in low-cost short-term financing and previously announced grants to get shovels in the ground for critical water and sewer infrastructure projects in New York City, the City of Utica in Oneida County and the Town of Minerva in Essex County.

The Board also took action to help ensure continued, long-term affordability of two existing projects, approving interest-free financing totaling over $8 million to the Village of Akron in Erie County and the Village of Warsaw in Wyoming County to provide savings on debt service for these projects.

“My administration continues to tackle water quality issues head-on with strategic investments that will benefit New Yorkers for generations to come,” Governor Hochul said. “These funds are crucial to help communities modernize and protect critical infrastructure so that all New Yorkers have access to clean water.”

Environmental Facilities Corporation President & CEO Maureen A. Coleman said, “This $164 million infrastructure investment will deliver clean, safe water, while saving ratepayers money and creating good paying jobs. Investing in water infrastructure is critical to protecting communities from water pollution that threatens public health and the environment.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner and EFC Board Chair Basil Seggos said, “I applaud Governor Hochul’s sustained commitment to invest in affordable and transformational infrastructure projects that improve water quality and help municipalities upgrade critical infrastructure. With $164 million in grants and financing, these resources will continue to protect water quality and maintain New Yorkers’ health and safety.”

New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James V. McDonald said, “I thank Governor Hochul and the Environmental Facilities Corporation for their leadership and partnership in making safe drinking water a public health priority. The financial assistance provided though the Environmental Facilities Corporation will help municipalities ensure their drinking water is safe and reliable.”

Secretary of State Robert J. Rodriguez said, “Once again New York is making nation-leading investments in clean water infrastructure together with the historic funding geared to help communities large and small to undertake projects that are vital to public health, quality of life, economic development and environmental protection. The Environmental Facilities Corporation’s approval of $156 million for New York City, the City of Utica in Oneida County, and the Town of Minerva in Essex County is key to providing the much-needed resources to build critical infrastructure projects to modernize aging systems.”

Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said, “Utica get out your shovels because the historic investments I secured in the Bipartisan Infrastructure & Jobs Law are flowing to critical water and sewer infrastructure improvements for the City of Utica and Oneida County. This $4.6 million federal investment will help keep our environments and the Mohawk River free of sewage overflow and bolster our communities water infrastructures resiliency. These federal dollars will add capacity to the city’s combined sewer system to support projects like the Wynn Hospital, that are transforming Utica’s downtown. I am proud to deliver this critical federal funding, and I applaud Governor Hochul for her leadership in turning the tide on Utica’s aging water infrastructure.”

The Board's approvals include financings through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, and grants already announced pursuant to the Water Infrastructure Improvement and Intermunicipal Grant programs.

Project funding approved:

City of Utica, Oneida County - $4.6 million grant and financing package for a sewer project that will make the city’s wastewater system more resilient during wet weather events and reduce risk of sewer overflows to the Mohawk River. Funding includes $3.4 million in interest-free financing and grant from federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds. BIL funding for water and sewer infrastructure is administered by EFC through the State Revolving Funds.

New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority - $150 million in short-term, market rate financing for the excavation and construction of Shafts 17B-1 and 18B-1 in City Tunnel No. 3, Stage 2 in Queens. This drinking water project will provide redundancy for the city’s water system and allow for better flow control and system management.

Town of Minerva, Essex County - $1.5 million in short-term, market rate financing for the replacement of nearly 6,000 linear feet of water main across two drinking water project areas.

Refinancing Projects Will Achieve Long-Term Debt Service Savings

The Board approved long-term interest free financing totaling $8.2 million for wastewater treatment plant improvement projects in the Village of Akron in Erie County and the Village of Warsaw in Wyoming County. Short-term financing provides capital for design and construction of projects. Once project construction is completed, the short-term financing is typically refinanced to long-term financing for up to 30 years, saving municipalities significant interest expenses versus financing on their own.

Based on current market conditions, these long-term interest-free financings are projected to save local ratepayers an estimated $10.6 million in interest payments over the life of the financings.

New York's Commitment to Water Quality

New York State's nation-leading investment in clean water infrastructure totals $5 billion since 2017. Under the leadership of Governor Hochul, the 2023-24 Enacted Budget includes $500 million in clean water funding. The Governor launched Community Assistance Teams this year to expand EFC's technical assistance program and help small, rural, and disadvantaged communities leverage this funding to address their clean water infrastructure needs. Any community that needs help with their water infrastructure needs is encouraged to contact EFC at efc.ny.gov/CAT.

The voter-approved $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act is advancing historic levels of funding to update aging water infrastructure and protect water quality, strengthen communities' ability to withstand severe storms and flooding, reduce air pollution and lower climate-altering emissions, restore habitats, and preserve outdoor spaces and local farms. Disadvantaged Communities will receive at least 35 percent of the benefits of Bond Act funding, with a goal of 40 percent."

94,Governor Hochul Announces Launch of State-of-the-Art Weather Risk Communication Center,https://www.governor.ny.gov//news/governor-hochul-announces-launch-state-art-weather-risk-communication-center,"Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the creation of New York’s State Weather Risk Communication Center at the University at Albany, a first-of-its kind operational collaboration between university researchers and state emergency managers. Through an annual $1.5 million investment, the Center will serve as a clearinghouse for critical weather information and develop new tools to help emergency managers make more informed, time-critical decisions to protect communities. The Center will also examine how the state and its partners communicate the risks associated with extreme weather to the public and how to improve those messages.

“New Yorkers know all too well that climate change has caused more frequent, intense, and unpredictable storms across our state, and we need innovative ideas to help us respond,” Governor Hochul said. “As we face the rising risk of extreme weather events, I’m proud to establish New York’s Weather Risk Communication Center to strengthen our preparedness and keep New Yorkers informed and safe before, during, and after emergencies.”

Specifically, the Center’s work will combine the high-quality forecasts provided by the National Weather Service (NWS) and supplemental data from the New York State Mesonet with on-the-ground information about critical infrastructure to create new decision-support products tailored to the specific needs of emergency managers. For example, during the massive September storm that dumped more than seven inches of rain in New York City in just 24 hours, the Center would have been able to create real-time maps informed by advanced weather observations with data about the city’s sewer infrastructure and capacity to help pinpoint where and how flooding was likely to occur and when evacuations might be necessary. Additionally, before or during a snowstorm, the Center will monitor forecasts and Mesonet data to map road surface temperatures and inform roadway pre-treatment planning.

The Center’s assistance will not be reserved just for state-level emergency managers. Its resources and expertise will be available to other public entities in New York that need support in making weather-related decisions, including, for example, school superintendents who need support to inform school closures.

When extreme weather is not in the forecast, the SWRCC will work closely with the state to offer emergency weather training and workshops, as well as prepare after-action analysis of weather emergencies and examine how the state and its partners communicate the risks associated with extreme weather.

University at Albany President Havidán Rodríguez said, “As New Yorkers confront more frequent episodes of extreme weather due to a changing climate, the University at Albany is honored to partner with New York State to ensure the expertise of our weather and climate researchers is fully available to the emergency managers and first responders charged with protecting lives and property. The launch of the State Weather Risk Communication Center is a credit to Gov. Hochul’s forward-thinking approach to the risks posed by climate change, a model for how universities can translate research to the real world and a vital step toward building a safer, more informed and more resilient New York.”

State Weather Risk Communication Center Director Nick Bassill said, ""New York already possesses the ingredients necessary to make us a nationwide leader at integrating weather information into our everyday decision-making, and I'm beyond thrilled to help make this possible through our State Weather Risk Communication Center. We'll build upon the excellent service from the National Weather Service and work hand-in-hand with our state partners in emergency management, transportation, and energy to provide them with the information they need before, during, and after a storm. Simultaneously, social scientists and software developers will build better tools and communication strategies. Being located at UAlbany also lets us train the next generation of experts by incorporating a robust student internship program.""

New York State Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said, “As climate change continues to make extreme weather more frequent and intense, in New York State we are strengthening our preparedness, response capabilities and resilience to meet the moment. Thanks to Governor Hochul’s leadership on preparedness and emergency response, the expertise of our partners at UAlbany, and our ongoing critical partnership with the National Weather Service, this new Center will not only help us make the best decisions during extreme weather events but most critically will help us find ways to better communicate the risks of that weather with the public.”

The Center will be based inside UAlbany’s ETEC building, which is home to one of the nation’s largest clusters atmospheric and climate researchers, including the NWS and UAlbany’s Atmospheric Sciences Research Center. In addition to being strategically located next to the NWS’ Albany Office, the Center will also leverage key existing resources within ETEC including:"
95,Governor Hochul Announces Year-End Results of Initiatives to Keep Highway Workers Safe,https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-year-end-results-initiatives-keep-highway-workers-safe,"As construction throughout much of New York State begins to wind down with winter weather setting in, Governor Kathy Hochul today highlighted the year-end results of several initiatives designed to keep highway workers and motorists safe throughout New York State. These include a new work zone speed enforcement pilot program, a partnership between state transportation agencies in cooperation with state and local law enforcement entities, and a new law designed to better protect motorists in disabled vehicles. The legislature worked hard to introduce and pass these essential measures over the last several years, and the initiatives were then implemented with the support and assistance of the state’s partners in organized labor and the contracting industry, whose members also work in dangerous environments for the benefit of all New Yorkers.

“New York has zero tolerance for negligent or aggressive behavior that endangers our men and women in labor who work hard every day to keep us moving,” Governor Hochul said. “Work zone speed limits and other restrictions protect highway workers making our roads safer for everyone, and the actions we have taken this year are proving to be effective.”

Automated Work Zone Speed Monitoring Pilot Program

Speeding through highway work zones endangers workers and other motorists and is a common factor in dangerous work zone intrusions. In April 2023, as construction season was officially kicking off across the state, Governor Hochul announced the launch of an Automated Work Zone Speed Monitoring Pilot Program at 20 sites operated by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and 10 on the New York State Thruway. The Automated Work Zone Speed Monitoring pilot program was established by legislation signed into law by Governor Hochul and is intended to improve speed limit compliance and slow vehicles down in work zones. More information about the pilot program can be found here.

Through November 22, 133,640 notices of liability were issued to motorists across the state, including 95,861 from work zones controlled by the State Department of Transportation and 37,779 from work zones along the New York State Thruway. Both agencies encountered motorists driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through monitored work zones.

Notices of liability by region were distributed as follows:

Long Island – 41,709

Rochester/Finger Lakes – 32,578

New York City – 12,330

Albany/Capital Region – 4,616

Binghamton/Southern Tier – 1,200

Syracuse/Central New York – 1,140

Poughkeepsie/Hudson Valley – 1,016

Buffalo/Western New York - 849

Hornell/Western Southern Tier - 211

Watertown/North Country - 113

Utica/Mohawk Valley - 99

Thruway - 37,779

Fines through the pilot program are issued as follows:

$50 for first violation

$75 for second violation

$100 for third and subsequent violations within 18 months of the first violation

Unpaid fines may result in a vehicle registration hold and drivers will not be able to renew their registrations without first paying their fines. Owners may contest a violation within 30 days of when they received notice. As required by law, 60 percent of the funds collected by NYSDOT and the Thruway Authority through the program will supplement work zone safety projects.

Of the approximately 4.9 million vehicles that passed an automated work zone vehicle in a NYSDOT work zone during the first six months of the pilot program, less than two percent were issued violations. More than 7,500 or nine percent of all NYSDOT speed violations were repeat offenders.

Of the more than 2.3 million vehicles that passed an automated work zone vehicle in a Thruway work zone during the first six months of the pilot program, launched in May 2023, less than two percent were issued violations. During that period, the average speed in work zones with a posted 45 mph speed limit dropped from 47 mph in May to 43 mph in November. The average speed in work zones with a posted speed limit of 55 mph was approximately 50 mph. Despite the speed reductions, more than 1,500 or four percent of all Thruway speed violations were repeat offenders.

Operation Hardhat

Under “Operation Hardhat”, State Troopers or local police officers are dressed as highway maintenance workers in active NYSDOT or Thruway work zones across New York, identifying and citing motorists for a number of violations, including disobeying flagging personnel, speeding through work zones, cell phone and seatbelt use, and/or violations of the State’s Move Over law. In 2023, 2,919 tickets were issued by State Police and participating law enforcement agencies during 84 deployments across the state.

The 2,919 tickets issued during Operation Hardhat this year included the following violations:

Speeding - 1,048

Cell Phone Usage - 499

Seatbelt - 353

Failure to Move Over - 230

Failure to Obey Traffic Control Device - 18

Unsafe Lane Change - 3

Failure to Obey Flagger - 1

Other Violations - 767

Other violations may include but are not limited to tickets issued for cracked windshields, broken headlights, expired inspections, improper exhaust, and unlicensed operation.

Violations by region were distributed as follows:

Utica/Mohawk Valley - 504

Albany/Capital Region - 438

Long Island - 378

Syracuse/Central New York - 272

Binghamton/Southern Tier - 272

Thruway - 258

Rochester/Finger Lakes - 222

Hornell/Western Southern Tier - 198

Watertown/North Country - 174

Poughkeepsie/Hudson Valley - 105

Buffalo/Western New York - 98

New Move Over Law

In September 2023, Governor Hochul signed legislation enhancing the existing “Move Over Law” to require drivers to exercise due care to avoid all vehicles stopped on the roadway, including by changing lanes. The Move Over Law has been in place since 2010 and was originally designed to prevent collisions with emergency vehicles. In the years since, the law was expanded to cover hazard vehicles and other responder vehicles. Nearly 300 drivers are struck and killed roadside every year nationally, and 37 people were struck and killed outside of a disabled vehicle in New York from 2016-2020. The most recent amendment expanded the existing law to cover all vehicles stopped on the road.

The State’s Move Over Law is personal for Karen Torres, whose father was killed when he was struck by a cement truck while working as part of a NYSDOT road crew. Download her story.

State Department of Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said, “Our highway workers are absolutely critical to all we do here at the Department of Transportation, and I am calling on the very people they serve – the traveling public – to please respect our crew members and the important work that they do. All it takes is a moment’s glance off the road to turn a typical commute into a tragedy with lifelong consequences. I thank Governor Hochul for her unwavering support for the safety of our workers as well as our partners in government, the industry and labor, for their continued collaboration in preventing needless tragedies from occurring.”

Thruway Authority Acting Executive Director Frank Hoare said, “Over the first six months of the Automated Work Zone Speed Enforcement pilot program, drivers have noticeably decreased average speeds in our work zones and the Thruway Authority has seen a drop in average violations issued per month. This is tangible data that represents real change in drivers’ behavior leading to safer work zones for our employees and motorists. I want to thank Governor Hochul and her Administration for their steadfast dedication for protecting our workforce, and our state partners at NYSDOT, New York State Police, DMV and the Governors Traffic Safety Committee for working with us on initiatives like Operation Hard Hat and Move Over enforcement to make our state’s roadways safer for all.”

State Police Acting Superintendent Dominick L. Chiumento said, “The New York State Police is committed to keeping our roadways safe - for those who travel them, and for those who work on them, but this is a team effort. I thank Governor Hochul and our State Agency partners for their commitment to safety initiatives such as these, that have helped to make our roadways safer for all. We also urge drivers to continue to do their part by slowing down and moving over when they see an emergency vehicle or maintenance crew on the shoulder of a road, staying alert, and putting their electronic devices away. Taking these simple steps can and does save lives.”

Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles and Chair of the Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee Mark J.F. Schroeder said, “In this busy travel season and throughout the year, it is so important to drive safely and to protect our highway workers, whether it is crews working on the road, plow operators or people providing assistance to disabled vehicles. They are there to help, and their families want and need them to come home safely after a hard day of work.”

State Senator Timothy M. Kennedy said, “Highway workers dedicate their days to making our roads safer, and yet every day in doing so, they’re putting their own lives at risk. These initiatives are designed to strengthen safety standards, deter reckless driving, and above all, get these workers - and drivers across New York - home safe to their families at the end of the day.”

Assemblymember William B. Magnarelli, Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee said, “Safety for highway workers is of paramount importance, especially as winter weather creates dangerous environments on the roads and highways. I compliment the state and local law enforcement entities who are working together to ensure the safety of highway workers and disabled motorists. Laws like the pilot work zone camera law, which I initiated, along with law enforcement and union support will help keep our workers safe during the cold, wintery months ahead.”

Associated General Contractors of New York State (AGC NYS), President and CEO Mike Elmendorf said, “Safety is the top priority of the construction industry—and work zone safety is about keeping both workers and motorists safe. The construction industry and our public partners—NYSDOT, the Thruway Authority and State Police—along with organized labor, have had an unprecedented partnership in fighting for safer work zones across New York. We applaud Governor Hochul and her Administration for this great collaboration and for prioritizing work zone safety. We continue to appeal to drivers to slow down and pay extra attention in work zones so they and the men and women working out there all get home safely.”

CSEA President Mary E. Sullivan said, “We applaud Governor Hochul and the New York State Department of Transportation’s efforts to increase legislation and enact more meaningful workzone safety initiatives for those who work and travel on roadways across the state. This is one more step toward reassuring many of our union members who often risk their health and safety, work long hours, night and day and often in inclement weather conditions, that NYS government and law enforcement have their backs and care about their safety.”

Teamsters Joint Council 16 President Thomas Gesualdi said, ""New York's highway construction workers keep our state moving and their safety is paramount. Work zone speed enforcement and other safety measures make a real difference for the safety of our members and give them the peace of mind that they will make it home each day. We thank Governor Hochul for prioritizing the safety of construction workers with these initiatives.""

Recognizing and understanding signs leading up to and within a work zone is essential for the safety of all drivers and roadside workers. Motorists are reminded that fines are doubled for speeding in a work zone, and in accordance with the Work Zone Safety Act of 2005, convictions of two or more speeding violations in a work zone could result in the suspension of an individual's driver license. More work zone safety tips can be found at www.ny.gov/workzone .

Maintenance crews across the state work alongside fast-moving traffic each day, knowing their lives depend on drivers being alert, patient and cautious. It is critically important that motorists eliminate distractions, pay attention to driving and move over for workers. Throughout construction season, maintenance and work crews are out on the road performing repairs and improvements to ensure roads are safe for motorists. All travelers should be prepared to reduce speeds and to be alert when passing through work zones."
96,Attorney General James Stands Up For College Athletes Against Anticompetitive NCAA Rule,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-stands-college-athletes-against-anticompetitive-ncaa-rule,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging the NCAA’s transfer eligibility rule as part of a bipartisan coalition of seven attorneys general. The lawsuit alleges that the NCAA rule is an illegal restraint on college athletes’ ability to market their labor and control their education. The rule requires college athletes who transfer among Division I schools to wait one year before competing in games. While the NCAA began automatically exempting first-time transfers from the regulation in 2021, it has continued to enforce the rule for subsequent transfers with limited exceptions.

“Forcing college athletes to wait a year after transferring schools before they participate in their sport means missed opportunities, lost memories, and diminished chances to further their career and personal growth,” said Attorney General James. “This NCAA policy forces college athletes to remain at institutions they want to leave, or risk being benched for the sake of a better educational opportunity. My office has made it clear that we aren’t afraid to tackle hard cases, and that we will stand up for the rights of college athletes and everyone to pursue their passions.”

As part of the multistate lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, the attorneys general are seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to keep the NCAA from enforcing the rule. In justifying the one-year waiting period for second-time transfers, the NCAA cites the promotion of academic well-being and the preservation of athletic amateurism. But the lawsuit from Attorney General James and the bipartisan coalition of attorneys general argues that these justifications are pretextual. Furthermore, the harm the rule does to athletes, universities, and fans far exceeds any supposed benefits.

The NCAA itself describes the college athlete experience as transformative, with athletic competition playing a key role. By preventing college athletes from competing, however, their experience is severely damaged. College athletes deprived of the opportunity to compete in their chosen sports are denied the opportunity to showcase their elite skills, and suffer losses to their current and future earning potential both for athletic competition and for name, image, and likeness compensation. The one-year waiting period constitutes 20 percent of the total time allotted by the NCAA for a college student’s athletic eligibility, meaning such a suspension is devastating for students who transfer to schools that better suit their unique needs.

Joining Attorney General James in filing this lawsuit are the attorneys general of Colorado, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia.



Today’s lawsuit continues Attorney General James’ efforts to protect the rights of student and professional athletes and ensure sports regulation authorities are held accountable for illegal policies. In May, Attorney General James and California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a joint investigation into the organization’s New York and California offices for violations of anti-discrimination and pay equity laws. Also in May, Attorney General James led a coalition of attorneys general in advocating for stronger anti-discrimination protections for transgender student athletes. In April 2022, Attorney General James led a coalition of six attorneys general to send a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to express concerns regarding allegations of gender-based discrimination within the organization.

For New York, this matter is being handled by Senior Enforcement Counsel Bryan Bloom, Deputy Bureau Chief Amy McFarlane, and Bureau Chief Elinor Hoffmann all of the Antitrust Bureau. The Antitrust Bureau is a part of the Division for Economic Justice, which is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D’Angelo and overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy."
97,Attorney General James Takes Action to Stop Illegal Gun Trafficking,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-takes-action-stop-illegal-gun-trafficking,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell led a multistate coalition of 21 attorneys general today in support of a proposed Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) rule that would ensure more gun sales are subject to background checks and reduce illegal gun trafficking. Following the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the ATF proposed a new regulation to clarify what it means for a person to be “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms, and therefore required to obtain a license and run background checks when selling guns. The proposed rule would close loopholes that allowed the unlicensed sale of firearms, including online and at gun shows. The coalition of attorneys general submitted a letter of support for the proposed rule and recommended areas of enforcement to limit gun trafficking.

“Gun traffickers and criminals have exploited loopholes in our laws to illegally obtain firearms and flood communities in states like New York with deadly weapons,” said Attorney General James. “The ATF’s rule is a commonsense way to address this problem, and will help ensure more firearm sales are subject to background checks, thereby cutting off sources of weapons for gun traffickers. I’m proud to lead my fellow attorneys general in support of this new effort to fight gun violence and keep our communities safe.”

Unlicensed gun sales make it easier for people who cannot legally purchase firearms to obtain them, endangering communities and fueling gun violence. Gun shows in states without universal background checks are a significant venue for unlicensed gun vendors and are a major source for guns trafficked into states like New York. A recent ATF report revealed that the number of guns later used in crimes that originated from gun shows increased by 19 percent from 2017 to 2021. Roughly 75 percent of the guns trafficked across state lines that were used in crimes originated from states without background check laws. In New York City alone, over 90 percent of the guns recovered from crimes originated from out of state.

The ATF’s proposed rule will crack down on unlicensed gun sellers and reduce the number of guns sold without a background check by ensuring more individuals who sell guns are subject to federal licensing and background check requirements. Vendors operating at gun shows and online would be subject to the regulation in more instances, reducing opportunities for gun sales without background checks. The new regulations will also help local and state law enforcement officials track gun sales and provide them with more tools to effectively inspect gun dealers, trace guns used in crimes, prosecute gun charges, and help keep the communities they serve safe.

Attorney General James and the coalition also recommend specific areas for ATF to focus enforcement on. Noting that online gun sellers and those liquidating the inventories of licensed gun sellers are common sources of guns used in crimes, the coalition urges ATF to hold those illegally selling firearms accountable instead of encouraging them to become licensed gun dealers.

Joining Attorney General James in support of the ATF’s proposed rule are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.

This multistate letter is the latest action Attorney General James has taken to fight gun trafficking and keep New Yorkers safe from gun violence. In November, Attorney General James and a coalition of 19 attorneys general filed an amicus brief in support of a California law restricting high-capacity gun magazines. Also in November, Attorney General James successfully argued against Second Amendment challenges in six cases in the New York State Court of Appeals involving gun possession charges. In August, Attorney General James joined a multistate coalition of attorneys general urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to uphold a Delaware ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines. Also in August, Attorney General James urged the Supreme Court to uphold the federal law barring domestic abusers from obtaining guns.

In May, Attorney General James sued a gun accessory manufacturer that aided the Buffalo mass shooter. In April, Attorney General James took action to remove more than 3,000 guns off New York’s streets in a single day through the first-ever statewide gun buyback program. In March, Attorney General James and the New York Drug Enforcement Task Force took down a firearm and drug trafficking operation that illegally sold guns, including ghost guns and assault weapons, in New York City. The takedown recovered 19 firearms, including 12 ghost guns. Also in March, Attorney General James secured a court order banning 10 gun distributors from selling and shipping ghost gun parts into New York. In December 2022, Attorney General James joined a coalition of 23 attorneys general in filing an amicus brief supporting federal efforts to ban the possession of firearms whose serial numbers have been removed. In June 2022, Attorney General James sued 10 national gun distributors for bringing ghost gun parts into New York."
98,Attorney General James Works to Hold Big Banks Accountable for Violating State Laws,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-works-hold-big-banks-accountable-violating-state-laws,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today led a coalition of 20 attorneys general in submitting letters to the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) urging both agencies to ensure that national banks cooperate with investigations being conducted by state attorneys general into violations of state laws. Though national banks are subject to state laws, as the Supreme Court recognized and as Congress codified in Dodd-Frank, they frequently decline to cooperate with investigations conducted by state attorneys general. This unacceptable behavior by the major banks can lead to companies and senior officials evading accountability for illegal conduct, which is why Attorney General James and the coalition are calling on federal banking regulators to correct the situation.

“No one is above the law, no matter how rich or powerful they are, and that includes major banks,” said Attorney General James. “Big banks should not be able to simply ignore investigations by state officials or think they can violate state laws with impunity. I thank my fellow attorneys general for joining with me to call on the OCC and CFPB to address this problem and ensure banks know they are answerable to state officials and laws.”

The federal OCC adopted regulations in 2004 exempting national banks from state laws and actions brought by state attorneys general. This action enabled national banks to claim immunity from state law enforcement, and preceded the explosion in subprime and predatory lending that resulted in the most destructive financial crisis in the United States since the Great Depression. Both the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the OCC’s view of national bank immunity from state laws, while Congress also created the CFPB as a consumer-protection-focused supervisor of big banks.

Big banks refusing to submit to state-level authorities, and being sheltered by the federal OCC in doing so, puts consumers, the economy, and national banks themselves at risk. State attorneys general are the primary source of consumer protections on issues including lending, debt collection, and prohibitions against unfair or deceptive business practices. When big banks refuse to cooperate with attorney general investigations, consumers suffer and problems can fester into major crises. Big banks, meanwhile, put themselves at risk when a culture of unaccountability tolerates improper business practices. Attorneys general should not have to resort to filing lawsuits against national banks to stop deceptive and illegal banking practices, and big banks should be equally accountable under state law as any other business operating within their jurisdictions.

Attorney General James and the coalition call on the OCC to issue supervisory guidance to national banks, instructing them that failures to cooperate with legitimate state law enforcement investigations pose safety and soundness risks to banking institutions. The attorneys general also urge the CFPB to take appropriate actions to ensure that big banks are accountable for violations of state consumer protection laws.

Joining Attorney General James in signing on to the letters are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands, as well as the Executive Director of the Hawaii Office of Consumer Protection."
99,Attorney General James Uncovers Major Problems Accessing Mental Health Care through Insurance Companies,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-uncovers-major-problems-accessing-mental-health-care,"NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today released a comprehensive report clearly demonstrating that health insurance companies are failing to offer adequate access to mental health care, exacerbating the mental health crisis in New York. The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) surveyed nearly 400 mental health providers listed on health plans’ networks and found that the overwhelming majority, 86 percent, were “ghosts,” meaning they were unreachable, not-in-network, or not accepting new patients. Inaccurate network directories are worsening the statewide mental health crisis and disproportionately impact marginalized communities, leading to adverse health outcomes, and increasing costs for patients. Today’s report follows Attorney General James’ mental health hearings across the state and offers recommendations to increase access to mental health care.

“No one who reaches out to mental health professionals listed by their insurance company should be told that the providers are unreachable, not accepting their insurance, or not accepting new patients,” said Attorney General James. “Our state is facing a mental health crisis, and this report clearly shows that insurance companies are failing to help New Yorkers in need. By not maintaining accurate directories as required by law, health plans are making it harder for New Yorkers, especially the most vulnerable among us, to get mental health care and forcing them to delay or forego the care they need. I am calling on health plans to rapidly address this problem and help us tackle the mental health care crisis.”

Attorney General James held mental health hearings in New York City and Buffalo in June 2022 and January 2023 to help highlight the crisis impacting residents throughout the state. In both hearings, more than 100 patients and providers described a broken system. Parents told OAG they spent months trying to find a provider through their insurance plan but could not find one, which led to their children experiencing worsened conditions.

Following the hearings, OAG staff conducted a statewide review of 13 health plans: Aetna, CDPHP, Cigna, Emblem, Empire BlueCross BlueShield, Excellus, Fidelis, Healthfirst, Independent Health, MetroPlus, Molina, MVP, and UnitedHealthcare. Callers attempted to schedule an appointment for an adult or child with a mental health provider who was listed as accepting new patients. Of the 396 providers called across all plans, only 56 providers, or 14 percent of those contacted, offered appointments. 86 percent of the listed, in-network mental health providers staff called were ghosts, as they were unreachable, not in-network, or not accepting new patients.

Impact of “Ghost Networks” on New Yorkers

New Yorkers struggling with mental health conditions rely on health plan provider directories to access affordable, quality health care services. However, when provider directories contain inaccurate listings or unavailable providers — known as ghost networks — patients may be unable to access treatment using their health insurance benefits. As a result, they are forced to choose between paying out-of-pocket, which is not possible for many, or forgoing treatment altogether.

Ghost networks are particularly harmful to New York’s most vulnerable residents, including low-income individuals, people of color, individuals with disabilities, and women, who are least able to aﬀord the cost of out-of-network care.

At the OAG mental health hearing in Buffalo, a Black parent from Rochester testified about her struggle to find appropriate and culturally responsive care for her child, describing a tangled and deeply inequitable system. Because they were unable to find appropriate care, she and her child endured eight to 10 psychiatric emergency room visits, more than 15 mental hygiene arrests, and countless referrals, meetings, and six-month wait lists over three years.

At the OAG mental health hearing held in New York City, a woman provided testimony that after treatment for depression in the emergency room at Bellevue Hospital, she was told that she would be referred to a therapist in a clinic that would accept Medicaid. However, she could not access treatment with any of the providers to whom she was referred, as they either did not return her calls or had long waiting lists. A mother provided testimony that she was unable to obtain in-network treatment for her elementary school-age child, who suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

In 2022 a mother filed a complaint with OAG that she was unable to find an in-network psychiatrist who could provide psychotherapy for her 14-year-old Black son, who suffers from major depression and attention-deficit disorder. Carelon, which administers mental health benefits for the mother’s insurer, EmblemHealth, gave her a list of eight in-network providers. She called all of them, but none were accepting new patients, provided both psychiatry and psychotherapy, or were culturally competent to treat a patient of color. After OAG intervened, the plan entered into a single-case agreement with an appropriate provider.

These cases reported to OAG demonstrate the real barriers New Yorkers face in accessing a mental health care provider because insurers are not maintaining up to date directories.

OAG Recommendations

To address this crisis and ensure that New Yorkers with mental health conditions have access to affordable and necessary treatment, major action is needed. State agencies must propose regulations for network adequacy for mental health and substance use disorder treatment services by December 31, 2023. The OAG report recommends that:

State regulators, such as the Department of Health (DOH), the Office of Mental Health, and the Department of Financial Services, should actively and frequently monitor health insurance networks through secret shopper surveys and other techniques to ensure that their directories are up to date. In particular, health plans should be required to ensure that members can get an appointment with an in-network provider within a short time frame. Plans must also collect and report information about whether network providers are actually providing care. State regulators should also take enforcement actions against health plans that violate the law, and seek penalties, corrective actions, and restitution to consumers. Health plans should be required to meet cultural competence and language access standards. At OAG’s January 2023 mental health hearing, several consumers and advocates testified about the need for culturally competent mental health care. The 2023 amendments to the New York Public Health Law require DOH to consider during its network adequacy reviews an insurer’s ability to provide culturally and linguistically competent care to meet the needs of the enrollee population. These provisions should be codified into a regulatory requirement that all New York health plans provide access to culturally and linguistically competent mental health care. Health plans should actively recruit and provide more incentives for mental health care providers to join and stay in their networks, including by providing higher reimbursement rates and reducing administrative burdens on providers.

The increased demand for mental health services in recent years has exacerbated longstanding network inadequacy, but health plans bear responsibility due to their low reimbursement rates for mental health services compared with physical health care. Health plans should also increase reimbursement rates for mental health providers to incentivize more providers to join their networks.

Health plans can incentivize greater mental health provider participation in networks by reducing administrative burdens that deter many providers from joining networks. By reducing administrative burdens such as time-consuming and unnecessary prior authorization and documentation requirements, and paying claims promptly, health plans can attract and retain more mental health providers.

Adopting these recommendations can significantly increase access to needed mental health care.

This report is part of Attorney General James’ ongoing efforts to address the mental health care crisis across New York. Attorney General James held two public mental health care hearings in New York City and Buffalo to hear directly from impacted New Yorkers. In October, Attorney General James and a bipartisan coalition of 32 attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit against Meta for harming young people’s mental health and contributing to the youth mental health crisis. Also in October, Attorney General James led a coalition of 18 attorneys general in calling for stronger federal regulations to ensure behavioral health services are covered equally to other types of health care. In August 2021, Attorney General James announced a landmark agreement with United Healthcare to resolve allegations that United unlawfully denied health care coverage for mental health and substance use disorder treatment for thousands of Americans, securing $14.3 million in restitution for consumers.

“I applaud Attorney General James for listening to the needs of New Yorkers and for providing detailed recommendations for addressing our current mental health crisis,” said Tamara Begel, Parent, Co-President of Long Island Families Together and Councilmember of Healthy Minds Healthy Kids, who testified at OAG’s New York City mental health hearing. “Her investigation into provider networks and her subsequent recommendations directly address one of the more detrimental tactics that private insurance companies use to block desperate parents from accessing the help their children need. These obstacles made it so much more difficult for me to find treatment for my son at a time when he urgently needed it.”

“Currently the only path to immediate and guaranteed treatment is a psychiatric emergency room,” said Yerania Simo, impacted individual who testified at OAG’s New York City mental health hearing. “We need to have increased access to doctors and clinics which accept Medicaid and that do not have extended wait lists which stall extremely urgent care and support. I am glad to see Attorney General James doing something to fix this issue.”

“As a parent to a teenage boy going through mental crisis, I cannot express the frustrations and even anger I have felt trying to find providers who could see him in a timely fashion and also accept our health insurance,” said Denise Amato, impacted family member who testified at OAG’s Buffalo mental health hearing. “One year we had to pay out of pocket after our search left us empty and desperate. Their waiting times if they did accept new patients was always two or three months, which when you are dealing with a fragile and manic mind, is unacceptable. Time is of the essence and I thank Attorney General James for addressing this critical issue.”

“At a time when untreated mental health and substance use disorders are creating a public health emergency, it is unconscionable that people desperate for help are turned away,” said John Coppola, Co-CEO, InUnity Alliance. “Reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of providing services and a lack of adequate state support for financially vulnerable programs have resulted in program closures when expansion of services to meet increasingly severe needs is what is needed. This is an untenable and unsustainable situation that must be addressed to help those suffering unnecessarily. Attorney General James' attention to this important issue is deeply appreciated by service providers and people needing help across New York state.”

“Every New Yorker should have access to mental health and substance use treatment when they need it and for however long they need it,” said Amy Dorin, Co-CEO, InUnity Alliance. “That’s how we build resilient communities! The data provided in the report is shocking, and the recommendations for greater accountability of the plans are on target. We thank and applaud Attorney General James and her team for their commitment to helping communities access mental health care and prosper.”

“Ensuring all New Yorkers have access to mental health care has always been the leading priority for NAMI-NYS,” said Sharon Horton, Executive Director, National Alliance on Mental Illness-New York State (NAMI-NYS). “We are troubled by the many barriers to care that remain, especially those generated by too many insurance companies that have not facilitated connections to local providers. This report conducted by Attorney General James’ office highlights the unfortunate experience of many vulnerable New Yorkers who are trying to get access to mental health care but are met with roadblocks from health plans. We need health insurance companies to do their part and maintain accurate and up to date directories of available providers to be able to connect New Yorkers with mental health care professionals to help them. NAMI-NYS applauds Attorney General James for listening to the needs of New Yorkers and working to address the mental health crisis.”

“This report illuminates what we have long heard from families: having insurance coverage often does not enable them to access the mental health care they need,” said Kayleigh Zaloga, President & CEO, NYS Coalition for Children’s Behavioral Health. “The NYS Coalition for Children's Behavioral Health commends Attorney General James on her pursuit of answers and real solutions in this analysis of network adequacy. We appreciate that a third of the secret shopper calls were parents seeking services for their children, highlighting the particularly devastating lack of services available for young people. New York state can and must do better to enforce parity and network adequacy requirements, and health plans must draw more providers into their networks and increase consumer access to care by raising their reimbursement rates. This report makes it clearer than ever that the status quo is simply unacceptable for New York's children and families.”

Learn More Interested in being featured? Contactcommunications@ncchamber.com. In the heart of the American Tobacco Campus in Durham, you can see a rising star. Several, in fact. If you know where to look. “It’s a privilege for us to be a part of this,” said Brian McGhee, GSK’s Workplace and Facilities Lead for North America. He oversees GSK’s involvement with the Rising Stars program. Rising Stars is a summer internship program for rising juniors and seniors in Durham Public Schools. “Just having the opportunity to be able to create these programs for students and give back to the community in this way, it means more to me than I can even explain,” said Jameya Jones with Durham Public Schools (DPS). Jones is the Workforce Development Coordinator with DPS. She created and oversees the program. “It allows students to get hands-on experience dealing with situations in the workforce that others might not have had the experience of doing if they don’t participate in the program,” said Jones. “So, they get a taste of real life while they are in high school.” Fourteen employers, including GSK, participated in this summer’s program. “Us bringing in those young minds, they’ve got a different perspective,” said McGhee. “They’ve got a whole other set of skills. They brought new energy into our workplace.” The Rising Stars program started in Summer 2022 with 22 interns. This year, that number more than doubled to 48. “I think the students are talking,” said Jones. “They’re sharing with their friends about the experience, the opportunity that they had. They like, ‘hey, you know, you need to apply for Rising Stars.’” Students must work 120 hours on site with their designated employer. They also participate in professional development training with Dale Carnegie and must do internship coursework which gives them high school course credit. “Their eyes were certainly opened,” said McGhee. “They didn’t know what it took to make the place work; so, they got to see that. And that’s not something that everybody is going to see on an everyday basis.” He added that the students who take part in the Rising Stars program benefit greatly from the experience. “Their futures are impacted in a positive way,” said McGhee. “It helped us certainly to be able to engage with their young minds and what they brought into the workplace from their perspective with their experiences and their skills.” McGhee said that the Rising Stars program is set up to prepare any interested employers to host interns – its turnkey for employers. “It is a very commendable program in that the kids come in engaged and ready to work and learn and provide their ideas with us,” he said. Jones said any employers interested in becoming part of the Rising Stars program can emailjameya_green@dpsnc.net. She added that the Rising Stars program is also unique in that it enables the students to create their first professional portfolio. “They’ll believe in themselves and once they graduate from high school, they can have a career here, as well,” she said. “It makes them feel like we believe in them, and they have a sense of ownership in their future.” It’s a future that, for these rising stars, is very bright.

104,Mayor Bowser and MPD Announce New Real-Time Crime Center,https://dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-and-mpd-announce-new-real-time-crime-center-0r,"(Washington, DC) – Today, Mayor Muriel Bowser and Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Pamela A. Smith were joined by local and federal law enforcement partners to announce MPD’s new Real-Time Crime Center (RTCC). The RTCC will serve as a new dedicated space that will be staffed 24/7 with local, regional, and federal law enforcement agencies to monitor and respond to criminal activities in real time.

“We are very focused on sending a clear message that if you engage in criminal activity in our city – if you harm people, threaten people, or make our communities less safe – you will be held accountable. The Real-Time Crime Center is part of that focused effort,” said Mayor Bowser. “I want to thank the local, regional, and federal law enforcement agencies that are involved in this effort. Together, through the combined resources and expertise of these partners, we will turn crime trends around and build a safer, stronger DC.”

The RTCC will serve as the nerve center for law enforcement in the District and throughout the region to collect and analyze data, to enhance situational awareness, and facilitate quick decision-making regarding crimes. The RTCC will also improve the overall efficiency of crime prevention and response efforts with law enforcement partners by leveraging their expertise and allowing more information to be shared – in real time – across jurisdictional boundaries.

“The Real-Time Crime Center represents a step forward for the Metropolitan Police Department in an effort to reduce crime and hold offenders accountable for their actions,” said Chief Smith. “We know that crime in our region is not limited to jurisdictional boundaries and sometimes, those committing crimes use that to their advantage. The RTCC will allow us to leverage our multi-agency partnerships to address crime trends throughout our communities.”



Partners from nine agencies – Amtrak Police, Arlington County Police, U.S. Capitol Police, Fairfax County Police, Metro Transit Police, Montgomery Police, U.S. Park Police, Prince George’s County Police, and the U.S. Secret Service Uniform Division – will work in collaboration with MPD to monitor and analyze data from various sources, including CCTV cameras, emergency calls, and other technology. The DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (HSEMA) and the DC Housing Authority Police Department (DCHAPD) will also support the RTCC, along with federal investigative partners at the ATF, FBI, and the U.S. Marshals Service.



The RTCC will launch in February of 2024.

105,Governor Glenn Youngkin Launches Building Blocks for Virginia Families,https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018644-en.html,"RICHMOND, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin today announced that Virginia will make a significant investment in early learning and childcare. The Building Blocks for Virginia Families initiative will empower parents with childcare choice, reduce red tape, expand available childcare options for parents, and provide needed support for parents to continue in the workforce. “Building Blocks for Virginia Families will ensure families can choose the early option that best supports their children in their most formative years and enter school ready to learn,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “By prioritizing parent choice and cutting red tape for families and providers, we are delivering a best-in-class model for early learning and childcare.” Through the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, Virginia used $794 million to expand childcare and early education programs. Over the past two years, Governor Youngkin invested funds to support parents’ post-COVID return to the workforce by increasing parent choice and fully implementing one of the nation’s strongest early learning data quality measurement and continuous improvement systems. The expiration of federal funding, put 27,000 children at risk of losing access to quality care. Through Building Blocks for Virginia Families, every eligible child will be able to continue to access high quality options that meet their family’s specific childcare needs and Virginia will remain the national leader in innovative approaches to quality early education and childcare. The Commission, staffed by the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation (ECF), created a series of guiding principles and recommendations which informed the development of the Building Blocks for Virginia Families approach. They also incorporated findings from a recent Vanderbilt University study that found a significant ROI on the learning investments from Virginia’s early childhood programs. “Today, we open the door to the next era of early care and education in the Commonwealth. Government cannot be the sole answer to every challenge including ensuring access to quality childcare,” said Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera. “The Building Blocks for Virginia Families plan is about public and private stakeholders coming together. We will address childcare deserts, early childhood provider shortages and introduce innovation and partnerships into how we pay for childcare for a sustainable system.” “It’s a great day for Virginia! Governor Youngkin has made a bold commitment to sustaining Virginia’s best-in-class public-private parent choice system through seminal investment and innovative reforms,” said President of the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation Kathy Glazer. “The Youngkin Administration has clearly recognized the importance of keeping Virginia’s families ‘whole’ with childcare services that support their children’s school readiness, their own reliable workforce participation, and the productivity of businesses in communities across the Commonwealth. Alongside our Ready Regions and Mixed Delivery partners, we are proud to continue to work with and support the efforts of the Administration through steady access to high-quality early childhood care and education services for Virginia’s families.” Building Blocks for Virginia Families builds on Virginia’s strong foundation and expands a marketplace to serve more families across the Commonwealth. Key attributes of the plan include: Ensures every low-income working family currently receiving public support continues to have access to high quality early childhood and after school programs with over $448 million annually in total investment Strengthens parent choice—of home-providers, public school preschools, community co-ops, church programs, and private day centers Creates an innovative childcare payment system driven by parents that making it easier for employers, philanthropies, local governments, community partners and families to contribute and support the success of Virginia’s early learners Cuts unnecessary red tape for providers so they can operate effectively, efficiently, and safely Eliminates childcare deserts by infusing $25 million to refurbish excess space at our colleges to launch new early learning hubs Reduces childcare educator shortages by maintaining $1 million scholarship program to increase the skills of Virginia’s early education workforce and $10 million per year for direct-to-childcare educator incentives that have been shown to reduce teacher shortages and increase educator retention in childcare Watch the announcement here."
