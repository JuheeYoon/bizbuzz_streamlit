According to the warrants, Treasure Mcweay “was extremely underweight, and her face appeared to be sunken in around the eyes and cheekbones.” A Dec. 13 autopsy revealed that the child weighed only 24 pounds and had just 5 milliliters of liquid in her stomach, the warrant adds. Officials considered her to be “extremely malnourished and dehydrated.”

Two other children, ages 4 and 3, were found to have been living with Rodney Mcwaey, and the warrant accuses him of not providing “sustenance in the form of food or water for any of his three children.”

Those children were hospitalized for extreme malnourishment and severe dehydration, the warrant details. Doctors at Hughes Spalding also confirmed with police that Mcwaey failed to provide one of his kids’ prescribed seizure medication, officials said.

Police interviewed Mcwaey and uncovered that he never allowed the children to go outside and did not permit them to leave their rooms without his permission, the warrant said. He also told police that if the kids needed something, he would take it to them.

During a search warrant of Mcwaey’s home, police said they found only expired eggs and expired milk. The kids’ rooms were also searched and no clothing was discovered, the warrant states. Several cameras, including some facing the children’s beds, were found throughout the house, officials said.

Mcwaey did not have custody of his children, authorities said.

On July 6, he is accused of kidnapping all three kids from a residence in Aberdeen, Maryland, arrest warrants reveal. The document states that the mother was the sole legal guardian and Rodney Mcwaey prevented family members, the kids’ mother and Georgia Division of Family and Children Services employees from speaking to the children.

A working smoke detector raises the chance of surviving a house fire by 85%, said Burton Clark of the Fire Service Psychology Association. Evacuating a home before help arrives is also critical to improving outcomes not just for the residents, but for the crews rushing into the flames to try to rescue them.

“Do not take any fire alarms as being false. There’s no such thing as a false fire alarm.

But as days went by, the trauma he witnessed began to take a toll on him, and Daniels said he wasn’t sure how to deal with his emotions.

That’s the reality of being a first responder, facing traumatic events and withholding emotions to do the job. But sometimes the trauma goes home with you. For years, it’s a topic that was rarely addressed.

Firefighters face an increased risk of suicide due to job-related stress and depression, a 2021 federal study found. Some organizations report that more than 100 firefighters nationwide commit suicide each year, but federal officials acknowledge potential data gaps as some departments may be hesitant to share figures due to the stigma and patient confidentiality.

In recent years, firefighters have been encouraged to discuss workplace trauma, which officials claim helps them process it instead of letting it smolder. Authorities in Atlanta and DeKalb said firefighters will debrief after every call and are urged to seek extra support from peers, leadership, chaplains and other resources such as therapy.

Carla Moore, chief psychologist for Atlanta’s Public Safety Behavioral Health Wellness Unit, said firefighters experience increased stress during emotionally intense calls, particularly those involving death or children. First responders need to address their feelings to maintain mental stability and well-being, Moore said.

“They usually talk about it within the station, not ever really processing it in a therapeutic fashion or a way that kind of opens it up, because to open it up means I actually have to talk about it more. So usually it’s repressed or just completely ignored altogether,” she explained.

What triggers stress

Starting as a recruit with the Danville Fire Department in Virginia in 1983 and later joining Atlanta Fire Rescue in 2005, Roosevelt Johns anticipated facing trauma daily and assisting people on their worst days.

Sometime in the late 1990s, Johns responded to a fiery crash in Danville involving a teenager who was killed. His child was about the same age and Johns couldn’t help but think: That could be my child.

That call has stuck with him ever since. He described it as a moment he realized the mental impact of being a firefighter.

“We say often that the firefighter who comes in on the first year is a different person after about five years,” Johns said.

Johns, who since 2013 has been serving as a chaplain with the Atlanta fire department, said there used to be a stigma about being impacted by a call, and openly discussing it was not encouraged. Firefighters were expected to develop what he calls “tough skin” and not let incidents weigh them down.

“One of the things that I think is paramount is that we talk about it because historically we did not,” he said. “But nowadays, we do try to encourage people to at least talk about those circumstances among your peers.”

Johns serves as a listening ear to crew members after emotionally intense calls, and has had countless firefighters come to him regarding changes in personality and relational issues.

Understanding the impact

Moore said not processing one’s emotions after a traumatic event is usually how prolonged stress, behavioral and mental health conditions, or other unhealthy habits begin.

According to a 2018 paper by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, about 30% of first responders develop behavioral health conditions, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, compared to 20% of the general population.

Moore emphasized the importance of new firefighters knowing what to expect and how to work through trauma. She said firefighters undergo mental wellness screenings, are provided psychoeducation, and receive external referrals for therapists and other medical professionals.

“The goal is to from the minute a person walks in as a recruit to get them to understand, just like you have to stay physically fit so that you can carry that hose, you have to stay mentally fit in order to sustain your mental health in doing this job,” she said.

Personality changes are often the first sign a firefighter is dealing with unresolved trauma. Officials explained that getting to work late, appearing disheveled, isolating oneself and having a short temper are some indicators. Johns and Daniels said that a firefighter may not realize that stress has changed them, but those close to them will notice.

Though Daniels and Johns both said they regularly speak with close friends after tough jobs, Daniels claimed that his personality has changed. When faced with a problem, he immediately wants to fix it, fearing that something worse could come out of it.

“I’m a problem solver. Once we get on scene, people expect us to have a solution. ... When I’m presented with a problem, I immediately attempt to come up with some type of fix for it,” he said, adding that “in a family situation or family household, that can be a problem sometimes.”

Resilience

Daniels said he often becomes a counselor to victims and their families, helping them comprehend the tragedy they’ve faced.

“We get the brunt of the gore, the mental stress that goes with it. We have the family members screaming in the background, we have the kids sitting on the couch not understanding why their parent or their loved one isn’t moving or isn’t responding,” Daniels said.

Just like victims have to come to terms with death in those circumstances, Johns explained that firefighters must recognize their own limits: It’s not always possible to save everyone. Guilt is a feeling Johns said many firefighters struggle with at the start of their careers.

Overcoming those emotional challenges is eased by engaging in self-care and spending time with friends and family. With the right tools in place, most firefighters are resilient, officials agreed.

“We as firefighters, we are very resilient and we understand that this is something that we chose to do,” Daniels said. “When duty calls, we are going to respond and respond appropriately because it’s not about us, it’s about the person who called us for help.”"

“Ms. Jonasson was unable to escape and closed her eyes, scared of angering Vin Diesel by rejecting him further and trying to dissociate, wishing the assault would end,” the lawsuit states.

Claire-Lise Y. Kutlay, an attorney for Jonasson, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Jonasson was initially too afraid to report the alleged assault. Jonasson was also made to sign a nondisclosure agreement as an employee of Diesel’s One Race production business, Kutlay said.

“She was afraid what it would mean for her career in the film industry, which has a pattern of protecting powerful men and silencing people who do speak up about sexual abuse that they have received or been subjected to,” Kutlay said Thursday. “She has made the very courageous decision to file a lawsuit so that she can seek justice and hold Vin Diesel and the others that permitted and covered up the sexual assault accountable for their actions.”

Diesel’s sister, Samantha Vincent, has also been sued by Jonasson, case records show. Vincent is the president of Diesel’s production company that employed Jonasson, and was the one who fired Jonasson shortly after the alleged assault, Kutlay said.

One Race Productions Inc. and One Race Films Inc. are also named as defendants in the case.

Jonasson, a California resident, was over the age of 18 when the alleged assault occurred, Kutlay said. She said Jonasson wants to prevent other women from experiencing what she went through.

Jonasson alleged that she was hired by One Race in September 2010 as an assistant working directly for Diesel. She said her first assignment was to travel to Atlanta for the filming of “Fast Five,” the fifth movie in the “Fast & Furious” franchise.

On Sept. 10, 2010, Diesel was allegedly entertaining multiple women at his hotel suite. Once the other women had left, Diesel attempted to undress Jonasson, she alleged.

After the alleged assault, Diesel said “Good job,” to Jonasson before leaving the suite, per the complaint. Within hours, Jonasson had been fired by Vincent, the lawsuit states.

“The message was clear,” the complaint states. “Ms. Jonasson was fired for courageously resisting Vin Diesel’s sexual assault, Vin Diesel would be protected, and his sexual assault covered up.”

Jonasson was empowered to sue in light of the “#MeToo” and “Time’s Up” movements exposing sexual assault, her lawsuit states. She said she felt protected by the federal Speak Out Act as well as California law allowing her to bring her otherwise untimely claims.

The lawsuit includes civil claims of sexual battery, sex discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination."
5,[Georgia] https://www.ajc.com/news/,"UPDATE: Atlanta teachers, staff will get Gov. Kemp’s bonus after all",https://www.ajc.com/education/update-atlanta-public-schools-to-approve-kemps-bonus-plan/LMPDJJXHHFAALEOGU6KA6Z7SWI/,"“All eligible Atlanta Public Schools (APS) employees have already received the state-referenced employee retention supplement in the form of the Mid-Year Holiday Retention Stipend, included in the December 14, 2023 paycheck,” the message read.

The school district changed course Thursday evening, hours after Georgia School Superintendent Richard Woods sent a letter to Atlanta Public Schools interim Superintendent Danielle Battle pushing her to reconsider the district’s decision.

“The intent of Atlanta Public Schools and the Atlanta Board of Education was to reward our hardworking teachers and school staff with a bonus before the holiday break, while also being fiscally responsible stewards of taxpayer funds,” the district said in a statement. “We did that as a district on December 15th and we are committed to passing along any additional funds once funds are disbursed for the Governor’s proposal and clarification is provided on which categories of employees should be covered by the bonus.”

APS initially said the money Kemp approved for the bonuses would be used for other district priorities.

“In this instance, we preemptively moved to show our appreciation to staff by asking our Board to approve the usage of fund balance for all employees in early December so that we could get our payments out in advance of the holiday break,” the district said in a statement earlier this week to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “We greatly appreciate the Governor’s willingness to use the state fund balance to share in the cost by providing stipends for our teachers, as this allows us to use our fund balance for other educational needs. Since we used district fund balance to secure the appreciation payments made to all eligible employees on the December 15th payroll, the state funding announced today will be used in support of other APS priorities.”

In his letter to Battle, first reported Thursday by the AJC, Woods said he was “baffled” by the district’s ability to predict the exact timing and amount of the bonus.

“Let me be very clear: the intent of the state’s $1,000 retention pay supplement is not to backfill the Atlanta Public Schools budget or ‘share in the cost’ of additional recognition already provided by districts to teachers,” Woods’ letter reads.

Lisa Morgan, the president of the Georgia Association of Educators, said it’s puzzling that APS didn’t wait on guidance from Woods’ office before notifying staff they wouldn’t receive the money.

“It’s very disappointing that a system would state — before they have all the details — that educators are not going to receive the bonus that was announced and intended for them,” Morgan said.

Woods ended his letter to Battle with a plea to change the district’s decision.

“The state is providing a $1,000 retention payment to teachers and support staff, and it is my expectation that they will receive it,” he said. “Anything less is a disservice to the teachers and staff whose efforts in the classroom — far more than anything that takes place at the state or central office level — are the reason our students succeed.”"

The investigation uncovered that Piercefield was friends with Davis and Wolfe, and they had been together prior to the killings. Piercefield and Wolfe took Davis to the Westwood apartment, which belonged to the surviving victim, around 2:30 a.m. and then left the complex, authorities stated.

At around 4:10 a.m., Piercefield and Wolfe returned “unannounced and for reasons unknown,” the district attorney’s office said. The two went into Davis’ bedroom and gunfire went off shortly after.

The surviving victim went to check on the three, but Piercefield then turned the gun on her, shooting her twice in the eye, according to law enforcement. Piercefield fled the apartment complex shortly before the woman called 911.

The district attorney’s office said Piercefield used two guns and fired at least eight rounds. All three victims were unarmed.

Piercefield was arrested a day after the shooting with the help of the Paulding County SWAT team.

He said about 10 inches of water left furniture, floors and walls damaged and sent Christmas gifts floating.

Bob Myers sat in the gymnasium of Oxnard College on Thursday afternoon holding his cane.

At around 1:45 a.m. Thursday, he was awakened at his home in the 55-plus community of Hueneme Bay by the sound of rushing water.

A storm that barreled down on Ventura County dumped what officials said was historic levels of rain over a short period of time. The downpour left streets flooded across Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme, where Myers lives.

“I thought some pipes had blown up or something,” he said. Myers ran to his bathroom but found no issues. He then moved to his back door, where he saw water rushing into his home “like someone was standing there with a fire hose.”

The doors, he explained, were closed, and the water was coming in from small spaces around them. The doors could not be opened.

He looked through one of his windows at the complex and saw “a lake.”

“Eventually,” he said, “the water receded enough that people could begin getting their doors open.”

Stories like this emerged in Ventura County coastal communities hit hard by the rainstorm.

Preliminary data suggest Oxnard may have experienced one of the heaviest downpours ever observed in the area, with rainfall rates of 3 inches per hour sustained for more than an hour.

“These are genuinely extraordinary torrential downpours — and, importantly, they’re continuing. This is not over yet,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA, said at a briefing Thursday.

Fire officials in Ventura County reported that 911 dispatchers had received more than 275 calls for help over a five-hour period as floodwaters rose in the coastal communities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard.

Mud and debris tumbled into roadways in Santa Barbara, closing at least one off-ramp on the 101 Freeway. Elsewhere, cars were surrounded by rushing water that appeared to be several feet deep.

But Port Hueneme was particularly hard hit.

One of Myers’ neighbors accidentally cut himself while attempting to get out of his home and was hospitalized.

Although the waters had receded, the damage to Myers’ home had been done.

“There is nothing livable left in my home,” he said. From 3 to 4 feet of water had entered the house, throwing appliances and furniture around and soaking walls.

Myers was at a loss about what his next steps would be.

“I am an unfortunate one,” he said. “I have no family in this state. I have no family closer than the East Coast.

“I don’t know what I’m gonna do.”"

Responding to a recent surge in retail theft, the California Highway Patrol announced Thursday it had seized more than $1 million in stolen items and arrested a Los Angeles woman in connection to a Southern California retail theft ring.

The Organized Retail Crime Task Force of the CHP conducted a raid on a warehouse in the city of Paramount and a business called The Makeup Store on Whittier Boulevard in Los Angeles, uncovering more than a million dollars worth of stolen cosmetics during the operation.

Officers arrested and booked Brenda Yanez, 48, on charges of organized retail theft, grand theft and receiving stolen property. Authorities linked her arrest to an organized theft ring targeting multiple Southern California retailers, including CVS, Sephora, Ulta Beauty, Rite Aid, Nordstrom, and 99 Cents Only stores.

In addition to the stolen property, police found tools used to remove anti-theft devices at the raided locations. Several loss prevention investigators from the affected retailers were on the scene, assisting in identifying stolen merchandise.

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last month that in response to a spike in retail theft, the CHP task force was “increasing enforcement efforts through proactive and confidential law enforcement operations with allied agencies through the holidays.” In the first 11 months of the year, the governor’s office said the task force had made more than 1,000 arrests, a 109% year-over-year increase.

Theft has prompted many retail businesses, including drug stores, to add extra security measures, such as locking allergy medicine, shaving razors, infant formula and batteries, among other items, behind plexiglass.

Tuesday’s raid came days after the Los Angeles Police Department searched a Westlake storefront and uncovered hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stolen merchandise. During that search, police discovered hundreds of stolen Apple products connected to burglaries.

Other law enforcement agencies have also been cracking down on retail thefts in California.

On the same day as the Whittier Boulevard bust, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office arrested six people in Lake Elsinore, charging them with various crimes, including burglary and narcotics-related misdemeanor warrants. Addressing a high rate of shoplifting at one retail store, the San Francisco Police Department conducted an operation Tuesday, arresting 18 shoplifting suspects."

The latest storm in Southern California is expected to drop little, if any, snow on the slopes.

As skiers and snowboarders flock to the Lake Tahoe and the Eastern Sierra slopes this holiday weekend, National Weather Service meteorologists say the latest storm is expected to drop only a limited amount of snow in Southern California.

The only area that could record even as much as 1 to 2 inches of snow over the weekend is the high mountain peaks of the Eastern San Gabriel Mountains, said John Dumas, meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, operators of the Mt. Baldy Resort in the San Gabriel Mountains, said they expect to open their snow play area Saturday and Sunday as well as a chair lift “through the holidays.”

“We expect more snow after Christmas through the New Year,” according to the post.

Big Bear Mountain Resort in the San Bernardino Mountains is expected to see rain and snow flurries Friday evening but should have little to no snow accumulation over the weekend.

Looking out of his office window and seeing blue skies, Justin Kanton, Big Bear’s public relations director, said the limited trails open for skiing should remain open over the weekend, and the amount of snow in the area has been great so far for visitors, especially students on winter vacation.

As the Big Bear resort waits what the storm might bring, Katon cautioned visitors to prepare ahead of traveling to the area by checking the weather report, looking for road closures and identifying whether snow chains are necessary for travel.

“What [you] don’t want is to get halfway up the hill and CHP turns [you] around because [you] don’t have the right kind of traction,” he said.

Other parts of the state have already received enough snow to kick off the ski season.

Over the next three days Mammoth Mountain in the Eastern Sierra is predicting about three inches of snowfall. The National Weather Service forecast for the Lake Tahoe area is partly cloudy with a slight chance of snow Friday, Saturday and Monday. Lake Tahoe’s resorts are reporting between six and 48 inches of base, with higher-elevation resorts operating up to third to a half of all trails."

Gavin Newsom signs the fast-food bill, surrounded by fast food workers at the SEIU Local 721 in Los Angeles, in September.

Workers at fast-food restaurants and in minimum-wage jobs can expect a pay bump soon, courtesy of higher wage floors adopted by California lawmakers and more than two dozen cities across the state.

In California, the minimum wage is currently $15.50 per hour, but it rises to $16 per hour starting Jan. 1, according to the state’s Department of Industrial Relations.

For workers in several cities, the pay bump may be more significant. Twenty-seven cities across the state adopted new minimum-wage laws this year, according to a study by the UC Berkeley Labor Center, and the pay increases are set to take place Jan. 1.

Because the cities’ minimum wage exceeds the state’s floor, workers would be entitled to the higher wage set by their municipality.

According to the labor center, 58 counties and cities across the country have minimum-wage laws. Most of them are in California.

In Oakland, the city approved a minimum wage of $16.50 an hour for 2024. In the city of Mountain View, local officials set a minimum wage of $18.75 an hour for next year, more than $2 above the state minimum.

For fast-food workers, the increased pay will be a bit more significant.

A new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September — codifying a deal reached between fast-food companies and unions — will boost minimum wages for many fast-food workers to $20 per hour, starting April 1.

That wage floor, which will apply to chains that have more than 60 locations across the country, is estimated to affect more than 500,000 workers.

Here are the California cities that will have higher minimum wages in effect, starting Jan. 1:



The UC Berkeley Labor Center tracks cities and counties that have adopted their own minimum wage, usually higher than their states. Others boosted their wage floors previously; for example, the minimum wage is $19.08 in West Hollywood and is $19.08 and $16,78 in Los Angeles, both of which will be adjusted later in 2024 for inflation."
16,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Six men allege ‘rampant, unceasing sexual abuse’ at secluded Northern California nonprofit",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/six-men-allege-sexual-abuse-fellowship-of-friends,"They were searching for spiritual awakening and enlightenment. Instead, the six men were subject to “rampant, unceasing sexual abuse” by their spiritual guide, in concert with members of a controversial religious group and workers at an award-winning Northern California winery, the men allege in court documents.

The unnamed plaintiffs filed a lawsuit Friday in Yuba County against the Fellowship of Friends — a nonprofit religious group described by some as a cult — along with its founder and spiritual teacher, Robert Earl Burton, and its Renaissance Vineyard and Winery.

Fellowship of Friends bills itself as an organization that helps members reach their true potential, an upscale throwback to the erstwhile Bay Area communes that separated participants from society so they could pursue self-realization. Former Fellowship members, however, allege the group is really a cult of personality masquerading as a nonprofit, and that its true purpose is to satisfy Burton’s sexual needs. On the side, the Fellowship created a famed winery whose lists of honors and accolades for its Cabernet Sauvignons, Sauvignon Blancs and Riesling span pages.

Their civil complaint seeks damages for 15 alleged violations, including gender violence, human trafficking, sexual assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs are also asking for a trial by jury.

Adam Slater, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said that although male sexual assault survivors experience “the same trauma as women,” stigma hinders the filing of criminal or civil lawsuits.

“We commend these brave individuals for coming forward and encourage others to do the same,” Slater said in a statement.

Fellowship President Greg Holman told The Times that his organization “has been made aware of the lawsuit” but has yet to be served.

Holman declined to comment when asked about the allegations and his personal interactions with Burton.

The Fellowship of Friends was established in 1970 by Burton , a former schoolteacher.

According to the Fellowship, members are encouraged to “learn both the principles of awakening and practical methods to apply those in their daily life.” Students are aided in this journey by Burton, 84, who is referred to as “The Teacher,” according to court documents.

Burton has told members he is guided by dozens of angels, including Abraham Lincoln, Plato and Jesus Christ.

California Trouble Taints a Cerebral Sanctuary Robert Burton created Fellowship of Friends to celebrate the intellect and offer a haven from nuclear holocaust. But claims of a sex scandal have prompted many members to leave.

The organization’s main campus is on a 1,300-acre tract in the Northern California community of Oregon House and is called Apollo. There, members drink fine wine, listen to opera and gaze upon expensive artwork.

Yet the plaintiffs asserted that the organization has a dark and “secret” side.

They allege they were “sexually assaulted, sexually battered, raped, harassed, groomed, and/or otherwise attacked” during their time at Apollo.

Five of the men were members from 1971 to 1986; the last plaintiff joined in 1997 and left in 2008.

Five of the plaintiffs said they suffered some form of sexual abuse or harassment from four to 30 times.

A sixth said he was “sexually harassed, abused, molested and assaulted” between 280 and 300 times over an eight-year period.

Burton and the organization made sure the balance of power was in their favor, the lawsuit alleges, as they maintained control of the men with threats of punishment and insistence on obedience. They quashed rebellion with “isolation, sleep deprivation [and] the creation of inner conflict.”

But the lawsuit also alleges that Burton lavished the men with praise and affection — “love bombing” them as a means of seduction and coercion, the lawsuit alleges.

Although Burton maintained that homosexuality was “degenerate” and “wrong,” the lawsuit says, he justified his pursuit of male members by referring to them as “feminine angels in a man’s body.”

A few of those suing were part of a “harem” of men who accompanied Burton throughout the day and were known as “Burton’s Boys.”

Burton told them “they are not sleeping with a man but an angel,” according to the lawsuit.

Between 2002 and 2005, the Fellowship hosted “Lovefests” on Valentine’s Day. On those days, Burton attempted to have sex with 100 men a day, falling short and sexually assaulting “between 70-80” men during these events, the lawsuit states.

He continued to assault members for decades with few repercussions because the handful of sexual abuse allegations made against him were primarily internal and never curtailed his activities, the lawsuit alleges. A female staffer filed complaints with the FBI in 2015 and 2019, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided the Fellowship twice as part of an investigation into its use of religious visas.

Members who pressed the organization’s board and Burton about the alleged sexual misconduct were shunned and kicked out, according to the lawsuit.

Samuel Sanders, director of the Fellowship board, was excommunicated after he wrote an internal email to fellow board members in 1981. “Burton has over the years pursued and sodomized young men. He has used his position to seduce these young men,” Sanders wrote, according to the lawsuit. “Our omission, and it is one in the strictest sense, is allowing it to continue.”

The men behind the lawsuit said in court documents that they are suffering from a variety of ailments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol abuse and panic attacks.

“Because the abuse here was committed by a so-called spiritual leader and enabled by the organization, it was all the more insidious,” plaintiffs’ attorney Slater said.

The men have also struggled in personal and romantic relationships, according to the lawsuit, and are pushing for the opportunity to tell a jury about their experiences."
17,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"November shatters global temperature records, marking 6 record-warm months in a row",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-12-21/november-shatters-global-temperature-records,"The planet has experienced an astounding six-month run of record-breaking temperatures, including the hottest November on record, federal officials announced Thursday.

Global average temperatures last month were 2.59 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average — 0.68 degrees above the previous record from November 2015, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose records date back to 1850.

The planet also experienced its hottest autumn on record — September through November — and its hottest ever January through November.

“It is virtually certain, with one month remaining in the year, that 2023 will be the warmest year on record,” said Karin Gleason, monitoring section chief with the agency’s National Centers for Environmental Information.

Last month saw record-breaking temperatures on land and in the oceans, Gleason said. South America, Africa and Asia each had their warmest November on record, while North America saw its second-warmest November on record.

In the contiguous United States, the average temperature in November was 44 degrees, or 2.7 degrees above the average, marking the 19th warmest November on record, she said.

The warming is largely driven by a strengthening El Niño, the tropical Pacific climate pattern associated with hotter global temperatures. Its counterpart, La Niña, is associated with cooler temperatures and had been in place previously for several years.

The hotter climate pattern is enhancing the effects of human-caused global warming, experts say.

“The overall trajectory, or trend, is warming, and then you have these influences of which [El Niño] is a primary player,” Gleason said. “The strong El Niño kind of broke through the barrier, and we’re starting to see temperature anomalies that we really haven’t seen historically in the record.”

The news comes only weeks after world leaders gathered in Dubai for COP28, an annual United Nations climate conference, during which nearly 200 countries agreed for the first time to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels.

Officials stressed that transitioning away from such fuels is critical to preventing additional planetary warming.

“As long as greenhouse gas concentrations keep rising, we can’t expect different outcomes from those seen this year,” read a statement from Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service in Europe, which has also affirmed that this was the hottest November on record. “The temperature will keep rising and so will the impacts of heatwaves and droughts. Reaching net zero as soon as possible is an effective way to manage our climate risks.”

NOAA officials said the effects of this warming are already being felt around the globe. The first 11 months of 2023 rank the highest for the number of billion-dollar climate and weather disasters in the U.S., Gleason said.

So far, there have been 25 billion-dollar disasters this year — 5 more than the previous record set in 2020. They include devastating flooding in California from January through March; flooding in the Northeast in July and Hurricane Idalia in Florida in August.

The total cost of 2023 events now exceeds $81 billion, and they have resulted in at least 482 direct and indirect fatalities, Gleason said.

Warmer ocean temperatures have also contributed to an above-normal hurricane season, with 20 named storms in the Atlantic and 17 named storms in the eastern Pacific this year, according to Matt Rosencrans, a meteorologist with the NOAA Climate Prediction Center.

That includes August’s Hurricane Hilary, which brought the first issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings in California. Ocean temperatures in November were a record-breaking 1.8 degrees above normal for the month.

El Niño isn’t only associated with warmer global temperatures. The pattern is also associated with wetter conditions in California, and the storms coming into the state now are likely related to it, Rosencrans said.

“Going forward, the forecast is that El Niño is expected to continue through this Northern Hemisphere winter — with a robust El Niño, potentially of historical strength,” he said. There is a 54% chance of a historically strong El Niño during the November through January season.

The impacts of that could include an enhanced southern storm track, which may affect Southern California as well as the Gulf region and the Southwest U.S., Rosencrans said. Long-term forecasts favor above-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures in California in January, Februrary and March.

However, the conditions this year have had at least one benefit for the Golden State, which was declared drought-free in November for the first time since 2020.

But the overall trends remain concerning, said Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, which also declared record warmth this year.

“We cannot return to the climate of the 20th century, but we must act now to limit the risks of an increasingly inhospitable climate in this and the coming centuries,” Taalas wrote in an update at the end of November.

“Greenhouse gas levels are record high. Global temperatures are record high. Sea level rise is record high. Antarctic sea ice is record low,” he said. “It’s a deafening cacophony of broken records.”"
18,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Falling mortgage rates lend a helping hand to home buyers,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/falling-mortgage-rates-lend-a-helping-hand-to-home-buyers,"Mortgage rates fell for the eighth consecutive week, giving cash-strapped home buyers some relief as the new year approaches.

The average interest rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage clocked in at 6.67% for the week ended Dec. 20, down from 6.95% a week earlier, according to data released Thursday by mortgage giant Freddie Mac. As recently as late October, rates were 7.79% — the highest in more than two decades.

The drop in borrowing cost saves new buyers hundreds of dollars each month, but experts said consumers shouldn’t expect drastic improvement in 2024.

The interest rate on mortgages changes based on a variety of factors, including inflation expectations and Federal Reserve policy.

Keith Gumbinger, vice president of research firm HSH.com, predicted rates will bottom out around 6.4% in 2024 as economic growth and inflation remain elevated enough to prevent further declines in borrowing costs.

“Cheaper mortgage money doesn’t necessarily mean that cheap mortgage money is coming,” Gumbinger said. “If you really want the lowest possible interest rates, you really have to hope for the most horrific economic climate.”

Rates have fallen since October, however, in large part because multiple economic reports have signaled inflation is slowing.

The most recent decline comes after the Federal Reserve signaled last week it may be done raising its benchmark interest rate, which helps set a floor on all types of borrowing costs, including mortgage rates.

For prospective homeowners, housing remains drastically more expensive than when rates were 3% and below during the early part of the pandemic. But the decline from 7.79% to 6.67%, equals $486 in monthly savings for a $800,000 home, assuming a buyer puts 20% down.

What effect somewhat lower mortgage rates will have on the housing market depends on how buyers and sellers react.

When mortgage rates first surged in 2022, home prices fell in response as buyers quickly pulled away and inventory swelled. But prices started rising again this year as well-heeled first time buyers returned and existing homeowners increasingly chose not to sell, unwilling to give up their rock-bottom mortgage rates on loans taken out before or during the pandemic.

In most counties, home prices are near their all-time peaks, while in Orange County, prices are setting new records, according to data from Zillow.

Jordan Levine, chief economist with the California Assn. of Realtors, said rates likely will end 2024 in the “low-6% range,” which should convince more existing homeowners to sell.

But he said the increase in supply isn’t likely to be enough to offset an increase in buyers who will also be lured by lower borrowing costs. As a result, Levine said the market may actually be more competitive in 2024, with prices up around 8% by year’s end in Southern California.

A recent forecast from Zillow predicted values would be flat to down slightly in Southern California between November 2023 and November 2024.

Zillow senior economist Nicole Bachaud said falling rates could mean home price growth comes in stronger than that forecast, but maybe not.

“Given the affordability crisis in Los Angeles, we might see sellers move before buyers have enough room in their budgets to respond,” she said."
19,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Huntington Beach to add new monthly celebrations, remove others like Black History Month",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/huntington-beach-to-add-new-monthly-celebrations-remove-others-like-black-history-month,"The Huntington Beach Fourth of July Host Band marches up Main Street during this year’s Fourth of July parade.

February’s city theme for Huntington Beach will be “We Love Our Libraries” in 2024, while the city will make no mention of Black History Month.

In June, the city theme will be focused on the history of Independence Day, but the city will not be recognizing (LGBTQ+) Pride Month.

The City Council voted 4-3 on Tuesday night to approve a 12-month calendar that will see each month dedicated to a specific theme but would remove other familiar months from the recognition list.

The item, introduced by Mayor Gracey Van Der Mark, Mayor Pro Tem Pat Burns and Councilman Casey McKeon, states that it is designed to honor the rich historic heritage of the country, state and Surf City itself. Each month’s theme will highlight significant events, landmarks and influential figures.

Tony Strickland voted to approve the item, while Dan Kalmick, Natalie Moser and Rhonda Bolton all voted “no.”

McKeon said that over the past year, city archivist and historian Kathie Schey has sent him about 20 chronological photos of the history of Huntington Beach that he has hanging in his council office.

“Myself, as a third-generation Huntington Beach resident, I’ve just been amazed to learn how much of our rich history that I was unaware of, and I can only imagine that the majority of our residents are unaware of as well,” McKeon said. “That was essentially the genesis for this calendar of historically themed months ... the monthly celebrations [now] are fragmented, inconsistent and relatively unorganized within the departments.”

But Schey, earlier in the meeting during public comments, said she would be resigning as the chair of the historic resources board and as member of the design review board in protest of the item. Another seven- to nine-member committee would be created to decide the calendar of events for each year, which she saw as usurping the power of the historic resources board.

“I think it’s a pretty thinly veiled, stinging vote of no confidence both in my role as a historian and leadership of the historic resources board,” Schey said. “The members of that board include a history professor, two history authors, two of the great-grandsons of our first mayor ... and this is unfair to them.”

The item states the committee could be assisted by the historic resources board or city staff, as needed. McKeon said the board was not consulted before the item was put on the agenda, though he did have a conversation with Schey over the weekend.

Monthly themes for 2024, as proposed and amended Tuesday, include celebrating the city’s origins and remembrance of the Holocaust in January, California’s history in March and the history of Huntington Beach’s railroad in April. But the item also states that any previous monthly themes or celebrations approved by earlier City Councils would be repealed and superseded.

These federally recognized celebrations include Black History Month, Women’s History Month in March and Pride Month in June, among others. May is Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, and Hispanic Heritage Month runs from mid-September to mid-October.

The item states that the new Huntington Beach celebrations are intended to be “free of any identity politics and political agendas.”

Kalmick questioned both the item itself and why the previously approved celebrations need to be disregarded.

“This is not public policy,” he said. “This is an Eagle Scout project. This is what we all learned in fourth grade and 10th grade and 11th grade. I do apologize if you didn’t know some of these things; a lot of folks in town do ... So, February of 2024 we’re not going to celebrate Black History Month. Why not?”

McKeon said the previous themed months could be added back in future years.

“This is meant to be a fun exercise that brings the community together,” he said. “You’re totally over-complicating it.”

Moser, who has a bachelor’s degree in history from Cal State Long Beach, said that presenting a comprehensive historical narrative is complex, and she cautioned against over-simplification or inadvertent sanitizing of the past.

“I love history and I want us to know more about history, [but] our immediate role as council members is to prioritize the needs of the community that directly impact them,” she said.

Don Han is the director of community partnerships for Groundswell, formerly known as OC Human Relations. He said he had been working to support the Huntington Beach Human Relations Task Force/Committee, which the council voted to ax over the summer, since 2005.

“It is kind of disheartening to see that the nationally recognized heritage months are being removed from the city of Huntington Beach,” Han said Wednesday. “The history of Huntington Beach is the history of these people. If Huntington Beach wants to continue to celebrate its diversity, it has to embrace and be inclusive of all people, so that they feel that they belong. Removing the Black History Month celebration, imagine if you identify as a Black person in that community, to see your city’s elected officials say, ‘We’re not going to recognize you and your history.’ That can be disheartening.”

State Sen. Dave Min also released a statement that was highly critical of the item.

Burns said that the federally recognized months were already well known and being celebrated.

“Just not in Huntington Beach,” Kalmick said."

Los Angeles County firefighters responding to a garage fire at a Lancaster area home on Wednesday found the body of a woman stuffed inside the trunk of a burned-out car.

Firefighters responded to the fire on 38th Street West in the Quartz Hill neighborhood just after 8 a.m., quickly extinguishing the blaze, according to Ed Pickett, supervising fire dispatcher at the Los Angeles County Fire Department.

Crews searched the garage and discovered the woman’s body inside the trunk of the car, Pickett said. The investigation was then turned over to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Details about the woman’s identity, whether she lived in the home and how she may have died were not immediately available. A report from KCAL-TV news said the woman was an elementary school teacher in Palmdale.

Google’s lobbying skyrockets

Speaking of watchdog journalism, tech policy reporter Queenie Wong recently dug into Google’s lobbying reports and discovered that the search giant spent a record amount lobbying in California this year.

Why? Mainly to fund an ad campaign attempting to kill legislation that would force Google, Facebook and other large online platforms to pay news publishers for articles displayed on their sites.

Google’s payment to a taxpayers group for the advertising made up most of the record $1.5 million the company spent lobbying in California from January to September, Wong reports . During the same period last year, Google spent $187,434. The company spends an average of about $257,000 per year lobbying in California, according to her review of data from 2005-22.

The massive surge reflects the growing efforts by tech companies to influence California lawmakers as they debate how to protect young people and journalists and other workers from the threats posed by social media sites, artificial intelligence and other emerging technology.

Will Trump get dumped from the ballot?

California Democrats are hoping a court decision disqualifying former President Trump from the Colorado primary ballot will help them strike him from California’s Republican primary.

Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, sent a letter this week to California Secretary of State Shirley Weber urging her “to explore every legal option” to remove Trump from the March 5 ballot because of his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, writes politics reporter Noah Bierman .

“This decision is about honoring the rule of law in our country and protecting the fundamental pillars of democracy,” she wrote, citing the Colorado Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision to exclude Trump from that state’s ballot.

Though it’s expected that the U.S. Supreme Court will wind up weighing in with a ruling that could effect many states, several — including California — are facing a time crunch to get ballots prepared for the March 5 primary.

Weber, who oversees elections in California, already released a preliminary list of likely candidates that includes Trump. She plans to mail a certified list of candidates to county elections officials Dec. 28 so that they can begin printing ballots. Although ballots could be amended later, changing them gets harder — and more expensive — as the election date draws nearer, Bierman reports .

Someone like Gavin Newsom, writes columnist Mark Z. Barabak."
23,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Column: Who will make sure L.A. reaches 100% clean energy by 2035?,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2023-12-21/column-who-will-make-sure-l-a-reaches-100-clean-energy-by-2035-boiling-point,"Then-L.A. Department of Water and Power board member Aura Vasquez applauds during a news conference outside DWP headquarters in February 2019, during which then-Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the agency wouldn’t spend billions of dollars rebuilding three gas-fired power plants along the coast.

Few people have a more important role to play in confronting the climate crisis than the head of the L.A. Department of Water and Power.

Although DWP is best known for its history of shady water grabs — as memorialized in the film “Chinatown” — it’s also a hugely influential player in the energy world. The agency drew international attention when it concluded it would be able to power the nation’s second-largest city with 100% climate-friendly electricity by 2035. Its early investments in large-scale solar power, green hydrogen and other clean energy technologies presaged similar moves by power companies across the country.

So if you care about limiting the deadly heat waves, destructive wildfires and other harms of global warming, you should care that Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is looking for a new general manager for DWP.

Marty Adams, the current head honcho, announced over the summer that he would retire in early February. His successor will lead DWP through a crucial period in the clean energy transition, during which the city will hopefully show the world it’s possible to dramatically reduce our use of planet-warming fossil fuels — without prompting widespread blackouts or causing electricity prices to soar out of control.

But some climate advocates are concerned that the Bass administration has done little to solicit public input on the next general manager. They’re also worried that DWP may not be as committed to 100% clean energy by 2035 as it once was.

Teresa Cheng, a Sierra Club staffer who follows the agency closely, told me city officials have made hardly any public statements about the search for the next general manager. That’s especially problematic, she said, because DWP’s next leader will play a key role in determining not only whether L.A. meets its clean energy goals but whether it does so equitably. That means low-income families and people of color saving money and breathing cleaner air in their neighborhoods.

“We really haven’t seen any public information about this search,” Cheng said.

I reached out to a representative for the mayor’s office late last week, mentioning the transparency concerns I’d heard from climate activists and asking whether Bass would do more to publicize the search process and give members of the public an opportunity to weigh in. Lo and behold, on Monday afternoon Bass’ office sent out a press release announcing that city officials have been working with a private firm to conduct a national search for DWP’s next leader.

The agency’s general manager “is critical in ensuring equitable service, safety and reliability in Los Angeles as well as helping us achieve the city’s collective goal of 100% clean energy by 2035,” Bass said in the press release.

Is phasing out fossil fuels still a top priority for the mayor and her appointees, though?

That question has been on my mind because of a letter sent by DWP to state officials a few weeks ago, requesting changes to a document drafted by the California Energy Commission. DWP asked the commission to strike a reference to the city’s “goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035” and instead refer to a “goal of 100 percent clean electricity” — sans the 2035 date.

That might not sound like a big deal. But it is.

The idea of ending the combustion of coal and natural gas for electricity has long been seen by climate scientists and activists as a necessary first step toward limiting global warming. The sooner we can transition the electric grid to solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, the sooner we can power our cars, trucks and home heating systems with clean energy.

Until recently, U.S. politicians were focused on switching to renewable energy by mid-century. California’s 100% clean electricity law, passed five years ago, included a 2045 deadline. Since then, nearly a dozen states have adopted similar timelines.

But with the world breaking temperature record after temperature record — and floods, storms and droughts getting worse — climate scientists and activists have increasingly argued we must move faster to ditch fossil fuels.

Following their lead, President Biden campaigned on a national target of 100% clean energy by 2035. DWP joined the party a few years later, concluding after extensive study with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory that L.A. can reach 98% clean energy by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Then-Mayor Eric Garcetti quickly endorsed that timeline, as did the City Council.

“This should encourage California to see that it’s achievable everywhere. If the biggest city in the state with the largest municipal utility in the country can do this, you can do it too,” Garcetti said at the time.

So when I pointed out to L.A. City Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky — a vocal renewable energy supporter — that DWP seemed to be backtracking on its 2035 commitment in the letter sent to state officials, she was none too happy.

“The City Council and Mayor have been clear about our commitment to reaching 100% clean energy by 2035 and have communicated this clearly and frequently to DWP,” Yaroslavsky said in a written statement. “Any effort by DWP staff to undermine this direction is infuriating and unacceptable. I fully expect the department to correct their filing.”

That’s exactly what happened. By the time I received Yaroslavsky’s statement, in fact, a DWP spokesperson had emailed me an updated version of the agency’s letter that reaffirmed rather than excised the promise to pursue 100% by 2035.

A spokesperson for the mayor’s office, meanwhile, pointed me to a recent news conference during which Bass touted her climate accomplishments, including securing federal funds that she said would help the city hit 100% clean energy by 2035.

“We’re cleaning up our power grid, building new zero-emission transit and transportation options and addressing climate and environmental justice issues, and creating a more climate-resilient water supply,” Bass said.

So is this all a giant nothingburger? Or should we be concerned that L.A.’s climate leadership is slipping?

The answer may depend on DWP’s general manager.

Running the Department of Water and Power is a notoriously tough job — and one that some recent occupants have only made more difficult for themselves. Marcie Edwards stepped down after two-plus years as general manager amid reports of customer dissatisfaction. Her successor, David Wright, was sentenced to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to bribery.

Adams, to his credit, will be leaving DWP after five and a half years at the helm, and four decades overall.

In an bulletin to DWP staff announcing his retirement, Adams said the agency finds itself at a “pivotal point as we see the critical importance of the Department’s role in creating the future of Los Angeles in a time of great economic and social need.”

“I am very excited for the next generation of employees and leaders who will carry this agency, and this City, into a bright new future,” he said.

Those employees and leaders will have difficult questions to answer on the road to 100% clean energy.

Some climate activists are frustrated by DWP’s plan to convert several power plants from burning fossil gas to hydrogen — a top priority for the politically powerful labor unions whose members operate those plants, but a nonstarter for environmental justice groups who worry that hydrogen combustion would lead to continued air pollution in low-income communities of color.

More broadly, DWP will need to make sure its clean energy programs bring proportionate benefits to low-income families and communities of color — which they historically have not, according to a recent report commissioned by the utility.

I’ll be watching closely as Bass chooses the city’s next energy boss. If you hear anything, let me know.

And if you want to weigh in? The mayor’s office isn’t offering any formal venues for public engagement. But Bass’ spokesperson told me the best way to provide input is via public comment at DWP board meetings and City Council meetings.

Whatever happens next, keep paying attention after the mayor makes her choice. We’ve got a long way to go.

On that note, here’s what’s happening around the West:

ENERGY POLITICS

How have Big Oil and Big Labor made it so difficult to pass aggressive climate laws in California? This story by CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and Jeremia Kimelman does a great job breaking down the partnership between the two political heavyweights — and the campaign dollars they use to sway lawmakers. And if you’re wondering why last year’s law seeking to limit alleged price-gouging by oil companies — which Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed through the Legislature over industry opposition — hasn’t led to lower gasoline prices yet, E&E News’ Anne C. Mulkern has an explanation.

“A quarter of California households reported being unable to pay their utility bills in October.” So writes KQED’s Vanessa Rancaño in this story, which illuminates the crisis of rising electricity rates — and how it can fuel homelessness. Her reporting is a valuable reminder that if we want to transition our homes from planet-warming gas heaters and stovetops to electric appliances, we need to keep electricity costs down. Speaking of which, Grist’s Akielly Hu has a good rundown of what cities are doing to try to get gas appliances out of homes and businesses, following a court ruling striking down Berkeley’s ban on gas hookups.

That’s the ballgame: California’s Diablo Canyon nuclear plant will be allowed to keep running past 2025. Federal officials have accepted Pacific Gas & Electric’s application to renew the plant’s license, clearing the way for PG&E to continue generating climate-friendly electricity at Diablo beyond a planned 2025 shutdown date, Mackenzie Shuman reports for the San Luis Obispo Tribune. The federal decision was a victory for Newsom, who — as I’ve reported previously — has fought to keep the plant open through at least 2030, arguing that it’s become a crucial tool for keeping the lights on without fossil fuels.

HOW WE GET AROUND

Less groundwater pumping and more reliable high-paying jobs are good — but truck traffic spewing toxic air pollution and heat-trapping emissions, not so much. That’s the tension at the heart of this fascinating story by my L.A. Times colleague Rebecca Plevin, about the warehouse boom getting underway in California’s San Joaquin Valley. “Unlike the Inland Empire, where warehouses have moved in at tremendous cost to densely packed neighborhoods, the valley offers open space, cheap land and workers eager to exchange backbreaking farm labor for a different kind of toil, indoors,” Rebecca writes.

Remember all those electric car chargers Volkswagen built as part of a legal settlement to make up for its emissions-cheating scheme? Customers say they work terribly. That’s according to this piece by the Washington Post’s Shannon Osaka, which notes that Volkswagen’s Electrify America fast-charging network ranked last in a recent customer satisfaction study.

The decline of intercity bus terminals is a slow-burning public transit crisis — and one I knew nothing about until I read this great story by CNN’s Nathaniel Meyersohn. Not only is it getting harder to travel across the U.S. by bus, noted journalism industry villain Alden Global Capital is partly to blame. The New York-based hedge fund — which has bought newspapers across the country and cut them to the bone — is purchasing bus terminals and selling them to real estate developers.

AROUND THE WEST

The weed killer paraquat is banned in 50 countries — but not California. Some people who have used it say they’re suffering from Parkinson’s disease as a result, and there’s lots of science suggesting they may be right, The Times’ Hayley Smith reports.

“People can also change. They can learn to live within the limits of the planet, to heed the warnings written in wood.” So write the Washington Post’s Sarah Kaplan, Bonnie Jo Mount, Emily Wright and Frank Hulley-Jones, in a gorgeous story focused on a scientist studying ancient Sonoran Desert tree rings in an effort to learn from the past what humanity’s future may hold.

After years of preparation, there are wolves on Colorado’s Western Slope again. The Colorado Sun’s Jason Blevins was there to watch their reintroduction by state wildlife officials. “The wolf loped through the snowy meadow into a copse of aspens, her fur blending with the browns, grays and whites of the remote corner of state land,” he wrote. “She turned for a moment to look back at the collection of about 45 people gathered around the crates before trotting into the forest.”

ONE MORE THING

I wrote last week about a lawsuit brought by several environmental groups seeking to overturn the California Public Utilities Commission’s decision to slash rooftop solar incentives. The state’s 1st District Court of Appeal released its ruling Wednesday, upholding the large cuts to solar incentives — despite some reservations from Presiding Justice Alison Tucher.

“The issue before the court today is, as the majority notes, not whether the Commission has chosen the best possible” method for compensating homes with rooftop solar panels, Tucher wrote in a concurring opinion, supporting the other two judges even as she wondered whether their ruling would lead to the best possible outcome. “Rather, we are asked simply to decide whether the Commission has chosen a course that complies with the law and is reasonably supported by the evidence.”

ACTUALLY, JUST ONE MORE

Donald Trump just might win the presidency next year. Former L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva is again running for higher office — he thinks he has a chance to dethrone L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn — instead of hiding in his man cave in La Habra Heights for the rest of his life like any other humiliated human would.

What’s next: Rick Caruso buys his suits at the Paramount Swap Meet? USC wins a national football championship? I’m calling those, as well as the following — and if any come true, be afraid, Southern California. Be very afraid.

*In-N-Out announces a new location on Neptune — not the avenue in Wilmington but the planet. Fans from California to Tennessee to whatever world Rob Schneider is from wait in a line that stretches to the Asteroid Belt, only to find out that In-N-Out is as overrated in the outer rungs of the solar system as it is on Earth.

*Councilmember Kevin de León gets more than 50% of the vote in the March primary, thereby winning his reelection bid outright and completing a political comeback few thought possible after his role in the 2022 City Hall leaked-tape scandal. At his victory party, De León vows to supporters that he’ll never, ever, pinky swear, cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die-stick-a-needle-in-my-eye run for higher office while councilmember — a promise he’s broken before. A day later, he announces write-in candidacies for president, U.S. Senate, Congress, his old Assembly district, L.A. County district attorney, L.A. County Superior Court judge and treasurer of the We Love L.A. Book Club that meets at the Eagle Rock Branch Library. De León loses each race.

*The Huntington Beach City Council — not content with its MAGA bona fides after dismantling the city’s human relations committee, prohibiting the pride flag from flying over City Hall, canceling Black History Month, and trying to keep away supposedly obscene books from library bookshelves — bans the ocean. The problem? Surf City’s waves are woke, because they’re blue like Democrats.

*Emboldened by the passage of his resolution to ban rodeos within L.A. city limits, Councilmember Bob Blumenfield drafts a new one seeking to stop all use of horses. Not only are people banned from riding on the animals, but say goodbye to plastic kiddie rides in front of supermarkets, Ford Mustangs and Pintos on the streets, Boise State Broncos games at the Coliseum and reruns of “Bojack Horseman” on Netflix.

*Right-wing media realizes that the most dangerous city in California isn’t San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Bernardino or even Santa Ana — it’s Irvine. Anyone who has tried telling a homeowner’s association that they want to paint their house eggshell white instead of vanilla white — or parked a car overnight that’s more than seven years old — will know exactly what I mean.

*Ron DeSantis, humiliated in the Republican presidential primaries, drops out of the race, resigns as governor of Florida and moves to California. Finding that the Golden State is not the hellhole he has spent most of his time in office demeaning, DeSantis announces his penance will be serving as Gavin Newsom’s personal footstool. Newsom graciously gives him a more dignified job: grape stomper at his vineyard, where his frenemy’s tantrums can be put to use.

*L.A. voters approve expanding the City Council from 15 seats to 27. The council then tasks AI to draw up boundaries for the new districts that will please everyone. AI does the digital equivalent of hanging a sign that says “Be Back Soon” and disappears forever, thereby saving humanity from the rise of the machines.

*Mayor Karen Bass invites Shohei Ohtani to tackle his new city’s traffic, homelessness, housing, crime and parking problems. Unable to pitch this year and with extra time on his hands, Shotime solves them all and still manages to hit .538 with 203 home runs in his first season as a Dodger.

*Meanwhile, Angels owner Arte Moreno finally decides to invest in young prospects after being burned too many times by past-their-prime free agents.

25,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Historic, ‘genuinely extraordinary’ rainfall in Ventura County stuns experts, causes flooding",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/timeline-when-will-worst-of-rains-hit-l-a-what-are-the-flood-risks,"Michael Ramirez, owner of the El Mirage barbershop, sweeps away water that flooded his business overnight in Port Hueneme.

Ventura County was inundated Thursday with what forecasters described as a once-in-a-millennium rainfall that stunned experts and brought flooding to roadways and homes in several communities.

Preliminary data suggest that Oxnard experienced one of the heaviest downpours ever seen in the area, with rainfall rates of 3 inches an hour sustained for over an hour.

That amounts to a month’s worth of rain in less than an hour, officials said.

“The frequency of this kind of event is on the order of once in every thousand years,” meteorologist Mike Wofford with the National Weather Service in Oxnard said of the storm. In addition to the deluge in Oxnard, more than 1.54 inches of rain fell on the Ventura Auto Center in 15 minutes.

Other experts agreed the downpour was one for the record books.

“This is likely the heaviest rainfall that has been observed in this area in recorded history and is likely a multi-centennial kind of event,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA, said during a briefing Thursday. “These are genuinely extraordinary torrential downpours and importantly, they’re continuing. This is not over yet.”

Fire officials in Ventura County reported that 911 dispatchers received more than 275 calls for help over a five-hour period as floodwaters rose in the coastal communities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard.

Bob Myers woke up around 1:45 a.m. to the sound of rushing water outside his home in the Hueneme Bay senior community.

“I thought some pipes had blown up or something,” he said. He checked his restroom but didn’t see anything. Then he looked out his back door and found water rushing into his home “like someone was standing there with a fire hose,” Myers said. When he looked out his window, he saw a lake of water.

Eventually, firefighters arrived to help Myers and his neighbors get out of their homes as the water began to recede.

“There is nothing livable left in my home,” Myers said Thursday as he sat in a Red Cross emergency shelter at Oxnard College. Between 3 and 4 feet of water had entered the home, pushing appliances and furniture around soaked walls.

Myers was at a loss about what his next steps will be.

“I am an unfortunate one. I have no family in this state. I have no family closer than the East Coast,” he said. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do.”

Before he retired, he said, he worked for a utilities company. His job was to respond to natural disasters and to help cut off the flow of gas.

He used to be on the other side of the equation, but now he’s one of the survivors of a natural disaster.

“But you don’t realize the full impact of what does it mean to lose your house, the bedroom your children grew up in, your documents, your pictures of your parents from 50, 60, 70 years ago that cannot be replaced because you didn’t experience it,” he said.

Mud and debris tumbled into roadways in Santa Barbara, closing at least one offramp on the 101 Freeway. Elsewhere, cars were surrounded by rushing water that appeared to be several feet deep.

UPDATE: The US 101 southbound off-ramp is closed at Garden Street in Santa Barbara. Video shows current conditions at Mission Street.

The amount of rain is akin to that which preceded devastating debris flows in Montecito in 2018, experts said, though that incident was also exacerbated by recent wildfires in the area.

Indeed, radar imagery shows powerful convective cells hovering over Santa Barbara, Ventura, Oxnard and Thousand Oaks that indicate torrential downpours with some lightning could persist for several more hours.

By midday, the storms were also beginning to develop a bit farther south, including portions of Los Angeles County, and were expected to crawl toward downtown L.A., the San Fernando Valley and coastal Orange County through the day.

Swain, the UCLA climate scientist, said the storm is a classic example of the kinds of extreme precipitation events that can be expected in a warming climate. The system arrived as federal officials confirmed that November was Earth’s hottest on record, and that 2023 is virtually certain to be the planet’s hottest year on record, due largely to El Niño and human-caused climate change.

“As the climate warms, we’re going to see heavier and heavier downpours, both in California and everywhere else,” Swain said, noting that the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water vapor increases exponentially with warming. “These are the kinds of rainfall rates that we can see these days.”

A flood watch is in effect across most of the region through late Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service.

Widespread flooding in the area is possible, and residents are advised to clear debris from rain gutters and waterways, use extra caution on roads and be prepared for possible power outages and downed trees, the NWS said.

The agency briefly issued tornado warnings for the Port Hueneme, Oxnard, El Rio, Saticoy and San Buenaventura areas just before 1:30 a.m. and again at 2:30 a.m., but there was no evidence a tornado had touched down, Wofford said. The agency issued multiple flash flood warnings just before 4 a.m. farther inland and special warnings for possible waterspouts and high winds near Point Mugu.

The tornado warnings were issued because meteorologists saw rotational winds on radar readings, Wofford said, and because it would be difficult to confirm what was developing in the sky that late at night.

Unlike other winter storms, the low-pressure system ambling its way along the coast is cut off from the Pacific jet stream and dropping torrential rains as it lingers in place.

“It’s not moving much, and it continues to send bands of rain into the area,” Wofford said. The storm was expected to hit Santa Barbara later in the day.

Officials in Ventura County urged people to be cautious after the storms. Emergency officials performed 12 swift water rescues, mainly for people trapped in submerged vehicles, Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andy VanSciver said.

Firefighters assisted 10 patients in flooded roadways, VanSciver said, but it’s unclear if there have been any injuries amid the rescues. About six to eight blocks of homes in the Hueneme Bay senior community were affected by floodwaters; emergency responders helped 20 people out of homes there. Some homes saw as much as 3 feet of water, VanSciver said, requiring emergency crews to use a heavy-duty medical vehicle to transport residents.

“The storm drains could not keep up with the rain,” VanSciver said.

Some of the homes in that area remain under an evacuation warning. An emergency shelter was established at the Oxnard College gymnasium, but other residents have been told to shelter in their homes while the floodwaters recede. Officials urged residents to stay home while roadways remain flooded on Thursday morning.

The overall effect from the rain is minimal, Santa Barbara County Fire spokesperson Scott Safechuck said. For nearly two days, it’s rained over Santa Barbara County and the storm is expected to linger through Friday.

But creeks and rivers in the area continue to flow and rescue crews have not been called to pull anyone out of the waters.

“In general the public is being very responsible to our warnings, when we tell them not to drive if you don’t have to and avoid flooded roadways,” Safechuck said.

County emergency responders have taken a proactive approach to torrential downpours ever since 2018, when a strong rainstorm caused a series of mud and debris flows to sweep over the community of Montecito. In total, 23 people died from the flow that left a 15-foot wall of mud and debris in its wake. Emergency officials maintain a steady line of communication with residents to ensure their safety.

“We’ve experienced heavy rains before. The Montecito debris flow was a devastating episode,” Safechuck said. “It’s something we think about every time it rains.”

The rain station at the remote Rocky Butte summit, about a mile east of Hearst Castle in San Luis Obispo County, received 15.72 inches of rain over a five-day period starting Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.

The station’s rain total is not indicative of the surrounding areas that saw far less rainfall total, NWS meteorologist Ryan Kittell said.

The rain station at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo received 3.78 inches over the same period, and a station in Atascadero recorded 4.09 inches .

The storm is expected to push its way toward Los Angeles County throughout Thursday and will bring heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms through Friday afternoon, according to the weather service. Forecasts show 1 to 3 inches of rain in the forecast for Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties, with 3 to 5 inches in the mountains and foothills.

Meanwhile, the National Weather Service in Las Vegas issued a flash flood watch for southern San Bernardino County and southwest Mohave County through Friday night. Meteorologists forecast three-quarters of an inch to 1.50 inches of rain for the region, warning drivers to avoid low-water crossings.

Rain showers were expected to increase overnight on Thursday in Orange and San Bernardino counties. Snow levels were expected to drop to 6,500 to 7,000 feet early Friday, with a winter advisory in effect for the mountain areas and instructions for drivers to take snow chains.

What is the forecast?

The National Weather Service said there was a moderate risk of flooding mostly in coastal Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties as well as the Santa Monica Mountains. There were also concerns about mountain ranges along the coast in Ventura and Santa Barbara.

Though this storm is massive, it will move slowly. And that could cause heavy rain, thunderstorms and flooding on roadways and creeks.

What will the next few days look like?

Thursday: Heavy showers, chance of thunderstorms in some areas.

Friday: Moderate showers.

Saturday: Light showers, with moderate rain in some inland valleys, giving way to partly cloudy skies and strong winds.

Sunday: Partly cloudy, giving way to slightly warmer temperatures and sun.

Monday: (Christmas Day): Slightly warmer.

What conditions are expected?

The weather service issued a special marine weather warning for the Central Coast on Wednesday morning due to the potential for waterspouts and strong winds. There was a slight chance that the conditions would produce cause a tornado or waterspout between Point Conception in Santa Barbara County and Los Angeles County, according to the forecast.

A flood watch in in effect for most of Southern California. Residents in San Luis Obispo, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties should be on the lookout for debris flows, flash flooding, general flooding and overflowing rivers, the weather service said.

Areas along the Santa Ynez and Santa Monica coastal ranges could see rainfall rates of an inch an hour Wednesday and Thursday from isolated thunderstorms. Other areas could expect to see 0.30 to 0.60 of an inch of rain per hour.

The storm could dump 2 to 5 inches of rain in coastal areas and up to 12 inches in coastal mountains.

What does the weather service advise?

The storm is expected to bring flooding for most of the region through Thursday, according to the weather service, which cautioned drivers to avoid roads that appear to be underwater.

“Rain may be locally heavy at times, and numerous floods are likely,” the weather service said in its social media channels. “Flash and urban flooding are expected, and debris/mud flows will be possible. Turn around, don’t drown!”"
26,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Pro-Palestinian UC students feel they are not supported. Some on the faculty are organizing to change that,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-21/uc-faculty-launch-unprecedented-organizing-drive-to-aid-campus-supporters-of-palestinians,"University of California faculty members across the system have launched an unprecedented organizing effort to defend campus advocates for Palestinian rights who feel unsupported after reporting widespread harassment and threats triggered by the Israel-Hamas war.

The effort to form Faculty for Justice in Palestine groups is part of a national movement that has taken off at nine of the 10 UC campuses, along with Princeton, New York University and Rutgers, among others. Faculty organizers said they were propelled to act by what many described as a singularly dangerous time for academic freedom and free speech, with the lives, careers and safety of campus Palestinian supporters on the line.

“I feel we’re at an inflection point,” said Ananya Roy, a UCLA professor of urban studies, social welfare and geography who is helping lead efforts at her campus to form a Faculty for Justice in Palestine group. “Folks are so alarmed by the calls for repression that we suddenly are seeing a real sense of urgency to have these formations in place.”

The organizing effort comes as Israel supporters said Jewish students on campuses across the nation have been subjected to hostile rhetoric against them and have experienced acts of escalating antisemitism. Many Israel supporters criticize the Students for Justice in Palestine campus group for what they regard as threatening actions. The student organization was recently suspended until the end of fall term by Columbia University for violating school policy leading to an “unauthorized event” that included “threatening rhetoric and intimidation,” according to a campus statement.

Yet faculty organizers say Palestinian supporters — whose large numbers on campuses nationwide are fueling robust activism — need the help to counterbalance better funded and organized pro-Israel campus groups that provide safe spaces. They say longstanding organizations, such as Hillel, and Israel studies centers, can swiftly mobilize to support Jewish students, along with a network of outside Israel defense groups that closely monitor perceived acts of antisemitism and move to combat them.

The result, argued Saree Makdisi, a UCLA English professor, is stronger blowback against pro-Palestinian students and faculty members — losing jobs or getting doxxed on such online blacklists as Canary Mission — than their pro-Israel peers.

At UCLA, junior faculty members have reported being criticized by senior members for including Palestinian voices in their course materials. One student said she burst into tears after feeling shut down in a class for defending Palestinian rights. An “emergency teach-in” on the crisis in the Gaza Strip led by Makdisi and other Palestinian supporters was moved online due to safety concerns. But students who gathered in a campus hallway to watch said they were verbally assaulted by young men who accosted them, screamed that they were terrorists and threw their laptops in a trash can. And a UCLA professor drew widespread criticism over reports that she required students to attend the teach-in — rumors that turned out to be false, according to a campus statement.

Makdisi and others say they hope that collective organizing — especially by faculty members with the privileges and protection of tenure — will strengthen their ability to protect vulnerable students and colleagues, expand teaching about the conflict and demand equal treatment for their concerns from campus leaders. Already, their voices have ramped up intense back-and-forth debate on campus and amplified their demands to the university administration.

Judea Pearl, a UCLA computer science professor who has led pro-Israel activism on campus, said he “of course” had no objection to the faculty forming support groups for Palestinian supporters. He said pro-Israel campus members also formed a support group last week, the UCLA Jewish Faculty Resilience Group of faculty and staff members, students and alumni to “counter rising Jew-hatred on campus and in the UC system, support Jewish students and faculty, and promote Western democratic values.”

He added, however, that “being ‘pro-Palestinians’ does not justify being anti-Israel or pro-Hamas” — calling the militant group’s ideology a “moral abomination.”

Colleges and universities nationwide have erupted in acrimony and tension since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war. On Oct. 7, Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostage, according to the Israeli government. Israel’s bombardment and ground war in Hamas-ruled Gaza has killed almost 20,000 people, according to health authorities in the Palestinian territory, and set off a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The United Nations estimates the war has displaced nearly 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents.

As the war intensified, a U.S.-based Palestinian support network that advocates nonviolent academic and cultural boycotts of Israel issued a call for campuses to form Faculty for Justice in Palestine groups. Three universities had already established such groups, including UC Davis and the University of Hawaii. The war fallout rapidly accelerated the movement. So far, more than 65 chapters have started up or are forming, a network representative said.

The campus climate is particularly fraught at UCLA. Supporters of Israel and Palestinians have faced-off in dueling rallies and faculty groups aligned with each side have pummeled Chancellor Gene Block and senior leadership with letters demanding action to calm the campus climate.

More than 350 faculty supporters of Israel have signed a letter urging Block to denounce any campus celebrations of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and hold “accountable” student groups and community members who cross the line from free speech to “incitement.” The letter said explicit calls for violence should trigger a campus response. As an example, the letter cited event advertisements featuring weapons and rally chants of “intifada,” an Arabic word that in the Palestinian context means uprising or rebellion against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.

Roy, of the Faculty for Justice in Palestine group, said that letter represented a “chilling moment of repression” that was endorsed by some influential department leaders with the power to short-circuit the future of students and untenured faculty who don’t agree with it. In their own counter-letter to Block, Roy and more than 280 faculty members said the pro-Israel demands were “so broad and overreaching as to make any activity — including teaching and research that supports even the most basic Palestinian human rights — punishable.”

“Such a stance is entirely against the mission of a public university, which is to protect critical education, pedagogy, and knowledge production guided by fidelity to truth, intellectual and methodological rigor, and a commitment to centering the experiences and narratives of all communities who bear the material impacts of systemic violence and oppression,” the letter said.

Pearl, who spearheaded the pro-Israel letter, dismissed such concerns. He said he was not aiming to quash speech, but believed Block should denounce any support for violence — a demand reiterated by the new Jewish support group. Pearl also said allegations of bias against Muslims and Arabs were overblown, saying criticism of them is immediately attacked as Islamophobia and racism.

“Who denies anyone the right to declare solidarity with Palestinians? No one!” Pearl said.

UCLA declined to respond to questions from The Times about whether Block and senior leadership regarded chants of “intifada” and other pro-Palestinian slogans as incitement that should trigger campus action.

In a letter to Pearl and other faculty signers, Block said “the speech and expression we have seen thus far does not meet the First Amendment standard for incitement.” He reiterated that “discrimination, threats, violence and hate have absolutely no place in a university community dedicated to open-mindedness, respect and mutual understanding.”

To ease safety concerns, UCLA spokesman Ricardo Vazquez said campus police were conducting additional patrols and had “added security resources.” Police and student affairs monitors were dispatched to events “to defuse possible tensions while protecting participants’ right to speak,” he said.

Vazquez encouraged campus members to report allegations of crimes to UC campus police and unlawful harassment or discrimination to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Civil Rights Office.

But some students said they were hesitant to report incidents because they don’t trust UC administration.

One UCLA student, who asked to be identified only by his first name Mohammad for fear of retaliation, said he has been spit on in his face and called a terrorist while wearing his kaffiyeh checked scarf. A friend was pepper-sprayed near the campus sculpture garden by an assailant who quickly ran away, Mohammad said, and another student was jumped by two young men, suffering a wrist fracture, while walking from campus residences. Mohammad said the incidents have not yet been reported to campus authorities but students planned to do so after compiling more reports.

The constant tension has led him to lose sleep, take up smoking for the first time and neglect his diet. He worries about getting doxxed so makes sure to encrypt his messages, hide his meeting sites and shield the identities of his fellow activists. Yet he pushes on with protest rallies, “die-ins” to portray Palestinian deaths and other visible advocacy.

“I’ve never been in this place of this stress before,” Mohammad said. “But we’re trying to take up visual space and make sure that faculty and the student body are all aware that the student presence on campus advocating for Palestinian solidarity is strong and unrelenting.”

Nationwide, complaints of harassment on both sides have skyrocketed in the last few months.

Palestine Legal, a Chicago-based nonprofit, has seen a tenfold increase in campus requests for help since the Israel-Hamas war began. The organization, which provides legal assistance in support of the Palestinian solidarity movement, received 449 requests for aid between Oct. 7 and Dec. 13 this year, compared with 40 requests last year.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, received 2,171 complaints of bias between Oct. 7 and Dec. 2, a 172% increase over the same period last year. First Amendment issues made up the largest category. The organization’s Greater Los Angeles office received 124 complaints of bias or requests for help specifically related to Palestinians or the violence in Gaza from Oct. 7 to Nov. 30.

Jewish students and faculty members also have experienced rising harassment. The Anti-Defamation League reported last week that it recorded 400 antisemitic incidents on college and university campuses between Oct. 7 and Dec. 7, compared with 33 during the same period in 2022. The ADL included campus rallies in the count, saying they involved “antisemitic rhetoric, expressions of support for terrorism against the state of Israel and/or anti-Zionism.”

Nour Joudah, a UCLA assistant professor of Asian American studies, said she is joining Faculty for Justice in Palestine to support students on campus experiencing harassment while they organize for a cease-fire and push its demand that UC not conflate criticism of Israel with antisemitism.

Joudah — who said she has lost more than 50 members of her extended family as a result of the Israeli bombardment — said she also hoped the group would influence UC leaders to speak out more even-handedly by decrying the mounting civilian deaths of Palestinians as they recognized the Israeli victims of the Hamas attack.

“I hesitate to center my emotions, and yet it’s undeniable that the actions of the UC administration both at UCLA and statewide have made me feel for the first time just how little value my life and the lives of my family hold in their eyes,” Joudah said.

UCLA declined to respond to questions over the perception that its statements were one-sided, whether criticism of Israel was antisemitic and why it had not publicly commented on the rising Palestinian deaths.

Vazquez said UCLA staff have been meeting with affected student groups and individuals to support their needs, provide resources, offer counseling and work with those who need academic accommodations.

Campus administrators, he added, have met with affected faculty members to discuss their concerns and issued a statement reiterating that personal views about the conflict should not influence the academic reviews of their peers. Makdisi said they have pledged to form a task force to address bias and harassment against Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs, which he viewed as an important step.

UCLA is developing other new initiatives to address antisemitism, Islamophobia and anti-Arab hate and would share them with the community soon, Vazquez said. UC President Michael Drake recently announced new UC systemwide actions focused on campus safety, civil rights, mental health, community education and employee training.

At UC Berkeley, the Faculty for Justice in Palestine group, along with several other campus organizations, last week pledged to expand teaching about “Palestinian history, arts and culture within the context of settler colonialism, anti-colonial struggles and decolonization.” The groups also said they would continue to support boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel — targeting related UC investments — and “fight fear and silencing” at the university globally known for free speech, academic freedom and social justice.

UC Merced’s pro-Palestinian faculty organizers hope to bring balance to UC’s “strongly pro-Zionist” stance on the conflict, among other goals, said Sean Malloy, professor of history and critical race and ethnic studies.

UC Santa Cruz’s new faculty group said it wanted to support Students for Justice in Palestine. The UC faculty members also said they would make space to discuss Palestinian issues in their classrooms, host events and act as liaisons for students experiencing harassment because they are perceived as Arab, Muslim, and/or pro-Palestinian.

At UC Riverside, faculty members involved in creating a Faculty for Justice in Palestine chapter hope to unify to create a stronger front against UC administrative power, said Dylan Rodriguez, a professor of media and cultural studies.

Sherene Razack, a UCLA professor of gender studies, said safety and strength in numbers can help Palestinian supporters avoid being targeted for possible retaliation. “It is really clear that the only thing one can do is organize collectively,” Razack said."

According to the National Weather Service website, the “earliest record” of snow on Christmas Day in Dallas was in 1841, when “soldiers were tracking a bear in 6 inches of snow,” but the source of that report is unclear.

While 2023 isn’t likely to bring snow to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, here is a look back at the history of snow on Christmas in the region through The Dallas Morning News’ archival material and information from the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. This list does not include instances of snow before or after Christmas Day.

‘Gloomy’ with snow in 1914

A “trace” of snow was reported Dec. 25, 1914, in Dallas and in Fort Worth, with some mix of rain and snow, along with “a few flurries,” according to the weather service.

Advertisement

A newspaper clip from Dec. 26, 1914, described how some in the city anticipated “the rare experience of a white Christmas,” but noted how the “snowstorm did not continue long” on Christmas Day.

“It was as if a sportive Canadian cloud had wandered from bounds and suddenly recalled itself, making the damp, chill, cloudy weather that followed all the more gloomy by contrast,” the article read.

Half-foot of snow in 1926

According to a clip from The News in 1926, Dallas residents finally got a picturesque snow day on Christmas. A photo from the clip read the following: “Adults turned children Saturday to take occasion of Dallas’ big Christmas snow. At the upper left is a snowball fight, to the upper right, a young man taking a snapshot of his girlfriend, who is holding up a huge bunch of snow as a bouquet. At the bottom, left, a small boy is telling his mother how to complete the snowman, while to the right is a view of one of the small streams in Highland Park Christmas morning.”

Six inches of snow were reported in Dallas and Collin counties, according to the National Weather Service. In Dallas, 6.3 inches of snow reportedly fell on Christmas Day .

“Much of the snow was gone by the afternoon of Christmas day,” the NWS website notes.

Snow goes unnoticed by many in 1975

A Dec. 26, 1975, article in The News with the headline, “Most miss Christmas snow in area” described how many residents in the city were “too snugly nestled in their beds to notice” the first white Christmas in nearly five decades.

“However, the flakes melted as they fell and there was no accumulation,” the article read.

The weather service website noted “much of the snow” in the Dallas-Fort Worth area melted before hitting the ground, but also stated “flurries were reported at DFW Airport,” and less than an inch of snow accumulated at the airport.

White, ‘treacherous’ Christmas in 2012

On Dec. 25, 2012, a “strong upper level system and a cold front” brought hail to Dallas-Fort Worth and a “winter weather event that included snow and sleet,” according to NWS Fort Worth.

“The greatest concentration of heavy snow was in western Denton County and Collin County where 4 to 6 inches of snow fell,” the NWS Fort Worth website states.

A Dec. 26 article in The News headlined, “White Christmas, but treacherous, too,” described how “steadily falling snow” in the region “made for dangerously slick conditions.” A report in The News the following day described how “some 1,000 travelers were stranded Christmas night” at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport after winter storms caused more than 400 flight cancellations.

Despite some of the dangerous road conditions caused by the snow that year, photos also showed residents in North Texans enjoying the snowy Christmas Day.

29,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Frisco expands creek monitoring program,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/12/21/frisco-expands-creek-monitoring-program/,"Frisco is expanding its remote monitoring program for its six major creeks that will allow staff to check water quality and potential flooding with the click of a mouse.

Staff is notified via email when it detects a pollutant so they can quickly send someone onsite to address the situation.

Dana Baird, communications director, said the technology has been used since the spring of 2020. Now, three new monitoring stations will be online by the end of the year.

The remote stormwater gauge stations, which cost $45,000 each, were paid for with stormwater fees. The stations have been great for the city, saving time and providing more accurate information.

“Frisco is essentially built around a lot of our creeks. They’re amenities to a lot of our residents and our communities,” Sean Aucoin, hydrologist for the city of Frisco, said via a Progress in Motion video. “So preserving and protecting these areas are vital.”

Currently, Frisco Public Works stormwater division monitors water quality in three of the city’s creeks — Stewart Creek at Legacy Drive, which is in the south part of the city; Cottonwood Branch at Legacy Drive in the city’s mid-section; and Panther Creek at Teel Parkway in the north.

Three additional stream monitoring stations are planned, with the focus on watersheds at Rowlett Creek, West Rowlett Creek and another section of Stewart Creek.

“The main brains behind this is actually a sonde,” Aucoin said.

Sondes are devices commonly used to monitor water quality, track changes in water chemistry and detect contaminants.

Before these stations were installed, Public Works employees would physically go out and check the water quality. Now they do both, checking onsite and using remote monitoring as a supplement.

In addition to checking for pollutants, each station has a rain gauge. Frisco’s Emergency Operations Center can see the same information as Public Works, which is helpful during flash flooding events.

“It also looks at the stage level so we can look at how deep the water is and basically how much rainfall has occurred within this area,” Aucoin said.

Advertisement

The new stations will also have cameras.

“The more data the better, right?” Aucoin said. “We get better information, better input info and better output info. So the return on investment has been spectacular because being able to remotely assess the streams has saved us a significant amount of time.”

Frisco Mayor Jeff Cheney said with the city’s culture of innovation, department staff are highly encouraged to take a look at how emerging technologies can make improvements.

“These are really smart applications that can make us smarter as a city, make us more effective and a safer community,” Cheney said."
30,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Texas AG Ken Paxton seeks gender-affirming care records from Seattle Hospital,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2023/12/21/paxton-seeks-gender-affirming-care-records-from-seattle-hospital/,"The Texas Attorney General’s office is trying to compel a Seattle hospital to hand over information about gender-affirming care patients from Texas may have received there, according to a lawsuit filed by the hospital this month.

The lawsuit, filed in Travis County District Court, said it is seeking to protect patient information of Texans who left their home state, where it’s illegal for minors to access gender-affirming care, to seek medically necessary treatment in Washington state, where it is legal. In the complaint, the Seattle hospital argues Texas authorities don’t have jurisdiction over these Washington patient records, and calls the requests “sham” and “improper.”

“There is no doubt the Attorney General is granted broad investigative powers under Texas law,” the lawsuit says. “But those powers are not unlimited. ... Gender-affirming care is legal in Washington.”

Seattle Children’s filed the suit after the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton served the hospital with a civil investigative demand in late November, according to the complaint. The request sought information about patients from Texas who had received gender-affirming care services from Seattle Children’s, including details related to diagnoses, medications prescribed, laboratory testing and other treatment protocols.

Advertisement

Paxton’s office also asked for the number of Texas children treated at the hospital and for guidance on how to “wean” a child off gender care.

According to the lawsuit, Paxton’s office told Seattle Children’s it was investigating potential violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which aims to protect consumers by preventing general misrepresentations of practices. In this case, the attorney general’s office said it was looking into misrepresentations related to “gender transitioning and reassignment treatments.”

The November letter also cited Texas law, referring to a new law that went into effect in September that prohibits minors from accessing gender-affirming medication and surgical interventions.

“Seattle Children’s took legal action to protect private patient information related to gender-affirming care services at our organization sought by the Texas Attorney General,” a hospital spokesperson said in a statement. “Seattle Children’s complies with the law for all health care services provided.”

The hospital on Thursday declined to comment further on ongoing litigation, but Seattle Children’s attorneys argued in the complaint that the Texas demands represent an “unconstitutional attempt to investigate and chill potential interstate commerce and travel for Texas residents seeking care in another state.”

They also said that if they complied with the data request, they would be violating federal health privacy laws and Washington state’s shield law. The shield law, approved earlier this year, prohibits local cooperation with out-of-state efforts to pursue criminal and civil cases related to reproductive health and gender-affirming care.

Advertisement

The law protects Washington-based businesses or organizations, like Seattle Children’s, from having to respond to “any [gender care-related] investigation by a ban state,” or a state that restricts access to gender-affirming care, the complaint says.

The law also prohibits state businesses from complying with subpoenas, warrants and other court orders related to health care that is legal in Washington.

Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Advertisement

A spokesperson for Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson’s office, which supported passage of the state’s shield law and has been vocal about protecting access to both reproductive health and gender-affirming care, did not comment on the lawsuit except to say their office was aware of it and was “closely monitoring.”

The hospital, which does not provide any gender-affirming care in Texas nor does it advertise gender-affirming services there, asked the court to “set aside” the patient data request — or modify the request and grant the hospital an extension to comply.

Seattle Children’s has provided gender-affirming mental, medical and some surgical care out of its gender clinic for more than five years. The state is not publicly tracking the number of out-of-state patients seeking some type of care that remains legal in Washington, but some local gender-affirming care providers have noticed increases in recent months.

The graphic bodycam footage is included in a video posted by the Mesquite Police Department on the City of Mesquite’s YouTube page. Warning to viewers: The video includes the officer firing the fatal shots.

About 3 a.m. Dec. 14, police said a stolen silver Hyundai sedan passed an officer on routine patrol near Cartwright and Edwards Church roads in the southeastern part of the city. The Hyundai was being followed by a Chrysler sedan.

Both cars then parked at gas pumps at a nearby 7-Eleven. Minutes later, police said a caller reported their Hyundai sedan had just been stolen from their residence near Clay Mathis Drive and Edwards Church Road.

Surveillance video from the gas station shows the driver of the Hyundai go inside the 7-Eleven with one of the Chrysler’s passengers.

While the two men were inside, footage shows the officer drive into the parking lot, get out of his patrol car, and walk up to the Hyundai with his flashlight in his left hand and gun raised in his right. Police said the car was empty.

The officer then walked over to the Chrysler as the two men left the convenience store and began walking toward the car. The officer repeatedly yelled at the suspects to get on the ground, and the footage shows one of them raise his hands in the air before they both ran through the parking lot, out of the frame.

The officer shared descriptions of the men to incoming officers before he ordered the driver of the Chrysler, identified as 19-year-old Payton Lawrence, to turn off the vehicle and stop moving it, police allege. Three people were with Lawrence in the Chrysler at the time.

“Do not move or I will f---ing kill you, do you understand me?” the officer barked at Lawrence.

The officer told Lawrence to stay at the pump and shut the car off while providing information to dispatch. As he was doing so, Lawrence placed the car in reverse and began to back out, away from the pump.

As the car moved, the officer banged the hood and yelled, “Shut the car off now.” He repeated the command at least four times.

Police said Lawrence stopped and pulled forward slightly before reversing again further away from the pump. The officer pointed his gun at him while yelling at him to stop.

Advertisement

As the car moved forward, the officer fired three shots into the front windshield with a 9 mm handgun, according to the bodycam footage. The car continued to roll forward while the officer reported, “Shots fired” into his radio.

The officer opened the front passenger door and pointed his firearm at Lawrence, telling him to not move. The officer then opened the back passenger seat door and yelled at the men in the backseat to not move. One of the men raised his hands in the air, the footage shows.

“Chill bro, chill our hands up, chill,” one passenger told the officer.

The car then rolled forward before traveling over a curb, coming to a halt in a grassy area, according to the footage. The officer then removed Lawrence from the vehicle and “performed life-saving measures,” police said. The department did not include any additional details about what medical treatment Lawrence received.

Two other people inside the Chrysler were questioned and released. The third, 19-year-old Kevon Moore of Dallas, was arrested on outstanding warrants. It was unclear, according to Mesquite jail records, what charges Moore was detained on.

Authorities were unable to find the two men who fled.

Four firearms were found inside the Chrysler, police said, including an AR-style pistol.

Citing the ongoing investigation, the department declined to release the officer’s name, but police said he has been with the department for 17 years.

After the department’s investigation is complete, it will be referred to the Dallas County district attorney’s office for review, police said. The office sent its own investigators to the scene as well to conduct an independent investigation.

According to police, its internal affairs unit will also conduct an investigation to determine whether the officer’s actions and use of deadly force followed department policy and procedures."

Although the Tuition Equalization Grant program has been in existence for more than half a century, it’s not well-known.

Advertisement

In last month’s fierce Texas House debate of a voucherlike proposal by Gov. Greg Abbott, supporters said “education savings accounts” or ESAs, which would publicly fund private school for certain K-12 students, were nothing new.

“Stop lying to people about whether or not we can use tax dollars for private education,” said Tyler Republican Rep. Matt Schaefer, an ESA proponent. “We’ve been doing it for decades.”

In the Tuition Equalization Grant program, state taxes already go to private education institutions, even religious ones, Schaefer said.

Advertisement

Voucher opponents noted that K-12 education is compulsory, and the Texas Constitution requires the Legislature to create a system that provides it for free. Going to college is voluntary — and generally a lot more expensive — they noted.

From the House chamber’s back mic, Abilene GOP Rep. Stan Lambert told Schaefer that the 1971 Legislature created the grants for financially strapped students attending private colleges and universities to help save money for taxpayers.

Demographic bulge

A large demographic bulge — the Baby Boom generation — was moving into higher education, Lambert recounted. Building new dorms and classroom buildings at state universities would cost a lot more than using financial aid to nudge more people to apply for a growing number of unfilled slots at private colleges, he said.

Advertisement

“I’m just asking you to realize that the decision made in the ’70s was a cost decision [for] the state of Texas because it would cost three or four times as much money to put a student in a public university than it would a private college,” said Lambert, who joined 83 other House members in stripping ESAs from an ultimately unsuccessful teacher pay and school funding bill.

Advertisement

The grants helping low- and moderate-income students afford private college don’t have to be repaid.

A tuition equalization grant isn’t an entitlement. The Legislature has capped funding at $99 million a year, which has limited how many students the program can serve — a maximum of about 29,000.

Advertisement

Grants are overseen by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board but awarded by the private colleges and universities, explained Elizabeth Puthoff, president of the Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas. Its 40 members are accredited institutions — a requirement for eligibility.

The coordinating board estimates the total financial need on a private campus and then allots a proportionate slice of the state’s total appropriation to each participating institution, Puthoff said in an interview.

“Each institution has their own awarding philosophy,” she said. “Do they want to give fewer students larger grants or more students smaller grants?”

The Legislature funds only about 55% of the estimated need for the grants, Puthoff said.

Advertisement

Former Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes, who backed the 1971 legislation that created the Tuition Equalization Grant program, said Lambert accurately described policymakers’ motive — economy.

“It was solely sold to the Legislature … based on the fact that we were going to be able to take advantage of these vacancies at TCU and SMU and Howard Payne and Hardin-Simmons, Abilene Christian College and McMurry and Southwestern University and all of these private schools,” Barnes said in an interview.

He referred to Texas Christian University and Southern Methodist University, each of which usually has had about 1,000-1,300 students annually receiving the grants during the program’s 52-year history.

Advertisement

Baylor University in Waco has been the biggest beneficiary, with between 2,500 and 3,000 students a year receiving the grants for decades.

In the state’s fiscal 2022, the latest for which data is available, Dallas Baptist University had 726 recipients; Texas Wesleyan University in Fort Worth, 712; University of Dallas, 387; and Paul Quinn College, 200.

Barnes, a Democrat, said he found it “rather amusing” the Tuition Equalization Grant program “came up as part of the debate on vouchers because it didn’t have any of the same similar purposes at all.”

Decrease in first-year enrollments

A 1968 report by the Liaison Committee on Texas Private Colleges and Universities, which included the presidents of SMU, Baylor and Rice University, bemoaned a 9% decrease in first-year enrollments in private accredited schools in Texas the previous two years.

Advertisement

The private-sector colleges in the state, then educating about 70,000 students, easily could accommodate 12,500 more “and save hundreds of millions of dollars annually for Texas taxpayers,” the report said.

At the time, some skeptics, such as James Dunn of Texas Baptists’ Christian Life Commission, raised concerns about whether giving money for students to attend religious schools violated the Texas Constitution’s ban on state funds’ being used “for the benefit of any sect or religious society, theological or religious seminary.”

The program bans grants for ministerial students. In its early years, participating institutions had to vouch that they didn’t condition employment of professors and staff on subscribing to a set of doctrinal beliefs.

Advertisement

Another requirement from the program’s inception has been that private-college students receiving athletic scholarships can’t apply for tuition equalization grants.

Recipients must meet the same “satisfactory academic progress” requirements as do state university students receiving TEXAS Grants, the state’s main financial aid program, said Puthoff of the Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas.

That includes maintaining a minimum 2.5 grade-point average.

In fiscal 2022, the average amount disbursed was $3,639, according to the coordinating board.

Advertisement

Also that year, 37% of recipients were Hispanic; 34%, white; 15%, African American; 5%, Asian; and 8%, of other or unknown race and ethnicity.

This year, the maximum award — $3,873 — is pegged to 50% of the estimated state subsidy to students attending public institutions of higher education. Students demonstrating exceptional financial need can get 150% of the maximum grant, or up to $5,810 a year.

Barnes, who was lieutenant governor from 1969 to 1973, said he considers the program a success.

No one’s trying to repeal it, he noted.

“We carefully looked at what the cost of building new classrooms was plus the cost of the land on public university campuses, and it was not even close,” Barnes said. “It made all the economic sense in the world for us to take advantage of this classroom space.”

In a released statement, the city manager’s office wrote that nobody proved state law was violated.

In a note to the entire department, Chief Gary L. Tittle wrote that he and the department want to “put this issue behind us as we move onward.”

Here are the 2023 inductees:

1. ARMIN MIZANI

Armin Mizani is the mayor of Keller. He led the removal of Tarrant County Chief Appraiser Jeff Law. (City of Keller)

Removing a county appraisal district’s chief appraiser is as difficult, as the Texas expression goes, as finding a horse thief in heaven. Yet Keller Mayor Armin Mizani answered my decadelong prayer that some public official would lead the ouster of the man whom, in my opinion, was the worst big county chief appraiser, Tarrant County’s Jeff Law.

Law was incompetent year after year. His computer system didn’t work. He was dishonest in his explanations. It was never ending with this dude.

The mayor will try to share the credit with other officials who helped him pull off this very difficult feat, as he did when I complimented him. But don’t let his humility fool you. It never would have happened without his intercession. People talked about removing Law for years, but without help of top leaders, it was too difficult.

2. DORA OVERTON

The Forest Hill widow was the last holdout on the Texas Department of Transportation’s Interstate 20 expansion project. She argued that she wasn’t able to sell her property to the state for an amount that would help her move to a comparable house. She was under a lot of pressure, but she didn’t fold.

Well, there’s good news. Her settlement offer was increased by $35,000, her pro bono lawyer, Michelle Jones of Denton, told me.

3. JENNIFER OLSON

Jennifer Olson is inducted because she is the rare local government gadfly who doesn’t care who gets ticked at her. The Trophy Club woman forges ahead.

She raised questions about the town’s extensive video surveillance system. She managed an extremely rare write-in campaign to elect Mayor Jeannette Tifany, whose name wasn’t even on the ballot.

Now she serves on the town’s Ethics Review Commission, which is charged with enforcing ethics for elected officers, appointed board, committee and commission members and town employees.

4. JENNIFER THOMPSON

Former Godley Councilwoman Jennifer Thompson is photographed outside of Godley City Hall. She was arrested on the city hall steps and charged with a fake charge (tampering with city council agenda items) to keep her from attending the council meeting. She was strip searched and kept in jail for almost 24 hours. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)

The former Godley city council member was thrown in jail minutes before a council meeting. The reason? Mayor Acy McGehee didn’t want her to vote against some of his measures. After I wrote about this, the mayor resigned.

Thompson filed a federal lawsuit charging that her civil rights were violated, and she was the victim of government repression that involved the small town’s police force, too.

As part of the incident, Thompson pleaded no contest to a charge brought by the Texas Attorney General’s office that she originally didn’t disclose that she had a felony conviction some 20 years ago involving misuse of gift cards. She said she thought the charge was erased from her record.

Her lawyer, Ana Jordan of Dallas, says she remains traumatized. “She is very brave. She’s facing a lot of resistance from very powerful people, and she continues down the path. She knows what she’s doing is right. She’s very inspiring.”

5. KELSO KING

Kelso King has monitored PUC and ERCOT meetings for 20 years. (Kelso King)

Kelso King is an Austin resident who monitors every Public Utility Commission meeting and every board meeting of ERCOT (operator of the state’s fragile electricity grid) and then writes an extensive report for his subscribers who pay $150 per quarter. Amazingly, he’s done this for 20 years.

“It’s in my blood,” he says.

He worked for the PUC in the 1980s and then worked at the attorney general’s consumer protection division for 10 years, representing state agencies before the PUC. His company is called King Energy Consulting. He doesn’t have a website but gave me permission to share his email address: kelsoking@aol.com.

6. SEAN BECKER

Becker Roofing and Exteriors owner Sean Becker wrote a book, Roofs That Last, that helps property owners avoid being hurt. He even makes his crews sign “roofer ethics statements.” (Tom Fox / Staff Photographer)

The Keller roofer has committed himself and his company, Becker Roofing & Exteriors, to promote honesty and transparency in a troubled, unregulated industry.

He wrote an excellent book called Roofs That Last. He has a “club” that, for a small fee, schedules an annual roof inspection. He requires his subcontractors to sign off on an “Ethical Agreements” form before they work for him.

He strikes me as a much-needed role model for an industry loaded with honest players but also untrustworthy individuals who take the money and run. In Texas, that happens every day.

7. EDGAR DWORSKY

Edgar Dworsky of Massachusetts is nicknamed MrConsumer. He hosts ConsumerWorld.org and mouseprint.org and is a retired lawyer and one of the nation’s foremost experts on companies that try to fool grocery customers in various ways. His specialty is deceptive packaging; the box looks bigger, but there’s less product inside. That’s called shrinkflation. His favorite toy as a child was a cardboard supermarket. I asked him to dig up a photo of the toy from the 1950s. He sent me one. What a charming origin story.

We met Hernandez in a recent Watchdog story showing how he won a half-million-dollar jury verdict against Southern Solar of Colleyville.

Do you realize how rare this is?

The jury believed that the company had violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

If more civil lawsuits like this were to occur, we could start cleaning up what I call “The Lone Scam State.”

(David Lieber)

9. ELLIE BREED

Ellie Breed is spokesperson for the Public Utility Commission, (Ellie Breed)

I saved the big surprise for the end. If there’s a Texas journalist who excoriated the (p)UC — Public Utility Commission, but I took away the ‘P’ because it doesn’t answer to the public — more than I, I’ve yet to meet her or him. But I don’t know if anyone has noticed in the past year that ERCOT has drawn more negative attention than the (p)UC.

I suggest that it has something to do with the hiring this year of Ellie Breed, the PUC’s spokesperson. She is receptive to inquiries and goes above and beyond when it comes to getting answers.

Advertisement

Compared to some previous (p)UC PR people, it’s a dramatic change. One spokesperson before her told his bosses in open records I obtained, that I was “an unprincipled, self-promoting huckster.” History has shown that’s an apt description of the (p)UC. He also concocted a story that my “prank-style antics [could] culminate in footage of him being dragged from our hearing room by a state trooper.”

Anyway, the bar for this state job is low, but Breed, whom I’ve never met personally, is a pro making a difference.

35,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Another round of rain this weekend,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2023/12/21/another-round-of-rain-this-weekend/,"Thursday has been delightfully wet since we need the rain. The rain will continue through the evening before diminishing overnight.

Friday will begin with spotty showers early, but dry by mid morning. There will be a bit of afternoon sunshine. However, more rain is on the way for the weekend.

“The first year after you lose someone is usually the hardest, especially around Christmastime,” Strasner said. “A lot of times, people that are new in their grief … the last thing they want to do is go to a Christmas party and put on a fake smile.”

She was grateful to find a different way to mark the holiday that year in the “Blue Christmas” service at Highland Park United Methodist Church.

Churches across the D-FW area hold Blue Christmas services to support those experiencing grief, loss or other hardships during the holidays. Also called “Longest Night Service,” it’s usually held around the winter solstice, which typically falls on Dec. 21 or 22.

Many Blue Christmas services omit hymn-singing, instead featuring acoustic guitar, harp or simple chants repeated in unison. Many also include a candle-lighting ritual in honor of lost loved ones or as a reminder of hope amid suffering. The UMC’s North and Central Texas Conferences put together a list of United Methodist churches offering these services this year.

It’s unclear exactly when “Blue Christmas” services began, but they have been offered by churches across the country since at least the 1990s. The Rev. Dawn Anderson of Dallas’ Lovers Lane United Methodist Church organized her first Blue Christmas while volunteering at another area UMC around two decades ago. Anderson had lost her husband to suicide, and together with her friend and fellow volunteer Sharon Clepper O’Connor, she organized a simple service with recorded music and a few candles.

“I think having been through deep grief myself, and some of the mental stuff that followed it … it just made me hyperaware of what people need during that time,” Anderson said.

Of her Blue Christmas service, she said, “I really kind of design mine for a person that might still be traumatized and in shock and just barely able to get out of bed. That’s the kind of person I want to make sure we offer something for. Hopefully, they leave on a hopeful note, because we remind them of how Jesus came to bring eternal life and how we’re going to see our loved ones again.”

Advertisement

Strasner has been coming to Anderson’s Blue Christmas services for years, following her after she moved churches. As she waits in line to light candles for her father and sister every year, she said, she always makes sure to hug Anderson.

“My grief journey [has] been going on for a while now, so I don’t see her like I used to,” Strasner said of Anderson, adding that she no longer attends the pastor’s biweekly GriefShare meetings. But the Blue Christmas services have remained a tradition she looks forward to every year, she said.

“You get a moment to light the candle for your loved one, and then you set it next to all of the other candles that are lit. It’s just really powerful, when you go back to your seat and sit down, because you look and you see all of these candles glowing, and they’re all for someone that we’ve lost but someone whose memory still lives on in us.”

37,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,"Uvalde school shooting evidence won’t go before grand jury this year, prosecutor says",https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2023/12/21/uvalde-school-shooting-evidence-wont-go-before-grand-jury-this-year-prosecutor-says/,"DALLAS (AP) — A Texas prosecutor says a criminal investigation into police failures during the Uvalde school shooting will continue into 2024, pushing back expectations that a grand jury would convene before the end of the year.

Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell said earlier this week that her staff are still examining the halting and haphazard police response to the May 2022 shooting that left 19 students and two teachers dead. Investigators sent Mitchell their preliminary findings in January and she previously said prosecutors would present evidence related to the massacre to a grand jury this year.

The possibility of criminal charges against some of the nearly 400 officers who rushed to Robb Elementary School but waited more than an hour to confront and kill the shooter has hung over Uvalde since state lawmakers faulted law enforcement at every level with failing “to prioritize saving innocent lives over their own safety.” The issue has divided the close-knit community of 15,000, and as the timeline for the criminal investigation has expanded, so has the frustration of some victims’ families with the district attorney.

“She’s just plainly not doing her job,” said Velma Lisa Duran, whose sister Irma Garcia was one of the teachers killed. “I don’t understand how they expect us to live in a place where there are no consequences.”

Mitchell did not answer questions posed to her by The Associated Press about when she now expects to go before a grand jury, the focus of her investigation or what charges she might be considering.

“My office is still dissecting the investigation of the Texas Rangers which is quite voluminous,” she said in an email response. “Upon our completion of the review of the Rangers investigation, we will then convene a grand jury.”

Advertisement

The Rangers, a part of the Texas Department of Public Safety, sent prosecutors their initial findings at the start of this year. But Mitchell said the agency’s investigation continued after that, and she told the San Antonio Express-News that she would need until the end of 2023 to present a case to the grand jury because she only received the full case file in July.

Since the shooting, there has been widespread criticism of the officers who massed outside the school and waited in hallways as the shooter could be heard firing an AR-15-style rife in a classroom. At least five officers have lost their jobs, including two Department of Public Safety officers and Uvalde’s school police chief, Pete Arredondo, who was the on-site commander during the attack.

The ongoing investigation is also likely to prolong legal fights over the release of records that might offer a fuller picture of the attack and police response.

Advertisement

Uvalde city officials filed a lawsuit last year that accused prosecutors of not being transparent and withholding records related to the shooting. News outlets, including the AP, have also sued local Uvalde officials for withholding records requested under public information laws. Over the summer, Uvalde’s then-mayor, Don McLaughlin, called on Mitchell to resign, saying she “has been involved in a cover-up regarding the city’s investigation into the Robb School tragedy,”

Advertisement

The Department of Public Safety has fought disclosure, citing a request from Mitchell due to her ongoing investigation. In November, lawyers for the state appealed a judge’s order that records be released.

Nonetheless, body camera footage, investigations by journalists and a damning report by state lawmakers have laid bare how over the course of more than 70 minutes, a mass of officers went in and out of the school with weapons drawn but did not go inside the classroom where the shooting was taking place. The 376 officers at the scene included state police, Uvalde police, school officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents.

Robb Elementary is now permanently closed and in October the city broke ground on a new school. But Uvalde remains split between residents who say they want to move past the tragedy and others who are still demanding answers and accountability.

Advertisement

In November, during the first mayoral race since the shooting, locals elected a man who’d served as mayor more than a decade ago, rather than a mother who has led calls for tougher gun laws since her daughter was killed in the attack.

This month, Duran, 52, marked what would have been her sister’s 50th birthday. She no longer expects to see justice on Earth for the police who failed to protect her sister and the officials she believes are shielding them.

“I take confidence in God’s wrath,” she said.

38,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Flash flooding wreaks havoc on Los Angeles area as powerful storm slams into Southern California,https://nypost.com/2023/12/22/news/flash-flooding-wreaks-havoc-on-los-angeles-area-as-powerful-storm-slams-into-southern-california/,"Southern California continues to face a dangerous flood threat through Friday as heavy rain targets the Los Angeles and San Diego areas, before moving eastward.

More than 20 million people from Southern California through central Arizona remain under a Flood Watch as rainfall totals surpassed 10 inches in several mountain areas, while bringing a month’s worth of rain in an hour in Ventura County.

The overall rainfall amounts combined with the potential for bursts of thunderstorm-triggered heavier rain, especially over recent wildfire burn-scar areas, prompted NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center (WPC) to put a swath of Southern California in a Level 3 out of 4 risk zone for flash flooding.

For many communities, the precipitation is the heaviest rainfall event since the remnants of Hurricane Hilary impacted the region in August.

Some of the hardest hit areas included Oxnard and Santa Barbara, where water rescues were needed.

A good Samaritan driver pulled two people from a vehicle before it was swept away and the American Red Cross opened at least one shelter.

Oxnard, Port Hueneme residents wake up to flooded homes

Significant flash flooding occurred in the Oxnard area, the largest city in Ventura County, after 3.18 inches of rain fell in one hour – of which 2.25 inches fell in just 30 minutes.

The city averages about 2.5 inches of rain for the entire month. Overall storm totals were nearing 6 inches at the city’s civic center by Thursday evening.

Photos shared on social media from Oxnard showed upwards of 2 feet of water on roads.

Larry Emerson, a resident of Port Hueneme in Ventura County, says he awoke to a frustrating sight Thursday morning when he found about a foot of water had seeped into his garage.

“Everything is wet and about a foot up on everything,” he said. “The deluge must have gone through the entire garage. I got boxes destroyed… (The floodwaters) tipped over a commercial vacuum cleaner and got water on the inside. It was so forceful.”

About 60 homes were flooded, and even a senior living center had to be evacuated. First responders had to use high-wheeled vehicles to evacuate about 20 people.

During the peak of the flooding, Ventura County Fire reported that they received approximately 275 calls within a span of five hours, according to public information officer Andy VanSciver. That is significantly higher than their usual call volume of less than 200 calls per day.

“This storm was a little bit unique to the Port Hueneme, Oxnard area. This is a coastal community, so it’s rather flat to begin with here by the ocean,” VanSciver said.

“And so the flood control channels were overwhelmed. I did hear on my response in as I was gathering information both on the police radio and the FM radio that the National Weather Service was reporting that it had received an enormous amount of rain.

“Sometimes they were saying maybe more than we’ve ever received in the last 30 to 40 years in such a short period of time.”

As much as 8 inches of rain expected

By the end of the week, between 5 and 8 inches of rain is forecast to fall in several areas, with some places experiencing even higher amounts, keeping an ongoing risk of flash and urban flooding.

5 West Coast rainfall forecast through Friday. Fox Weather

Some mountainous areas in Southern California reported rainfall totals over 10 inches through the week as of Thursday evening.

Rocky Butte in San Luis Obispo County reported 15.95 inches, while Ventura County’s Old Man Mountain had 13.70 inches, according to the National Weather Service.

Closer to the metro area, Beverly Hills had 2.66 inches of rain while Los Angeles’s LAX airport reported 2.15 inches.

Severe weather jolts residents as Tornado Warnings issued in Ventura County

For some, the storms didn’t just bring heavy rain and flooding, but a threat of severe weather.

Early Thursday morning, two Tornado Warnings were issued for the Oxnard area after Doppler Radar indicated possible rotation inside passing thunderstorms.

The Tornado Warnings were the first issued by the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles office during the month of December since 2008.

“At one point, we had over 350,000 people under a Tornado Warning and also a Flash Flood Warning,” FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin said.

Snow blankets the Sierra Nevada

The same system is also dropping heavy snow over the highest elevations of California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains, with lower snow amounts over the highest elevations of the Washington and Oregon Cascades and parts of Idaho and Nevada.

Rain was forecast to slowly head east through the day Friday, drying out Southern California from west to east and shifting heavy rains and the flooding threat into parts of Arizona."

A Missouri girl who was born the size of a “little baby bird” four months early and spent nearly 10 months in the hospital finally made it home — just in time to be her parents’ greatest Christmas “gift.”

Evangeline “Evie” Statler will celebrate her first holiday at home with mom and dad after she only had about a 50% chance at survival when she was delivered at a Cape Girardeau hospital on March 24 – about four months before her mid-July due date – and weighing just 14 ounces, according to reports.

“For the timing to line up with Christmas, it’s like, symbolic, almost like, yeah, she is our gift,” the newborn’s father, Dylan Statler told KSDK after Evie was released Monday.

Evie arrived prematurely after mother Maddie Statler, 27, explained she woke up with back pain, and later that day started having contractions.

After she had some bleeding, she went to the hospital, ABC’s “Good Morning America” reported.

She received medications to stop the preterm labor, but the bleeding continued during her stay at the hospital. Maddie was hemorrhaging from placental abruption, a serious pregnancy complication, which led Evie to be born by C-section.

“It was definitely scary,” said Maddie in a news release cited by People.

“We didn’t know if we both would make it or not and didn’t know what would really happen. She was so tiny, like a little baby bird.”

Doctors told the couple their new daughter had less than a 50% chance of survival in what Dylan, 30, called a “nightmare scenario.”

“Each day was kind of like a victory that we got through — like, if we got through another day there at the beginning, we counted that as a win,” he told ABC.

Evie was later transferred to St. Louis Children’s Hospital in July for specialized care as she still fought for survival and was treated for complications including high blood pressure in the arteries of her lungs, ABC reported.

“We anticipated a very long stay,” Dr. Melissa Riley, who oversaw her care, told ABC.

“So when she arrived here, as sick as she was … at that time, if you would have said, ‘Dr. Riley, is Evie going to be home by Christmas?’ I would have said, ‘I’m not betting on that one.'”"

A Post reporter watched Thursday morning as Alexander Mendez, 23, of Venezuela and 30 others — including women and children — crossed the Rio Grande Thursday morning.

“I am going to New York,” Mendez said, noting that his sister, aunt and cousin were joining him.

He said he already had a cousin the Empire State and hoped to carve out an improved existence in his new environment.

“I want to explore New York, work and get a better life,” he said after making the two-month journey to the border.

The group crossed the Rio Grande under the crowded Camino Real International Bridge.

“Attention, attention,” blared a loudspeaker in a pre-recorded message in Spanish.

“It is illegal to cross here. This area is secured with wire and there is no entry. Go to the bridge. It is illegal to cross here. Remain in Mexico.”

Officials said more than 4,000 undocumented travelers were apprehended in the Lone Star State’s Del Rio sector in past 24-hours alone.

Most will cite seeking asylum as their reason for crossing illegally into the US, which means they must have a “credible fear” of harm if they are returned to their homeland.

The 10,000 who have given themselves up to Border Patrol in Eagle Pass this week are the equivalent to roughly one third of the small town’s permanent population, putting huge strain on its resources.

Beleaguered border agents worked in vain to stem the human tsunami, hustling to repair holes in razor wire while migrants calmly scaled the barrier around them.

The Post observed migrants covering the barbed fencing with rugs and sweatshirts to avoid lacerations before climbing over.

Three Guatemalan men removed their shoes and socks before crossing a riverbank in the area.

“My brother has been in New York for two years,” one of them said.

“We are all going to New York.”

Johan Rodriguez, 20, told The Post through an interpreter that he arrived in Piedras Negras in Mexico at the Texas border after a grueling three-month trek by foot and bicycle that began in Venezuela.

“I traveled through Venezuela, Colombia, El Salvador, Panama, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and now Mexico,” he said under a baking sun Thursday after crossing over into the US and joining the crowds in Eagle Pass.

Rodriguez said he came to out America solely for economic reasons, and was not in any danger back home.

“There’s no opportunity in Venezuela,” he said.

“It’s not dangerous but the economy is bad.”

The former secretary of state leveled the accusation against Netanyahu, 74, during a meeting at Columbia University on Wednesday with 16 children and siblings of some of the more than 100 hostages that remain in Palestinian territory, according to Haaretz.

Clinton, 76, reportedly urged the family members to ramp up the pressure on the Israeli government to strike a deal with Hamas terrorists that would see more hostages let out of Gaza.

She further accused Netanyahu of being more focused on “politics and his personal survival” than on negotiating the release of hostages.

“As long as the hostages are not the main and primary target for Israel, then everything that I or President Biden say or do is of little value,” Clinton said, according to sources that spoke with Ynet News.

The former Democratic presidential candidate also told family members that the Biden administration was making efforts to reach a “Christmas deal” that would lead to the release of more hostages, but that the fate of the deal was ultimately in the hands of Hamas and the Israeli government.

Eight Americans are believed to be among the 132 hostages that Hamas has refused to release since the terror group’s deadly Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish state.

More than 100 people were released by Hamas during a temporary cease-fire with Israel which began on Nov. 24 and ended Dec. 1.

“The work that the families and the forum does is so important and influential. You need to keep doing it. Put pressure on all the players involved,” Clinton reportedly told the families of the hostages.

Hamas officials said Thursday they would not discuss any hostage exchange deal “except after a full cessation of aggression.”"

A judge granted Thursday Lindsay Shiver’s request to return to her young children in the US while she awaits the murder-for-hire trial, which is anticipated to kick off in March.

She has been remanded to the island nation since July, though allowed free from prison under the conditions that she wear an electric monitoring device and adhere to a curfew.

Shiver and her team told the court she feared for her “mental and physical safety” and begged that she be allowed to see her children, who she has been separated from since her arrest, according to Court TV.

Shiver, 36, will be allowed to return to her parent’s home in Alabama under the new ruling, but must keep her ankle monitor on and will not be permitted to travel to Georgia, where she lived with husband Robert Shiver before allegedly asking her new beau to kill him.

Robert Shiver pleaded that the judge strike down her request, stating that he is “thankful to be alive” after her fruitless attempt on his life.

“After reviewing the indictment, this was a situation close to happening…I’m concerned for the safety of myself,” the Auburn University football standout said.

Shiver is accused of explicitly instructing her barman beau Adrien Bethel, 28, and alleged assassin Faron Newbold Jr., 29, to whack Robert Shiver amid their increasingly bitter divorce.

Shiver allegedly sent a series of texts to Bethel asking him to “kill” her snapper husband.

Local police unearthed texts that detailed the plot during an unrelated investigation of a break-in at the waterfront bar where Bethel worked.

Both Shiver and Beth denied seriously pursuing a murder-for-hire plan, claiming the texts amounted to little more than hyperbolic fantasy amid Shivers’ marital combat.

Prior to their marriage’s implosion, the Shivers split their time between a multi-million dollar Thomasville, Georgia, mansion and a luxury spread in the exclusive Bahamian enclave of Baker’s Bay.

John McWhorter, a linguist professor at Columbia University, wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times on Thursday in which he said Gay should resign if the Ivy League school declines to dismiss her from her post.

Gay allegedly quoted or paraphrased authors more than 40 times without proper attribution in her academic works — which breaks the school’s strict rules on plagiarism.

“Harvard has a clear policy on plagiarism that threatens undergraduates with punishment up to the university’s equivalent of expulsion for just a single instance of it,” McWhorter wrote.

“That policy may not apply to the university’s president, but the recent, growing revelations about past instances of plagiarism by Dr. Gay make it untenable for her to remain in office.”

He added that Gay keeping her job “would not only be a terrible sign of hollowed-out leadership, but also risks conveying the impression of a double standard at a progressive institution for a Black woman, which serves no one well, least of all Dr. Gay.”

Gay, Harvard’s first black president, has produced a mere 11 academic articles in her career and not one book on her own, noted McWhorter, who is black.

Her appointment as president, he argued, “gives the appearance that Dr. Gay was not chosen because of her academic or scholarly qualifications, which Harvard is thought to prize, but rather because of her race.”

On Thursday, a complaint revealed more than 40 allegations of her plagiarizing others’ works.

Columbia University’s John McWhorter said Gay should resign

The allegations first surfaced earlier this month, with accusations she lifted other scholars’ works in her 1997 doctoral thesis and that four papers published between 1993 and 2017 did not include proper attribution.

The allegations have also caught the attention of Congress amid its investigation into existing claims of antisemitism on campus, which McWhorter noted he initially pushed back on, wanting more evidence.

“But in the wake of reports of additional acts of plagiarism and Harvard’s saying that she will make further corrections to past writing, the weight of the charges has taken me from ‘wait and see’ to ‘that’s it,’” he wrote in The Times.

“If it is mobbish to call on Black figures of influence to be held to the standards that others are held to, then we have arrived at a rather mysterious version of antiracism, and just in time for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday in less than a month,” he wrote.

“I would even wish Harvard well in searching for another Black woman to serve as president if that is an imperative. But at this point that Black woman cannot, with any grace, be Claudine Gay,” McWhorter said.

Gay has defended her academic integrity, telling the Boston Globe “Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards.”

Harvard has stood by its president, with its board announcing unanimous support for Gay.

The House Committee on Education and the Workforce on Wednesday announced a probe into how the school handled the allegations of plagiarism against Gay."

“[Jones] is then seen pressing the erect penis against the door before walking away,” court documents state.

Four days later, police tracked down the accused burglar, who allegedly admitted to creeping around the house.

Jones told investigators he was merely checking in on the woman’s “welfare” after having seen someone else get shot at the house just two weeks earlier, court documents show.

As for the sex toy, Jones allegedly relented that he was carrying one but that it had “slipped out” when he approached the door.

He was taken into custody, but put up a brief fight, the charges indicate.

Jones was booked into the Pinellas County Jail for stalking, attempted burglary and resisting arrest.

Tim Burchett says he’s ‘sure’ members of Congress have been ‘honeypot’ victims: ‘Next thing you know, you’re in the motel room with them naked’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/rep-tim-burchett-sure-members-of-congress-are-honeypot-victims/,"Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett claimed Thursday that “good conservative” lawmakers are falling victim to “honeypot” schemes and voting in ways to avoid being outed for their deviant behavior.

The “powerful people” entrapping members of Congress are “always either out on the tarmac or in the private room” with the president, Burchett right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson during a discussion that centered on the impending release of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s client list.

“They’re the ones that write the big checks. They don’t care who’s in [office]. They hate this country. They hate what we’re about. But they love their portfolios and they love their money more than they do anything else,” the 59-year-old congressman said, adding that they gather disparaging information about lawmakers in order to “protect” their investments.

“And by doing so, you know, the old honey pot — the Russians do that — and I’m sure members of Congress have been caught up,” Burchett suggested, without offering any specific evidence other than the voting patterns of some of his congressional colleagues.

3 Burchett suggested that “good conservatives” are voting “for crazy stuff” because they don’t want to be outed for deviant sexual acts. AP

“Why in the world would good conservatives vote for crazy stuff like what we’ve been seeing out of Congress?” Burchett said.

The lawmaker went on to assertively describe how he believes the honey trap schemes work.

“You’re visiting, you’re out of the country or out of town or you’re in a motel or at a bar in DC and, whatever you’re into – women, men, whatever — comes up and they’re very attractive and they’re laughing at your jokes. And you’re buying them a drink. Next thing you know, you’re in the motel room with them naked,” he said.

“And next thing you know, you know you’re about to make a key vote. And what happens? Some well-dressed person comes out and whispers in your ear, ‘Hey, man, there’s tapes out on you,’ or, ‘Were you in a motel room or whatever with whoever?’ And then you’re like, ‘Oh,’ and [they] said, ‘You really ought not be voting for this thing,’” Burchett went on.

The congressman argued that “it’s human nature” for lawmakers to vote in ways that would keep compromising personal information from getting out.

“And, you know, no man or no woman actually is an island. And they know what to get at. You know, if it’s women, drugs, booze, it’ll find you,” Burchett said, claiming that this sort of blackmail happens in all levels of politics.

“I’ve been in this game my whole life. I spent 16 years in the state legislature in Tennessee and eight years as county mayor. And now I’m in my fifth year in Congress. But it’s just — the stakes are higher. But the game is still the same,” he said.

Burchett theorized earlier this week that Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s (R-Tenn.) effort to subpoena the flight logs for Epstein’s infamous private jet was “snubbed” by Senate Democrats because some are “compromised.”

“Too many of my colleagues, I’m afraid, are compromised in this area. For whatever reason, somebody’s whispered in their ear, said, ‘Hey, you don’t want something to come out on something else. You better keep your mouth shut on this,'” Burchett said during a Monday appearance on Newsmax."

Jesse Leonardo Otero, 44, is well known to the California businesses he frequently targets as well as several local police departments who’ve dealt with his antics repeatedly over the years, KRON reported.

He was most recently picked up by cops outside a shopping center in Pleasant Hill, about 20 miles east of Oakland on Dec. 8.

He had been released from the Martinez Detention Facility jail on misdemeanor charges just hours earlier that same day, the outlet reported.

The career criminal allegedly hurled swears and insults at a KRON reporter who asked him, “Jesse, don’t you get sick of getting arrested?” as he was cuffed outside the shopping center.

Otero, who is homeless, survives and supports his drug addiction by shoplifting and then selling the stolen merchandise, cops told the outlet.

3 Jesse Leonardo Otero, 44, has been arrested 90 times for shoplifting in the California Bay Area. KRON

He’s known to police throughout the Bay Area, where he travels by BART trains to hit different communities to commit crimes.

His lengthy rap sheet shows he goes after both small businesses and big-box stores — and often returns to steal from them again to the extent that many store employees know him on a first-name basis.

“Since we started knowing who he was, we would call him out by name and say, ‘Jesse — you’re not allowed to be here,’” Daisy Erns, store manager at Five Little Monkeys toy store in Albany, told KRON.

Otero’s typically cited or briefly jailed before he’s released back out on the streets again.

3 Otero is known to multiple police departments in the Bay Area, where he targets stores repeatedly. KRON

He rarely steals more than $950 worth of products, according to police, which keeps him out of jail due to a 2014 change in state law.

That year, California residents voted to up the felony charge threshold for shoplifting from $400 in stolen property to $950, making most shoplifting crimes misdemeanors, according to the outlet.

Police are then left with no choice but to set him free despite his incredible criminal record.

“Nowadays, with the way that the filing standards have changed and the law is written, if it’s a petty theft under $950, he’s given the same ticket that you would get for running a stop sign,” Pleasant Hill police officer Jacob Williams told KRON.

“So that person is no longer booked into jail based off the shoplift alone — even if we are aware of prior convictions on his criminal history,” he said.

Otero is currently in jail after his latest arrest. It’s unclear if or when he will be released.

3 Otero is currently facing a consolidated 31-count misdemeanor complaint for his arrests in 2023.

He was also arrested on Nov. 21 in Concord after committing a theft at a mall. He ran onto an interstate highway as he tried to flee police before he was detained.

Just days later on Nov. 24, Otero stole $340 worth of items from a bike store in Danville, according to the owner.

The Contra Costa DA’s office filed a consolidated 31-count misdemeanor complaint against the career criminal — compiling his 31 arrests in the past year into a single case, KRON reported.

District Attorneys in the Golden State can consolidate cases for repeated crimes into one case, as Otero is currently facing.

His misdemeanor jury trial is scheduled for the last week of the year."

“We’ve got to fight for our country,” Trump reportedly told two officials with the Wayne County Board of Canvassers on Nov. 17, 2020, according to a recording reviewed by the Detroit News. “We can’t let these people take our country away from us.”

He also told the pair, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, that it would be a “terrible” look for them to sign off on the state’s election results after previously voting in opposition to certifying them during the call. The two Republican members of Wayne County’s canvassers board later voted to certify the 2020 vote results.

McDaniel, who was also on the call, suggested that both Palmer and Hartmann would be offered legal representation, presumably by the RNC, if they decided not to sign the certification document.

“If you can go home tonight, do not sign it. … We will get you attorneys,” she reportedly said.

“We’ll take care of that,” Trump added.

Palmer and Hartmann did not sign the official statement of votes for Wayne County and tried unsuccessfully to rescind their votes supporting the certification of Michigan’s election results the day after the call.

The call took place some 30 minutes after the end of a Nov. 17, 2020, meeting between the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, according to the Detroit News.

Trump further claimed that Republicans had been “cheated on this election” and “everybody knows Detroit is crooked as hell.”

“How can anybody sign something when you have more votes than people?” the 77-year-old former president said on the call.

McDaniel, a Michigan native and Wayne County resident argued that if the election were to be certified without an audit, voters would “never know what happened in Detroit.”

She told the Detroit News that Joe Biden’s narrow margin of victory in the state “warranted an audit.”

Both McDaniel and Michigan GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox formally requested an audit in a Nov. 21, 2020, letter to the Board of State Canvassers.

“What I said publicly and repeatedly at the time, as referenced in my letter on Nov. 21, 2020, is that there was ample evidence that warranted an audit,” McDaniel told the outlet.

Hartmann and Palmer both acknowledged in 2020 that they had received a call from Trump and McDaniel, and that the call took place as the pair sat in a parked car outside the Wayne County elections building.

“The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance, stated Wayne County, Michigan, Canvassers,” Trump tweeted the morning after the call. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers. There are more votes than people. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!”

Biden edged out Trump in Michigan by about 154,000 votes in 2020 – 50.6% to 47.8% – and easily defeated the incumbent in Wayne County by a 38 percentage point margin.

Trump, the 2024 GOP presidential primary front-runner, was indicted in Georgia and by a federal grand jury earlier this year over his alleged efforts to interfere in the 2020 election."

The 79-year-old Democrat was convicted on 13 of the 14 charges leveled against him in a 2019 federal indictment accusing the veteran Chicago City Council member of using his position to steer business from private developers to his law firm.

Prosecutors also alleged that Burke threatened to block a measure raising admission fees at Chicago’s famed Field Museum over its failure to grant an internship to the daughter of a former alderman, whom he had recommended.

Burke’s shakedown scheme targeted the developer working on a $600 million renovation of Chicago’s Old Post Office, a Burger King in the former alderman’s 14th Ward and Midwest liquor store chain Binny’s Beverage Depot.

Burke, 79, faces a maximum of 110 years in prison. AP

The former Chicago alderman was found guilty of 13 of the 14 corruption charges brought against him by federal prosecutors. AP

“Did we land the, uh, tuna?” Burke told former Alderman Danny Solis, who wore a wire for two years as federal authorities investigated the case, in an apparent reference to his desire to land the Old Post Office developer as a client for his law firm specializing in property tax appeals.

In another recording played for the jury, Burke told Solis that the developers could “go f–k themselves” if they thought they would get favorable treatment from him without their business.

The disgraced city official also repeatedly played up that he could help the developer – 601W Companies LLC of New York – in a dispute with Amtrak because of his close ties with a board member for the rail operator.

“We made his daughter a judge here in Cook County. And one of their other daughters is a friend of my daughter … You’ll find out Chicago is a very small town,” Burke said in one recording.

“Jews are Jews, and they’ll deal with Jews to the exclusion of everybody else … unless there’s a reason for them to use a Christian,” Burke also told his colleague, referring to the lead developer of the Old Post Office renovation project, who is Jewish. Burke is Roman Catholic.

Burke was also accused of shutting down remodeling work at a Burger King owned by Zohaib Dhanani after the fast-food franchise operator didn’t respond to Burke’s request to employ his law firm.

“It seems like the two were being linked together … the property taxes and the permits,” Dhanani told jurors.

“Maybe since I had not responded about the property tax business, maybe that’s why it would have been shut down,” Dhanani testified. “I didn’t see any other reason why it would be shut down.”

Peter Andrews, a political aide to Burke, and developer Charles Cui were on trial alongside the former alderman, who resigned in May.

Andrews was found not guilty on all charges.

Cui was found guilty on bribery charges after he hired Burke’s law firm in an effort to get the ex-alderman’s help resolving a pole sign dispute with the city related to his Binny’s Beverage Depot property. Burke had the city’s buildings commissioner look into Cui’s sign issue the same day his firm signed Cui up as a client.

Burke faces a maximum sentence of 110 years in federal prison.

He left the courthouse with his wife, retired Illinois Supreme Court Chief Justice Anne Burke, without speaking to reporters."
49,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Prosecutor who allegedly shielded Joe, Hunter Biden testified 79 times she’s ‘not authorized’ by DOJ to give answers",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/lesley-wolf-who-allegedly-shielded-joe-hunter-biden-said-shes-not-authorized-by-doj-to-give-answers/,"WASHINGTON — The former federal prosecutor who allegedly shielded President Biden and his son Hunter during a criminal investigation testified 79 times to Congress that she was “not authorized” by the Justice Department to answer questions about the case, according to a transcript reviewed by The Post.

Former assistant Delaware US attorney Lesley Wolf repeatedly cited a five-page authorization letter from Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer as she refused to answer questions during a House Judiciary Committee deposition last week.

Weinsheimer’s Dec. 12 letter, also reviewed by The Post, says: “[T]he Department generally does not authorize congressional testimony from line-level personnel, especially relating to an ongoing investigation with charges pending in court. The Department has declined to do so in connection with this matter.”

Wolf’s dozens of refusals to answer questions — just one day after the full House voted to authorize an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden — frustrated attempts to firm up the storyline involving what whistleblowers say was a sweeping coverup by Wolf and colleagues to protect the Biden family.

5 A former federal prosecutor who allegedly shielded President Biden and his son Hunter during a criminal investigation testified that she was “not authorized” to answer questions about her actions, according to a transcript. AP

The near-blanket rejection of questions follows pressure from House Republicans on the administration to allow witness testimony and could bolster GOP arguments that the White House is obstructing the inquiry, which itself could form an article of impeachment.

Two IRS agents who worked on the long-running tax fraud investigation of Hunter Biden, which focused on his foreign income from countries such as China and Ukraine, alleged in prior testimony to House committees that Wolf tipped off the first son’s lawyers to investigative steps and forbade inquiries into Joe Biden, even when communications mentioned him.

Wolf served on the squad of prosecutors that signed off on a probation-only plea deal in June for the first son on tax and gun charges, which fell apart the following month under scrutiny from a federal judge.

IRS supervisor Gary Shapley, who oversaw the Hunter Biden investigation for three years, and case agent Joseph Ziegler, who worked on the inquiry for five years, made a series of specific claims against Wolf, which she did not refute in her testimony.

Tax investigators learned in December 2020 that Wolf “reached out to Hunter Biden’s defense counsel and told them” about investigators’ plans to search a northern Virginia storage unit that contained business records, “circumventing our chance to get to evidence from potentially being destroyed, manipulated or concealed,” Ziegler testified in July.

Shapley testified that investigators were months earlier barred from searching a guest house at Joe Biden’s Wilmington, Del., home where Hunter often stayed.

Shapley said that on Sept. 3, 2020, “Wolf told us there was more than enough probable cause for the physical search warrant there, but the question was whether the juice was worth the squeeze.”

Wolf also allegedly objected during a meeting on Dec. 3, 2020, to questioning a key Biden family associate, Rob Walker, about the president.

“Wolf interjected and said she did not want to ask about the big guy and stated she did not want to ask questions about ‘dad’” he said.

“When multiple people in the room spoke up and objected that we had to ask, she responded, there’s no specific criminality to that line of questioning. This upset the FBI, too,” Shapley testified.

Wolf served as a key point person for the investigation, serving under Delaware US attorney David Weiss.

The whistleblowers accused Weiss’ office of giving Hunter Biden’s legal team advance knowledge of a planned interview attempt in late 2020, scuttling a planned approach, and said that prosecutors didn’t pass along a paid FBI informant’s tip that Joe and Hunter Biden received $10 million in bribes from Ukrainian energy company Burisma, which paid Hunter a salary of up to $1 million to serve on its board beginning in 2014 when his vice-president dad led US policy toward the country.

Wolf allegedly instructed FBI agents in August 2020 to remove references to Joe Biden from a search warrant affidavit, writing, “Someone needs to redraft [the affidavit]… There should be nothing about Political Figure 1 in here,” according to an email released by the Ways & Means Committee.

“That email, I think, is super important because it’s a one-off example in writing of the constant concern of following investigative leads that might lead to Joe Biden,” Ziegler said last week in a Fox News interview.

“The FBI agents who drafted that affidavit, they believed that they had sufficient evidence — probable cause — to support including Political Figure 1 in that affidavit,” said the self-identified Democrat.

“That related to [Ukrainian energy company] Burisma, access to Joe Biden and access to the administration and there was ample evidence that was included in that affidavit that’s supported including Political Figure 1. That has a waterfall effect on the investigation because those emails that we’re searching for might not come through to the team.”

Shapley and Ziegler said they were not allowed to get cellphone geolocation data that could have proved Joe Biden was with his son in July 2017 when Hunter sent a threatening text message to a Chinese government-linked businessman saying, “I am sitting here with my father,” and warning of retribution.

Within 10 days of that message, $5.1 million flowed to accounts linked to Hunter and first brother James Biden from CEFC China Energy — after a tranche of $1 million earlier that year, less than two months after Biden left office as vice president.

A May 2017 email penciled in Joe Biden, referred to as the “big guy,” for a 10% cut from CEFC dealings.

The IRS whistleblowers say that — in addition to preferential treatment for Joe and Hunter Biden — Attorney General Merrick Garland misled Congress under oath about Weiss’ ability to independently bring criminal charges against Hunter Biden.

Biden-appointed US attorneys in Los Angeles and Washington have confirmed in testimony that they declined to partner with Weiss, who in August was elevated by Garland to be a special counsel, allowing him to bring charges independently outside of Delaware.

Businessman Len Blavatnik and his family foundation have paused their millions of dollars in funding to the Ivy League as it stands behind President Claudine Gay despite accusations she stood by as students spewed antisemitic rhetoric on campus, according to a report.

The Harvard Business School alumnus will halt his funding until the university directly addresses what he sees as rampant antisemitism at the school, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.

Blavatnik and his wife Emily have donated at least $270 million to Harvard, with about $200 million directly benefiting the medical school.

What it will take for the elite institution to win back the Access Industries founder’s financial support is unclear.

The Ukraine-born billionaire did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Harvard University also did not respond to emails.

Blavatnik, who is Jewish, is the latest of a string of heavy donors to pause donations to Harvard following its alleged failure to condemn the mass slaughter of Israelis by Hamas terrorists.

Former Victoria’s Secret CEO Les Wexner, whose foundation had given untold millions to Harvard over 34 years, cut ties with the university shortly after the Israel-Hamas war started in October.

Hedge funder Bill Ackman, also a business school alum, has repeatedly spoken out against the Ivy League, along with $500 million donor Ken Griffin.

The US government is also considering ways to strip billions of dollars in federal funding from the institution.

The backlash against the school has only ramped up following Gay’s disastrous testimony before Congress in which she said calls for genocide against Jewish people would only violate Harvard’s rules depending on their “context.”

Harvard has continued to stand behind Gay — who was also recently accused of 40 acts of plagiarizing other scholars’ work in a separate scandal — and has since apologized for her testimony.

The school is now being investigated by the federal Department of Education over whether it has breached the civil rights of Jewish students, which are protected under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

The millions of dollars in suspended gifts and federal funding would dramatically affect Harvard’s longstanding reputation, forcing the school to slash the level of donations that can secure admission.

One college counselor previously told The Post that a $2 million check might be the new $20 million."

James Oliver, a 14-year-old student at Geneva High School, collapsed at West Chicago High School on Dec. 8, and suffered an AVM stroke and brain hemorrhage, school officials told parents in a letter.

He died on Sunday night after weeks in the hospital.

The teen’s sudden death has left the community stunned.

“He just brought me so much joy, as he did many other people,” swim coach Jennifer Heyer-Olson told ABC7 Chicago.

James Oliver, 14, died on Sunday after suffering a stroke at swim practice earlier this month. GoFundMe

“And I think when somebody passes away, you just wish more that you could have told them that.”

A family friend told the outlet that Oliver was born with a brain arteriovenous malformation — or AVM — a condition in which tangled blood vessels in the brain cause connections between arteries and veins, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

A neurosurgeon at Northwestern Medicine said that the condition is congenital and very rare.

“It’s thought that most AVMs are present from birth, and so we see a lot of AVMs either being diagnosed incidentally or being diagnosed because they bleed,” Dr. Matthew Potts told ABC7. “We see a lot of that in children, and teenagers and young adults.”

James Oliver was born with a brain arteriovenous malformation, according to family friends. Sharks for Heyer

“About half people diagnosed with AVM experience symptoms, while the other half don’t experience any symptoms until a rupture occurs,” Potts added.

The school community was informed of James’ death in an email on Monday.

“As a school community, our thoughts are with his brother, Sean, a GHS junior, his family and friends, and our hearts are mourning this loss,” the email read.

The two brothers were inseparable, according to the outlet.

Sean was also a member of the swim team and trained at Heyer-Olson’s home pool, the swim coach said. She grew close with the boys’ family, and the brothers would help her with chores while her husband battled a serious illness.

“Just delightful to be around, happy, polite, doing good, just doing kid things,” Heyer-Olson said.

“Summer mornings in the pool will never be the same without experiencing the brotherly love, silliness, and ongoing whispering (usually regarding trading cards) between Sean and James,” she told the Kane County Chronicle."

“Get out, get out!” one Las Vegas cop is heard shouting at disgruntled professor Anthony Polito from a second-floor balcony at the school after the horrific Dec. 6 massacre.

Polito, 67 — wearing a long, black trench coat with one hand visible at his side — said nothing as he briskly walked by and headed for the door and into his final shootout with police.

The split-second sighting is buried in more than five hours of bodycam video released by the Las Vegas Metro Police Department this week from the massacre that left three UNLV professors dead and one other wounded.

The footage shows cops swarming the campus shortly after shots rang out around 11:45 a.m., combing through stairwells and hallways looking for the active shooter.

“Careful, careful,” one cop says. “Don’t rush it.

“Watch the doors,” he said as they moved down one hallway as alarms blare in the background. “Keep looking at the doors… He’s still active. Be careful. He’s still active.”

At one point a cop reports that “the suspect is down,” but the search of the massive building continued, with staffers and students periodically found cowering in classrooms.

During one grim exchange, an officer tells another, “I have bodies in here, like a lot. Every f–king floor.”

Police said three UNLV educators — Naoko Takemaru, 69; Cha Jan “Jerry” Chang, 64; and Patricia Navarro Velez, 39 — were killed during the shooting rampage.

The 38-year-old professor who was wounded has not been identified.

Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Polito was armed with a 9 mm handgun and nine magazines with more than 150 rounds when he stormed onto the campus.

The shooter had been turned down for a teaching position at the school and had been “struggling financially” — and had a “target list” of UNLV faculty members, WPLG-TV News reported.

County Undersheriff Andrew Walsh acknowledged to the Associated Press that cops had a brush encounter with Polito while searching the campus building but had no way of knowing he was the killer.

“They don’t have a description of the shooter at the time,” Walsh said. “And they know there are other police sources on the first floor.”

53,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,‘Pure torture’: Family of 9-year-old girl kidnapped from NY campground and held captive for days speaks out,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/charlotte-senas-family-speaks-out/,"The family of the 9-year-old girl who was abducted from an upstate New York camping ground three months ago is breaking its silence as the child tries to “resume her normal life” following the frightening, days-long ordeal.

The shocking kidnapping made national headlines when the child vanished while riding her bike around a small loop at Moreau Lake State Park, outside of Saratoga Springs during a family camping trip on Sept. 1.

The ordeal, which Gov. Kathy Hochul called “every parent’s worst nightmare,” came to an end roughly 48 hours later when authorities found her hiding in a cabinet inside the mobile home of local man Craig Nelson Ross Jr., 47, who lived just two miles from the girl’s home.

“You always say this type of stuff doesn’t happen to you but obviously it can happen to you,” Jené Sena, the victim’s aunt, told ABC News Thursday.

Sena, speaking on behalf of the of the family, asked the network not to publish the girl’s name or show her picture, even though her identity and likeness had been widely publicized after being the subject of an Amber Alert. The Post has honored the family’s request as well.

The woman said she “dropped to my knees, screaming” with relief when learning police had finally found her niece following a massive multi-agency manhunt.

“Pure torture, pure pure torture really, you’re thinking like, what if this doesn’t end soon? What if we can’t find her, all of the what ifs,” Sena said.

Ross had led police to the scene when he dropped a ransom letter in the family’s mailbox as troopers staked out the address.

He was initially charged only with first-degree kidnapping, but prosecutors added charges of predatory sexual assault against a child, along with charges of sexual abuse, assault and endangering the welfare of a child last month.

“Honestly, it’s been a roller coaster. She’s a child that didn’t ask for what happened to her. So, she’s trying to resume her normal life,” Sena said.

“Unfortunately, the world we live in, there are predators out there. And so justice will be not only him being safely away to not do this to anyone else, but also her having… a great support system and tools, and whatever she needs around her to move forward,” Sena said.

“This isn’t just a headline. This isn’t just something to get clicks. This is a real person, a real child, a real family,” she added.

The woman told the network that the young victim will be spending Christmas with her family and hoped her case would bring awareness to other abductions and increase “sensitivity” in the legal system.

Ross has pleaded not guilty and faces up to life in prison if convicted."
54,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"South Africa threatens prosecution, revoked citizenship for nationals who join IDF",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/south-africa-warns-nationals-its-illegal-to-join-idf-without-approval/,"South Africa issued a stark warning Monday against its civilians taking up arms with Israel, threatening prison time for those who do so without government approval.

Officials said they were “gravely concerned” by reports that the country’s nationals had joined the Israel Defense Forces in its war in Gaza against Hamas, adding that such action could violate domestic and international law.

“Any person joining the IDF without the necessary permission of the [National Conventional Arms Control Committee] is breaking the law and can be prosecuted,” South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement.

South Africans caught fighting in the IDF without approval could be thrown behind bars, while the punishment for naturalized nationals could result in their citizenship taken away, according to the country’s laws.

The warning made clear that the Republic of South Africa “does not support or agree with” Israel’s crusade against Hamas.

Last month, the country’s parliament voted to cut diplomatic ties with Israel shortly after it filed a referral to the International Criminal Court for an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza.

President Cyril Ramaphosa had previously accused Israel of war crimes and acts “tantamount to genocide” just three weeks into the war.

Although it had condemned Hamas for its Oct. 7 surprise attack that killed 1,200 people, Ramaphosa claimed Israel was illegally retaliating by punishing Palestinian civilians through unrelenting bombings and the deliberate denial of medicine, fuel, food and water.

Nearly 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

Talks for a second temporary truce between Israel and Hamas and hostage release negotiations apparently broke down Thursday after Hamas officials became incensed over Israel’s comments that the fighting will resume regardless of a cease-fire.

Hamas leaders claimed the Jewish state was trying to lure the group into a temporary pause rather than end the war that has left Gaza in shambles, pointing to recent comments made by Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicating the IDF would not stop fighting until Hamas is eradicated.

“Whoever thinks that we will stop is detached from reality,” he said Wednesday night. “We are continuing the war to the end. It will continue until Hamas is eliminated — until victory.”

The Jewish state believes that there are still 128 hostages in Gaza, not all of them alive, following the weeklong truce agreement that resulted in 105 captives being freed last month."

A plain-clothed officer, equipped with a body camera, was deployed to W.E.B. Du Bois Regional Middle School in Great Barrington on Dec. 8 to search for the highly controversial book: “Gender Queer”.

The award-winning graphic memoir by Maia Kobabe — which details the author’s exploration of sexuality and gender identity through adolescence into adulthood — was the most banned book across the country for two straight years, according to the American Library Association.

The Great Barrington Police Department received a complaint about “concerning illustrations” in the book that an eighth-grade teacher had made available to students in their classroom, Police Chief Paul Storti told Boston.com.

The anonymous complainant said the book had images of sexual acts.

Because the issue was filed with the police department, Storti said they had a “duty to examine” it further.

An officer arrived toward the end of the school day and, alongside the teacher, looked for the book but was unable to locate it.

District Superintendent Peter Dillion said in a statement that the book was “not a class text but a supplemental material that students can request to sign out.”

Police notified the Berkshire District Attorney’s Office, but the investigation was later dropped as the office determined it was a “matter to be managed within the Berkshire Hills Regional School District.”

Dillion said he had wished the concerned patron had come to the school district first before going to the police, as “we have systems to respond to concerns about curriculum.”

News of the incident spread wildly through Commonwealth State and even grabbed the attention of Governor Maura Healey, who said that “book banning has no place in Massachusetts,” according to Boston.com.

“That’s partly what is so concerning,” said Ruth Bourquin, a managing attorney for the ACLU of Massachusetts. “Police going into schools and searching for books is the sort of thing you hear about in communist China and Russia. What are we doing?”

The school’s librarian, Jennifer Guerin, said it was “critically important for concerned community members to remember that the current situation is not about forcing a book into students’ hands.”

“It’s about the freedom to read. It’s about providing voluntary access to a well-written, highly acclaimed resource in a safe place for a teenager who might want or need it,” she said, according to the Berkshire Eagle, which first reported the news.

Book bans have taken root in schools across the country, with Florida and Texas banning vast multitudes of books.

In August, one Texas school district pulled Anne Frank’s Diary, as well as the Bible after community members complained.

A Moms of Liberty chapter in Florida also got five books banned from a school district after arguing they had graphic depictions of sex, violence, pedophilia, bestiality, and other subject matters."

Surveillance cameras allegedly caught Neal Milano, 76, using a black permanent marker to scrawl out the nasty message — as well as homophobic and sexist slurs — across eight walls on four separate floors of the Sunnyside building on Nov. 2, the Queens District Attorney’s Office said.

Milano was released without bail at his Thursday arraignment in Queens Supreme Court on a 10-count indictment, including for hate crime charges.

The accused creep, who at one point was the property manager of the 39th Place building, has long caused tensions there.

“He always seems intoxicated. He’s a real problem,” one of the residents, a man who asked to remain anonymous, told The Post on Thursday.

Milano allegedly spray-painted the vile missive about Hamas on every floor of the building, including in the stairwell, said the neighbor.

6 Surveillance cameras allegedly caught Milano using a black permanent marker to scrawl out the nasty message, as well as homophobic and sexist slurs across 8 walls on 4 separate floors of the Sunnyside building.

“Everybody pretty much feels the same. Everybody in the building wants him to leave,” he said.

In 2017, when Milano was the condo’s property manager, he filled the space with a strange mix of hyper-patriotic posters and images of Hitler and Mussolini, and tenants told The Post at the time that he ruled the building with an iron fist.

A year later, Milano was acquitted by a Queens judge of all counts after he was accused of repeatedly harassing a 43-year-old tenant, including grabbing her by the neck and arm, calling her slurs and threatening to “burn the building down.”

Before the ruling, he defended hanging Nazi and other imagery in the building lobby, saying, “It’s history! You can’t change history!”

“There was a picture of Hitler and the Nazi flag next to a bigger picture of Churchill and the British flag! It’s history, it’s WWII!” he said at the time.

The current super said that Milano was no longer the manager of the building, which was free of the eclectic decorations when The Post visited Thursday.

He and every other member of the condo-board have a restraining order out against Milano, the super said.

“He lives here but all he can do is come in and go out,” the super said.

“He was told by the judge he can go straight in and he can go to his apartment and when he leaves he has to come straight out, no stops. No, if he sees one of us he has to lower his gaze, look at the floor and continue out.”

6 Before the ruling, he defended hanging Nazi and other imagery in the building lobby, saying, “It’s history! You can’t change history!”

A woman who lives on Milano’s floor said she and her husband are “terrified” of him before pointing out his massive red pick-up that had every window, including the windshield, blacked out, and was creepily idling within earshot from where she spoke to The Post.

“The red pickup truck with the engine running across the street. That’s him, he’s watching you right now,” she said.

6 Neighbors described Milano as a terrifying and frequently drunk animal who constantly causes issues for the rest of the building.

The nervous neighbor said that Milano was “usually very drunk” and “getting in an argument with people.”

“He also writes ‘kill the super’ inside the trash chutes. He’s always screaming and cursing at the super,” she added.

The super, who said he was the one who called 911 on Milano over the vile graffiti, said the building received a fresh coat of paint to cover the missives after the police investigation concluded.

6 A woman who lives on Milano’s floor said she and her husband are “terrified” of him before pointing out his massive red pick-up that has every single window, including the windshield, blacked out.

Milano was charged with one count of criminal mischief in the third degree as a hate crime, one count of criminal mischief in the third degree and eight counts of making graffiti.

He faces up to seven years behind bars if convicted.

Milano’s defense attorney Kevin O’Donnell said that his client entered a not-guilty plea earlier Thursday.

“He looks forward to defending the charges,” O’Donnell said.

Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz slammed Milano’s alleged actions, saying, “Hateful and bias-motivated attacks have no place in our communities and this shameful aggression will not be tolerated.”

“The defendant will be held accountable for the serious charges against him,” Katz said in a statement.

Milano is scheduled to appear in court next on Jan. 30."

“Mr. President, I believe you are guilty of treason and should be publicly hung,” Schneider, 63, wrote in the message that was screenshot by multiple outlets. “Your son too,” he added, presumably about Hunter.

“Your response is..? Sincerely, John Schneider,” he concluded.

The country singer reportedly wrote the tweet in response to the current president’s message, which reads, “Trump poses many threats to our country: The right to choose, civil rights, voting rights, and America’s standing in the world. But the greatest threat he poses is to our democracy. If we lose that, we lose everything.”

When contacted by The Post for comment, Schneider defended his words.

“Seriously, folks? This is my final comment on this. I neither said nor implied any such thing. Despite headlines claiming otherwise, in my post, I absolutely did not call for an act of violence or threaten a U.S. president as many other celebrities have done in the past. I suggest you re-read my actual post and pay attention to the words before believing this nonsense.”

He continued, “It’s my position, which I am entitled to have, that some of our nations leaders in Washington have lost their way, and corruption runs rampant, both on our nation’s borders and abroad. Transparency and accountability must happen in order for our constitutional republic to survive. There is no threat implied or otherwise in that statement. “

The Secret Service also told The Post in a statement, “The Secret Service is aware of the comments made by Mr. Schneider, and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence. We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.”

Schneider has never shied away from expressing his distaste for the president, 81, claiming in an October tweet that he “funded the Hamas barbaric and inhumane attack on Israel.”

In 2018, he told Fox News that there was “a bias against conservatives, Republicans, in Hollywood,” which he believed was why he was serving jail time for failing to pay alimony to his estranged ex-wife, Elvira Castle.

Schneider’s most recent comment comes just one day after he came in second as Donut on “The Masked Singer” to R&B singer Ne-Yo, who was dressed as Cow for the show.

The actor claimed the Fox program is “really the glue that held me together for the last couple of months” as he is grieving his wife, Alicia, who died of breast cancer in February.

“It was one of the shows that Alicia really wanted me to do,” Schneider told People. “She would always say, ‘You’ve got to do ‘The Masked Singer.’ I fully expected one day for Alicia to be there to help … so when that opportunity came, I just had to kind of look toward heaven and kind of laugh because, of course, she still runs things but further away. And then, when they said, ‘We’d kind of like you to be a Donut.'”

He continued, “Every Saturday, Alicia would go down to our local donut store, get me a bag of apple fritters. And I would eat one, only one, but donuts had been part of my life. For a long time, they were part of Alicia’s and I’s marriage and relationship. So again, they said, ‘Donut,’ and I just had to look up at the sky and go, ‘Well, of course. This is you. It’s got to be you.'”"

John Fetterman.

That’s according to the man himself, who told the New York Times in a story published Thursday that “I have found out over the last couple years … that the right, and now the left, are hoping that I die.

“There are ones that are rooting for another blood clot,” the Pennsylvania Democrat added, referencing his near-fatal stroke from last year. “They have both now been wishing that I die.”

Once beloved by the far left, Fetterman, 54, has rankled many activists with his staunch support of Israel following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, and now insists that he’s “not a progressive.”

In response, disgruntled left-wingers have referred to him with the X hashtag “#GenocideJohn” and some have even berated him in person.

The hulking Pennsylvanian, famous for strutting around the Senate in oversized shorts and hoodies, bemoaned what he described as “purity tests” set by his former fellow travelers.

“It’s just a place where I’m not,” he told the Times. “I don’t feel like I’ve left the [progressive] label; it’s just more that it’s left me.”

“I’m not critical if someone is a progressive … I just believe in different things.”

Back in 2016, Fetterman backed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) bid for the presidency and billed himself as “a Democrat and a progressive.”

He later endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after Sanders exited the race.

“This bizarre purity thing, where people were offended that I was embracing Secretary Clinton when we have Trump on the other side?” Fetterman reflected. “How did that work out for you?”

As mayor of Braddock, Pa. and then as lieutenant governor of the Keystone State, the Democrat earned a reputation for backing many far-left wish list items.

Fetterman insists that he still wants federal legalization of marijuana, a $15 national minimum wage, and universal healthcare.

But his support of Israel and recent admission that he doesn’t believe “it’s unreasonable to have a secured border” have rubbed some on his side of the aisle the wrong way.

“Whenever I’m in a situation to be called on to take up the cause of strengthening and enhancing the security of Israel or deepening our relationship between the United States and Israel, I’m going to lean in,” Fetterman told Jewish Insider in April of last year.

“I would also respectfully say that I’m not really a progressive in that sense.”

On Thursday, he expressed bewilderment to the Times that “the very left progressives in America don’t seem to want to support really the only progressive nation in the [Middle East] that really embraces the same kind of values I would expect we would want as a society.”

“I’m not really sure,” he added, “what part of any of this would be a surprise if anyone’s been paying attention.”"

When researchers sought volunteers for the study, mostly women raised their hands “because for them it’s much more socially acceptable to cry,” Ph.D. student Shani Agron, who spearheaded the work, said in a statement.

However, the researchers hypothesized that the tears don’t need to come from a woman to have a similar effect.

Previous studies with rodents found that female mouse tears reduce fighting among male mice, and male mole rats smear themselves with their own tears to avoid being attacked by alpha mice, the Weizmann Institute noted.

Scientists said other research also shows that sniffing tears reduces testosterone.

“Given previous findings showing lower testosterone levels in men following sniffing tears and the findings in rodents showing that tears reduce aggression, we hypothesized that tears would act the same in humans; however, we were surprised by the size of the effect in the lab,” Agron told Newsweek.

After collecting tears from six female volunteers who watched sad films, researchers exposed dozens of men to the tears or a saline liquid.

They couldn’t distinguish between the substances since both are clear and odorless.

The men then played a computer game, used in other aggression studies, with players collecting money that their opponent attempts to steal from them.

Players can get revenge and make their opponent lose money, even though they wouldn’t gain more money for themselves.

After smelling women’s tears, the men’s desire to seek revenge fell 43.7%.

These results are similar to the study findings involving rodents, but unlike rodents, humans don’t have a structure in their noses that detects odorless chemical signals.

The researchers dug deeper by studying 62 olfactory receptors, which play a key role in the sense of smell, finding that four were activated by tears, but not saline.

They also hooked study participants to MRI machines and noted that after smelling tears, the areas of the brain linked to aggression — the prefrontal cortex and the anterior insula — were less active.

Scientists believe that the substance of tears may have evolved to protect babies from harm.

“Babies can’t say: ‘Stop being aggressive towards me.’ They are very limited in their ability to communicate, and they are helpless as well. They have a vested interest in lowering aggression and that reflects the sad reality of aggression towards babies,” Noam Sobel, a Weizmann professor of neurobiology, told the Guardian.

Dr. Minna Lyons, a Liverpool John Moores University psychologist, told the Guardian that the findings are “remarkable,” but people shouldn’t draw significant conclusions.

“In real life, things may play out differently. The tears of the target of domestic violence may do little in reducing aggression of the perpetrator. Why does the chemosignaling not work in these circumstances?” she said.

“The social context of crying is massively complicated, and I suspect the reduction of aggression is just one of the many potential functions of tears,” Lyons added."

The Israeli military released video Thursday of a huge series of explosions demolishing the tunnels in the upscale Rimal neighborhood in Gaza City that once housed Hamas’ upper echelons.

Col. Benny Aharon, who gave a tour to reporters two days before the demolition, said the homes and offices of Hamas’ top Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar and military chief Muhammad Deif were linked to the tunnel network, The Times of Israel reports.

Also located in the ritzy neighborhood was the home of the daughter of Hamas’ top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh.

The Jewish state believes Sinwar and Deif were operating in the tunnels beneath Palestine Square when their forces stormed Israel on Oct. 7, slaughtering 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 240 others.

The IDF located about 20 tunnel shafts that led to the Palestine Square underground network, with some entrances located just a few feet from the main traffic circle of the neighborhood.

Aharon told reporters that the electricity used throughout the tunnels was available because Hamas siphoned power from civilian generators and solar panels, with enough energy stolen to allow terrorists to “survive down there for months.”

Given its location and size in such a populated area, Aharon claimed it was “not possible that people did not know what was going on here.”

5 Inside the tunnel system, the IDF found several Hamas weapons and equipment. IDF

Along with the electrical system, the IDF found several weapons in the tunnels, including guns, rockets and equipment for nighttime operations.

The destruction of the tunnel was carried out by Aharon’s 401st Armored Brigade, along with the elite Yahalom combat engineering unit, which have decimated Hamas’ forces in northern Gaza.

After nearly two months of fighting across northern Gaza, the IDF said Wednesday night that its ground offensive in the area is nearing its end as only a handful of Hamas bases remain.

5 The tunnel system beneath Palestine Square had about 20 major entrances. IDF

Over the past 24 hours, the IDF said it has carried out airstrikes against 230 Hamas targets.

The United Nations estimates that more than 1.8 million Palestinians, 85% of the population, have been displaced by the war after fleeing northern Gaza.

The UN added that nearly 20% of all of Gaza’s buildings and infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli strikes."
61,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"US, China military leaders hold first call in more than a year",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/us-china-military-leaders-hold-first-call-in-more-than-a-year/,"WASHINGTON – The top military officials from the US and China held a long-awaited call Thursday, ending a 16-month standoff during which Beijing cut all armed forces contacts with Washington.

Chief of the Joint Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown and his counterpart, Gen. Liu Zhenli of China’s Joint Staff, spoke via videoconference to discuss “a number of global and regional security issues,” according to the Pentagon.

“General Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain open and direct lines of communication,” Joint Staff Spokesperson Navy Capt. Jereal Dorsey said in a statement.

“Gen. Brown reiterated the importance of the People’s Liberation Army engaging in substantive dialogue to reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings,” he added.

It was the first time that any Pentagon official has spoken with a Chinese military leader since August 2022, when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a controversial trip to Taiwan.

The move infuriated China – which has said its No. 1 goal is to absorb the island – and Beijing cut off dialogue with the US.

The call came about a month after President Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping while the two were in San Francisco for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

Resuming military-to-military communications was one of the major agreements to come out of the hours-long meeting.

Critical calls

During China’s silent treatment, defense officials repeatedly bemoaned the lack of contact between the two adversaries, calling it dangerous to close lines of communication in the event of a close call, troubling interaction, or other misunderstanding.

5 “General Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain open and direct lines of communication,” Navy Capt. Jereal Dorsey said in a statement. AP

“Beijing has consistently denied or ignored US requests for defense engagements at multiple levels,” the Defense Department said. “Those concerns have been amplified as US officials observe increasingly provocative and risky behavior on the part of China’s military.“

The point was made clear early this year when the US military detected a Chinese spy balloon entering US airspace.

Beijing ignored the Pentagon’s calls seeking an explanation, opting to publicly deny intentionally sending the balloon into US airspace and claiming it was a civilian airship that blew off course.

The balloon ultimately traversed US airspace from Alaska to North Carolina, where the Air Force finally shot down the surveillance craft after its weeklong trip over the country, irking Beijing.

While Thursday’s call brought optimism, Pentagon spokesman Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to say whether Liu had agreed to continue regular communication or reactivate the military-to-military emergency hotline.

“I’m not going to speak for China, but clearly … we’re going to continue to do everything we can do to keep those lines of communication open,” he said.

Still, Dorsey said Brown advocated during the call for regular conversations on “defense policy coordination” and opening communications between the commanders of the US Indo-Pacific Command and China’s eastern and southern theater commands.

Avoiding unintentional conflict

Brown also called for resuming the countries’ commitments to the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement, which was signed in 1998 and established a routine of regular talks between the two nations on maritime safety until the US-China relationship soured in 2020.

Maritime talks are critical to maintaining peace in the western Pacific, where the US Navy regularly patrols and challenges Beijing’s illegal claims to islands and reefs in the South China Sea.

There have been multiple close calls and dangerous encounters between the two nations’ navies over the past year as the Chinese military attempted to chase away US ships in international waters.

“China respects the rights of navigation and overflight entitled to all countries in the South China Sea in accordance with international law,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang. “However, we firmly oppose any action that undermines China’s sovereignty and security in the name of freedom of navigation and overflight.”

Such risks also extend to the air. Between 2021 and 2023, the US saw China conduct more than 180 “coercive and risky air intercepts” with American military aircraft in the region, according to the Pentagon’s latest China Military Power report.

“Defense officials have noted a steep rise in China’s risky and aggressive intercepts of US aircraft operating in international airspace in accordance with international law,” according to the DoD.

Should lines of communication remain open, the Pentagon hopes to avoid miscalculations after such encounters that otherwise could unintentionally spark conflict – or even war.

While Brown “regularly communicates with chiefs of defense across the world,” Dorsey said, it was the first time he had such a high-profile call since taking over the position from Army Gen. Mark Milley in September.

“[He] remains open to constructive dialogue with the PRC,” said Dorsey, using the official acronym for China."

House Education and Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) wrote a letter on Wednesday to Harvard Corporation senior fellow Penny Pritzker demanding internal documents and communications about the scandal.

Foxx’s letter questions whether the university’s governing body is holding Gay to “the same standards” as students after her work was flagged for dozens of instances of copying other academics — including portions of her 1997 Ph.D. thesis.

The Post first contacted Harvard about the seemingly improper citations nearly two months ago — and was subsequently threatened with a defamation suit if it published a story based on the allegations.

As part of the probe, Foxx has requested any records about the university’s “public response to media inquiries.”

House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY), another member of the committee and a Harvard alumna, has also vowed to exercise “every tool at our disposal including subpoena power” to hold Gay accountable.

“Harvard University’s pathetic record of stifling free speech has expanded beyond campus, threatening the New York Post following their investigation and coverage of Claudine Gay’s history of serial plagiarism,” Stefanik told The Post Thursday.

“This attempt at bullying and subsequent censorship is entirely unacceptable; the Congressional investigation will use every tool at our disposal including subpoena power to expose the rot of antisemitism plaguing higher education and the hypocrisy of the poisoned ivy towers of Harvard. This is a reckoning.”

The committee letter also notes that Harvard’s federal funding is conditioned on its compliance with standards of academic integrity overseen by the New England Commission of Higher Education and asks the university to “provide assurance” those standards are being upheld by handing over records.

“If a university is willing to look the other way and not hold faculty accountable for engaging in academically dishonest behavior, it cheapens its mission and the value of its education,” Foxx wrote. “Students must be evaluated fairly, under known standards — and have a right to see that faculty are, too.”

The investigation comes after Gay was hauled before Congress Dec. 5 to testify about antisemitism on Harvard’s campus, during which she was pressed by Stefanik about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violated the university’s codes of conduct related to bullying and harassment.

Gay said allowance for the speech would depend on “context,” refusing to give a yes-or-no answer and adding that the words only could warrant action if it rose to the level of bullying, harassment and intimidation.

“Without sufficient action from the Harvard Corporation, the ‘depends on the context president’ will also be forever marred as the ‘plagiarism president,’ and a great stain will mark Harvard’s legacy,” Foxx said in a statement.

“While the antisemitism and plagiarism investigations being conducted by the Committee are separate and distinct, they both raise questions of hypocrisy in academia. In this case, how could a serial plagiarizer like Claudine Gay hold a student accountable for plagiarism ever again?”

On Oct. 24, The Post contacted Harvard about 27 instances of Gay’s plagiarism in two academic papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 2011 and 2017, as well as an academic magazine article from 1993.

7 “Without sufficient action from the Harvard Corporation, the ‘depends on the context president’ will also be forever marred as the ‘plagiarism president,’ and a great stain will mark Harvard’s legacy,” Foxx said in a statement. AP

The university’s senior executive director of media relations and communications, Jonathan Swain, a former Hillary Clinton aide and member of the Biden-Harris transition team, responded he would “get back in touch over the next couple of days.”

The next communication The Post received, on Oct. 27, was from Thomas Clare, a Virginia-based defamation lawyer with the firm Clare-Locke who shared a 15-page letter with comments from the academics cited by Gay denying she plagiarized their work.

Clare further threatened The Post with a lawsuit if a story about any plagiarism allegations went to press.

However, the Clare letter was sent two days before the Harvard Corporation had even begun an internal review of Gay’s potential plagiarism, according to the university’s student newspaper.

Harvard’s governing body asked a four-person subcommittee and three-person independent panel of experts to separately investigate the allegations.

On Wednesday, Harvard announced the joint review found “examples of duplicative language without appropriate attribution” in Gay’s 1997 doctoral dissertation, but concluded it did not rise to the level of plagiarism, the Boston Globe reported.

“President Gay will update her dissertation correcting these instances of inadequate citation,” a summary of the review stated.

That same day, however, Harvard received more than 40 new allegations of plagiarism against Gay in a 37-page document, which was obtained and first reported on by the Washington Free Beacon.

The firestorm has only added to calls from members of the House Education and Workforce Committee to conduct a thorough investigation of Harvard, its president and its policies.

“Harvard has been terrified of losing donations and taxpayer funding since they were exposed for harboring antisemitism,” Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who sits on the committee, told The Post.

“Claudine Gay claimed to support free speech and truthful inquiry in her congressional testimony, but now the university is threatening journalists and lying to protect its reputation and over $50 billion endowment. It’s shameful.”"

The cruise ship Maud, en route to England, lost its ability to navigate after its electricity went out, the Danish Joint Rescue Coordination Centre said, according to Reuters.

Punishing winds shattered windows on the bridge of the vessel, causing water to flood in.

A “temporary loss of power” occurred after Maud was struck by a “rogue wave,” ship owner HX told The Post in a statement.

The ship, which also had 131 crew members on it, was sailing from Floroe in Norway to Tilbury in the UK, a centre spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the Danish Joint Rescue Coordination Centre said that the “situation is under control” and the ship is being steered manually from the engine room, though it can’t navigate.

Authorities plan on towing the vessel to a Danish port around 10:30 p.m. local time overseas.

The cruise company said “no serious passenger or crew injuries” were reported due to the incident and the ship’s condition is “stable.”

“In line with our robust operational protocols, in addition to assuring the wellbeing of all aboard, the crew immediately conducted thorough safety checks and technical assessments,” HX said.

“Further assessments are now being made for onward sailing. The ship is in direct contact with the relevant maritime authorities and shoreside support teams.”

HX is a unit of Norway’s Hurtigruten Group."

Tyler Anderson, 30, of Dover, now faces three counts of transmitting an interstate threat and could receive 15 years in prison if convicted on all charges, according to court documents.

Anderson was initially arrested Dec. 9 and charged with threatening graphic violence a day earlier in response to a Ramaswamy campaign message advertising an appearance in Portsmouth.

“Great, another opportunity for me to blow [Ramaswamy’s] brains out!,” Anderson allegedly replied, adding in a subsequent message: “I’m going to kill everyone who attends and then f— their corpses.”

The new charges relate to messages Anderson allegedly sent Nov. 22 in which he threatened to “impale” and “disembowel” one candidate, and a Dec. 6 message to a third campaign in which he said, “now I know where to go so I can blow that bastard’s head off” and added, “Hope you have the stamina for a mass shooting!”

The other two candidates allegedly threatened by Anderson were not identified by prosecutors, but the Dec. 6 message answered by Anderson used slogans associated with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Anderson was released on bail last week after his defense team contended he had no intention of following through on the threats, according to WMUR-TV.

The judge agreed, noting the defendant has no prior record, but insisted that Anderson take mental health medication, enroll in a mental health program, avoid contact of any kind with presidential candidates and not possess any weapons.

“We have seen an increase in threats of violence against public officials and those seeking public office across the country, and I have made clear that these types of illegal threats undermine the function of our democracy,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement responding to Thursday’s new charges.

“We will not tolerate illegal threats of violence directed at public officials or those seeking public office.”

Anderson is due back in court early next month, days before the state’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary, which is set for Jan. 23."
66,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Our child has ADHD — the Adderall shortage is costing our family $280 more a month we can’t afford,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/lifestyle/adderall-shortage-costing-family-280-more-a-month-it-cant-afford/,"A nationwide shortage of drugs that treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has forced some patients to shell out hundreds more for pricey, brand-name alternatives.

A new analysis from USA Today found that the prices that retail community pharmacies pay for common ADHD medications have outpaced inflation, and in some cases, have doubled or tripled in the last year.

The Food and Drug Administration announced a shortage of Adderall in October 2022 due to “ongoing intermittent manufacturing delays” at companies that make the drug.

According to recent studies, an estimated 6 million children and 11 million adults suffer from ADHD. Adderall is a popular stimulant prescribed to improve focus and attention.

The Adderall shortage spurred patients to seek out alternatives — in turn, those ADHD meds became hard to find and prices increased.

A Delaware mom — whose husband and 17-year-old daughter also have ADHD — told USA Today that the Adderall shortage prompted their doctor to switch her daughter’s prescription to Vyvanse, the only option they could find.

The mom — whom USA Today only identified by her first name, Sam — shared that the monthly amount they pay after insurance rose from less than $20 to $300.

Without insurance, a supply of 100 capsules of Vyvanse costs around $1,306, according to Drugs.com.

GoodRx, which provides coupons for medications, says generic Vyvanse costs $100, while the brand-name Vyvanse starts at $369, which is slightly higher than the cost of brand-name Adderall.

Sam told USA Today that ADHD medication is now too expensive for herself and her husband — their daughter’s health and education are the top priorities.

“With medication and accommodations at school, my daughter is a straight-A student. Without the medication, she’s failing,” Sam explained. “It’s that stark of a difference.”

In addition to the price surge, Sam said there ends up being an “additional ADHD tax” since they have to travel far distances to pharmacies that have the drugs in stock.

“You can’t really compare it, but if there was a shortage of cancer drugs, there would be a lot more uproar than there is with the shortage of ADHD medication because people don’t seem to realize this is a disability,” Sam said. “It is very debilitating. It does have quite an impact on your quality of life.”

As far as the ADHD drug shortage goes, USA Today reports that the Drug Enforcement Administration said it has been adjusting its quota restrictions to increase production of ADHD stimulants.

“DEA has been in communication with the relevant manufacturers, and 17 out of 18 manufacturers have informed us that they will use their allotted quota amounts and increase production of stimulant medications,” the agency wrote in a letter early last month."
67,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Prominent professor whom Claudine Gay allegedly copied calls for her to be fired, says Harvard needs to get ‘back towards sanity’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/carol-swain-calls-for-claudine-gay-to-be-fired-from-harvard/,"A prominent professor has called for the immediate sacking of Harvard University president Claudine Gay to steer the school “back towards sanity” after she allegedly plagiarized other academics’ work 40 times.

Political science professor Dr. Carol Swain, formerly of Vanderbilt University, claims Gay used sections of a book she published in 1993 and an article published in 1997 without crediting her.

“Fire Claudine Gay posthaste,” Swain posted Thursday on X, as part of a post titled “Some free unsolicited advice for Harvard University.”

“She can be relieved of duties until the terms are negotiated.

“Hire the best man or woman who can steer the university back towards sanity.”

She also told the Ivy League college it needs to stop “appeasing the Marxist identity politics mob,” saying it “should not be a consideration,” in their decision-making processes.

Harvard University did not respond to a request for comment from The Post Thursday.

Swain also urged the prestigious Ivy League school to “apologize to alumni, students, parents, and donors who have been harmed and embarrassed.”

“Have a sit-down conversation with the people who have been harmed by the plagiarism of Gay and the system that protects her,” Swain continued.

She added she was “weighing [her] options” in response to a question from a follower about whether she planned to take legal action against Gay.

Plagiarism allegations against Gay first surfaced earlier this month, with accusations that she lifted other scholars’ works in her 1997 doctoral thesis and that four papers published between 1993 and 2017 did not include proper attribution.

Gay remains president of the college and an investigation by the university cleared her of research misconduct.

Although she will update attribution in three instances of her work, the university said it is standing by her on Thursday, according to the Wall Street Journal.

An earlier statement on December 12 from the Harvard Corporation, the school’s highest governing body, said officials became aware of claims of plagiarism in late October and had initiated an independent review. That found no misconduct, and a review deemed further plagiarism claims submitted earlier this week “without merit,” according to the WSJ.

In the aftermath of that statement, The Post revealed how Harvard had actually covered up a weeks-long investigation into whether Gay had used other researchers’ work without crediting it and hired a bulldog law firm to help cover it up.

In a statement to the Boston Globe, Gay has vehemently defended her academic rigor, saying: “I stand by the integrity of my scholarship. Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards.”

Swain previously blasted Gay in an essay for the same newspaper, in which she wrote: “Ms. Gay had no problem riding on the coattails of people whose work she used without proper attribution. Many of those whose work she pilfered aren’t as incensed as I am. They are elites who have benefited from a system that protects its own.”

The plagiarism allegations have attracted the attention of Congress, with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce expanding an already existing investigation into antisemitism on the college campus to include the accusations of plagiarism, according to the Harvard Crimson.

Gay was already under fire over her handling of antisemitic behavior on campus following the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel and her responses at a separate congressional hearing about them where she refused to condemn Harvard students calling for the genocide of Jews.

In the ensuing firestorm, a bipartisan group of members of Congress introduced a resolution calling for Gay to resign from her position, but the college also stood by her at that time too."
68,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Ron DeSantis calls Trump indictments biggest regret of the campaign: ‘Distorted the primary’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/ron-desantis-reveals-his-biggest-regret-of-the-campaign/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis opened up Thursday about the one thing he wishes he could change about the 2024 campaign: Donald Trump’s legal trouble.

DeSantis ripped the four indictments against the 77-year-old as unfair and lamented that they had “distorted” the GOP primary process — while also warning that they could spell doom for Trump in the general election.

“I wish Trump hadn’t been indicted on any of this stuff,” DeSantis told Christian Broadcasting Network host David Brody.

“From [Manhattan DA] Alvin Bragg on, I’ve criticized the cases … that’s distorting justice, which is bad, but I also think it distorted the primary.”

The 45-year-old posited that the indictments both turbocharged Trump’s support among Republican voters and prevented his rivals from getting traction in the race.

“It also has just crowded out so much other stuff, and it’s sucked out a lot of oxygen,” DeSantis said.

Bragg secured the first indictment against Trump in late March, charging him with 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments to former adult film star Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal.

At that time, polls showed DeSantis within sight of Trump in the race for the Republican nomination.

But from the time of the first indictment, Trump’s lead has skyrocketed to the current 52.2-point spread in the RealClearPolitics average.

In all, Trump faces 91 criminal counts in two federal cases, a state case out of Georgia and the Manhattan case.

“I think the Democrats have had a plan on this,” DeSantis told Brody. “I think the media has a plan on this. And I think if it gets to the point where six months from now, Trump’s the presumptive nominee and he’s having to go through all this, they have a plan for how they’re going to ride this out.”

On Wednesday, the Sunshine State Republican criticized the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove the 45th president from the primary ballot, echoing a similar concern.

“They’re doing all this stuff to basically solidify support in the primary for him, get him into the general,” he said at a campaign stop in Iowa. “And the whole general election is going to be all this legal stuff.”

DeSantis has campaigned aggressively in Iowa, seeking to build momentum against Trump ahead of the Jan. 15 caucuses.

The Florida governor has scored coveted endorsements from Gov. Kim Reynolds and evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats.

However, the RCP average shows Trump leading DeSantis by 32.7 percentage points.

“Trump does obviously have a certain segment that’s very strong,” he explained. “A lot of these people, though, that come up in these polls, a lot of them are soft. I mean, they remember him, they liked his policies, but they are willing to vote for somebody else.”

Throughout the campaign, DeSantis has tried to drive home a message that Trump failed to deliver on his promises and would likely lose in the general election.

“Ron DeSanctus has plenty of things he wishes he could have changed, from hiring Jeff Roe to run his super PAC, to wearing awkward lifts in his shoes, to announcing his campaign on Spaces that was bangled from the start, to hiring his personal cronies with no presidential experience,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told The Post in response.

“But above all, he probably wishes he wouldn’t have run in the first place so he wouldn’t have to humiliate himself on the campaign trail every single day.”"

Clarissa Hernandez, 27, from Texas, had downed a pint of tequila minutes before getting behind the wheel of her Land Rover early Aug. 11 and plowing into an electronic signboard in Palm Springs that read, “Don’t Drink & Drive,” according to a police statement.

The impact of the crash shattered the sign, but cops said the situation could have been much worse because the sloshed driver had narrowly avoided colliding with a group of pedestrians leaving a nearby theater.

Officers who were posted at the checkpoint near the crash scene ran over and saw Hernandez staggering away from her wrecked vehicle.

“Her eyes were bloodshot, red and watery, and her speech was slurred. She swayed forward and back continuously,” read an incident report cited by the station KESQ.

Hernandez even leaned on the smashed sign resting on its side to steady herself as she walked, police said.

Far from showing remorse for what happened, the woman was described in the report as “angry, argumentative and hostile.”

When questioned about her alcohol intake, Hernandez reportedly admitted that she had imbibed the tequila just 10 minutes before careening into the sign.

At one point, Hernandez allegedly swung a hand at an officer who tried to stop her from leaving the crash scene.

On Wednesday, Hernandez pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count each of driving under the influence of alcohol and willfully resisting, and was sentenced to three years of probation."
70,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Travel chaos in the UK as strong winds from Storm Pia disrupt holiday travel just days before Christmas,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/travel-chaos-in-the-uk-as-strong-winds-from-storm-pia-disrupt-holiday-travel-just-days-before-christmas/,"LONDON — High winds from Storm Pia on Thursday grounded flights in parts of the U.K., suspended train service and stopped Scottish ferries in a preview of holiday travel disruptions likely to hit northern Europe as the storm moved east.

Meanwhile, in a development unrelated to weather, a surprise strike by French workers added to the travel chaos by shutting down Eurostar trains between London and Paris, leaving thousands of travelers stranded.

Powerful gusts knocked out power to tens of thousands of homes in northern England, toppled a truck on a highway in Manchester, tore part of the roof off an apartment building in Sheffield and — in a bit of good news — helped generate a record amount of electricity.

A gust of 115 mph was recorded on Cairngorm Summit in the Scottish Highlands as the national meteorological service warned of winds up to 80 mph in northern Scotland and 55 mph in northern England and Northern Ireland. There was also an ice and snow warning for the Shetland Islands, where schools were closed.

The storm struck as travelers took to the roads, rails and skies to get ahead of holiday traffic expected to peak Friday.

As wind warnings expired Thursday afternoon, the storm bore down on Europe and was expected to bring similar troubles there.

Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport warned that “a significant number of flights” would be delayed or canceled due to the high winds.

Dutch authorities closed a number of storm barriers on major rivers as a precaution due to high water levels.

The storm was expected to reach southern Sweden on Thursday evening with a thunderstorm, heavy snowfall and poor visibility across the region, the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute said.

In Germany, national railway operator Deutsche Bahn said there were delays and cancelations to trains in Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony, the two biggest states on the North Sea coast. Lines affected included those from Hannover to Berlin and Frankfurt, and from Hamburg to and from western Germany and Denmark.

The Federal Office for Shipping and Hydrography warned of a possible storm surge Thursday evening on the North Sea coast, which could bring water levels up to 2.5 meters (8.20 feet) higher than mean high tide. Some ferries to or from North Sea islands were canceled for Thursday or Friday.

In the U.K., gusts knocked down trees that blocked roads and struck power lines, causing blackouts to 40,000 households in northeast England, energy company Northern Powergrid said.

A driver was hospitalized when a tree crashed onto his car in Clifton, Derbyshire.

The winds generated a record of 21.8 gigawatts of electricity, supplying 56% of all the power that was being used from the grid in Great Britain between 8 and 8:30 a.m., National Grid Electricity System Operator said. It surpassed the previous record of 21.6 gigawatts.

British Airways grounded two dozen flights, British broadcaster Sky News reported. A spokesperson for the airline did not provide further details but issued a statement saying it apologized to customers for having to “make some adjustments” to its schedule.

National Rail said speed restrictions for trains were in place across Scotland, and parts of England and Wales. ScotRail said it suspended service on some of its lines, and TransPennine Express asked train passengers to delay their journeys in and out of Edinburgh through most of the day.

Ferry operator CalMac canceled its service to 22 islands off the west coast of Scotland."
71,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Iowa Republicans more likely to back Trump after ‘poisoning the blood’ rant: poll,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/iowans-more-likely-to-back-trump-after-poisoning-the-blood-rant-poll/,"A plurality of likely Iowa Republican caucusgoers say former President Donald Trump’s recent comment that illegal immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” make them more likely to support him, a new poll shows.

A Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom survey found 42% said the statement made them more likely to caucus for Trump, while 28% said the rant made them less likely to back the 77-year-old.

Another 29% said the comment “did not matter,” and 2% were unsure.

Trump made the remarks to supporters at a Dec. 16 rally in Durham, NH, while heavily inflating the number of illegal immigrants who have entered the US since President Biden took office.

“When they let, I think the real number is 15, 16 million people into our country, when they do that, we got a lot of work to do,” the 45th president said. “They’re poisoning the blood of our country. That’s what they’ve done.”

Politicians on both sides of the aisle have since denounced the rhetoric — even as Trump doubled down days later at a Waterloo, Iowa, rally.

“I don’t believe, as the former president said again yesterday, that immigrants are polluting our blood,” Biden responded in a Wednesday speech at the Wisconsin Black Chamber of Commerce in Milwaukee. “The economy and our nation are stronger when we tap into the full range of talents in this nation.”

Vice President Kamala Harris said in an interview later that night with MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell that people have “rightfully” found Trump’s words “similar to the language” of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.

6 “I don’t believe, as the former president said again yesterday, that immigrants are polluting our blood,” President Biden responded in a Wednesday speech. AP

Hitler’s 1925 autobiography-manifesto “Mein Kampf” speaks about the “poison” of “foreign blood” being introduced into the “national body” of Germany, which he said would dilute the “purity” of the Aryan race.

Trump has since said he “never read ‘Mein Kampf’” and argued that his comments were made “in a much different way,” adding that illegal immigration brought crime and disease across the border.

“I don’t know what this means with the blood stuff. I know people are trying to draw historical allusions. I don’t know if that what he meant,” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is likely Iowa Republican voters’ second choice for president, according to the Des Moines Register/NBC/Mediacom poll.

“We need a nominee who’s going to be able to press the case against Biden’s failures without getting involved in, and stepping in it, or doing things that are going to divert attention,” he told Fox News.

“Because now the media is focused on, ‘What did he mean by that?’ instead of focusing on why Biden is failing.”

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is in third place behind DeSantis in Iowa, said the words were “more of the chaos and distraction we’re trying to get rid of.”

“We need to secure the border; we need to make sure that we start catch-and-deport instead of catch-and-release,” Haley told Fox News. “All of those things we need to do — and we can do it without the rhetoric.”

“Let’s fix the border without saying things that are gonna get people riled up,” she added.

Other Republicans mentioned family members who came to the US legally as immigrants, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose wife served in the Trump administration.

“It strikes me that didn’t bother him when he appointed Elaine Chao secretary of transportation,” McConnell said of his wife, who was born in Taiwan and became a naturalized US citizen as a teen.

The Iowa poll also found that 43% of GOP caucusgoers were more likely to vote for Trump after he said “radical left thugs that live like vermin” in the US need to be rooted out, and 50% were more likely to support him after he pledged to authorize “sweeping raids, giant camps, and mass deportations” to crack down on illegal immigration.

The survey, which was conducted Dec. 2-7, reached 502 likely GOP Iowa caucus attendees and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points."
72,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Hamas refuses to hear new hostage deal as Israel says war will ‘not stop’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/hamas-refuses-to-hear-new-hostage-deal-as-israel-says-war-will-not-stop/,"The tense talks for a second temporary truce in the war in Gaza appear to have broken down after Hamas officials became incensed over Israel’s comments that the fighting will resume regardless of a cease-fire.

While negotiations to release as many as 40 hostages appeared to be heading in a positive direction yesterday, Hamas officials said Thursday they would not discuss any hostage exchange deal “except after a full cessation of aggression.”

It echoed Hamas senior official Ghazi Hamad’s recent comments to Al Jazeera, where he accused the Jewish state of trying to lure the terrorist group into a temporary pause rather than seek an end to the war devastating Gaza.

“Some people are looking for a small pause — a pause here and there for one week, two weeks, three weeks,” Hamad said. “But we want to stop the aggression [completely].”

“Israel will take the card of the hostages and after that they will start a new round of mass killing and massacres against our people,” he added. “We will not play this game.”

Hamas’ rejection came following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech Wednesday night in which he reiterated that regardless of any cease-fire, the war will not end until the terrorist group is eradicated.

“Whoever thinks that we will stop is detached from reality,” Netanyahu said. “We are continuing the war to the end. It will continue until Hamas is eliminated — until victory.”

The comments come as Egyptian and Qatari negotiators remain in talks with Israeli and Hamas representatives in an attempt to broker a deal to release 40 additional hostages in exchange for a temporary truce, the freedom of Palestinian prisoners and more aid for Gaza.

“Serious talks between Israel and Hamas through mediators are ongoing in an attempt to break the deadlock, but progress remains slow and there is yet to be a significant breakthrough,” a source briefed on the talks told the Financial Times.

The Jewish state believes that there are still 128 hostages in Gaza, not all of them alive, following the weeklong truce agreement that resulted in 105 captives being freed last month.

On Tuesday, all three major Israeli TV networks presented the Jewish state’s negotiating goals revealing that their government wants to see Hamas free specific hostages, including women, seniors and those with physical or mental illnesses.

President Biden told reporters yesterday that the US was also pushing for Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire deal as reports surfaced that the death toll in Gaza surpassed 20,000.

“We’re pushing it. There’s no expectation at this point, but we are pushing,” Biden said"
73,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,British teenagers ‘obsessed with murder’ convicted of ‘ferocious’ killing of transgender girl,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/british-teenagers-convicted-of-ferocious-murder-of-transgender-girl-brianna-ghey/,"LONDON, Dec 20 – Two British teenagers were found guilty on Wednesday of killing 16-year-old transgender girl Brianna Ghey in a “ferocious attack” in a park in northwest England earlier this year.

The court heard the boy and girl, who were 15 at the time of the murder and cannot be named because of their age, spent months plotting to kill someone and had a list of several potential victims who they knew.

Ghey, who had agreed to meet the girl in a local park, was stabbed 28 times with a hunting knife before her body was spotted by a couple walking their dogs.

Prosecutors said Ghey’s killers had shared hundreds of WhatsApp messages in the run-up to the murder, sharing fantasies about murder and torture, with the girl admitting she enjoyed watching videos about serial killers, murder and torture.

“The planning, the violence and the age of the killers is beyond belief. Brianna Ghey was subjected to a frenzied and ferocious attack and was stabbed 28 times in broad daylight, in a public park,” Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Ursula Doyle of Crown Prosecution Service Mersey Cheshire said.

“Girl X and Boy Y appear to have been a deadly influence on each other and turned their dark fantasies about murder into a reality.”

Speaking outside court, Nigel Parr, Detective Inspector at Cheshire Police, described the killing as “a senseless murder committed by two teenagers who had an obsession with murder, whose only motivation in killing Brianna was to experience what this would be like.”

The pair will be sentenced after Christmas."
74,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Biden calls Mexico president as illegal border crossings break all-time records,https://nypost.com/2023/12/21/news/biden-calls-mexico-president-as-illegal-border-crossings-spike/,"WASHINGTON — President Biden spoke Thursday with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador — but broke little new ground as the number of daily illegal border crossings breaks all-time records with thousands of migrants camped out in border states awaiting processing.

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stressed to reporters that Biden and Lopez Obrador discussed longstanding efforts to address “root causes” of migration as well as tentative ideas to stem the flow of people through Mexico.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at the same briefing that “the president has done everything that he can — right? — on his own… [and] we also need funding” from Congress — drawing a sharp rebuke from the House GOP.

“The White House’s insistence that ‘the president has done everything that he can on his own’ to secure the border is an insult to the American people,” said Raj Shah, a spokesman for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who implored Biden in a Thursday letter to use his presidential powers to halt a mounting humanitarian crisis days from Christmas.

“In fact, it has been this administration’s policies — that President Biden can reverse — that have led to the historic crisis we are seeing on a daily basis,” Shah said.

In describing Biden’s talks with his Mexican counterpart, Kirby stressed that the leaders discussed dealing with underlying issues in other countries as an increasingly diverse group of migrants, including from outside the Americas, cross the border and apply for asylum.

“One of the things that President Lopez Obrador and [Biden] talked about today was trying to work at getting at the root causes of migration,” Kirby said — while also acknowledging an ongoing “big surge” and “significant spike” in illegal crossings.

A three-year Biden administration initiative to reduce illegal immigration by addressing “root causes” such as poverty, crime and corruption — led by Vice President Kamala Harris — has not reduced illegal crossings, the levels of which have risen dramatically.

“There’s a lot of factors and part of that is, of course, dealing with instability and political and domestic instability in the region,” said Kirby, who touted a Venezuela prisoner swap deal reached this week with socialist strongman Nicolas Maduro in which he agreed to free 21 opposition politicians.

“The work that we did with Venezuela here, not just to get Americans back, but to get the Maduro regime to ascribe to certain electoral reforms, that’s important — that’s important to help get at some of the root causes of migration,” he said.

Asked by a reporter whether Biden and Lopez Obrador discussed how to slow the current flow, Kirby said: “They did talk in broad terms about what can be done inside Mexico to slow that process down. And there are some things like checkpoints on rail lines and on highways and that kind of thing and the Mexican Armed Forces presence in the south also can be important to that as well.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will travel to Mexico in the near future to “flesh those modalities out a little bit.”

Kirby at one point admitted “more” must be done on the border — pointing to a pending request for additional funding for border operations and care of migrants allowed into the US.

“Part and parcel of the supplemental request was very much recognizing that more needs to be done on border security. And we’re willing to keep having that conversation with members of Congress,” he said.

The Biden administration has been forced to close two major rail links with Mexico amid the current rush to the border.

Lopez Obrador, whose office did not immediately release a readout of the call, said Thursday morning that Biden had requested the two men speak.

The Mexican leader said “I think migration” would be the topic of the conversation.

“Let’s see what he puts to us,” added Lopez Obrador, who is widely known by his initials, AMLO.

More than 12,600 people reportedly were processed by US Customs and Border Protection officers Monday, the most ever recorded in a single day.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott reacted to the surge by signing a law Monday that would allow state police to arrest people who illegally enter from Mexico — despite prior US Supreme Court rulings that immigration policy cannot be set by individual states.

Lopez Obrador has decried the Texas state law as inhumane.

Johnson, the top-ranking Republican in Washington, sent Biden a letter Thursday warning that “Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is at a breaking point.”

“All of this is the direct result of your administration’s policies,” Johnson wrote. “You have clearly undermined America’s sovereignty and security by ending the Remain in Mexico policy, reinstating catch-and-release, suspending asylum cooperative agreements with other nations, ignoring existing restraints on the abuse of parole, and halting border wall construction.”

“You also undermined Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) core mission, and even used a smartphone app to facilitate the release of border crossers into the United States,” he went on.

The House speaker demanded the president reverse these policies with swift executive action to expedite removals and reform parole and asylum policies and that he make use of Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The federal law would allow Biden to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate” if he “finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”

Johnson added, “The wide-open border has caused unspeakable human tragedy for migrants and certainly for our own citizens.

“Countless children and adults have been victims of human trafficking and cartels have been emboldened and enriched,” he wrote. “Local communities have been devastated and terrorists and dangerous criminals have entered illegally and dispersed across our country. We are now more vulnerable to a terrorist attack on our homeland than ever.”

Winter typically draws fewer migrants due to freezing temperatures along the southwestern frontier, but this month’s spike in crossings comes after years of mounting increases, which Republicans attribute to Biden’s more welcoming policies for asylum seekers.

Many people who illegally cross the border are allowed into the US to await decisions on their claims of persecution, burdening local government resources in New York City and other popular destinations.

After an initial wait period, migrants seeking asylum are entitled to work permits.

The badly backlogged system of check-ins and court dates mean cases can stretch out well into the future.

Nearly 2.5 million people were apprehended after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border in fiscal 2023, which ended Sept. 30, in addition to an estimated 670,000 “gotaways” who eluded authorities.

That record-breaking tally followed a record-breaking nearly 2.4 million the year prior, itself following a record-breaking 1.7 million in fiscal 2021.

On his first day in office in January 2021, Biden halted funding to construct former President Donald Trump’s US-Mexico border wall.

Biden in June 2021 ended Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy that required most asylum seekers who reached the southern border to await US court rulings in Mexico.

The Department of Homeland Security in October said it was necessary to resume wall construction in Texas, citing an “acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers … to prevent unlawful entries,” but Biden distanced himself from the move and said he had to spend money appropriated by Congress."

Trump’s attorneys had contended in a brief Wednesday filing that there was no reason for the high court to intervene in the appellate process, which threatens to delay the scheduled start of the 77-year-old’s trial March 4.

But Smith’s team countered Thursday that the question demanded a “timely and definitive resolution” that only the justices could provide.

“The public interest in a prompt resolution of this case favors an immediate, definitive decision by this Court,” prosecutors wrote in their brief.

“The charges here are of the utmost gravity. This case involves — for the first time in our Nation’s history — criminal charges against a former President based on his actions while in office.”

Trump’s team has sought to get the courts to toss out the four-count indictment against him for alleged subversion of the 2020 election, arguing that he can’t be charged for carrying out official duties as president.

Earlier this month, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled against Trump, finding the 45th president was not entitled to a “lifelong get-out-of-jail-free pass.”

Trump’s team appealed the ruling to the DC appeals court, but Smith went straight to the high court with his initial Dec. 11 request for a speedy ruling.

Chutkan has put “any further proceedings that would move this case towards trial” on pause amid the appeal.

“Only this Court can provide the final word on his immunity defense,” Smith’s team wrote. “Certiorari before judgment will allow the Court to set a schedule for briefing and argument to assure that respondent’s immunity claim will be resolved as expeditiously as possible.”

Smith’s team further stressed that the “respondent agrees that the important constitutional question in this case will require this Court’s review.”

In Wednesday’s brief, Trump’s legal team contended that the matter had to be heard by the appeals court first.

“In 234 years of American history, no president ever faced criminal prosecution for his official acts. Until 19 days ago, no court had ever addressed whether immunity from such prosecution exists,” they wrote.

“To this day, no appellate court has addressed it. The question stands among the most complex, intricate, and momentous issues that this Court will be called on to decide.”

The Trump team also argued that Smith’s office lacks standing to request that the Supreme Court expedite an appeal of a decision that it won.

Should the Supreme Court opt against expediting the challenge, Trump’s case could be delayed indefinitely while the immunity question is decided.

Trump is facing a total of 91 criminal counts across four cases. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing in all of them.

On Tuesday, the Colorado Supreme Court disqualified Trump from the GOP primary ballot — a ruling his campaign has also vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court."

A new scientific study says New Year’s Eve revelers in the US will indulge in unprotected sex at a higher rate than during other holidays — including Valentine’s Day.

The study’s steamy findings are based on the seasonal sale of morning-after pills and other types of emergency contraception, which boozed-up revelers are more likely to use after the year end’s big ball drop, researchers at Texas Tech University wrote in the British Medical Journal this week.

“More than ever, emergency contraception is a critically important option for people in the US, particularly those living in regions with bans or severe restrictions on abortion,” the researchers wrote.

“Firstly, New Year’s Eve celebrations are commonly associated with increased sexual behavior,” the study said. “In a survey of American’s views of holidays and their sexual lives, more than 70% of respondents planned to put in extra effort to be sexual with their partner on New Year’s Eve.”

Researchers said Americans are less likely to use condoms during drunken New Year’s Eve hook-ups, making panicked runs to the pharmacy for morning-after alternatives more likely.

Overall, the holiday is expected to mean a 10% jump in unprotected sex based on yearly patterns.

Texas Tech largely tracked sales of levonorgestrel, the drug commonly referred to as the morning-after pill that can block pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of intercourse, but can be effective for up to 120 hours, according to the study.

The study looked at sales of the drug throughout the year between 2016 and 2022 by women between the ages of 15 and 44 — and found a jump in purchases after New Year’s Eve.

Results determined that about 41,000 more levonorgestrel were sold among the nearly 65 million women in the age group in the days following the holiday, the study said.

The researchers cautioned that, despite the wink-wink subject, it’s no laughing matter.

“Although this annual spike in sales might seem humorous, it is indicative of unmet contraceptive need that calls for further attention,” they wrote."

Frank J. Litterio, 61, of Elma, allegedly shot Jill Harris, 62, multiple times with the medieval weapon on Dec. 13 before trying to take his own life, the Erie County District Attorney’s Office said last week.

“An autopsy revealed that Harris had been struck three times by arrows — once in the abdomen, once in the face and once in the chest,” Erie County Undersheriff Bill Cooley said at a press conference Friday.

The crossbow had to be reloaded one arrow at a time, adding to the sadistic nature of the domestic murder, Cooley noted.

“So when you consider what it takes to load and fire a crossbow, there’s a process to it. So this was clearly… deliberate actions,” he said.

Litterio was arraigned on second-degree murder charges from a hospital where he was being treated for “self-inflicted wounds,” including a cut to his neck, multiple puncture wounds to his chest and injuries to one of his wrists, officials said.

The front door of the suspect’s home.

He was being held without bail ahead of his next hearing, set for Jan. 29, 2024.

If convicted, Litterio faces 25 years to life in prison.

The incident came months after another upstate man was accused of killing his newborn baby and injuring his wife with a crossbow."

79,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,"Citing 'simply massive' volume of discovery documents, Menendez lawyers seek trial delay",https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2023/12/21/senator-bob-menendez-lawyers-seek-trial-delay/72001944007/,"Sen. Bob Menendez may have a few more months to wait before his federal corruption trial starts.

Though it is currently scheduled to begin May 6, the senator’s attorneys — Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman — filed a letter with the judge Wednesday asking for the trial to be pushed back “at least two months to early July 2024” because of the “complexity of this case” as well as the “volume and timing of the government’s disclosures.”

“Contrary to the government’s overheated statements to the press, this is far from an open-and-shut case,” the letter states. “There are substantial meritorious factual and legal defenses that require defense counsel’s — and the court’s — attention. But defendants cannot meaningfully prepare for trial on the timeline the court set at the initial conference, before the government produced a single page of discovery.”

Story continues below photo gallery.

According to the letter, there have been more than 6.7 million documents totaling more than 15 million pages produced during the discovery so far.

That includes more than 3 million emails and text messages, over 20 search warrant and cell site applications and another 1.5 million documents that “lack sufficient metadata to readily categorize them by document type.” And about 48% of them came within the last month.

North Jersey:Most people call the police once or twice in their lives. Not when you're Nadine Menendez

Volume of discovery 'simply massive'

Fee and Weitzman say the volume of discovery is “simply massive” and will take months to sort through. They also note that classified discovery has not even started yet because the defense counsel is “still in the process of seeking and obtaining clearance to review classified discovery and participate in the CIPA process."" That refers to the Classified Information Procedures Act.

According to the letter, Fee and Weitzman also need time to conduct their own investigation and find witnesses “located in Egypt and elsewhere.”

More:Menendez's alleged actions for Egypt a potential national security threat, experts say

“The defendants seek only a modest extension of the trial date — just two months — and a reasonable schedule for pretrial motions in the case,” the letter states. “Defendants’ requests still put this case on a true ‘rocket docket,’ proceeding to trial within 10 months of the filing of the original indictment.

""Given the complexity of this case and the seriousness of the charges at issue, the speed with which this case is proceeding is extraordinary, but defendants understand and respect the court’s desire to move this case expeditiously,” the letter says.

They also asked for an extension of one week for the pretrial motions deadline and requested that a second deadline be implemented for potential motions based on the government’s discovery.

Hundreds of thousands in bribes

Menendez faces corruption charges, brought by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from three businessmen in exchange for helping them enrich themselves and trying to get them out of trouble, according to an indictment unsealed on Sept. 22 in New York.

The senior senator and the other four defendants — his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, and businessmen Wael Hana, Fred Daibes and Jose Uribe — have all entered not guilty pleas.

The trial is expected to last four to six weeks.

The indictment alleges that between 2018 and 2022, Menendez and his wife “engaged in a corrupt relationship with Hana, Uribe and Daibes” to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for Menendez using his “power and influence to protect, to enrich those businessmen and to benefit the government of Egypt” even as he sat as chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Bribes allegedly included cash, gold bars, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a low- or no-show job and a Mercedes-Benz — much of which is detailed in photographs in the 39-page indictment.

Menendez is up for reelection next fall, and to secure his spot on the ballot, he will need to win the primary on June 4, likely around the time of closing arguments in the case if the trial date stands.

Rep. Andy Kim and first lady Tammy Murphy have announced that they will run in the Democratic primary for the seat."

81,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,NJSEA will once again fund an UFC event at Prudential Center. Price tag? $5M,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2023/12/21/njsea-fund-mma-event-prudential-center/71991060007/,"For the second time this year, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority seems poised to dedicate millions of dollars to an event at Prudential Center.

A resolution the board of commissioners was expected to approve Thursday morning will allocate $5 million to the Newark arena for a mixed martial arts event next summer.

Why can the NJSEA fund events at Prudential Center?

Brian Aberback, a spokesperson for the agency, said Wednesday that the NJSEA has “broad statutory authority to promote and otherwise support sporting events statewide.”

The authority, created in 1971, holds the land lease for and provides for the ongoing operation of the MetLife Sports Complex, including MetLife Stadium, the Meadowlands Racetrack, the Meadowlands Arena and American Dream.

Beyond East Rutherford, the agency owns the Wildwood Convention Center and holds the land lease for the Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport; Favorites, an off-track wagering facility in Woodbridge, and the Atlantic Health Jets Training Center in Florham Park.

Prudential Center is privately owned by HBSE — Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment — and operated by Devils Arena Entertainment.

Earlier in 2023:How did the NJSEA steer $3.5M in pandemic relief to an MMA event at Prudential Center?

According to the resolution, the money will be provided because Devils Arena Entertainment “recently made a request to the NJSEA for funds to help secure an upcoming UFC mixed martial arts pay-per-view event, currently scheduled for June 1, 2024.”

Taxpayer money appropriated to the NJSEA in the fiscal year 2024 state budget for “International Events, Improvements and Attraction” will be used to meet this request.

The Devils and the Seton Hall men's basketball team are the arena's sole home teams. It also placed fifth for total gross revenues in Pollstar's 2022 annual rankings, topping $85 million. A spokesperson for the Devils said the venue set revenue records in ticketing, sponsorship, groups, entertainment, and food and beverage sales during the 2022-23 season.

Prudential Center also hosted events in late June for Gov. Phil Murphy's inaugural North to Shore Festival. Murphy said at the time that the festival will ""generate economic activity and have a significant impact on our region"" and will feature concerts, comedy shows and talks from various New Jersey business and industry leaders.

NJSEA approved pandemic relief funds for UFC 288

Earlier this year, the authority approved the use of $3.5 million in pandemic relief funds for UFC 288 on May 6. Thursday’s resolution does not use relief funds.

That money was ""for use in support of sporting events, attractions and promotions"" at Prudential Center, and the resolution authorized by the NJSEA's board of commissioners on April 27 specifically identified UFC 288 as one of the ""marquee events.""

The $3.5 million used in the spring is just a small part of the larger fund to which the state has access. New Jersey was given $6.24 billion in federal pandemic relief funding in May 2021. According to a report by State Auditor David Kaschak, as of Sept. 30, about $6.2 billion had been allocated but only $1.8 billion had been spent.

The state still has time, though. The deadline to allocate the funding is not until the end of 2024, and the deadline to spend it isn't until two years after that. But any unused funds must be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

The agency is also expected to approve $400,000 for the 2024 CONMEBOL Copa America international men's soccer tournament, being held at MetLife Stadium next summer, and $1.65 million for the NHL Stadium Series at MetLife in February. In both cases, the money will go to the New Meadowlands Stadium Company, because the state recognizes that these events “will generate significant tax revenue and will further benefit additional economic impact items including, but not limited to, tourism, hotels, restaurants and job creation,” the respective resolutions say.

But police in Margate believe in a more likely scenario: they’re probably from a railcar that was dropped in the ocean to form an artificial reef.

“The seats are far too heavy to have come from anything like a plane,” Margate police chief Matthew Hankinson said Thursday.

The chairs may have appeared from the Point Lookout artificial reef along the southern shore of Long Island. The State of New York has worked to build up the reef in recent years, dumping a myriad decommissioned objects - from subway cars, old turbines and concrete, to piles of miscellaneous objects - to the ocean depths in order to create a more diverse and healthy marine ecosystem.

The seats were reported at approximately 7 a.m. on Tuesday at Quincy Street beach by a resident named Matthew J. Perry, Lt. Joe Scullion of the Margate police department explained Thursday. Scullion said Chief Hankinson and a detective from the department went to the beach to inspect the seats and they were later recovered by the Department of Public Works.

“The seats are stripped down to the metal with nothing left from cushions, seat belts or buckles that would indicate they came from a plane crash,” Scullion said. “A detective did some further research and found that decommissioned railcar seats are typically stripped down to the metal parts and taken out to sea and dumped to help build artificial reefs.”

Scullion said the seat’s appearance on the Jersey Shore was likely caused by the strong storms over the past two weeks. Images of the seats taken by the police department show the metal frames and what appear to be foot rests, a feature commonly found on train seats where plane seats typically have a compartment for storage underneath the seat.

Scullion and Hankinson said that the fixed armrests found in the middle of the seats also suggested originating from a train rather than a plane.

“The storms probably broke it loose and it eventually landed on our shore,” he said. Other artificial reefs on the east coast have been created using old subway cars, including Redbird Reef off of Slaughter Beach in the Delaware Bay. Seats were reportedly removed from the cars to form that reef, however.

Scullion said the police department did not report this incident to federal or state authorities for further investigation. He said that if there was any indication the seats originated from some type of plane crash or other unexpected catastrophe at sea, they would notify the National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies.

A Tiktok video posted Wednesday, recorded by the person who reported the seats, known online as Matthew Jacob, captured the seats in the sand just outside the rolling waves off Quincy Street and quickly went viral. The video has been viewed over 12.5 million times and has nearly 12,000 comments. In follow-up videos, Jacob reports the discovery to police, who collect the seats and explain they will investigate their origins.

One of the third-prize Powerball tickets was sold at ShopRite liquor store on New York Avenue in Lyndhurst. The other was sold at Amazonia Multiservice, a convenience store on Wilson Avenue in Newark, New Jersey lottery officials said.

Both Powerball tickets matched four numbers plus the Powerball.

No one across the country hit Wednesday’s $576 million jackpot, pushing the top prize for the next drawing Saturday to $620 million with a cash option of $310.8 million, potentially the 20th largest in U.S. lottery history.

Wednesday’s winning numbers were: 27, 35, 41, 56 and 60. The Powerball was 16 with a Power Play of 2X.

Five second-prize tickets matching five numbers but not the Powerball were also purchased nationwide for Wednesday’s drawing.

Ticket sold in Colorado, Kentucky and Virginia are valued at $2 million each because the winners spent an extra $1 for the Power Play option. Two tickets are worth $1 million each — one in Kentucky and one in Rhode Island, lottery officials said.

In addition, no one won the secondary $10 million Double Play jackpot on Wednesday. Those winning numbers were: 22, 25, 28, 30 and 53. The Double Play number drawn was 3.

No one has hit the jackpot since Oct. 11 when a ticket worth $1.765 billion was bought in Frazier Park, California — about 70 miles north of Los Angeles.

The odds of hitting the Powerball jackpot are 292,201,388 to 1. A player who buys a $2 ticket has about a 1 in 11,688,053 chance to match five numbers and win at least $1 million, while the odds are 913,129 to 1 to win a third prize of at least $50,000.

Powerball drawings are held each Monday, Wednesday and Saturday in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Friday’s Mega Millions drawing is worth an estimated $57 million with a cash option of $28.4 million.

Janis Miller, 77, of South Orange, was charged with one count of wire fraud and released on $100,000 bond Thursday, the office said.

Miller is accused of collecting $1.01 million in Social Security benefits and U.S. Office of Personnel Management funds intended for her aunt since 1998. Miller’s aunt had previously worked at the Veterans Administration and was eligible for OPM benefits, according to the complaint.

Prosecutors alleged Miller withdrew approximately $70,000 using a debit card for her aunt’s account over the 25-year fraud. She also allegedly wrote $130,000 in fraudulent checks to her own company, forging her aunt’s signature on the checks in order to do so.

According to documents filed in the case, after Miller’s aunt died in 1998, federal retirement and survivor benefits continued to be deposited into her bank accounts. The federal benefits agencies were never notified about the aunt’s death. Authorities alleged Miller made cash and electronic withdrawals from the account and forged checks made out to company she controlled.

According to the complaint, Miller also impersonated her dead aunt on a phone call with the Social Security Administration in 2022 to continue receiving funds. After the agencies discovered the fraudulent activity, funds were discontinued in 2023, approximately 25 years after the fraud first began.

Miller’s federal public defender Carol Dominguez was not immediately available Thursday night for comment.

97,[New Jersey] https://www.nj.com/,"Kids, parent, crossing guard struck by intoxicated driver while crossing N.J. street, police say",https://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/2023/12/kids-parent-crossing-guard-struck-by-intoxicated-driver-while-crossing-nj-street-police-say.html,"Two children, a parent and a crossing guard were taken to a hospital for evaluation after they were struck by a car while crossing a street in Gloucester County on Thursday morning, according to police.

The incident occurred shortly after 8:30 a.m. at Hessian and Grove avenues in the borough of National Park near National Park Elementary School.

Motorist Lanielle M. Phelps, 40, of West Deptford, was allegedly intoxicated when police say she struck the four in a crosswalk.

All four victims were transported by ambulance to Cooper University Hospital, in Camden, to determine the extent of their injuries, police said. Additional details on their status were not available as of Thursday afternoon.

“All four sustained injuries. They are still being evaluated at Cooper,” West Deptford Police Chief John Chambers said around 2:30 p.m. He noted that one of the victims suffered a head injury. “At this moment, we do not believe any injuries are life-threatening.”

Phelps, who remained at the scene, was charged with four counts of assault by auto, endangering the welfare of a child and driving while intoxicated. She had a child in her vehicle at the time of the crash, police said.

Investigators have recovered surveillance footage of the incident, the chief noted.

Phelps was placed in Salem County Correctional Facility pending court hearings.

98,[New Jersey] https://www.nj.com/,"Man shot to death at N.J. park had planned to rob accused killer, prosecutors say",https://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/2023/12/man-shot-to-death-at-nj-park-had-planned-to-rob-accused-killer-prosecutors-say.html,"The victim killed in a shooting in Woodbury earlier this month conspired with another man to rob the juvenile charged in the homicide, according to court documents and statements made during a recent hearing.

Woodbury police officers responded to Wing-Dickerson Park around 1:15 a.m. on Dec. 2 and found 21-year-old Ti’jere K. Jackson dead of a gunshot wound to the chest.

A juvenile was identified as the shooter and later arrested. The Gloucester County Prosecutor’s Office has not announced the charges filed against the juvenile or revealed his age, citing state law that prohibits release of such details in juvenile cases.

Police also arrested Amante Black-Thompson, 18, of Woodbury, on a charge of criminal attempted robbery.

Black-Thompson conspired with Jackson to rob the juvenile, according to an affidavit of probable cause filed with his charges.

Around 11 p.m. on Dec. 1, Black-Thompson contacted Jackson via Instagram and arranged the robbery, detectives state in the affidavit.

Jackson and the juvenile communicated over Instagram about three hours later and then met in Woodbury and traveled to the park, investigators said.

Black-Thompson was then observed arriving and the three walked to a separate area of the park, the affidavit states.

Several minutes later, the juvenile was seen “fleeing the area” and police soon found Jackson dead, authorities said.

In an interview with police, Black-Thompson said that he had agreed to “be present” with Jackson for the attempted robbery of the juvenile, according to the affidavit.

During a hearing last week, Assistant Prosecutor Timothy Gaskill said Black-Thompson and Jackson conspired to rob the juvenile during a transaction.

“The investigation revealed that there was some type of deal to sell some type of item between these individuals at 2 a.m. and the resulting incident ended up in the death of another individual,” Gaskill said.

The item being sold was never disclosed in court or identified in the complaint.

Gaskill described Black-Thompson and Jackson as “associates” and said they knew the juvenile, but that their relationship to that juvenile was unclear to investigators at this stage.

While the prosecution asked that Black-Thompson remain jailed pending trial, describing him as a flight risk and danger to the community, his defense attorney noted that he had no prior juvenile or adult criminal record. Black-Thompson turned 18 a week before the incident.

Michael Ortiz said his client is struggling since Jackson’s death in the shooting and described the men as friends.

“The circumstances of this case are tragic. My client’s best friend … passed away during this incident. And the only evidence of a weapon is of the juvenile having a weapon, not of my client and, to my knowledge, the … decedent.”

Ortiz noted that his client has cooperated with investigators.

“He called the cops. He stayed on the scene. He gave a statement to police,” Ortiz said. “He turned over evidence to police.”

A judge ordered Black-Thompson’s pre-trial release with the requirement that he maintain weekly contact with court staff. He’s due back in court next month for a pre-indictment hearing.

While details about the juvenile are shielded from public view, he was arrested later in the day on Dec. 2 , according to the prosecutor’s office and details filed with charges against a 20-year-old who was not involved in the shooting incident.

As detectives were conducting surveillance on the juvenile’s residence, James Workman, of Barrington, arrived in a vehicle. The juvenile left his residence, entered Workman’s vehicle and they drove off, investigators said.

Plainclothes detectives pulled over the vehicle in Woodbury Heights and approached it while wearing ballistic vests labeled with “Police” on them, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Workman pointed a handgun at an approaching detective, officials stated, but complied with orders to lower the weapon.

Workman was taken into custody and the firearm was found to be a ghost gun — a weapon that is unregistered and has no serial number — loaded with hollow-point ammunition, authorities said.

He was charged with aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer by pointing a firearm, along with multiple weapons charges.

James D. Feeley, 46, of Grafton, Ohio pleaded guilty Thursday in New Jersey federal court to anti-kickback laws and health care fraud that involved an Edison-based pharmacy, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Thursday.

Feeley was accused of orchestrating an illegal $24 million health insurance kickback ring that included pharmacies, telemedicine companies and doctors.

Authorities alleged that Feeley and his co-conspirators used a network of marketing companies he controlled to call patients and coerce them into filling expensive prescriptions for medications they did not need.

Feeley then passed that information to telemedicine companies that paid kickbacks to doctors who signed prescriptions without ever meeting with those patients.

Once scripts were signed, Feely allegedly funneled those prescriptions to pharmacies where he and his business partner, Mark Belter, had agreements to receive kickbacks for expensive prescriptions, authorities said. The pharmacies would fill the prescriptions and submit claims to Medicare and TRICARE for reimbursement, and ultimately send a kickback to Feeley for the prescriptions filled, the office said.

The scheme lasted for three years, starting in 2017 and ending in 2020, authorities said. Over $24 million in fraudulent reimbursements were filled and Feely and his companies received $6 million of the illegal kickbacks from Edison-based Apogee Bio Pharm LLC.

The principals of Apogee were indicted in September in a $33 million prescription-drug scheme connected to the marketing companies Feeley controlled, authorities said.

Gary Kaczka, 62, of Saddle Brook as well as two New York men, William B. Welwart, 69, and Ethan B. Welwart, 35, were charged with 22 total counts of health care fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to violate the federal anti-kickback statute.

William was the CEO of Apogee while Ethan was Director of Operations and Kaczka was a pharmacist that at times acted as the pharmacist-in-charge. Ethan also owned pharmacies in Oceanport and Bal Harbor, Florida. All three are still awaiting trial.

Elan Yaish, the former president of Apogee, pleaded guilty to violating the federal anti-kickback statute in August.

Maude Elizabeth Syvertsen was found dead after the home on Mooney Road in the Ledgewood section of the township caught fire and partially collapsed, the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office said.

Syvertsen’s 71-year-old son suffered what officials described as “severe” fire-related injuries. He remains hospitalized at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, a prosecutor’s office spokeswoman said Thursday.

Though the fire is not considered suspicious, the cause and origin remain under investigation Thursday, the spokeswoman said.

The fire broke out about 1 p.m with 13 departments assisting Roxbury firefighters to contain it.

The 3,388-square-foot home sits on nearly 1.2 acres at the corner of Mountain Road, according to property records. Authorities said it is now uninhabitable.

Julio Cesar Paniagua, 27, made his first court appearance Thursday and was detained, officials said. Joel Ramon Garcia, 33, was previously ordered to be held in jail following his arrest on Nov. 20, the office said.

The father of the man who was kidnapped called the Paterson Police Department on Nov. 15 around 11 p.m. and told them about the abduction, according to a complaint.

He told detectives he had received a phone call about 25 minutes earlier from his son telling him that he had been kidnapped and asked his father to provide his kidnappers with $30,000 for his return, the complaint stated. However, he did not give his father a form of transaction, nor any instructions on where to send or drop the money.

At 11:50 p.m., while he was at the police station, the father received another call from his son, but this time, a person he did not know told him that he knew the police were involved and threatened to chop his son’s fingers off if he did not provide the $30,000, investigators said.

Police were able to track where the calls came from by using tower dumps, which is a list of all cellular numbers that connected to a given cellular tower within a defined time period, authorities said. Investigators determined the phone belonged to Garcia and that the calls were coming from the area of Dedham, Massachusetts, according to the complaint.

Garcia and Paniagua, both of whom were later positively identified by the man who was kidnapped, released the man on Nov. 17 and he went to the police to tell them what happened, authorities said.

He said he was sitting in his car around 5:45 p.m. when both Garcia and Paniagua got into the back seat and that both of them were armed with handguns, the office said. They arrived in Massachusetts about six hours later.

While Garcia was arrested three days after the man was abducted, Paniagua was not charged until Dec. 7 when he was being held in connection with immigration proceedings, according to the complaint. He later admitted his role to the detectives, authorities alleged.

The charge of kidnapping carries a maximum penalty of life in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000, the office said.

112,[New Jersey] https://www.nj.com/,Some residents return home as area still reeling from Passaic River flooding,https://www.nj.com/passaic-county/2023/12/some-residents-return-home-as-area-still-reeling-from-passaic-river-flooding.html,"Evacuated residents from some neighborhoods adjacent to the Passaic River have started returning to their homes as flood waters have started to recede, while others are still reeling from the lingering effects of weekend storms.

The area was hit hard by major flooding after the coastal storm on Sunday and Monday dumped as much as 4 to 5 inches of rain on the region. The city of Paterson declared a state of emergency on Monday and shut down multiple major roadways. District officials in the city announced Wednesday schools would be closed the rest of the week, and given next week’s winter recess, would not resume until 2024.

“This decision is due to continuing safety issues for our students and staff traveling into the city in relation to flooding, frozen surfaces, and road closures,” the district said in its announcement. The district said it would update the school calendar “to ensure the statutory requirement of 180 days of instruction is met.”

Paterson Police put up barricades on roads that were still closed on Wednesday and warned drivers to avoid these heavily flooded areas. Water damage and flooding could still been seen on some roadways in the city on Thursday, although several roads had significantly less water than the previous day and more cars seemed to be passing through.

A state of emergency was also in effect in Wayne from Monday to Wednesday, as residents in the town, as well as in nearby Little Falls, were told to evacuate their homes and move their cars to municipal parking lots.

The township of Little Falls sent alerts out on Thursday afternoon, saying flood waters have started to subside and residents in certain neighborhoods could return home.

Residents on Grey Rock Avenue, Orchard Street, West End Avenue, Parkway and Riverview Circle have returned to their homes. The neighborhoods west of Parkway are still closed and being monitored by local officials.

On Thursday evening, many of the streets in Little Falls appeared dry and electricity and Christmas lights were back on in most of the town.

Officials in Wayne and Paterson did not respond to requests for comment.

113,[New Jersey] https://www.nj.com/,Ex-Paterson cop found not guilty of excessive force in flashlight beating of suspect,https://www.nj.com/passaic-county/2023/12/ex-paterson-cop-found-not-guilty-of-excessive-force-in-flashlight-beating-of-suspect.html,"A jury in Passaic County on Thursday acquitted former Paterson patrolman Spencer Finch of all criminal charges, rejecting the state’s case that the cop used excessive force when he beat a man 14 times with his flashlight during an arrest then kneed him in the face once he was in handcuffs.

After deliberating for three hours, the jury of eight men and four women found Finch not guilty of aggravated assault, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, perjury, falsification of public records, and official misconduct. Finch bowed his head and appeared to weep as the jury foreman read the verdict in Superior Court in Passaic County.

The jury determined that Finch, a 17-year-veteran of the Paterson Police Department, used justifiable force to subdue Brandon Cosby in the hallway of an Atlantic Street apartment building on the night of May 26, 2021.

Finch and another Paterson police officer, Edwin Martinez, had responded to the building on a domestic violence call.

Finch, who testified at the trial, admitted he knew that the oversized flashlight he had that night violated Paterson Police Department regulations, but told the jury he carried it anyway because it was a more effective tool.

Finch told the jury that the bigger flashlight was more effective at breaking car windows at accident scenes, and for reviving opiate users who had overdosed by rubbing them in the chest.

Finch told the jury that he only used as much force as was necessary to subdue Cosby, who he described as “enraged” and ready to fight police when they arrived.

But the prosecution maintained that Finch never did anything to de-escalate the situation, and didn’t tell Cosby he was under arrest until after the scuffle and the suspect on the floor and in handcuffs.

Finch then kneed the man in the face, but testified that the suspect had attempted to head-butt him.

Finch was fired from the Paterson Police Department after the criminal charges were filed. He is awaiting trial in an earlier 2018 case accusing him of using excessive force after responding to a robbery at a convenience store in Paterson.

Finch hugged his attorney, Eric Kleiner, following the verdict, and his parents, who were seated in the gallery and attended every day of the four-week trial. Finch declined to comment to reporters as he left the courtroom.

“This is exactly what innocence looks like: a full acquittal on every bogus charged that they trumped up against him,” Finch’s attorney, Kleiner, said.

“They charged the wrong guy. They should have charged Cosby. He committed three criminal offenses,” he said, referring to charges of resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer and making terroristic threats that Finch filed, but were later dropped by the prosecutor’s office.

“Spencer Finch saved lives that day,” Kleiner said. “He was the hero. They charged the hero as the defendant. And they made the criminal the victim.”

Chief Assistant Prosecutor Peter Foy left the courtroom and did not comment.

The trial, which was held before Judge Marilyn Clark, lasted four weeks. Finch took the witness stand and testified for three days, and claimed that Cosby was in a rage and resisting arrest.

Finch and Martinez had responded to the building on a domestic violence call placed by a woman who was the mother of Cosby’s two children. Cosby is seen on security camera video pacing the hallway and talking on his cellphone as police arrive.

Finch first went into the apartment to talk to the woman who had made the call. He testified that she showed him a series of angry texts that Cosby had sent her that night. Finch said he went out into the hallway intending to arrest the man for making terroristic threats.

Foy argued that Finch never told Cosby he was under arrest. Video shows Finch leaving the apartment and immediately confronting Cosby, who appears to take a step away from Finch as he approaches. Finch then slapped Cosby in the face and a scuffle ensues as Martinez joined.

Finch fell to the floor – he testified on the witness stand that Cosby “body slammed” him – then picked up his flashlight and is seen striking Cosby 14 times on the head. Finch’s body camera was off during the struggle and was not activated. But Martinez’s body camera stayed on and recorded the struggle as he and Finch wrestled Cosby to the floor.

114,[New Jersey] https://www.nj.com/,N.J. cop indicted on charges he severely injured 2-year-old at his home,https://www.nj.com/salem/2023/12/nj-cop-indicted-on-charges-he-severely-injured-2-year-old-at-his-home.html,"A Salem County grand jury has indicted a Penns Grove police sergeant on charges he severely injured a toddler left in his care while he was off-duty.

Anthony J. Minguez, 38, of Carneys Point, was looking after a woman’s 2-year-old son at his residence on Feb. 12 when he called 911 to report the child had fallen and needed an ambulance, according to an affidavit of probable cause filed by Carneys Point Police.

Doctors who evaluated the boy found a serious head injury and concluded he was the victim of child abuse, police said. Minguez was charged later that month and suspended with pay from his position with the Penns Grove Police Department.

An attorney for Minguez did not respond to requests to comment on the case Wednesday.

When he called 911 on Feb. 12, Minguez said he was performing CPR on the child, authorities said. The boy was then taken by ambulance to Nemours Children’s Hospital in Delaware, authorities said.

Doctors determined the 2-year-old suffered a “severe injury” to the head, which was causing brain swelling, and a portion of his skull had to be removed to alleviate the swelling, authorities said.

Once the child’s head was shaved, a neurosurgeon noticed a “cluster of bruises which in his words resembled fingers or knuckles,” police stated in the affidavit. Other bruises on the toddler were noted as “areas of concern” and the doctor believed they were caused by “a blow, pinch or pull,” authorities said.

Another doctor found broken blood vessels in the child’s retinas, which would be caused by “violent shaking of the victim,” authorities said.

Court documents do not describe the relationship between Minguez and the boy’s mother, who had left the toddler with him while she went to take care of errands at her own residence, according to the affidavit.

The mother told investigators her son seemed fine when she left him at Minguez’s residence that day.

A grand jury indicted the police officer last week on charges of second-degree aggravated assault and third-degree endangering the welfare of a child.

Penns Grove Police Director Richard Rivera said he had not been notified by the Salem County Prosecutor’s Office that the officer was indicted.

Typically, an officer’s status would shift to suspension without pay after an indictment and Rivera said the borough will review the case this week.

Rivera criticized the prosecutor’s office for allowing a local police department to handle the case, saying matters involving charges against municipal police officers are usually investigated by county prosecutors to avoid the appearance of favoritism or conflict of interest at the local level.

“This entire matter — the investigation and charging — should have been handled at the county prosecutor level,” Rivera said.

Salem County Prosecutor Kristin Telsey declined to comment on Rivera’s remarks.

Rivera praised Minguez’s service in Penns Grove’s police department.

“Anthony is a supervisor and he works very well with the community,” the police director said.

Minguez is due back in court Jan. 12 for a post-indictment arraignment hearing.

Minguez previously faced charges in an unrelated case. He was off-duty and dining at a restaurant in Salem County in 2017 when he was accused of exposing himself to two children in the restroom.

The Salem County Prosecutor’s office said in a statement at the time that it reviewed the case and found the boys had gone into a bathroom stall while Minguez was relieving himself and surprised the man. The prosecutor found the case did not rise to an indictable offense and referred it back to municipal court.

Minguez was found not guilty following a municipal court trial in 2018.

State civil rights investigators formally notified the township of their inquiry on Thursday, which is focused on whether the town and its police department “have taken appropriate corrective action to address and remedy any discrimination by leaders.”

Clark officials did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

The investigation comes a month after state Attorney General Matthew Platkin excoriated Clark officials at a press conference announcing the release of the grand jury report, which stopped short of finding criminal wrongdoing but flagged “disparities in police practices” that may violate state civil rights laws.

Both inquiries stem from secret recordings made by a police lieutenant capturing longtime Mayor Sal Bonaccorso, the police chief and other officers using racial slurs and making other discriminatory statements.

The recordings were first published last year as part of an NJ Advance Media investigation, which revealed the township paid $400,000 in a hush-money settlement that kept the public in the dark.

Bonaccorso, a Republican, has been Clark’s mayor since 2001. He faces separate criminal charges of using his public office to benefit his private landscaping business, which surfaced as part of the attorney general’s probe. He previously apologized for the racist recordings but has denied criminal wrongdoing.

The rest of Clark’s leaders have largely refused to publicly address the controversy. At a township meeting on Monday night, Council President William Smith broke the long silence in a prepared statement he read to the audience.

“With the recent release of the attorney general’s report concluding their almost three-and-a-half year investigation of the township, the Clark council was found to have acted appropriately on the recommendation of our township attorney and insurance company in the matters that were all investigated,” he said.

“None of us sitting up here condone the words that were heard on those recordings,” he added, but “the council is focused on moving forward and acting in the best interest of the citizens.”

The civil rights probe suggests the matter is far from over.

Among the issues being probed is the pattern of traffic stops and arrests in Clark, a suburb that has long held a reputation as a “sundown town” where minorities aren’t welcome after dark.

The state report found 44% of people arrested in Clark were Black, even though the township is 93% white. The grand jury report examined police records but ultimately found issues with record keeping left them without “conclusive evidence of discriminatory policing practices, though some areas require interventions and further study.”

It recommended the referral to civil rights investigators “for an in-depth investigation and review of the policing practices in Clark.”

The report also called for the firing of Police Chief Pedro Matos and internal affairs Sgt. Joseph Teston, who were caught on tape along with the mayor using racial slurs.

Earlier this month, the council voted to hire an independent hearing officer to review the AG’s recommendations, a role that would normally fall to the same mayor who was also caught on tape using slurs.

Matos and Teston have been on paid leave since July 2020, as has a third police officer, Capt. Vincent Concina, who was accused of retaliation by the whistleblower, former Lt. Antonio Manata.

In that time, the three have been paid more than $1.6 million in salary. They have also continued to receive health insurance benefits, costing taxpayers a combined $321,475 since their suspensions, according to financial documents obtained through a public records request.

118,[North Carolina] https://carolinapublicpress.org/recent-news/,Burden of high prices behind bars in NC,https://carolinapublicpress.org/62619/burden-of-high-prices-behind-bars-in-nc/,"As Cierra Cobb grapples with a soaring grocery bill at home due to historic inflation, she has to also help her husband pay for necessities such as hygiene and other items at the Maury Correctional Institution’s prison canteen.

The rising cost of household staples has put a strain on her budget, so she must choose between putting money in her husband’s trust fund account or on his tablet, which he uses to communicate with her.

“It’s putting a burden on me and everyone who has someone incarcerated,” she said. “We have to limit what we can and can’t send them. Sometimes I could put money on his tablet but put less money on the canteen, or more money in the canteen, and then he can’t have tablet time.”

Families of men and women incarcerated in North Carolina prisons are dealing with inflation in their own households while struggling to pay for the rising costs of essential items at prison canteens for their loved ones.

Incarcerated people rely on the prison canteen — a small shop inside prisons — to purchase essential items like hygiene products and snacks that the Department of Adult Correction does not provide.

Many rely on the canteen to supplement their diet, but rising prices due to inflation are making these items difficult to afford, especially for those struggling financially.

“It’s a double whammy because we have inflation at the grocery store outside, and then we have to deal with inflation inside,” Cobb said. “Simply put, you’re sometimes in the negative trying to take care of them.”

Rising cost of support

At Maury Correctional Institution in Greene County, where Cierra’s husband, Jeffrey Cobb has been incarcerated since 2017, a 29-ounce box of Banquet fried chicken now costs $13.46, a price that Jeffrey said is out of reach for many incarcerated people.

In 2018, the same box cost $6.40, he said. The boxes sometimes come with fewer than the six pieces advertised and the prices are so high that the chicken sometimes goes bad because few people can afford to buy them, Jeffrey said.

“They aren’t buying loads of it no more, and because of that it is getting mold on it,” said Jeffrey, who is serving a 30-year sentence for second-degree murder.

The cost of some items at the Central Prison canteen in Raleigh has increased so much over the past year that Lyle May is forced to cut back. A tube of Aquafresh Toothpaste-Sensitive now costs $5.70, up 52% from a year ago. Dental floss costs 48 cents, up 92% since last year.

Denture adhesive has increased by more than 148%, to $8.70, according to May, who is on death row.

“These are essential items that many people are forgoing simply because the cost keeps rising,” said May, a prison journalist who writes on issues related to mass incarceration and the death penalty. “People with dentures simply don’t wear dentures because they can’t afford the adhesive.”

For May, the price hikes serve as a reminder of how hard it can be for families to afford to send money to their loved ones in prison while also struggling with high prices on the outside.

“Those high costs also remind us of our absolute dependence on friends and family to send money to afford these things,” May said.

“Those people are also dealing with rising costs at the supermarket and are unlikely to send more money to their incarcerated loved ones when they were already struggling to do so.”

John Bull, a spokesperson for the Department Adult of Correction, said inflation has affected everyone, not just incarcerated people.

“Offenders in the North Carolina prison system aren’t affected by food or housing costs. Those are provided for them by the taxpayers,” Bull said. “All offenders are provided three square meals a day. Offenders are paying more for snacks and non-essentials because of inflation, just like everyone else. If they choose to purchase items from the canteens, that’s their choice.”

More than just inflation

While inflation is a factor, the high prices in state prisons are also because they have long been subject to price markups through agreements between the prisons and vendors. Since 2015, prices have been subject to up to a 20% markup at prison commissaries, according to DAC. Prior to this, they could be marked up by up to 18%.

In North Carolina, each state prison decides its own commissary prices, item selection, and vendor contracts. Profits for at least 13 prison canteens in North Carolina have increased significantly since 2015, partly due to the markups, according to a records request obtained by CPP.

For example, Avery-Mitchell Correctional Institution made about $21,000 in profits in 2015. As of August 2023, that figure was more than $100,000, a 21% increase, based on DAC data. Columbus and Alexander Correctional Institutions also saw double-digit increases in their profits, from 6% and 9% in 2015 to 18% and 17%, respectively, as of August 2023.

DAC said in a statement that profits increased partly because of the 20% markup on all canteen items, except stamps, in 2015. DAC also increased inmate spending limits to the current level of $45, $60 and $75 for close, medium, and minimum custody, respectively.

“When people buy things at the canteen, they’re often buying things that they can’t go without,” said Wanda Bertram, a communications strategist for the Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank focused on criminal justice. “It’s not right … for the prison or a company to be making money off of people shopping for those things.”

North Carolina prison commissary profits go to a welfare fund that the Department of Corrections is supposed to use on programs that benefit inmates. By law, some of the money goes to the Crime Victims Compensation Fund, which has received nearly $2 million since 2019, according to records obtained by CPP.

DAC says these funds are allocated to prison facilities for programs, education and recreational equipment. However, Bertram said the state should fund programs and services for incarcerated people, not shift the cost to inmates and their families by forcing them to buy essential items in the prison canteen.

“If there’s a program that people in prison need, that money for that program should come from the state,” Bertram said.

“You’re investing in incarcerated people’s lives and investing in their welfare when they come back from prison, that’s something that’s a public good. Taxpayers should be paying for that and not just the families of incarcerated people when they’re trying to buy something like a bottle of water.”

Economic strain on families

To prevent contraband from entering prisons or jails, correctional agencies prohibit family members from bringing packages during visits or mailing them directly to incarcerated loved ones.

To send packages, family members must order through online catalogs operated by Union Supply Group, the exclusive provider of packages to North Carolina prisons.

Its catalogs offer a variety of items, including toiletries, snacks and clothing. However, prices for these items are often higher than on the outside, and families often have to pay for shipping.

Cierra is one of many people who rely on USG to send food, clothing and gifts to her husband. She stopped ordering care packages for about a year because of the high cost.

“They had gone up so much for about a good year,” said Cierra, who has now resumed ordering the packages. “He told me not to buy them because some of the items on the care package were cheaper at the canteen.”

She pays more for some items, such as a 10-ounce Jergen lotion that costs $9.85, far more than she would spend outside.

USG is partnered with North Carolina Correction Enterprises, which is under DAC. Companies such as USG offer their services at no charge to corrections agencies along with a share of the revenue. In the last five years, North Carolina earned about $2.8 million from USG based on a 20% commission, according to records obtained by CPP.

Correction Enterprises operates the care package program at the Anson Correctional Institution in Polkton. About 21 incarcerated people work on the package program, earning $10.51 per hour. DAC said the revenue it receives from USG is reimbursement for operating the facility, including staff wages and benefits, rent and utilities.

USG has paid a 20% commission to Correction Enterprises since 2013, which will increase significantly this year after the company was forced to raise it to 35%.

In July 2021, after initially losing the package program to Keefe Group, which offered 35% commission in its bid, significantly higher than USG’s offer of 20%, USG sued. This past March, an administrative law judge awarded the contract back to USG, but this time the company agreed to pay a 35% commission.

Low prison wages

May and Jeffrey say the biggest issue they face is low pay inside prisons, which is well below the federal minimum wage.

Inflation is affecting everyone, but incarcerated people face even greater challenges because of their limited options, May said. People outside of prison can seek better-paying jobs, and employers are sometimes inclined to raise wages.

“Prices are indeed rising across the board, so too are the wages available to those in the workforce. An effort among employers exists to increase wages to match the cost of living. In contrast, North Carolina prisons continue to pay inmates the same rates they were paid in the 1960s and 1970s,” May said.

A 2022 ACLU report found that inmates in state prisons across the U.S. are paid on average between 13 and 52 cents per hour for “non-industry jobs,” such as janitorial work or maintenance and repairs, which make up the majority of prison jobs.

In North Carolina, for non-industry jobs, the daily wage is between 40 cents and $1.

About 90% of incarcerated people assigned to work programs in fiscal year 2020-21 worked inside prison facilities, according to the Department of Public Safety annual statistical report.

These jobs help reduce the cost of building and operating facilities, while providing job skills that can help incarcerated people find employment upon release, according to the report.

Incarcerated people working in prison industries earn up to $3 per day, for work such as farming, food processing, printing, sewing, laundering, and manufacturing car license tags and street signs.

Question before the courts

Kristi Graunke, legal director of the ACLU of North Carolina, says underpaying incarcerated people, especially when preparing them for the workforce, hinders their ability to thrive outside of prison and increases their risk of recidivism.

People in prisons often need to save money for things like transportation, housing, and food after they are released.

“To the extent that (job skills) are transferable, it makes no sense not to pay them more fairly for that work,” Graunke said. “Forcing incarcerated people to work for very little money, and then not leaving them a nest egg when they leave prison, creates a cycle of recidivism.”

The courts have ruled that incarcerated individuals working within prisons do not have the right to the minimum wage. However, a Maryland case currently before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit may soon determine whether prisoners working alongside non-incarcerated individuals for third party employers beyond prison walls are subject to the same minimum wage laws.

The ACLU of North Carolina and other chapters recently submitted an amicus brief in the case, arguing that those incarcerated individuals working for third party employees should be entitled to the same minimum wage protections as other workers.

“This practice of putting incarcerated workers alongside private sector workers turns that law on its head and undermines it because the incentive for these private companies or third parties is to reach out and try to get more incarcerated workers because they’re cheaper, rather than hire people who are free world laborers,” Graunke said.

“That is something that ought to be of concern to the court because not covering incarcerated workers in this instance really undermines the entire purpose of the minimum wage statute.”

119,[North Carolina] https://carolinapublicpress.org/recent-news/,What does ruling banning Trump from Colorado ballot mean for NC voters?,https://carolinapublicpress.org/62603/trump-disqualified-colorado-court-what-about-nc-ballots/,"The Colorado Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday, which disqualifies former President Donald Trump from running for president in that state under the disqualification clause in the U.S. Constitution, is likely to have implications in North Carolina too, experts say.

Recent efforts nationwide have tried to disqualify Trump from primary elections, but they were dismissed on procedural grounds because political parties get to decide how delegates are assigned and nominees get chosen, according to David Becker, the executive director and founder of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, civic organization.

“I don’t think this is going to make it more or less likely that any other state court passes a similar ruling, it’s very likely however that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up this case and that will have a significant impact on the states,” Becker said during a virtual media briefing on Wednesday.

Carolina Public Press interviewed five political scientists Wednesday to examine the significance of the Colorado ruling and its implications in North Carolina.

While some N.C. experts say similar efforts to disqualify Trump from the ballot in the state could possibly take place, most agree that the N.C. Supreme Court, which has a Republican-majority bench, may not rule in their favor.

Other experts say that what happens on a state level is of less consequence if the Colorado Supreme Court decision is appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which would ultimately either qualify or disqualify Trump on ballots in all states, including North Carolina.

Martha Kropf, a professor of political science and public administration at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, wouldn’t be surprised if there were efforts to disqualify Trump in North Carolina, she said.

“It is possible for a similar case to be brought to a lower or state court in North Carolina,” Kropf said, but “it still may be a federal issue like the one in Colorado.”

“It’s a state supreme court interpreting the U.S. Constitution,” said John Szmer, also a professor of political science and public administration at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, of the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling. “They have their interpretation and it only applies to Colorado and nowhere else.”

The disqualification clause in the federal Constitution is not the strongest legal argument because courts have disagreed on the issue and “it at least fits in a legal gray area,” Szmer said.

“There are possible implications for perceptions of the legitimacy of courts when they challenge the candidacy of somebody who has a very intense political following and is a perceived leader of a political party,” he said.

NC court friendly to Trump

Most of the experts interviewed share a similar perspective, that a state supreme court decision like Colorado’s is improbable in North Carolina’s political landscape.

Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, said such a ruling “is not possible here” because of the composition of the court — a Republican majority N.C. Supreme Court bench.

Based on the N.C. Supreme Court’s recent decisions on various voting issues, such as the reversal of the court’s decision on the voter ID requirement, it seems probable on a state-level that attempting to disqualify Trump from the ballot wouldn’t be possible, Kropf said.

Szmer agrees that “the probability of the North Carolina Supreme Court agreeing with the Colorado Supreme Court is very, very low,” he said.

However, the State Constitution in North Carolina also has specific criteria for disqualification for office. It describes three instances in which a person can be disqualified: denying “the being of Almighty God,” if a person “is not qualified to vote in an election for that office” and anyone who is found “guilty of treason or any other felony against this State or the United States.”

While the State Constitution does describe the grounds for disqualification, “North Carolina’s Supreme Court, appellate courts and the state Board of Elections will be very careful moving forwards in this direction because of this perception that the election might be rigged,” said Nadine Gibson, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington, of the sociopolitical climate in the state.

“This is very touchy territory, considering that the Jan. 6 situation is present in the back of many people’s minds,” she said of the statewide implications of disqualifying Trump on the ballot.

Preparations for elections start very early, she said. If Trump were disqualified from the ballot at the last minute, “there could be financial costs” for election administration, such as the reprinting of ballots, she said.

“It’s better to have the courts figure out what’s going to happen now, rather than even a few months from now,” Gibson said.

Andrew Taylor, a professor of political science at N.C. State, said if Trump were convicted in any of the federal cases against him, he possibly could be disqualified in North Carolina under the state Constitution.

“If Trump was found guilty as a felon, then he wouldn’t be, through that logic, qualified to be on the ballot in North Carolina,” Taylor said.

While Taylor isn’t sure whether any movements are afoot in the state to do that, he said, “I bet you there are lawsuits ready to go should this happen to Trump.”

Given that 2024 is an election year, Taylor said it’s clear to him that Trump’s qualification is a matter that would be best resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court because “it is a matter of federal office and the U.S. Constitution.”

“We’re on the road to some kind of national solution,” he said.

JERUSALEM — In a rubble-strewn alley near the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, Israeli soldiers say they found themselves being lured into a deadly and surreal trap. “The ambush attempted to use dolls and children’s backpacks with speakers playing sounds of crying,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement last week. “These were placed intentionally near a tunnel shaft connecting to a large tunnel network.” The IDF posted photos of two makeshift mannequins or dolls swaddled in toddler clothing rigged with explosives.

In recent days, the IDF has reported that its soldiers have been hearing recordings of weeping and people speaking Hebrew — attempts, commanders believe, to trick the Israeli soldiers to search for hostages nearby. The IDF has not released those recordings.

Some analysts suggest that wariness of such traps might have been a factor in the IDF’s mistaken killing of three Israeli hostages in Gaza last week — that the troops were spooked and too fast to fire.

As the conflict rages, Israeli forces and Hamas militants on the ground are waging war on an increasingly complex battlefield — one on which Israel deploys 21st-century drones and robots while Hamas relies on some of the oldest tactics: deception, surprise, ambush.

In intense urban combat, fought above and below ground, Hamas militants dart from building to building in civilian clothes, the IDF says, and attempt to ensnare Israeli soldiers with booby traps and lures.

Israeli analysts say the IDF is struggling to meet opposing objectives: finding and killing Hamas fighters while also trying to rescue Israeli and foreign hostages.

The three Israeli hostages could not have done more to signal that they were not a threat. They were shirtless and carried a makeshift white flag. Nearby was a crude sign that read, “SOS,” the internationally recognized distress signal, and below, scrawled in Hebrew: “Help! 3 hostages.”

A preliminary IDF investigation indicates the message was written by the hostages. Israeli officials have not explained why it was ignored.

Rights activists say the hostages’ deaths show that at least some IDF soldiers are too quick to shoot. Even the father of one of the dead captives asked, plaintively, why the soldiers did not wound his son in the leg.

The IDF said the soldiers broke the rules of engagement. Senior military leaders have apologized to the nation and the families. Evidence emerged this week that an IDF combat dog with a GoPro camera had recorded the voices of the three captives. An investigation continues.

Critics say the incident wouldn’t have been investigated or even publicized if the three had been Palestinians.

Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said the deceptions “are designed to entice the army to enter areas that Hamas prepared in advance as kill zones.”

“It’s also meant to create confusion, chaos, anger and frustration.”

Hamas recordings of people speaking Hebrew might grow less effective over time, but they remain a challenge or provocation, he said. “It’s as if they’re saying, ‘See, you are mighty forces, but we continue to taunt you.’”

Israeli soldiers facing high-intensity, close-quarters combat are probably “already fatigued and frightened,” he said, and “the backdrop of all the deception operations by Hamas” makes them “more vulnerable to being caught off guard.”

The IDF said Wednesday that it had uncovered approximately 1,500 tunnel shafts and tunnel routes in Gaza since Israel launched its ground invasion in late October.

Hamas boasts of its use of tunnels and ambushes. The militants stress that they’re the smaller force battling for their homeland against occupation by one of the best-equipped militaries on Earth.

The Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announces daily, through news briefings on its Telegram channel, the targeting of Israeli forces across the Gaza Strip. Proud of its use of antitank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades — especially those targeting Israeli tanks, but often aimed at infantry, too — it also publishes videos of the attacks.

A typical report, from Wednesday, reads: “Qassam Mujahideen were able to booby-trap the eye of a tunnel east of the city of Khan Younis, and as soon as an occupation army force advanced to the eye of the tunnel, it was blown up with soldiers, and the force members were killed and wounded.”

Al-Qassam statements do not reveal the deceptions employed. They don’t mention exploding dolls or Hebrew recordings. Hamas officials refused to share details with The Washington Post: “This is military information that cannot be disclosed by al-Qassam.”

“Booby traps, dolls, crying, people speaking Hebrew,” said a lieutenant colonel in an IDF reconnaissance unit. “We have been well-briefed.”

The officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the IDF, said his unit was sent recently to investigate a building in central Gaza where he said rocket parts had been manufactured and some of soldiers heard “recordings of crying” but could not find the source.

The IDF destroyed the building. In this environment, the officer said, everything and everyone is suspicious.

He described Hamas fighters coming out of a tunnel into a room where Israeli soldiers slept. He recalled a Palestinian man in his underwear waving a bloody white flag and approaching his troops. The Israelis sent a small drone out to examine him. The man was wounded.

The man told them later that he was forced by Hamas to surrender to the Israelis while from a nearby building the scene was being filmed, the officer said. The officer didn’t know if his troops were being probed or if the militants wanted to photograph the Israelis shooting a civilian. He was not shot, the officer said, but given first aid and taken to an ambulance.

“There’s no safe place,” the lieutenant colonel said. He was echoing, perhaps unintentionally, a plaint spoken by many Gazan civilians under the Israeli onslaught.

Hamas triggered the current hostilities by rampaging through Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostage. Israel responded with a campaign the government says is aimed at eradicating Hamas.

Nearly 20,000 Gazans have been killed in the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The IDF reports that at least 130 of its soldiers have died since the start of the ground invasion.

Gaza’s close quarters and dense population make “it very, very difficult to conduct any military operation,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters this week in Tel Aviv.

“Above and beyond that, Hamas routinely uses civilians as shields,” he said at a news conference with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “Beyond that, they place their headquarters and their logistical sites near protected sites, hospitals, mosques, churches, you name it. And so, that adds to the complexity.”

The conditions require “a very professional force,” Austin said, “and that force has to learn each step of the way.”

Ron Ben-Yishai, senior national security commentator for the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, has reported on all of Israel’s wars from 1967 to today.

He believes the shooting of the three hostages was not a result of Hamas lures but rather an ethical failure by the IDF. “The shooting of the three hostages was done hastily,” he said. “It has no connection to Hamas tactics, which I witnessed firsthand.”

“They simply abandoned IDF values,” he said. “In my opinion, not all fighters behave this way. Quite the opposite. Most of them are very careful.”

When Ben-Yishai entered Gaza recently with the IDF, he said, he “saw inside a children’s room, among the blankets, a large explosive device that was very unpleasant to encounter.”

“The bombs were hanging in sandbags on the walls to explode at the head level of the soldiers,” he said. “With the crying of children and all these gimmicks, the goal is to lure the IDF forces into traps. They lay bait to bring the forces to the area where explosives are placed in a circuit and connected to each other. And it did happen. They managed to hit soldiers like that.”

“Hamas’s use of deceit and trickery tactics is not new,” said Netanel Flamer, a senior researcher in Middle Eastern studies at Bar-Ilan University who is soon to publish a book on the group’s combat methods.

Hamas exploits the complexity of urban combat, he said, “aiming to either cause harm to innocent civilians, leading to the erosion of Israel’s international legitimacy and self-recrimination, or to harm the Israeli society by creating internal division and questioning the military operation’s justification.”"

KABUL — More than two years after the Taliban’s takeover, its internationally isolated government is pushing ahead with a plan to make the Afghan economy more self-sustaining, if not outright self-sufficient. Afghan officials are overseeing the construction of dams and canals to boost agriculture, and tunnels to connect remote provinces. Steel mills work through the night to churn out red-glowing, heavy beams for infrastructure projects.

The Taliban-run government’s ambitions, at least in part, are driven by necessity. The Taliban’s crackdown on women’s rights has worsened its pariah status, stalling efforts to gain control over Afghan central bank reserves held abroad and to secure Western funding. While foreign aid funded three-fourths of the public expenditures before the takeover, the Taliban says it is largely relying on domestic revenue and customs to finance its projects.

Abdul Latif Nazari, a deputy minister of economy, acknowledged in an interview that these financial constraints limit the scope of government projects. “But we’re on the right path,” he said, “the path that will lead us to self-sufficiency.”

For the Afghan population, however, economic conditions continue to deteriorate. The number of Afghans with humanitarian needs has surged by about 60 percent since 2021 and now represents over two-thirds of the population, according to the United Nations.

And challenges are mounting. Afghanistan’s top trading partner, Pakistan, is increasingly frustrated with the government in Kabul and has been willing to disrupt economic ties for political purposes. Meanwhile, cash-strapped Afghan business owners and other taxpayers say they’re running out of savings to pay for the Taliban-run government’s plans.

“Self-sufficiency itself does not mean anything,” said Omar Joya, an Afghan economist, unless the Taliban can achieve “economic growth, employment, lower poverty levels and an adequate life so that people can at least meet their basic needs.”

Riches below the ground

Taliban officials say a priority is an expansion of oil extraction, drawing on reserves that could eventually cover domestic demand, according to assessments conducted before the Taliban takeover. With new wells, one of Afghanistan’s biggest oil fields, located in the Amu Darya basin in the north of the country, could increase its output more than threefold in the coming months, officials projected.

They are also rushing to exploit the country’s vast wealth of lithium ore and other minerals, which might be worth almost $1 trillion, according to a U.S. Defense Department estimate in 2010. Afghan authorities say they struck seven mining contracts earlier this year, worth $6.5 billion in investment.

It could take years before mining can start on a large scale. Once it does, the Taliban says infrastructure projects now underway will be essential for exporting coal, minerals, as well as vegetables.

In the west of the landlocked country, a railway link with Iran that is being repaired has raised the prospect of Afghan freight trains heading to Iranian sea ports. Meanwhile, repairs at the Salang tunnel in northern Afghanistan were just completed, Taliban officials say, which could ease travel between central and northern Afghanistan and facilitate trade with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

During years of war, long-haul trucking in Afghanistan was obstructed by Taliban attacks and military checkpoints where extortion was common, but a more reliable road network could now help to revive this commerce.

“Afghanistan is standing on its own feet,” said Shir Baz Kaminzada, a mining and industry representative and the chief executive of one of the country’s largest printing companies, which until not long ago produced NATO leaflets.

But Kaminzada acknowledged that reminders of the country’s international isolation remain ever present. Western manufacturers that used to supply his plants with equipment and banks that facilitated his payments now shun his company, he complained.

He blamed Pakistan for much of the disruption. Afghanistan’s industry is rising from the ashes, he said. “They’re scared.”

Tensions with Pakistan

The more Afghan officials seek autonomy, the more apparent it has become how dependent the country remains on neighboring countries. When trucks carrying agricultural produce headed toward Pakistan this fall, they were repeatedly halted at the border. As politicians traded accusations, pomegranates and onions rotted in the sun.

Pakistan’s leadership blames the Afghan Taliban for harboring militants who have staged a mounting number of deadly attacks in Pakistan in recent months. Angered, Islamabad has expelled hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees, seized Afghan imports and imposed restrictions on cross-border trade.

The impact of the political tensions was palpable at the customs department in Kabul on a recent afternoon, where imports from and exports to Pakistan are processed.

As trucks carrying goods arrived at the gate, many of the warehouses were only half-full. Ahmad Khalid Rahimi, a 45-year-old customs official, was quick to explain that the empty shelves were in no way a reflection of the economy, but rather of the department’s efficiency. “Everything is being processed very quickly,” assured Rahimi.

“Why are you lying?” whispered a frustrated worker who stood nearby. “We don’t have enough supplies these days.”

An hour away, at the Milat steel factory on the outskirts of Kabul, the gap between the government’s ambitions and reality is evident every day at 4 p.m. when the electricity goes out for about six hours, and the cranes and observation towers lose power.

Hundreds of employees were hired when the factory, central to the Taliban’s infrastructure plans, reopened last year. And yet, the factory has in recent months struggled with shortages of electricity.

The Taliban is hoping to use solar energy to make the country’s power grid self-sufficient. But for years to come, the Milat steel factory will likely have to compete with the power demands of more than 5 million Kabul residents and the constraints of a grid that has for decades relied on imported electricity.

Despite high demand for the factory’s output, Milat Steel recently had to lay off 150 of its 500 workers, said Nasir Ahmad Haqmal, 35, who supervises production.

Uncertain times

Taliban officials primarily blame the West for many of the challenges. In an interview, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid singled out the United States for freezing $7 billion in Afghan central bank assets after the Taliban takeover. “First, they occupied our country. And now they occupy our reserves,” said Mujahid.

But Afghanistan’s new partners could prove challenging, too. While some Chinese companies are positioning themselves to reap a windfall from lithium and other natural resources, the Chinese government’s ties to the Taliban remain limited. Afghanistan is focusing much of its outreach on Iran, but long-standing border tensions over scarce water supplies make political relations between the two countries unpredictable.

Meanwhile, taxes, fees and licenses have become such a burden for some Afghans that they say they’re thinking about giving up their businesses.

Ismail Hotak, 25, founded a commercial real estate agency on the outskirts of Kabul last year. Even though business has been dismal, he keeps getting hit with taxes and unexpected fees that he said he didn’t know existed.

“If the authorities ask me for any more money, I’ll just close,” he said.

Many of these fees existed before the Taliban takeover but were less stringently enforced. Corrupt officials “reduced the cost if we paid them directly. Most of it went into their own pockets,” recalled Sahib Khan Ansari, 48, a steel vendor in Kabul.

Ansari said he appreciates the decline in corruption and the increased investments in infrastructure under the Taliban.

But the one thing that would make the economy flourish by clearing the way for foreign aid and investment, he said, would be the reopening of schools for girls.

MOSCOW — In Russia, where the entire LGBTQ+ community has been banned as “extremist,” some parents are paying thugs to abduct their queer sons and daughters, forcing them into secure private centers to “cure” them with so-called conversion therapy. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Some of these young people are fleeing the country, looking for safety in the West.

Former residents say conditions behind high concrete walls are like small unregulated prisons, designed for alcoholics, drug addicts, or people whose families see them as problems.

Many were tricked or abducted, then held for months. They recounted being beaten, humiliated or forced to read out confessions that they were destructive and selfish because of their “addiction” to their sexual or gender identity — mimicking rigid programs designed to combat drug and alcohol addiction.

Many of them emerged “somehow mentally broken,” believing there was something wrong with them, said Vladimir Komov, who formerly served as a rights lawyer at a prominent LGBTQ+ legal advocacy group DELO LGBT+, which shut its operations last week due to the ban.

A 2020 report by an independent United Nations expert found that conversion therapy was “deeply harmful … inflicting severe pain and suffering and resulting in long-lasting psychological and physical damage.” The report called for a global ban.

In President Vladimir Putin’s move to cement his rule and build a repressive, deeply conservative nation, he has singled out LGBTQ+ people as scapegoats alongside antiwar activists.

But the rhetoric is also part of Putin’s bid to enlist socially conservative nations in Africa and the Middle East to back Russia in its war against Ukraine. At the same, he hopes to divide liberal Western democracies by encouraging antipathy to LGBTQ+ rights.

In a Nov. 30 ruling, Russia’s Supreme Court endorsed a Justice Ministry application to ban the “international LGBT public movement” as an extremist organization, following other repressive laws. After the ruling, police raided LGBTQ+ venues in Moscow.

One movie streaming site, apparently fearing prosecution, placed an adults-only rating on “My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,” an animated children’s series, likely because of the pony Rainbow Dash’s rainbow mane and tail — the same colors as a Pride flag.

Before its closure, DELO LGBT+ handled 200 monthly requests for legal help from queer people. Of these requests, 7 percent said their families threatened to put them into treatment centers, tried to do so or had done so in the past, the group said.

“After these laws, the number of people facing threats to be put in such institutions has increased,” Komov said.

Ada Blakewell, a 23-year-old transgender nonbinary person, queer activist and journalist, who uses she and they pronouns, underwent nine months of conversion treatment, from August 2022 until May 2023, in a remote treatment center, Freedom Rehabilitation Center, in the Altai region of Siberia.

Blakewell said she was beaten, thrown into a nearby river as punishment and forced to perform physical exercises repeatedly “until all I could see is white and yet they forced me to do it over and over again.”

Those undergoing the treatment had to swim in the river daily at 8 a.m. before morning prayers, even in winter in subfreezing temperatures. She was given “manly” jobs like chopping wood and helping slaughter chickens, turkeys and pigs “to help myself to become a man.”

In one disturbing incident, she was forced to castrate a pig, after being told that she would see what transgender surgery was like.

“I was given a surgical knife and given instructions how to do it,” she said. “But I couldn’t finish it. I had a severe panic attack and from then on, I was getting more and more suicidal.”

She was given neuroleptic drugs, designed for people suffering psychiatric illness.

“You could call me a prisoner,” she said.

Alexandra, 28, a Moscow transgender woman whose wealthy parents also rejected her gender identity, was forcibly held in several treatment centers for 21 months.

Alexandra, who agreed to describe her experience on condition that she be identified only by first name, spent 20 months in a center outside Moscow with about 60 other people, mainly drug addicts and alcoholics, which was staffed by former residents, who doled out punishments. They told her being queer was an addiction that would ruin her life.

Alexandra said was so heavily sedated she felt “like a zombie” and was constantly told she was sick. Other residents threatened to kill her. “I felt alone because people around me were from another world,” she said. “People were very distant. I was feeling like I’m canceled. I felt invalid.”

The accounts by Blakewell and by Alexandra could not be independently verified but were consistent with previous accounts in Russian independent media and by international rights groups about conversion therapy centers in Russia.

Blakewell said she had been tricked into going to the center by her mother, a business executive, who asked her to support her during heart surgery in a rural area of the Altai region. Her mother got out of the car. A hefty, thuggish man then pressed Blakewell against the door, the locks snapped shut and her phone, Apple watch and backpack were taken.

As they drove to the treatment center, the driver told her it was time to atone for being queer, using an offensive epithet. “I still feel really bitter toward my family,” Blakewell said.

Alexandra faced similar deception.

“I didn’t know what to think,” she said. “I was in a really vulnerable state mentally at that time.”

Conversion therapy has been banned in 22 U.S. states and in 12 countries, with many others planning national bans, according to Global Equality Caucus, an international network of lawmakers that supports equal rights for LGBTQ+ people.

Last month, Konstantin Boikov, a lawyer with DELO LGBT+, fled Russia for New York after homophobic threats and abuse. (He does not identify as gay.) Tomatoes and eggs were hurled at his apartment door, and abusive notes and severed chicken heads were also left there.

He said he feared imprisonment by Russian authorities or homophobic violence if he stayed.

“We cannot continue our activity as an organization,” said Boikov, one of five DELO LGBT+ activists now based in New York, who serves as lawyer to both Blakewell and Alexandra as they pursue legal action. “So our members will act individually, helping people as lawyers or human rights activists.” No client will be abandoned, he said.

“The state is trying to convince the population that all the country’s ills all come from these enemies,” Boikov said, “so that people unite around one leader, without thinking.”

Alexandra was freed in June after she broke a staircase fitting and threatened managers that she would continue to break more things unless she was released. Her parents still shun her.

Blakewell escaped a month after she was abducted but was quickly caught and beaten so severely some of her teeth were broken. She tried twice more and was beaten again. She won her freedom by calling police from a staffer’s cellphone that was left lying around, insisting on rescue until they finally came.

Before her imprisonment, Alexandra was proudly transgender. After her freedom, she said she tried to mentally break free of the “conversion” therapy, “but I failed.”"

The U.N. Security Council is tentatively slated to vote Friday on a draft resolution that would call for an indefinite pause in fighting to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been delayed multiple times because of opposition from the United States. The political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, visited Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials about the war in Gaza.

Hostages: More than 100 held in the Gaza Strip have been released. Here’s what we know about those released by Hamas so far.

A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier around the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

More than 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip in the war between Israel and Hamas, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hamas militants led an attack on Israel on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s response — an all-out bombardment of Gaza and a ground invasion — has killed almost 1 in 100 people in the Strip.

The Gaza Health Ministry said early Friday that 20,057 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since Oct. 7.

The number of deaths is far higher than in any conflict in Gaza in recent history. And it is higher than the estimated 15,000 Palestinians killed in the violence that followed the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Palestinians call that mass displacement the Nakba, or “the catastrophe.”

Neta C. Crawford, co-director of the Costs of War Project at Brown University, which tracks the toll of conflicts, said the rate of death among the population was similar to that of 20th-century wars.

“This is, in the 21st century, a significant and out-of-the-norm level of destruction,” she said.

The number of people killed in Gaza since Oct. 7 has been a subject of dispute. The Washington Post and other media outlets rely on numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry, as many international institutions, organizations and global bodies did before the war. The ministry has proved reliable historically, with direct access to hospitals and morgues. It writes death certificates for Palestinians living in the enclave.

Israeli and U.S. officials have questioned the figures publicly, however, arguing that they cannot be trusted because the ministry is controlled by Hamas, which both countries designate as a terrorist group. Both governments have noted that it does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.

“The only figures that Israel and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] can estimate with a degree of confidence are the numbers of Hamas terrorists killed since the Oct. 7 attack,” an Israeli official said this month, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. The official said that “several thousand” Hamas fighters had been killed at that point, a small proportion of a force that has been estimated at 30,000.

War makes counting the dead difficult. The Gaza Health Ministry paused its death toll updates last month, citing communication outages and a lack of access to besieged hospitals, but later resumed counting.

While the United Nations often releases its own counts after a conflict, in Gaza it is relying for now on numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry, given the information available. U.N. officials have said they see no reason to doubt the figures, but acknowledge that the numbers could prove inaccurate for practical reasons.

At a meeting of the World Health Organization’s executive board, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cited the Gaza Health Ministry figures and suggested they could actually be an undercount.

“We don’t know how many are buried under the rubble of their homes,” said Tedros, who leads a U.N. agency that works directly with the Gaza Health Ministry.

The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has seen 134 members of its staff working in Gaza killed since Oct. 7, said William Deere, the agency’s representative in Washington.

A team of academic experts in health data at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health studied the number of deaths of U.N. staff in Gaza and used the data to estimate whether the Gaza Health Ministry’s death toll was being inflated.

They found “no evidence” of inflated mortality in the data, the experts wrote in a letter published in the Lancet medical journal earlier this month.

“The true death toll is probably higher than what’s being reported because of difficulties verifying bodies buried under rubble and diminished capacity from the hospital system,” one of the experts, Benjamin Q. Huynh, added in an email.

The bombardment of Gaza, particularly in the north in the early stages of the war, has been intense by any measure. The densely populated enclave, in which more than 2 million people live in cramped cities and refugee camps, and the presence of military facilities in civilian areas have contributed to a significant death toll.

Analysts have suggested that the heavy destruction of infrastructure, particularly in the north of Gaza, indicates the use of large bombs such as the 2,000-pound Mark 84 bombs.

While these huge bombs can be retrofitted with the U.S.-supplied JDAM system to become a precision weapon, a U.S. intelligence assessment found that almost half of the munitions Israel has used in Gaza since the war began have been unguided bombs, an unusually high proportion for a high-tech military like the IDF.

The pace of death does not appear to have slowed as the conflict drags on. An average of 277 deaths were recorded each day in Gaza from Oct. 7 to Nov. 24, when a week-long pause in the conflict began. In the period since fighting resumed on Dec. 1, the average number of daily deaths has risen to more than 300, according to Health Ministry figures.

The Biden administration has begun to push Israel to lower the tempo of its conflict. President Biden told supporters at a recent campaign event that “indiscriminate bombing” was beginning to cost Israel support around the world.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan told Israel officials that they should transition “to lower-intensity operations … in the near future,” John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, later told reporters.

At the end of November, the Biden administration provided an estimate to Congress that the death toll in Gaza was more than 15,000, close to the number provided by the Gaza Health Ministry at the time.

In an appearance on social media in early December, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus suggested that the Israeli military would soon present an “analysis of claims made by the Hamas-controlled and so-called Gaza Health Ministry.” In the same appearance, Conricus repeated the claim that the number of dead militants in Gaza was “in the thousands.”

Brian Finucane, a State Department attorney under the Obama administration who serves as a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, said that under the rules of war, the IDF would be expected to assess any potential civilian death toll of an attack before it began.

The aim would be to ensure that any civilian harm was proportionate to the military advantage expected. “Whether they’d ever release them is another matter,” Finucane said of those estimates.

High levels of death in Gaza undercut arguments that Israel is avoiding civilian deaths, Crawford said."

Choose your plan ArrowRight Readers of Today’s WorldView may agree that it’s been a grim year. In Ukraine, a grinding counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion lurched into a bleak stalemate. In the Middle East, a decades-old conflict exploded into an unprecedented, high-intensity war in the Gaza Strip. The bulk of the territory’s inhabitants have been driven from their homes, some 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in a matter of weeks, and a quarter of Gaza’s population is “starving,” according to the United Nations, which warned Thursday that the risk of famine in the territory is “increasing each day.”

“It doesn’t get any worse,” Arif Husain, chief economist for the United Nations World Food Program, told reporters. “I have never seen something at the scale that is happening in Gaza. And at this speed.”

While these two wars consumed the attention of major global news outlets (and this daily newsletter) for much of 2023, other crises smoldered on. In Sudan and Myanmar, ruinous civil wars, marked by myriad atrocities and reports of war crimes, are collapsing already dysfunctional states and provoking spiraling humanitarian crises. Over a wide swath of sub-Saharan Africa, coups and power grabs roiled the region. Social instability and post-pandemic economic pressures fueled surges in migration across the world.

2023 will probably be the hottest year on record, with heat waves scourging every continent, accompanied by other extreme climactic events. Droughts and floods were both more acute — the most viscerally shocking moment came arguably in September, when heavy rains led to the failure of dams and flash floods that killed more than 11,000 in northeastern Libya. “This disaster is of mythic proportions,” a Libyan health official told my colleagues at the time.

After storm waters destroyed two dams in east Libya, a devastating flood washed through Derna on Sept. 11, washing away people, cars and buildings. (Video: John Farrell/The Washington Post)

In the face of such calamity, one would hope that the new year would bring better news. But, as your humble harbinger of bad tidings, I have to apologize: There’s a lot that can go wrong in 2024, and many crises that will get worse.

The war in Gaza is reaching a dangerous tipping point. While Israeli officials vow a long campaign, the current fighting is pushing Gaza’s 2.2 million people to the brink. The territory is the deadliest place in the world to be a civilian. Before Oct. 7, when the militant group Hamas launched its strike on southern Israel, 80 percent of Gaza’s population required humanitarian assistance. Now, everyone does, and barely a trickle of what’s needed is getting into the besieged territory. Aid organizations and myriad world leaders are calling for a cease-fire and a surge of relief aid into Gaza. But absent a cessation of hostilities, the war could convulse the region, bringing in anti-Israel factions based in Lebanon and Syria, and spawning an unprecedented flow of Palestinian refugees into Egypt.

In its annual “emergency watchlist” published this month, the International Rescue Committee ranked the conflict in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories as the second most glaring crisis to watch in 2024. The first was the far-less-discussed civil war in Sudan, where eight months of fighting between the country’s military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have left more than half the country in need of humanitarian aid and forced some 6 million people from their homes. Some 19 million children are without education as the conflict has shuttered thousands of schools.

“Sudan has become the world’s largest displacement crisis,” the IRC’s Elshafie Mohamed Ahmed said in the report. “The ability to deliver aid is hindered by the lack of humanitarian access and funds. The ethnic, tribal and regional polarization of the current war is further threatening the limited access currently available.”

150,000.



That’s the number of children forcibly displaced in less than a week as fighting escalates in Sudan’s Al Jazirah state.



Nearly 3M children are at risk.



Here’s what you need to know about this crisis. — UNICEF (@UNICEF) December 21, 2023

Africa is home to the bulk of the other potential hot spots, as listed by the IRC. Three “coup belt” nations in West Africa — the junta-led states of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger — are all in the rankings. The Burkinabe military is floundering in the face of a surge in Islamist militancy, with renegade factions controlling more than half the country. In Mali and Niger, where similar dynamics are on show, growing food insecurity and the drying up of foreign aid are plunging millions toward greater peril.

The IRC’s 10 “watchlist” nations account for 86 percent of all people in humanitarian need globally. Lurking behind the political instability consuming these societies is the specter of a warming planet, as droughts and other climate shocks affect some of the world’s most vulnerable communities. “What were once separate circles of crisis are now a Venn diagram with an expanding intersection,” wrote IRC President David Miliband. “Three decades ago, 44% of conflicts happened in climate-vulnerable states. Now that figure is 67%.”

The Biden administration has most successfully held the line in shoring up Western support for Ukraine’s resistance to Russian aggression. But its scope for action will be constrained in a divisive election year, and even Washington’s capacity to fund Kyiv is in doubt — let alone its ability to get its arms around myriad crises elsewhere, from Somalia to Afghanistan to gang-dominated Haiti, teetering on the verge of state collapse.

In Asia, an election in Taiwan may be marked by new provocations from China at a time when the Biden administration is trying to bring some stability to its relationship with Beijing. But the biggest conflagration could take place in Myanmar, where the ruling junta is reeling from an offensive launched by a coalition of rebel militias and seeing mounting desertion in its ranks.

The current trajectory, however, “does not point towards a near-term regime collapse on the battlefield, absent unforeseen developments,” noted Morgan Michaels, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Myanmar is instead headed towards a new phase of the conflict, marked by a weakened but still dangerous regime, more intense violence and greater uncertainty.”"

For Palestinians in Gaza, there’s nowhere left to go.

They were already packed tightly before the war, hemmed in by a years-long Israeli and Egyptian blockade. During the current conflict, few parts of the enclave have been spared bombardment, and Israel’s often haphazard and confusing evacuation orders have pushed the displaced into ever-shrinking “safe” areas.

But with limited internet and power, many civilians couldn’t access the grid and when they did, they found it hard to follow. Dec. 2 Israel on Dec. 2 directed civilians in southeastern Gaza to move farther south to Rafah. Dec. 3 A day later, civilians in Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, were also told to evacuate. Tens of thousands had been taking refuge in the city after having fled there from the north.

Almost 1.9 million people, 85 percent of Gaza’s population, have now been forced from their homes, the largest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948.

“They keep saying, ‘Go south. Go to a safer place,’” said Aseel, a resident of northern Gaza who gave only her middle name for security reasons. But then she hears that new strikes have hit those areas too. She added: “We are going in circles here in Gaza. That’s the problem.”

The IDF says it is “seeking constantly to minimize harm to the Palestinian civilian population,” pointing to its evacuation-announcement system of texts, phone calls, airdropped leaflets and warning strikes.

Nearly 20,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry — including many who had evacuated to elsewhere in the Strip in search of safety.

The IDF used to call areas supposedly free from bombardment “safe zones”; it now refers to them as “safer zones.” According to a damage analysis of satellite data by remote-sensing experts Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, at least 20 percent of buildings in the south have been damaged, including in Khan Younis and Rafah.

Overcrowding

Rafah, which makes up just 17 percent of Gaza’s area, has become the epicenter for displacement. Before the war, Rafah was home to 280,000 people. But population density has increased fourfold as more than 1 million people — about half of Gaza’s population — have poured into Rafah, according to the United Nations. The forced displacement has pushed civilians into shelters that are “dangerously overcrowded,” said Arvind Das, Gaza team lead for the International Rescue Committee.

“My 2-year-old daughter wants milk every day. She continues to cry for several hours, but I have no help to offer,” said Anwaar al-Khatib, 28, who fled from her battered home in Beit Hanoun to the Tal al-Zaatar area — which was then bombed — to the Indonesian Hospital — which was then besieged — and finally to a school serving as a shelter in Rafah. “Two cans of beans are distributed every two days. Or three.”

Rafah’s al-Quds School is overwhelmed with families, said Muhammad Issa, who is in charge of the shelter. The school, which normally accommodates 1,000 students, is now hosting three times as many people.

Conditions are desperate. About 70 women and children sleep in each of the school’s 27 classrooms, Issa said. Men sleep in the outdoor courtyard.

Touma called it a “super crisis moment.” The agency planned to host 150,000 people in 56 shelters in a worst-case conflict scenario; now, it’s supporting nearly 1.4 million in 155 shelters, according to UNRWA media adviser Adnan Abu Hasna.

At some shelters, 1,000 people share one toilet, he said. The wait is hours.

For a shower, which 5,000 people share, “you have to wait days,” Abu Hasna said.

There are lines for water “everywhere” in the Strip, he added. And days-long lines for flour too.

The supply base was completed in 2019 as a place to store and distribute flour and other basic goods. It was never intended as a location to house people. Displaced Palestinians have crowded into the 26 warehouses and set up tents in the empty lots around the complex’s buildings. Omar Omar, who was displaced from Beit Lahia, said the warehouses are so packed that “you feel that there is no oxygen in any of them.” Hygiene, he said, is “difficult to control.” Ahmed Ismail, 38, said that under the pressures of overuse, sewage from the bathrooms flows into the tent he shares with his wife, two daughters and two sons. Rather than waiting hours for the toilet, they relieve themselves in buckets and plastic bags. They shower every week or so. The Ismail family walked to Rafah from Jabalya — a 23-mile journey — after their neighborhood was bombed.

A displaced population

Severe overcrowding is leading to outbreaks of disease and infection — hepatitis, skin and respiratory illnesses — as people share tight spaces and resources. It’s made all the worse by the collapsed medical system incapable of treating them.

Saif al-Din Muhammad Qadouha, 45, is living in a tent with 11 family members in Rafah. Their home north of Gaza City was destroyed. His son and others in the family now have hepatitis C. Qadouha is worried that his family will pass on the infection to others crammed in their shelter.

“I didn’t lose my children to missiles, but now I’m watching them die of disease,” he said.

Then there is the psychological effect and the stress of displacement. “The story of becoming a refugee and the trauma that comes with leaving one’s home and not being allowed to return is something that haunts the Palestinian communities.” said UNRWA’s Touma.

Ramez Muhammad, 46, and 14 family members have heeded Israel’s evacuation orders three times, until they reached an area near the southern Rafah crossing.

“Our dignity has been lost in this displacement,” Muhammad said. “I want to return to my home, even if we have to live on top of the rubble.”"

Dear Amy: A while ago my wife got a cellphone call from “Martine,” a very high-strung woman whom she regarded as a friend. The reception was so poor that she asked Martine whether they could talk when she got home. Instead of agreeing, Martine exploded in hysterical anger, screaming that the 40-year friendship was over.

This extreme and illogical overreaction left my wife so depressed that I finally wrote to Martine on my own initiative, asking what kind of person she was who would treat a friend in such a shabby and insulting manner. I added that I was writing without my wife’s knowledge or permission (which she wouldn’t have given), but seeing the effect of her rage on my wife, I regarded it as my business, as well as hers.

Martine flew into another tantrum, but instead of directing it at me she attacked my wife, who had nothing whatsoever to do with my writing the letter. Martine seemed to be determined to hurt her for no reason, or maybe she was deflecting. I say good riddance and my wife seems philosophical about the matter, but the “friendship” — is clearly over.

Initially my wife was not happy with my choice to contact Martine but now she seems more or less behind it. We agreed to ask for your views on my choice. Your thoughts?

— Protective Husband

Protective: Your wife seems to have accepted your choice, as well as the consequences that have flowed from it, so asking for my opinion after the fact really puts me in the position of being an armchair referee.

Your wife’s relationships are her own to manage. Her feelings and actions are her responsibility. She reacted to “Martine’s” behavior by becoming sad and depressed. After some time had passed, she might have chosen to reach out to her in her own way and using her own words. She might have expressed some worry about Martine’s health or mental health. Or she might have expressed some anger and ended the friendship — on her own terms.

You’ve denied your wife these choices. At the very least, you could have told her how you were feeling and let her know that you intended to react. You didn’t do that because you knew she would disagree with you, and so you went behind her back. Your wife might feel that she is standing between two angry people who don’t hear her or respect her autonomy.

I assume that she is now threading the needle; appreciating your loyalty to her, understanding your protective behavior regarding Martine, and accepting the fact that — at this point — she can’t do anything about either one of you.

Dear Amy: A few weeks ago, I returned from an enjoyable touring vacation. The scenery and the attractions were wonderful. There was only one problem — one of my fellow travelers.

This person spent the entire vacation stating her obnoxious political views. Since I was sitting near her on the bus, I asked to be rotated, so I could escape her constant airing of her political opinions. That helped some, but every time I sat down to a meal, she seemed to be at the same table.

I go on these trips to have a good time and enjoy new experiences. I don’t go on them to discuss politics. Everyone has a right to their opinion, but I don’t believe it was her right to impose her opinions on other people who can’t escape. I’m wondering whether I should have done more to protect my serenity. Your thoughts?

Discouraged: You don’t report having asked this person not to discuss politics with you. You might have said, “I happen to disagree with your views, so let’s agree to leave our political views at home. I want to enjoy a peaceful holiday, and I want the same for you.”

Your tour operator might have helped by conveying a similar suggestion.

Anonymous: Is it striking to you that the person who sexually molested a 10-year-old girl now has a lovely wife and implicit family support, and the victim of that sexual molestation has uneven results in therapy, a trauma response to family gatherings, and explicit criticism for being “extreme” and ruining parties?

It’s striking to me.

Real lives over three decades obviously can’t fit into a 100-word question to an advice columnist. Maybe your son has had extensive therapeutic intervention of his own; I certainly hope so. Maybe you’ve backed your daughter consistently with everything you’ve got.

But your version here, as presented to me, is that the victim is the problem.

And that’s a hard no.

I don’t have a harder “no” in me than the one I have for that.

Here’s my suggestion: Accept, as a result of your son’s actions, that yours is a family that no longer gathers in full. That’s it.

No family ever “has to,” by the way.

As heartbreaking as that is for you, what your daughter carries is unfathomably more so. Accept that, too.

If your family’s gathering situation changes for the better someday for some reason, then great. But if it doesn’t, then that will not be your daughter’s fault — just as it isn’t now and absolutely never was.

Dear Carolyn: I started seeing a therapist this year. I was going through a lot at work, some minor health issues, and feeling generally stuck and depressed. I’ve started to feel as if I don’t have much to talk about in sessions. I feel as if I’ve gotten to a better place, but mostly I want to spend the time — driving, appointment, driving home — on other things. A friend cautioned me that if I end my therapy now, I might be stuck if I suddenly need help again. So I’m weighing that fear against wanting the time back and not wanting to make up things to talk about. How do I know when I’m done with my therapist?

— Done?

Done?: The short answer, always, is to bring this up with your therapist.

The long answer is still short, but includes: I’m glad your friend is looking out for you. That’s nice to have. It’s also good to look out for people we don’t know — in this case, someone who could get needed therapy when you free up the spot. Running out of things to talk about can be a legitimate sign of progress, as can feeling the pull of your attention back to other things. Your therapist may be able to offer you less frequent sessions as you figure out whether you’re ready to wrap things up completely. All of which lead back to speaking up in your next session."

Dear Miss Manners: I moved 10 years ago to a beautiful part of the country. When driving or riding with others, I am frequently startled by incredible scenes: a massive volcanic mountain that suddenly appears around a corner, lake views where none were expected, bald eagles flying in front of the car.

These sights are so startling and beautiful, and I interrupt whatever conversation is taking place with exclamations. I don’t think I can help myself! “Look! An otter!” “Look at the massive antlers on that buck!” “Ooh, newborn deer twins!” “That eagle is enormous!”

I constantly interrupt conversations, but seriously, how can I not? That glacier wasn’t there a minute ago! Am I rude?

After the wedding, I didn’t hear from the couple, but my DIL said several guests complimented the cake. At a later social event, I saw the couple for the first time since their wedding. In front of several people, he said: “That wedding cake you made was no good. I would have thought the guy who attended a fancy cooking school could have done better than that.”

130,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Alex Ovechkin’s goal drought ends with an OT winner in Columbus,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/21/alex-ovechkin-ot-winner-blue-jackets/,"Listen 5 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

COLUMBUS, Ohio — In the long arc of Alex Ovechkin’s career, goal No. 828 easily could have been a simple footnote on his chase of history. If it had been any other goal — an empty-netter, perhaps, or a goal late in a blowout win — maybe it would have been.

But No. 828 turned out to be an overtime winner that busted Ovechkin’s 14-game streak without a goal, the longest of his career, and lifted Ovechkin’s Washington Capitals to a 3-2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena. Ovechkin’s emphatic celebration, with a fist pump toward the ice before jumping into the embrace of defenseman John Carlson, made clear exactly how meaningful the goal was for the Capitals’ captain — and for his team.

Ovechkin scored 4:07 into overtime and 1:25 into a four-on-three power play drawn by winger Tom Wilson after a dramatic encounter with Columbus goalie Elvis Merzlikins (29 saves).

When the power play began, Ovechkin already had 13 shot attempts in the game and looked intent on breaking the drought. Merzlikins previously stopped several of Ovechkin’s trademark one-timers from the left faceoff circle, so for the game-winner, Ovechkin held on to the puck for an extra second before firing a wrist shot that, after he had gone more than a month without a goal, finally hit the back of the net.

“I thought he was one of our best players tonight by far,” Washington Coach Spencer Carbery said. “Shot attempts, was shooting it, was moving well on the ice. Puck recoveries, it looked like he was handling the puck better. He had a ton of great looks where you think they’re going to go in, and this one, he stops and rips it low blocker. We had a great view from the bench. Huge goal for us.”

“It’s been a while,” Ovechkin said with a smile. “I’ll take it.”

For the second night in a row, the Capitals had leads of 1-0 and 2-1 before getting pushed to overtime. After a lukewarm start from both teams — they combined to produce one shot on goal through the first seven minutes — winger Anthony Mantha scored a power-play goal at 18:24 of the first period to put Washington into the lead, redirecting a shot from Ovechkin past Merzlikins.

The Capitals’ power play has been flawed and ineffective throughout this season, but after Mantha’s and Ovechkin’s tallies Thursday, they have scored on the power play in four of their past five games — raising their conversion rate to 12.5 percent, no longer last in the NHL.

“It feels great, honestly, inside the locker room,” Mantha said. “We kind of knew that it was going to eventually click. It couldn’t go the way it did early on. The guys made the adjustments and they’re still doing the adjustments to make it work.”

Share this article Share

It was clear, from the way the Blue Jackets began to pressure Washington goalie Charlie Lindgren (34 saves) in the second period, that Mantha’s first goal wouldn’t be enough to eke out a win. After spending much of the frame in Washington’s defensive zone, Columbus finally beat Lindgren at 15:18 as Cole Sillinger deflected a shot from Emil Bemstrom over Lindgren’s pad.

Advertisement

But the Capitals came back to life after Sillinger scored. Washington hasn’t completed many tic-tac-toe passing plays this season, but the Capitals put one together for Mantha’s second, just over two minutes after Sillinger’s goal. Carlson passed the puck down to winger Aliaksei Protas at the bottom of the right circle, and he one-touched a pass to Mantha at the edge of the slot.

The Capitals then found themselves in an uncomfortably familiar position, giving up a game-tying goal late in the third period. Their fatigue, on the second night of a back-to-back, was evident in the second half of the game, and Yegor Chinakhov scored with 7:11 remaining to force overtime.

“This one was right up there with the most challenging that we’ve had this year,” Carbery said. “You could just tell in that third period, and we talked about it. We knew what was coming. We had just been in this situation last night, and we had nothing in the tank, physically and mentally.”

Advertisement

In overtime, the two teams traded opportunities, with the Blue Jackets having a slight edge in dangerous chances. Then Columbus forward Kent Johnson tumbled into the net alongside Wilson, and Merzlikins’s fuse was lit. As he reached in to collect his stick from under Wilson, the two began to scrap, and Merzlikins threw several punches before the two were separated.

Merzlikins received a penalty for roughing, which gave the Capitals the power play that produced the game-winner.

“Power play steps up once again,” Carbery said. “O with a huge goal. And Tom Wilson, too, I think deserves a lot of credit for holding his composure there. You knew what was going on there. Merzlikins was sort of trying to create an odd-man rush and get in his way subtly, but obviously, Willy, to hold his composure and draw the power play there, arguably you could say is the difference in the game.”

With the win, Washington improved to 6-0-0 in the second game of back-to-backs — a mark the Capitals feel says it all about their mentality as a group."
131,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Young Americans are more pro-Palestinian than their elders. Why?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/21/us-support-israel-palestine-poll/,"Listen 8 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Across more than two months of war between Israel and Hamas, public opinion on the conflict has continuously shifted. But there has been a constant: a divide between the views of older and younger Americans that has shown up both during the war and in the years leading up to it.

A late October YouGov poll is illustrative. It found that more people ages 18-29 sympathized with Palestinians than with Israelis in the current conflict — the only age bracket with that view (28 percent expressed more sympathy with Palestinians vs. 20 percent for Israelis — though even more sympathized with both peoples equally, 31 percent). Older groups were more likely to sympathize with Israelis than Palestinians or both groups equally, particularly those 65 and older. Fourteen percent of 18- to 29-year-olds thought it was “very important” for the United States to protect Israel compared with two-thirds of those 65 or older.

Experts say there are multiple explanations behind why age could be a factor in Americans’ opinions on Israel and its relationship with Palestinians.

Two generations, two narratives

Each age group has a different “generational memory” of Israel, Dov Waxman, director of the UCLA Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for Israel Studies, said. Beliefs about the world tend to form in our late teens and early 20s and often don’t change, he said.

Advertisement

Older generations, with a more visceral sense of the Holocaust, tend to see Israel as a vital refuge for the Jews, he said, and see its story as one of a people returning to safety in their homeland after living for 2,000 years as a scattered diaspora facing persistent persecution.

In the decades after its founding, Israel was a relatively lower-income and vulnerable country. Its military victories against its neighbors, in 1948, 1967 and 1973, were generally admired in the West. (An estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes during the months before and after the 1948 war that created Israel.)

But by the time millennials began forming their understanding of global events, the violence of the second Intifada had concluded in the mid-2000s with enhanced walls and barriers constructed between Israel and the West Bank, and then Gaza. This generation formed its idea of Israel from reports of Palestinians denied access to water, freedom of movement and fair trials, under the military control of what was by then a relatively rich, nuclear-armed power.

“When I was in college it was the Oslo peace process, and I still remember that Israel — pursuing peace with the Palestinians and the hopes that came along with that,” Waxman said, of the ’90s. “Younger Americans have no memory of that.”

A racial justice lens

Joey Ayoub, a Palestinian-Lebanese writer, podcaster and academic, says young Americans are more likely to conceptualize the Palestinian cause as a sister issue to U.S. efforts for racial justice. There is a “visual parallel,” he said: of an armed soldier or police officer dominating a space inhabited by a populace with limited power, whether in a town in the occupied West Bank or a majority-Black neighborhood in the United States.

“It’s a natural ally to the Palestinian struggle, because it’s very similar if you think of it in terms of the bullet points being demanded — the right to dignity, the right to life and so on,” he said.

Advertisement

He sees 2014 as a pivotal year in a new generation’s understanding of the conflict. A war in Gaza killed about 2,250 Palestinians and 73 Israelis at roughly the same time as protests erupted in Ferguson, Mo., over the police shooting of an unarmed Black man.

“Palestinian Americans were tweeting advice towards African Americans about how to deal with tear gas, for example,” he said. “That was something very symbolically powerful.”

Eitan Hersh, a political science professor at Tufts University, said conflict between Israel and Palestinians seems to be seen by the young left, especially on college campuses, as “a people of color — that is, the Palestinians — rising up against a white oppressor,” though a significant portion of Israel’s Jewish population is of a non-European background. (Some are the descendants of about 850,000 Jews who were expelled from Arab countries and Iran after Israel was founded.)

Advertisement

“It’s a bit of a curiosity,” he said. “One could tell an oppressor-oppressed story where the Jews, and Israel, is a story of the oppressed: kicked out of all these countries, going back to their homeland, surrounded by a broad set of dominant countries in the region that wants to destroy it.”

Shifting demographics

One explanation for the generational divide, experts said, was that fewer Gen Zers and millennials identify as conservative or Christian — demographics more likely to sympathize with Israel — than older groups.

Share this article Share

“Young adults in America on the left think of Israel in the same way that they might think about Iran, or China or Russia,” said Hersh, referring to a 2021 study of young Americans’ views on Israel compared with other nations. It found more than half of moderate and conservative Americans ages 18-30 held a positive view of Israel.

Thirty years ago, support for Israel was associated more with Democrats than Republicans, Waxman said. This began to change during the George W. Bush presidency, after 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, when a perception on the American right developed “that Israel is the front line in this clash of civilizations — between a Judeo-Christian civilization and militant Islam,” Waxman said.

Donald Trump’s support of Israel, including moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to the more contested city of Jerusalem, furthered the trend, said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland.

“The fascinating thing there is that attitudes toward Islam and Muslims actually improved in America with the rise of Trump,” Telhami said. “People said, ‘We hate Trump, Trump hates Muslims, therefore, we like Muslims,” he said of progressives.

Advertisement

Another “major factor” in older generations’ feelings toward Israel is their greater religiosity, according to Waxman. More than three-quarters of Americans 60-64 are Christian — with increasingly higher numbers for older brackets — compared with about half of adults under 30.

“It’s, I think, for many religious Christians, somehow a kind of atonement in supporting Israel and Zionism,” Waxman added. “Genuinely, a feeling of Israel as a consequence of this long history of Jewish persecution” by Christians.

Some Christians, particularly among evangelicals who are especially likely to sympathize with Israel, believe that Israel was promised to the Jews by God, and that the return of the Jews to Israel fulfills a biblical prophecy of the events that will precede the second coming of Jesus Christ.

But even outside of this belief, the idea of Israel as a sacred land for Judeo-Christians has an emotional resonance that is simply not present for the increasing number of secular young Americans.

Advertisement

“There’s a connection between Israel as they see it in the Bible and Israel that exists politically today,” Telhami said of some Christians. There is an association between place names like “Hebron,” “Jerusalem” and “the Galilee” with Bible stories as much as with 21st-century geopolitics, and a long history of hearing this geography referred to as the home of the Israelites, particularly through the Old Testament.

Social vs traditional media

Dana El Kurd, a nonresident fellow at the Middle East Institute, said different types of media consumption have probably played a role in how people have formed their views on the Middle East.

Americans 45 and older are most likely to get their news from TV networks and their websites, and Americans younger than 45 are most likely to get their news through social media, according to 2022 YouGov polling.

The regular use of TikTok in particular is correlated with criticism of Israel, a New York Times/Siena poll found this week.

Ayoub, whose interview podcast “The Fire These Times” with Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, Jewish, and Armenian perspectives has mostly Gen Z and millennial listeners, said that new forms of media facilitated access between content creators and consumers without “having a gatekeeper.” This has downsides, including “a huge uptick in misinformation” online, he said, but also positives, including allowing traditionally underrepresented groups to reach an audience.

On social media, Palestinians in Gaza such as filmmaker Bisan Owda and photographer Motaz Azaiza have accrued millions of followers sharing content directly from the war zone.

TikTok has been criticized, especially by Republicans, because pro-Palestinian hashtags appear to be more popular than pro-Israel hashtags on the app. But the company says that phenomenon occurred organically, not because the company was intentionally manipulating its algorithm.

“I’ll give an anecdote,” El Kurd said. “My students, when the war broke out, said that they had gone onto TikTok and toggled between the different locations,” to see what kind of videos were popular in Israel compared with Gaza, the West Bank and other places. “It had never occurred to me before to do that.”"

President Biden said he will send top U.S. officials to Mexico in the coming days to seek help with the record migration surge that has pushed the number of illegal border crossings to more than 10,000 per day, prompting U.S. authorities to shut down two major railway crossings and other ports of entry.

“More enforcement actions are urgently needed to reopen key ports of entry across our shared border,” Biden wrote Thursday evening on X (formerly Twitter), after speaking by phone earlier in the day with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall will travel to Mexico “in the coming days” to meet with the Mexican leader and urge a firmer response, the White House said.

Mexico’s immigration enforcement agency, the Instituto Nacional de Migración, has slackened its operations in recent weeks as its annual funding runs low, according to U.S. and Mexican officials.

In Lukeville, Ariz., families with children and groups from Africa, Asia and South America have been entering through breaches in the U.S. border wall where smugglers have sawed through.

In Eagle Pass, Tex., Border Patrol agents have had to set up a sprawling outdoor reception area to manage the thousands of migrants arriving daily by wading across the Rio Grande. Agents are facing spikes in Jacumba Hot Springs, Calif., as well as El Paso and other remote sections of southern Arizona.

Mexican forces are rarely visible on the south side of the border. The country’s National Guard has played a key role during previous migration crackdowns, but there has been scant presence of troops in recent weeks at the busiest crossing points.

Many migrants have arrived to the United States by riding freight trains through Mexico. The Biden administration’s decision to close the rail crossings at El Paso and Eagle Pass, Tex. — an attempt to stem the tide of migrants — is a significant disruption of commerce between the United States and its top trading partner.

U.S. farm groups, the rail companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are urging the Biden administration to reopen the crossings as soon as possible. Train operator Union Pacific said that the two crossings account for 45 percent of all cross-border rail commerce and that the shutdowns are inflicting losses of $200 million per day in wages, goods and transportation costs.

The Biden administration has not said publicly what specific actions it wants Mexico to take. Mexican authorities have long been wary of offers by the United States to help pay for immigration enforcement actions on Mexican soil.

“Everything revolves around getting the Mexican government to do targeted operations,” said one U.S. official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.

The United States would like to expand deportation flights to southern Mexico that would carry migrants from that region as well as Central Americans, two officials said.

Mexico’s cooperation with U.S. immigration enforcement has fluctuated in recent years, and both the Biden and Trump administrations have turned to Mexico for help when illegal crossings soar. Mexican law offers broad protections to migrants transiting the country, which makes crackdowns more difficult. The country’s enforcement efforts are weakened further by corruption and bribe-taking.

Mexican authorities say they remain committed to working with the United States to manage migration, while urging the U.S. government to expand work visas and alleviate the conditions driving people to leave their home countries.

Biden officials are urging Congress to approve a $106 billion White House supplemental funding request that would send aid to Ukraine and Israel while providing nearly $14 billion for border operations and immigration measures. Republicans are demanding new restrictions to asylum access, expanded deportation powers and other enforcement tools, some of which face stiff opposition from Democrats and the president.

Negotiators in the Senate said they have made progress toward a deal. But most lawmakers have left Washington for the holiday break, leaving any deal unlikely to be reached before the end of the year."

Robert M. Solow, who won the 1987 Nobel Prize in economics for exploring the impact of technology on economic growth, work that spawned a wider understanding of what drives the expansion of industrial economics, died Dec. 21 at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 99. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The death was confirmed by his son John. No cause was given.

The son of a fur buyer, Dr. Solow was a Brooklyn-born Harvard graduate with a quicksilver wit and liberal political leanings. His research made him a respected voice on public policy, particularly on matters of employment.

Dr. Solow, who spent most of his career teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, served on government panels and was a senior staff economist on President John F. Kennedy’s Council of Economic Advisers in the early 1960s. He was a believer in the Keynesian theory of government intervention in the economy, which put him at odds with conservative economists such as Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate who espoused free markets.

“Everything reminds Milton Friedman of the money supply,” Dr. Solow quipped while on a panel with Friedman. “Everything reminds me of sex, but I try to keep it out of my papers.”

In a special 2007 issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy devoted to the impact of Dr. Solow’s work, the editors wrote that his seminal 1956 paper, “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth,” and a follow-up paper in 1957, “Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function,” were “among the most influential and revered articles in economic theory.”

Those papers, the editors wrote, had “transformed growth theory from arguably obscure debates about stability and gloomy knife-edge properties into a fully fledged, flexible framework for analyzing key growth questions [such as] the impact of changes in savings, population, depreciation, and technical progress on the level and growth of output.”

Dr. Solow was essentially a theorist who devised statistical or mathematical models to describe the interplay of economic forces and was a pioneer in what came to be known as “total factor productivity,” the respective contributions of labor, natural resources and capital goods to increases in national income.

He was in his 30s when he laid the groundwork for his Nobel-winning theories, devising mathematical analyses that showed how technological progress accounted for much of U.S. economic growth in the first half of the 20th century. Previously, increases in capital and labor alone were widely believed to have played dominant roles in the growth rate.

“Solow’s theoretical model had an enormous impact on economic analysis,” the citation from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences read. “… Above all, Solow’s growth model constitutes a framework within which modern macroeconomic theory can be structured.”

The strong role of technological progress identified by Dr. Solow contributed to a greater emphasis by governments on higher education and technological research.

His liberal politics found expression in a collection of papers appraising the Kennedy-Johnson years that he and economist Eli Ginzberg of Columbia University compiled and edited. It was published in 1974 as “The Great Society: Lessons for the Future.”

In a final chapter, Dr. Solow and Ginzberg wrote that “there is nothing in the history of the 1960s to suggest that it is a law of nature that social legislation cannot deal effectively with social problems, or that state and local governments or private enterprise will always do better than the ‘Feds.’”

It was as if they were disputing the conservative doctrine of the Reagan administration, to come less than a decade later.

Implying support for a government safety net to help those with the lowest incomes, the editors also said: “The prolonged economic prosperity of the 1960s helped to lift many families out of poverty but this longest boom in the nation’s history also proved that economic growth is not the answer for all who lack an adequate income.”

The oldest of three children, Robert Merton Solow was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 23, 1924.

“I was good at school from the very beginning, but not very intellectual until my last year in high school,” he wrote in a Nobel biographical statement. “Then one of those teachers who make a difference taught me to read the great 19th century French and Russian novelists, and to take ideas seriously.”

He graduated from high school two months before he turned 16. He initially planned to enter Brooklyn College, whose tuition was free to New York City residents, but enrolled at Harvard University in 1940 on a full scholarship after an English teacher convinced him he probably could get into the elite college.

Months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Harvard sophomore enlisted in the Army because “it seemed that there were more urgent and exciting matters than what I was doing,” he wrote in his Nobel statement.

He spoke German and knew Morse code, and so the Army assigned him to a signals intelligence unit that fought its way up the Italian peninsula in 1943-1945. The unit’s mission was to intercept, decode and translate communications between German tactical units.

For his leadership of that unit, then-Tech Sgt. Solow was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, but he turned down a battlefield commission as a second lieutenant. He explained in a 2014 interview for this obituary that taking the commission would have altered his relationship with the other enlisted men in his unit or would have led to his transfer to another unit.

In August 1945, he was on home leave pending possible reassignment to the Pacific for the invasion of Japan when word came of the Japanese surrender after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Looking back, he recalled in the MIT interview, “I have never held it against Harry Truman that he dropped that bomb.”

That same year, he married Barbara Lewis, a Radcliffe student who became an economic historian. She died in 2014. Survivors include sons John Solow and Andrew Solow; a daughter, Katherine Solow; eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

After his military discharge, Robert Solow completed his undergraduate studies at Harvard in 1947. He also became research assistant to future Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief, a pioneer of the economic input-output analysis. Leontief “taught me economic theory and use of mathematics in economics,” he said.

He joined the MIT faculty in 1949, while still working on his doctoral dissertation for Harvard (a degree he received in 1951). In 1961, he won the John Bates Clark Medal, given by the American Economic Association to an American economist under age 40 who has made the most significant contributions to the field. In 1979, he served as the association’s president.

At MIT, Dr. Solow formed a close relationship with the economic theorist and textbook author Paul A. Samuelson, whose office was next door. Samuelson, who died in 2009, was the first American economist to win a Nobel. Their proximity at MIT, Dr. Solow later wrote in his Nobel biography, “began what is now almost 40 years of almost daily conversations about economics, politics, our children, cabbages and kings.”

Advertisement

Dr. Solow also became known for his mentorship of future Nobel laureates such as George A. Akerlof and Joseph E. Stiglitz (who shared the prize in 2001) and Peter A. Diamond (2010). They were among many high-powered graduate students who enrolled at MIT as Dr. Solow and others emphasized that the department put the education of students ahead of faculty research.

After retiring from teaching in 1995, Dr. Solow pursued several intellectual interests. He and Alan Krueger, a Princeton-based scholar and future chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, compiled and edited essays about the U.S. economic boom of 1995-2000 in their book “The Roaring Nineties: Can Full Employment be Sustained?” (2001).

Dr. Solow also devoted himself to examining, with others, the nature and institutional background of low-wage work in the United States and a few European countries.

Dr. Solow was not hostile to technology (it was central to his theory of economic growth), but he disliked and rarely used email. He offered this “economist’s explanation” of his distaste for electronic correspondence in the 2014 interview for this obituary: “If you make communications costless, you will get messages of zero value.”"
134,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,Three Wash. police officers found not guilty in death of Manuel Ellis,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/12/21/manny-ellis-verdict-tacoma-not-guilty/,"Listen 4 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Jurors in Tacoma, Wash., on Thursday found three officers not guilty in the March 2020 death of Manuel “Manny” Ellis, a Black man who was restrained, handcuffed and Tasered by police. Officers Christopher Burbank, 38, and Matthew Collins, 40, were found not guilty of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. The third officer, Timothy Rankine, 34, was found not guilty of first-degree manslaughter.

Ellis, 33, had been out walking on the night of March 3, 2020, when he stopped beside a police car and “briefly” interacted with the officers inside before continuing on his way, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson’s office said when it announced the charges in May 2021. Witnesses said the exchange was respectful, with no signs of aggression. But just after Ellis began to walk away, Burbank and Collins got out of the vehicle and wrestled him to the ground, the report said. Rankine was the first officer who responded to the scene, and he helped Burbank and Collins restrain Ellis, according to the attorney general’s office.

During the struggle with the officers, Ellis could be heard saying, “Can’t breathe, sir,” according to security camera footage. His death led to protests in Tacoma, with community members joining Ellis’s family in calling for accountability for the police department.

“I know the Ellis family is hurting, and my heart goes out to them,” Ferguson said in a statement after the verdicts were delivered. The case marked the first time the attorney general’s office had brought criminal charges against police officers for unlawful use of deadly force.

The Tacoma Police Department’s internal investigation, which is independent of the criminal trial, is ongoing, according to a statement from the city, which added that the years since Ellis’s death “have been filled with wide-spread anger, mistrust, and apprehension.” The department’s investigation will probably be finished Friday, the statement said, and its police chief will decide within the next two weeks whether the officers involved will face disciplinary action.

Around 11 p.m. on March 3, 2020, Ellis had walked to 7-Eleven for a snack, the attorney general’s office report said.

On the walk back, he passed a police car stopped at a red light and talked to the officers, which witnesses said seemed to be a casual conversation, according to the report. After Ellis turned away, Burbank swung open the passenger door, striking him and “knocking him to his knees,” the report states.

According to video cited within it, Burbank wrapped his arms around Ellis, lifted him up and then drove his body into the ground. Collins also got out of the police car and struck Ellis in the head at least four times, the report states. While Collins held Ellis in a restraint, Burbank used a Taser on him, according to the report. Ellis told the officers he could not breathe multiple times throughout the struggle, the report adds.

After Rankine came to the scene, he “started applying pressure to Ellis’s back,” the report states, adding that he “continued to pin Ellis to the ground with his body weight” until the fire department arrived.

Ellis was declared dead at the scene. The Pierce County medical examiner ruled his cause of death was hypoxia, or a lack of oxygen, “due to physical restraint.”

While witnesses told prosecutors it did not appear that Ellis ever struck the officers, according to the report, Burbank and Collins told other officers that Ellis had tried to get into another car near where they were stopped and that he had attacked them.

During the officers’ trial, their attorneys argued that Ellis “created his own death” and that he “forced the officers to use force against him.”

Wayne Fricke, an attorney representing Burbank, also told The Washington Post that the incident was “not a George Floyd case.” The charges against the three Tacoma officers were brought more than a month after Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted in Floyd’s murder.

Fricke told The Post earlier this month that he and the officers’ attorneys believe Ellis died because of drug use, not the officers’ use of force. While Ellis’s autopsy showed the presence of methamphetamine, Pierce County Medical Examiner Thomas Clark said that Ellis’s death was likely not caused by the drug, according to the attorney general’s report.

Jury deliberations began last week after about two months of trial. After the not guilty verdicts were delivered, Ellis’s family members gathered for a rally in Tacoma near a mural dedicated to him, KOMO reported. During the rally, James Bible, an attorney representing the Ellis family, said they would be asking for a federal probe of the case.

“You will do something about this, or we will do something about this,” Bible said. “That is the reality.”

Old Dominion men’s basketball coach Jeff Jones was hospitalized Wednesday evening in Honolulu after suffering a heart attack, the university announced Thursday. Jones, 63, is “resting comfortably and expecting a full recovery” and will be held for observation for the next two to three days, ODU said in a statement. Uncover your Newsprint: Find out what your 2023 reading says about you. ArrowRight “Coach Jones and his family would like to thank Dr. Brandon Itagaki and the team at the Honolulu Straub Medical Center, along with ODU Associate Head Athletic Trainer Jason Mitchell for their prompt care and medical expertise,” the statement said.

Old Dominion (3-7) is in Hawaii for the Diamond Head Classic, which the Monarchs opened Thursday with a 111-87 loss to TCU (9-1). Assistant Kieran Donohue will act as interim coach for the rest of the tournament.

“We as a coaching staff couldn’t be more proud of the way our guys entered this basketball game,” Donohue said after the game, per the Virginian-Pilot. “They fought, competed and battled, and that’s all we can ask. Ultimately, it wasn’t enough to come out of here with a result, but the way we entered the game and the way we played, myself and our coaches couldn’t be any more proud of our guys.”

The United States is prepared to support a new draft resolution in the U.N. Security Council that calls for an indefinite pause in the fighting to permit more humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said late Thursday. A vote on the measure is scheduled for Friday. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight “We’re ready to move forward,” Thomas-Greenfield told reporters outside the council chamber after a fourth straight day of closed-door negotiations. “It will be a resolution — if the resolution is put forward as is — that we can support.”

The new draft replaces a resolution offered Monday by Arab countries that avoided calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the war, in hopes of avoiding language that had brought U.S. vetoes of several previous U.N. votes since Israel began military operations in Gaza immediately following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.

Advertisement

The new draft retains much of the Monday language, calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” in the fighting throughout Gaza and the opening of corridors inside the enclave “for a sufficient number of days to enable full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access.”

But it alters another passage involving the pre-screening of all goods going into Gaza, calling for U.N. Secretary General António Guterres to appoint a senior coordinator “with responsibility for facilitating, coordinating, monitoring, and verifying in Gaza, as appropriate, the humanitarian nature” of all assistance, and demands that “the parties to the conflict cooperate with the coordinator to fulfill their mandate without delay or obstruction.”

That vague phrasing replaces initial wording that gave Guterres “exclusive” control over all truck inspections, a formulation that was rejected by both the United States and Israel. Until now, screening has been performed by Israel alone, seeking to prevent any military or other assistance going to Hamas. U.N. officials had also asked for more “flexibility” in the language, according to people familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive negotiations.

U.S. support for the resolution comes as the Biden administration has become increasingly isolated in its support for Israel and refusal to support widespread calls for a cease-fire, even as it has pressed for a change in Israeli military tactics amid nearly 20,000 civilian deaths from its airstrikes and ground operations, according to Gazan health authorities, and international warnings of widespread famine and disease in Gaza.

Over a quarter of the population of Gaza faces “catastrophic hunger and starvation,” according to a study published Thursday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), part of an international early warning system first established in the 1980s by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Drawing on data from the United Nations and other sources, the report says approximately 576,600 people have run out of food completely, with the broader population facing acute food insecurity.

The staggering figures stand out even against more encompassing global hunger statistics.

“The number of people facing ‘catastrophic’ levels of hunger in Gaza is four times greater than the total number of people facing ‘catastrophic’ levels of hunger worldwide,” said World Food Program (WFP) spokesperson Steve Taravella. “The scale and swiftness of this crisis is unprecedented in modern times,” Taravella said. “If current predictions continue, we will reach famine by February.”

“We have worked hard and diligently over the course of the past week with the Emiratis, with others, with Egypt, to come up with a resolution that we can support,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “And we do have that resolution now. We’re ready to vote on it. And it’s a resolution that will bring humanitarian assistance to those in need.”

Share this article Share

In addition to questions about the inspections, U.N. officials have said the distribution of aid flowing into Gaza — only a fraction of what is needed, according to humanitarian organizations — has been prevented by ongoing Israeli attacks.

Advertisement

“Currently, intense fighting, lack of electricity, limited fuel and disrupted telecommunications severely restrict access to loading points and to trucks” inside Gaza for distribution, Guterres spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Thursday.

Even before wide-scale Israeli attacks moved to southern Gaza, officials from the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have assessed Israel’s lengthy inspection regime as contributing to delays in assistance. While the United States was “actively working with our partners” on language in the U.N. resolution about the issue, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, “Israel has had, and understandably so, … a role in the inspection regime — a key role, a pivotal role. And we understand and respect that.”

In an angry response to charges that Israel is hindering the flow of aid, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said it was the United Nations’ “utter failure” to provide for the people of Gaza.

“Today it is possible to provide three times the amount of humanitarian aid to Gaza if the U.N. — instead of complaining all day — would do its job,” Herzog said, according to a Times of Israel report on Herzog’s meeting with a visiting French lawmaker. He repeated that Israel is ready to pause the fighting and facilitate far more aid into Gaza if Hamas will release about 130 Israeli and foreign hostages it still holds.

The draft resolution calls for the “immediate and unconditional” release of the hostages. It also demands that “all parties to the conflict comply with their obligations under international law ... including with regard to the conduct of hostilities and the protection of civilians and civilian objects.”"

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) tried to compel a Seattle hospital to hand over information about gender-affirming treatment Texas youths may have received across state lines, according to court filings, signaling an escalation of his office’s attempts to crack down on Texans’ ability to access such health care. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Seattle Children’s Hospital requested a Texas judge nullify, or at least rein in, Paxton’s demands, arguing that his office lacks the jurisdiction over the Washington state hospital. In filings this month, the hospital said Paxton’s queries — made under the guise of an investigation by the AG’s consumer protection division — were “sham requests.”

Paxton’s office did not respond to request for comment about the hospital’s filing Thursday.

A spokesperson for Seattle Children’s Hospital declined to comment on the specifics of its legal action. In a statement, the spokesperson said the hospital complies with the law for all heath-care services and “took legal action to protect private patient information related to gender-affirming care services at our organization sought by the Texas Attorney General.”

Conservative lawmakers have driven efforts in recent years to criminalize gender-affirming care with laws similar to ones that restrict abortion access by creating legal liability for health-care providers and the in-state portion of people’s travel for out-of-state care.

Paxton has been at the vanguard of such efforts. Last year, his office investigated clinics in Austin, Dallas and Houston for providing gender-affirming care, leading them to close or stop offering the services. Paxton’s office also requested records from the Texas Department of Public Safety for those who had changed their sex on their driver’s licenses.

Paxton’s legal battle with Seattle Children’s Hospital marks a rare instance of conservative officials reaching the state’s long arm beyond their own borders.

Officials and doctors with Seattle Children’s Hospital signed affidavits saying the hospital has virtually no ties to the state of Texas: The hospital is not incorporated in Texas, does not have bank accounts or property in the state, does not advertise youth gender-affirming care in Texas and does not have physicians or health staffers who provide care in Texas.

Advertisement

The hospital’s legal filing further argues the information the Texas attorney general requested was for private medical records and health information covered under HIPAA and Washington state privacy laws.

Among the requests by Paxton’s office were documents for how many Texas children the hospital treated for gender dysphoria, the number of “gender reassignment” surgeries performed and specific medications hospital employees had prescribed to children from Texas.

“The demands are an unconstitutional attempt to investigate and chill potential travel by Texas residents to obtain healthcare in another state,” attorneys for the hospital wrote.

For families like Lisa Stanton’s, the hostile climate fostered by Texas’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies became overwhelming. Last summer, Stanton and her family moved to Colorado from Texas because of the state’s treatment of transgender children. On Thursday, her phone was “blowing up” with messages about the Seattle lawsuit.

“My moms group, we were all discussing it,” said Stanton, who has a 12-year-old transgender daughter.

Share this article Share

Other state attorneys general have requested similar records, but they have focused their requests on hospitals within their own states. Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville confirmed in June that it had turned over the medical records of transgender patients as part of a probe by the Tennessee attorney general’s office.

“We would hope most hospitals would respond as Seattle is, but what happened at Vanderbilt was shocking,” said Stanton, who noted that the Vanderbilt hospital now faces a lawsuit for releasing patient records.

Stanton predicted some families in states such as Texas who hadn’t previously considered moving will flee the state as the fear and risks of staying grow so strong that they outweigh the loss of leaving home.

At that thought, Stanton started to cry.

“It is a loss. It’s hard to be away from your friends, your community, all the people you care about,” she said. But in Texas, they were not safe anymore. “When very bad people have your information, you have to get out.”

If the courts rule in Paxton’s favor, it could give “a powerful tool to any other hostile state” wishing to similarly burden providers of gender-affirming care anywhere in the country, said David B. Cruz, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California.

“It does seem like this action by the attorney general is trying to push the state of Texas’s efforts further to restrict gender-affirming care and reduce or limit the ability of medical professionals to treat these people who need it,” Cruz said.

Ian Pittman, an Austin-based attorney representing families with transgender children, including some who sued Paxton and the state for using Child Protective Services to investigate them, said Texas’s SB14 law, which restricts gender-affirming care for youths, does not bar families from seeking the care out of state. If courts grant Paxton access to transgender Texas youths’ out-of-state medical records, he said, that may not matter.

Pittman likened the attacks on the LGBTQ+ community by the Texas GOP to attacks on reproductive and voting rights in recent years.

“They think that by harassing families like this, and generally making the state inhospitable, that two things will happen: People who are impacted will be more likely to move out of the state, and people who are not impacted but whose ideology is aligned with this will be more likely to move to the state,” Pittman said. “... It’s all connected and an attempt to maintain power.”

Beyond contesting Paxton’s jurisdiction over the matter, Seattle Children’s Hospital argued in its filing that it is protected under the state’s recently enacted Shield Law.

The law, crafted in response to the Dobbs ruling that eliminated federal protections related to abortion access, protects providers of abortion and gender-affirming treatment and their patients. Under the law, Washington courts and law enforcement may not aid, enforce subpoenas and investigations by or make arrests at the request of outside states seeking to prosecute treatment that they ban but that is legal in Washington.

Washington state Sen. Drew Hansen (D), who sponsored the Shield Law, said the legislature crafted the measure specifically to protect people in Washington from “aggressive overreach from states like Texas.”

“They say, ‘Don’t mess with Texas.’ But also don’t mess with Washington state,” Hansen said. “We make our own laws here. Other states don’t get to harass people here because of legal choices they made.”"

140,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"China, clashing with neighbors, reaches out to Hanoi and Pyongyang",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/china-clashing-with-neighbors-reaches-out-to-hanoi/,"SEOUL, South Korea — China has stepped up efforts farther afield in search of support and diplomatic backup as relations with its nearest neighbors deteriorate.

The dire state of relations between China and the Philippines was made clear after details of tense talks Wednesday between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Philippine counterpart Enrique Manalo were released. The two have clashed repeatedly over China’s aggressive sovereignty claims in the South China Sea.

“China-Philippines relationship now stands at a crossroads, with its future yet to be decided,” Mr. Wang told Mr. Manalo in telephone discussions, according to Chinese media CGTN. “The Philippine side must act with caution.”

He warned the Philippines not to collude with “ill-intentioned external forces” — a likely reference to Manila’s treaty ally, the U.S. — while claiming it has provoked maritime incidents and undermined China’s lawful rights. An international tribunal ruled against China’s South China Sea claims in 2016, but Beijing has refused to acknowledge the verdict.

Mr. Wang said disputes should be resolved by dialogue, and Mr. Manalo characterized the telephone talks as “frank and candid.” Relations deteriorated after the 2002 election of Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., who reversed the pro-China policies of predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.

High-profile clashes have played out in disputed waters off the Philippines in recent weeks. Chinese coast guard ships and maritime militia — weaponized fishing fleets — rammed and fired water cannons at Philippine vessels.

The intentions of Mr. Wang, who reportedly requested the talks, are not clear, analysts said.

Alex Neill, a Singapore-based analyst of Chinese security matters and a fellow at Pacific Forum, said it was unclear whether the Chinese minister was trying to cool the crisis or escalate China’s claims but added, “My gut feeling is it is probably the latter.”

China’s official press has dismissed a U.S.-led coalition formed this week to protect maritime traffic in the Red Sea from attacks from pro-Iran, Yemen-based Houthi rebels as a “Band-Aid” given the larger regional crisis, but “freedom of navigation” has become a mantra of the U.S. Navy in repeated challenges to China’s claims regarding Taiwan and the South China Sea.

If tensions in the South China Sea — a mass of disputed shoals, reefs and islands — escalate from coast guard clashes to full-scale naval activity, the Pentagon’s Operation Prosperity Guardian could provide a template for a similar Washington-led coalition in East Asia. Governments in the strategic “First Island Chain” — the arc of islands closest to the Chinese mainland encompassing Japan, Taiwan, portions of the Philippines and Indonesia — are already leaning heavily toward Washington.

Farther afield

China has shown signs of focusing farther afield on countries where relations have not been so antagonistic. In recent days, senior Chinese leaders have engaged with the communist nations on China’s northeastern and southwestern flanks.

Mr. Wang hosted North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Pak Yong Ho in Beijing on Monday, the same day Pyongyang test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. Although little information about their meeting was released, it was reportedly friendly, with Beijing offering to upgrade cooperation and communications.

China has long been North Korea’s core supplier of food and fuel. North Korea’s ties with Russia have tightened in recent months, and Moscow is positioned to supply grain and power and potentially reduce Pyongyang’s reliance on Beijing.

Still, Chinese leaders apparently have concluded that Beijing is positioned to expand its influence as heavily sanctioned Russia joins long-isolated North Korea as a dependency.

“I don’t think China is too concerned,” said Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at Seoul’s Asan Institute. “China can dominate relations with either party.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping made a two-day visit to Vietnam last week, his first in six years. He visited the mausoleum of state founder Ho Chi Minh and was received by leaders of the ruling Vietnamese Community Party.

Party-party ties are believed to be strong. Mr. Xi and Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong signed 36 agreements on infrastructure, security, trade and other matters. The details of most agreements were not released.

In September, Vietnam warmly welcomed President Biden for talks that resulted in deals on semiconductors, minerals and other issues and elevated the U.S. to the same high diplomatic status extended to China and Russia.

As global manufacturers exit China, Vietnam is emerging as a high-tech investment destination. Vietnam has traditionally obtained its arms from Russia, which, because of its war in Ukraine, is constrained from significant arms sales.

China-Vietnam ties are clouded by simmering territorial disputes in the South China Sea. In Hanoi, the two countries agreed to establish a maritime crisis hotline and possibly operate joint naval patrols. It’s unclear, however, whether the two countries, which fought a war in 1979, are fully on the same page.

“A nice gloss is painted over these events as the two parties would like to paint a rosy picture of their relationship,” Mr. Neill said. “But truth be told, they are rivals — historic rivals. … There is too much weight laid on party-party relations.”

China’s dwindling peripheral influence

The end of the COVID-19 pandemic left Beijing with significant diplomatic ground to make up. Pro-American administrations hold office to its east, in South Korea and Japan, and to its south, in Taiwan and the Philippines. The Biden administration has moved to strengthen ties with all four nations.

Regional players in East Asia, jittery about Chinese assertiveness, are weaving a web of multi- and “mini-lateral” security ties extending as far as Australia and Britain. The result: In the strategic First Island Chain, China is losing political ground.

Japan is fortifying its southern Ryukyu Islands. The Pentagon obtained permission this year for expanded rotational troop deployments to the Philippines, notably in northern Luzon.

Both locations are adjacent to Taiwan and cover naval chokepoints flanking the island democracy, which China has vowed to take over one day. On Jan. 13, Taiwanese voters go to the polls, with the anti-Beijing ruling party widely expected to win a third consecutive term for the presidency.

The coming year may also bring headaches for Chinese diplomats.

“The U.S. and U.K. are demonstrating they are willing to intervene in the Red Sea against the Houthis,” Mr. Neill said. “That sends a message to the South China Sea, where there is a potential for unmanaged escalation.”

North Korea, constantly talking up untested tactical nuclear weapons, is also looking restive and uneasy over its dependence on Beijing.

“My belief is that China is concerned about North Korea’s behavior next year,” said the Asan Institute’s Mr. Go. “I think the North will engage in a major nuclear test or an ICBM test at a normal angle — over Japan — teasing the U.S. and Japan to try and shoot it down.”

141,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"New naval coalition a ‘highway patrol’ to thwart Houthi ‘bandits’ in Red Sea, Pentagon says",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/new-naval-coalition-highway-patrol-to-thwart-houth/,"The Defense Department described Yemen’s Houthi rebels as “bandits” preying on merchant ships passing through the “international highway” that is the Red Sea. That makes the new U.S.-organized Operation Prosperity Guardian multinational task force a maritime highway patrol charged with keeping the peace in the region, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday.

The Iran-backed Houthis began launching drones and missiles at merchant ships passing through the Bab al-Mandab Strait linking the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden after Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel. More than 20 nations have now signed on to participate in the mission, Defense Department officials said.

“This is an international problem that requires an international response. We will continue to work with this ‘coalition of the willing’ and all countries will be able to contribute what they feel that they can,” Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman told reporters. “In some cases, that will include vessels [and] in other cases, it could include staff or other types of support.”

Operation Prosperity Guardian will fall under Combined Maritime Forces, an international naval coalition based in Bahrain under the command of the U.S. 5th Fleet.

“The Houthis aren’t attacking just one country. They’re attacking the economic well-being and prosperity of nations around the world,” Gen. Ryder said. “This is a defensive coalition that is there to help reassure global shipping and mariners as they transit the straits.”

Several major shipping companies and oil firms have suspended travel through the Red Sea after more than a dozen civilian ships came under attack since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Houthi officials say their campaign is a show of support for the Palestinian cause in the fighting.

Pentagon officials declined to elaborate on the strategy and tactics Operation Prosperity Guardian will employ to counter the Houthi attacks on merchant ships. The forces will cover an area of about 450 miles, the distance from Washington, D.C. to Boston.

“We’re going to continue to work with the international community to safeguard those vessels that are transiting those waterways,” Gen. Ryder said. “I would hope that the Houthis would understand the pressure that they are going to bring onto themselves if they don’t stop these attacks.”

Brown speaks with Chinese counterpart for first time since assuming top Pentagon job,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/gen-cq-brown-speaks-chinese-counterpart-first-time/,"Months of urging from the Pentagon for military leaders in China to communicate paid off Thursday when Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke with his Chinese counterpart by video teleconference.

It was the first time Gen. Brown spoke with Gen. Liu Zhenli of the People’s Liberation Army since he replaced retired Army Gen. Mark Milley on the Joint Chiefs in October.

“Gen. Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain open and direct lines of communication,” the Defense Department said. “Gen. Brown reiterated the importance of the People’s Liberation Army engaging in substantive dialogue to reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings.”

Thursday’s video call was the first talk between top military leaders from the U.S. and China since August 2022 when Beijing suspended all contact after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. It follows a meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month.

“The two military leaders discussed a number of global and regional security issues,” the Pentagon said.

The U.S. considers China its No. 1 pacing challenge, the only other country capable of marshaling high levels of military and economic power. Washington has accused Beijing of engaging in reckless and provocative behavior in the Pacific. The U.S. Navy regularly sends warships through the Taiwan Strait and other parts of the South China Sea to press its navigation rights.

The Pentagon said Gen. Brown “reaffirmed the importance” of both sides holding high-level talks between Washington and Beijing and between Adm. John C. Aquilino, commander U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and his counterparts in the PLA.

Gen. Brown “regularly communicates with chiefs of defense across the world and remains open to constructive dialogue with the [People’s Republic of China],” the Defense Department said.

According to a job posting on Tesla’s website, the electric vehicle maker wants a Scandinavian public policy expert with a “passion for Tesla’s mission,” who will make sure the “political, regulatory and fiscal frameworks of the ‘Nordics’ support Tesla’s mission.”

Whoever takes the job must reckon with the labor battle between Tesla and the Nordic region.

The battle began in late October when a handful of Tesla mechanics joined the Swedish labor union IF Metall. After Tesla refused to sign a collective agreement with the union, the machinists went on strike.

Other labor unions in Sweden soon launched sympathy strikes, with transport, mail and waste unions agreeing to stop servicing Tesla.

Since Tesla still refused to negotiate with the union, laborers across the Nordic countries launched sympathy strikes against Tesla.

The strikes show no signs of stopping, with Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, having little to say publicly about the issue. Mr. Musk has been openly anti-union for years, recently insisting that unions create a “lords and peasants” situation.

Hamas mapped the locations of border settlements and Israeli Defense Forces positions, then trained its fighters on the weak points of all the sites, The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday.

“They infiltrated Israel, knowing exactly which areas were under less surveillance, where there are observation posts (and) where the dining rooms and sleeping quarters are located,” the newspaper said, citing an Israeli military source. “Terrorists knew about the security vulnerabilities of an IDF base located kilometers away from the border.”

Other Hamas militants brought a video of a server room at an Israeli intelligence base they intended to attack. “Specific computers to be taken from the server room were marked in the video,” the newspaper reported.

Israeli officials said Iran provided the Hamas militants with instructions about which computers they should take during the attack.

“The level of their awareness about the Intelligence Corps base in the western Negev slipped us. They knew exactly what they wanted to achieve,” an IDF source told The Jerusalem Post. “It’s amazing to understand the level of their intent before the war.”

Hamas fighters also were given detailed instructions on tapping into the communications lines between IDF units located near the Gaza Strip, which would have allowed them to eavesdrop on encrypted systems, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Israeli government officials have publicly acknowledged the cascading series of intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to overwhelm their defenses during the Oct. 7 attack. They promised a wide-ranging inquiry once the war is completed, but according to The Jerusalem Post, a unit of Israel’s Intelligence Division has already launched an investigation.

“The field of defense and information security in the IDF will undergo a ‘fundamental change’ in the coming year, which will require the army to rethink its approach and fundamentally change its way of handling this issue,” the newspaper reported.

The bloodshed took place in the philosophy department building of Charles University, where the shooter was a student, Prague Police Chief Martin Vondrasek said. He has not been named publicly.

Police gave no details about the victims or a possible motive for the shooting at the building located near the Vltava River in Jan Palach Square. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said investigators do not suspect a link to any extremist ideology or groups.

Pavel Nedoma, the director of the nearby Rudolfinum Gallery, said he saw from a window a person standing on a balcony of the building and shooting a gun.

Police said they were still searching the area, including the balcony, for possible explosives. The building was evacuated, Prague Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda said.

The building forms part of the square and faces a bridge across the river with a view of Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech presidency. President Petr Pavel said he was “shocked” by what happened and offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims.

Where tourists, students and others would normally be enjoying the view of the iconic monument instead reflected chaos and terror on Thursday afternoon. Police vehicles and ambulances sped across the bridge with their sirens wailing to each the empty square, which was sealed off by officers.

Some video footage from the scene showed people being evacuated from the building and others trying to hide by a wall."
146,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Plagiarism charges dog Harvard President Claudine Gay on heels of antisemitism outcry,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/claudine-gay-harvard-president-dogged-by-plagiaris/,"Harvard President Claudine Gay survived an antisemitism uproar only to be engulfed by a plagiarism scandal that threatens her brief term in the top job and the reputation of the nation’s oldest university.

Calls for Ms. Gay to resign are mounting as the plagiarism claims snowball. She now stands accused of 41 instances of failing to give proper credit in seven articles over 30 years, according to the latest tally by Manhattan Institute senior fellow Christopher F. Rufo, who aired the first public charges two weeks ago.

The seven published writings in question represent more than half of the 11 articles listed on her resume, a conspicuously thin record of scholarship for the president of what many consider the nation’s most prestigious university.

“This is a scandal of epic proportions for the world of higher education and for the Ivy League,” Peter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, told The Washington Times.

He said Ms. Gay reached “sort of the summit of Mount Everest, the highest position an American academic could attain — and she got there with a very meager publication record.

“And then that record itself turns out to be largely bogus,” he said.

The Harvard Corp. reacted to the growing furor late Wednesday by telling The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, that Ms. Gay would request three corrections to her 1997 Ph.D. thesis based on the findings of a subcommittee formed by the board to consider the allegations.

Notably, Harvard didn’t use the word “plagiarism.” It said the subcommittee found “duplicative language without appropriate attribution.”

Ms. Gay has submitted four corrections to two of her articles after an “independent review” found “a few instances of inadequate citation.” Harvard said the review, which concluded on Dec. 9, “found no violation of Harvard’s standards for research misconduct.”

If members of the Harvard brain trust think seven corrections will resolve the matter, they haven’t been paying attention to Carol M. Swain.

Ms. Swain, a conservative political scientist and legal scholar, became a central figure in the scandal after charges that Ms. Gay paraphrased nearly verbatim two passages of Ms. Swain’s 1993 book, “Black Faces, Black Interests” (Harvard University Press).

Ms. Swain, a distinguished senior fellow at the Institute for Faith and Culture, offered some “free unsolicited advice” for Harvard on Thursday. The list included “Fire Claudine Gay posthaste.”

“She is a documented serial plagiarist,” Ms. Swain said on “The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show.” “That cannot be denied, and Harvard University can’t decide unilaterally that they’re going to change the definition of plagiarism just to protect its first-ever Black president.”

I have some free unsolicited advice for Harvard University.



1. Stop listening to the apologists for plagiarism.

2. Fire Claudine Gay posthaste. She can be relieved of duties until the terms are negotiated.

3. Stop listening to the racist mob of whites and blacks who cry racism … pic.twitter.com/TggW9QzTkB — Dr. Carol M. Swain (@carolmswain) December 21, 2023

Others calling Thursday for Ms. Gay to step down include Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, a Harvard alumnus who said the resignations shouldn’t stop there.

“Of course Harvard’s president should resign in disgrace for tolerating antisemitism and her rampant plagiarism,” he said on X. “But so should every member of Harvard’s board who covered up for her and allowed this to happen.”

Ms. Gay, who assumed the Harvard presidency in July, defended her academic integrity in a Dec. 12 statement saying her scholarship “adheres to the highest academic standards.” She has not commented on the issue since.

The plagiarism issue jumped this week from the conservative press to the left-tilting legacy media, including The Boston Globe, which asked in a staff editorial, “Did Claudine Gay plagiarize or not? Harvard should be clear.”

The New York Times called the allegations against Ms. Gay an “embarrassing development” for Harvard. CNN said the latest corrections fail to address “even clearer examples of plagiarism from earlier in her academic history.”

A full-blown plagiarism uproar was the last thing Harvard needed in the wake of the furor over campus antisemitism after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israelis.

The outcry over the college administration’s initial tepid response culminated in a disastrous Dec. 5 House hearing at which Ms. Gay and other university presidents said that whether calling for “genocide of Jews” violates conduct codes would depend on the context.

Those comments resulted in the resignations of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and Penn board of trustees Chairman Scott Bok, but the Harvard Corp. refused to force out Ms. Gay and billed her as “the right leader to help our community heal.”

Meanwhile, the university’s prestige and pocketbook have suffered. Applications for early admissions fell this year by 17%, while archrival Yale University reported a 1.4% increase, according to figures released this week.

The donor revolt also shows no signs of abating. Billionaire Len Blavatnik, a Harvard Business School graduate whose family foundation has donated an estimated $270 million to Harvard, has paused his financial support, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

Harvard still boasts the nation’s largest university endowment at $51 billion.

Rep. Virginia Foxx, North Carolina Republican and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, expanded the investigation into antisemitism at Harvard to include the plagiarism charges. She expressed concerns that Ms. Gay may have gotten away with conduct for which students would have been suspended or expelled.

In Ms. Gay’s corner are large swaths of the Harvard faculty. More than 600 faculty members signed a petition after the House hearing urging the board to “resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard’s commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay.”

Steven Levitsky, a Harvard government professor, told The New York Times that the examples of alleged plagiarism appear to be “mild sloppiness.” He said quantitative scholars like Ms. Gay are less concerned with “their literature reviews.”

Taking issue with his view was Rep. Elise Stefanik, New York Republican and a Harvard graduate.

“On the world stage, @Harvard continues to shred any remaining semblance of academic integrity,” she said on X.

147,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,U.N.: More than 1 in 4 people in Gaza are starving because of war,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/un-more-than-1-in-4-people-in-gaza-are-starving-be/,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip — More than half a million people in Gaza - a quarter of the population - are starving, according to a report Thursday by the U.N. and other agencies that highlights the humanitarian crisis caused by Israel‘s bombardment and siege on the territory in response to Hamas‘ Oct. 7 attack.

The extent of the population’s hunger eclipsed even the near-famines in Afghanistan and Yemen of recent years, according to figures in the report. The report warned that the risk of famine is “increasing each day,” blaming the hunger on insufficient aid entering Gaza.

“It doesn’t get any worse,’’ said Arif Husain, chief economist for the U.N.’s World Food Program. “I have never seen something at the scale that is happening in Gaza. And at this speed.”

Israel says it is in the final stages of clearing out Hamas militants from northern Gaza, but that months of fighting lie ahead in the south.

The war sparked by Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 rampage and hostage-taking in Israel has killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians. Some 1.9 million Gaza residents - more than 80% of the population - have been driven from their homes, and many of them are crammed into U.N. shelters.

The war has also pushed Gaza’s health sector into collapse. Only nine of its 36 health facilities are still partially functioning, all located in the south, according to the World Health Organization. WHO relief workers on Thursday reported “unbearable” scenes in two hospitals they visited in northern Gaza: Bedridden patients with untreated wounds cry out for water, the few remaining doctors and nurses have no supplies, and bodies are lined up in the courtyard.

Bombardment and fighting continued Thursday, and internet and communications that had been knocked out for several days gradually began to return across the territory.

U.N. Security Council members are negotiating an Arab-sponsored resolution for a halt in fighting to allow for increased aid deliveries. A vote on the resolution has been postponed twice this week in the hopes of getting the U.S. to support it or allow it to pass after it vetoed an earlier cease-fire call.

Thursday’s report from the U.N. underscored the failure of weeks of U.S. efforts to ensure greater aid reaches Palestinians. At the start of the war, Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, medicine and fuel into the territory. After U.S. pressure, it allowed a trickle of aid in through Egypt. But U.N. agencies say only 10% of Gaza‘s food needs has been entering for weeks.

This week, Israel began allowing aid to enter Gaza through its Kerem Shalom crossing, which boosted the number of trucks entering from around 100 a day to around 190 on Wednesday, according to the U.N. But an Israeli strike Thursday morning hit the Palestinian side of the crossing, forcing the U.N. to stop its pickups of aid there, according to Juliette Touma, spokesperson of UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. At least four staff members at the crossing were killed, a nearby hospital reported. The Israeli military said it struck militants in the area.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Israel has been working to increase its inspection of aid trucks to 300 or 400 a day and blamed the U.N. for failures in delivery. The amount of aid could triple “if the U.N., instead of complaining all day, would do its job,” he said, without elaborating on what more the U.N. should be doing.

Egypt’s Rafah crossing has limited capacity for trucks to cross. U.N. officials say delivery of aid within much of Gaza has become difficult or impossible because of fighting, and more than 130 U.N. personnel have been killed.

The report released Thursday by 23 U.N. and nongovernmental agencies found that the entire population in Gaza is in food crisis, with 576,600 at catastrophic - or starvation - levels. “It is a situation where pretty much everybody in Gaza is hungry,” Husain, the World Food Program economist, said.

“People are very, very close to large outbreaks of disease because their immune systems have become so weak because they don’t have enough nourishment,” he said.

Hundreds of people lined up at a soup kitchen in the southern Gaza town of Rafah on Thursday, waving cups and pots, waiting for soup to be served from huge vats hanging over wood fires. Rafah, by the Egypt border, is one of the few places that receives regular aid deliveries.

Aya Barbakh, a displaced woman, said she comes every day for food. “Let us be in comfort like other people. We see people dying every day, and we want to die like them. We have been insulted and humiliated,” she said.

Mahmoud al-Qishawi, with the American charity Pious Projects that runs the kitchen, said there’s no fuel to cook with, so they have to search around the neighborhood for wood to burn. “There’s a huge number of families and we don’t have food that is enough for them.”

Israel has vowed to continue the offensive until it destroys Hamas’ military capabilities and returns scores of hostages captured by Palestinian militants during their Oct. 7 rampage. Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and captured around 240 others.

Hamas fired a barrage of rockets at central Israel Thursday, showing its military capabilities remain formidable. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.

The United States has continued to support Israel’s campaign while also urging greater efforts to protect civilians. The U.S. wants Israel to shift to more targeted operations aimed at Hamas leaders and the group’s tunnel network.

The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday the death toll since the start of the war had risen to more than 19,600. It does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.

On Wednesday, the WHO delivered supplies to Ahli and Shifa hospitals in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops have demolished vast swaths of the city while fighting Hamas militants.

Israeli forces have raided a series of health facilities in the north in recent weeks, detaining men for interrogation and expelling others. On Thursday, troops stormed the Palestinian Red Crescent’s ambulance center in the Jabaliya refugee camp, taking away paramedics and ambulance crews, the group said.

In some health facilities, patients who are unable to be moved remain, along with skeleton staff who can do little beyond first aid, according to U.N. and health officials

Ahli Hospital is “a place where people are waiting to die,” said Sean Casey, a member of the WHO team that visited the two hospitals Wednesday. Five remaining doctors and five nurses along with around 80 patients remain in Ahli, he said.

All of the hospital buildings are damaged except two buildings where patients are now being kept - the orthopedics ward and a church on the grounds, he said.

Inside the church, it was “an unbearable scene,” he said. Patients with traumatic wounds struggled with infections. Others had undergone amputations. “Patients were crying out in pain, but were also crying out for us to give them water,” he said.

Israel’s military says 137 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. Israel says it has killed some 7,000 militants, without providing evidence. It blames the high number civilian deaths in Gaza on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields when it fights in residential areas.

However, the federal government cannot guarantee safe passage out of the besieged Palestinian territory.

Immigration Minister Marc Miller expects the program to be up and running by Jan. 9. Until now, the government has focused on getting 660 Canadians, permanent residents and their spouses and children out of Gaza.

Miller said the government will start accepting applications for people with extended family connections to Canada, including parents, grandparents, siblings and grandchildren.

He said people will be offered three-year visas if they meet eligibility and admissibility criteria.

Miller said he’s not sure how many people will be able to come to Canada under the program, but he expects the number will be in the hundreds.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose Cabinet took office last week, has promised to free the outlet and other state-owned media of the former ruling conservatives’ propaganda and divisive policies.

The first broadcast under the new authorities began with experts and officials explaining why programs under the previous government violated standards of fairness and objectivity, and why the new government had to make changes quickly. Even the name of the program was changed, from “News” to “19.30,” the time when it is broadcast on the main channel, TVP1.

The program then carried a report on the 2024 budget debate in parliament, followed by other news from Poland and around the world, trying to include various viewpoints. At the end, the newscaster said the program aspired to the highest standards and would also consider critical voices.

Other programs on TVP1, such as popular sitcoms or quiz shows, remained unchanged.

Police and security forces erected barriers in front of TVP’s main building in the capital, Warsaw, after leaders of the Law and Justice party that was ousted from power following elections two months ago began a sit-in inside the building on Wednesday to protest the changes implemented by the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

Some remained inside on Thursday, when police only allowed authorized employees into the TVP building.

The government on Wednesday said it had fired and replaced the directors of the state television and radio outlets and the government-run news agency, PAP. They had been under control of the right-wing Law and Justice party during its eight years in power, and were used as the government mouthpiece, denigrating government critics and the opposition and spreading euroskeptic views.

Tusk‘s administration said it would seek to reestablish independent media in Poland in a legally binding and lasting way.

The change of TVP management was sudden and the new editorial team apparently had no time to prepare a full evening newscast on Wednesday. Instead, a newly appointed anchor came on the air to explain the situation, promising unbiased newscasts would start on Thursday.

President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the previous ruling team, has criticized the steps by Tusk’s government regarding state media, but Tusk replied they were needed to restore their objectivity and fairness, in the service of the entire public."
150,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Israel’s military campaign in Gaza seen as among the most destructive in history, experts say",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/israeli-military-campaign-in-gaza-seen-as-among-mo/,"JERUSALEM — The Israeli military campaign in Gaza, experts say, now sits among the deadliest and most destructive in history.

In just over two months, the offensive has wreaked more destruction than the razing of Syria’s Aleppo between 2012 and 2016, Ukraine’s Mariupol or, proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II. It has killed more civilians than the U.S.-led coalition did in its three-year campaign against the Islamic State group.

The Israeli military has said little about what kinds of bombs and artillery it is using in Gaza. But from blast fragments found on-site and analyses of strike footage, experts are confident that the vast majority of bombs dropped on the besieged enclave are U.S.-made. They say the weapons include 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) “bunker-busters” that have killed hundreds in densely populated areas.

With the Palestinian death toll in Gaza approaching 20,000, the international community is calling for a cease-fire. Israel vows to press ahead, saying it wants to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities following the militant group’s Oct. 7 cross-border rampage that triggered the war, in which it killed 1,200 people and took 240 others hostage.

The Biden administration has quietly continued to supply arms to Israel. Last week, however, President Joe Biden publicly acknowledged that Israel was losing international legitimacy for what he called its “indiscriminate bombing.”

Here’s a look at what is known so far about Israel’s campaign on Gaza.

Israel’s offensive has destroyed over two-thirds of all structures in northern Gaza and a quarter of buildings in the southern area of Khan Younis, according to an analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data by Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University, experts in mapping damage during wartime.

The percentage of damaged buildings in the Khan Younis area nearly doubled in just the first two weeks of Israel‘s southern offensive, they said.

That includes tens of thousands of homes as well as schools, hospitals, mosques and stores. U.N. monitors have said that about 70% of school buildings across Gaza have been damaged. At least 56 damaged schools served as shelters for displaced civilians. Israeli strikes damaged 110 mosques and three churches, the monitors said.

Israel holds Hamas responsible for civilian deaths by embedding militants in civilian infrastructure. Those sites also shelter multitudes of Palestinians who have fled under Israeli evacuation orders.

“Gaza is now a different color from space. It’s a different texture,” said Scher, who has worked with Van Den Hoek to map destruction across several war zones, from Aleppo to Mariupol.

By some measures, destruction in Gaza has outpaced Allied bombings of Germany during World War II.

Between 1942 and 1945, the allies attacked 51 major German cities and towns, destroying about 40-50% of their urban areas, said Robert Pape, a U.S. military historian. Pape said this amounted to 10% of buildings across Germany, compared to over 33% across Gaza, a densely populated territory of just 140 square miles (360 square kilometers).

“Gaza is one of the most intense civilian punishment campaigns in history,” said Pape. “It now sits comfortably in the top quartile of the most devastating bombing campaigns ever.”

The U.S.-led coalition’s 2017 assault to expel the Islamic State group from the Iraqi city of Mosul was considered one of the most intense attacks on a city in generations. That nine-month battle killed around 10,000 civilians, a third of them from coalition bombardment, according an Associated Press investigation at the time.

During the 2014-2017 campaign to defeat IS in Iraq, the coalition carried out nearly 15,000 strikes across the country, according to Airwars, a London-based independent group that tracks recent conflicts. By comparison, the Israeli military said last week it has conducted 22,000 strikes in Gaza.

The Israeli military has not specified what it is using. It says every strike is cleared by legal advisers to make sure it complies with international law.

“We choose the right munition for each target - so it doesn’t cause unnecessary damage,” said the army’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.

Weapons experts have been able to draw conclusions by analyzing blast fragments found on-site, satellite images and videos circulated on social media. They say the findings offer only a peek into the full scope of the air war.

So far, fragments of American-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) bombs and smaller diameter bombs have been found in Gaza, according to Brian Castner, a weapons investigator with Amnesty International.

The JDAM bombs include precision-guided 1,000- and 2,000-pound (450-kilogram and 900-kilogram) “bunker-busters.”

“It turns earth to liquid,” said Marc Garlasco, a former Pentagon defense official and a war crimes investigator for the U.N. “It pancakes entire buildings.”

He said the explosion of a 2,000-pound bomb in the open means “instant death” for anyone within about 30 meters (100 feet). Lethal fragmentation can extend for up to 365 meters (1,200 feet).

In an Oct. 31 strike on the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, experts say a 2,000-pound bomb killed over 100 civilians.

Experts have also identified fragments of SPICE (Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective) 2000-pound bombs, which are fitted with a GPS guidance system to make targeting more precise. Castner said the bombs are produced by the Israeli defense giant Rafael, but a recent State Department release first obtained by The New York Times showed some of the technology had been produced in the United States.

The Israeli military is also dropping unguided “dumb” bombs. Several experts pointed to two photos posted to social media by the Israeli Air Force at the start of the war showing fighter jets stocked with unguided bombs.

Israel says it has two goals: Destroy Hamas and rescue the 129 hostages still held by militants.

Eleven weeks into the war, Israel says it has destroyed many Hamas sites and hundreds of tunnel shafts and has killed 7,000 Hamas fighters out of an estimated 30,000-40,000. Israeli leaders say intense military pressure is the only way to free more hostages.

But some families of hostages worry that the bombing endangers their loved ones. Hostages released during a weeklong cease-fire last month recounted that their captors moved them from place to place to avoid Israeli bombardment. Hamas has claimed that several hostages died from Israeli bombs, though the claims could not be verified.

The level of destruction is so high because “Hamas is very entrenched within the civilian population,” said Efraim Inbar, head of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, a think tank. He also said intense bombardment of Hamas‘ tunnels is needed to protect advancing Israeli ground forces from attacks."
151,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,From fugitive to shackled prisoner: ‘Fat Leonard’ back in U.S. court and could face more charges,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/from-fugitive-to-shackled-prisoner-fat-leonard-bac/,"MIAMI — A defense contractor at the center of one of the biggest bribery scandals in U.S. military history is expected to face additional charges following his return to the United States from Venezuela as part of a broader prisoner swap between the two countries, a federal prosecutor said Thursday.

Leonard Glenn Francis, who is nicknamed “Fat Leonard,” faced a federal judge for the first time since snipping off his ankle monitor last year and disappearing weeks before a sentencing hearing on charges that he offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defense contractors and others.

He was later arrested in Venezuela and had been in custody there since, but was returned to the U.S. in a large swap that also saw the release of 10 American detainees by Venezuela in exchange for the Biden administration freeing Alex Saab, a Colombian-born businessman and close ally of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was facing money laundering charges in Miami.

Francis, shackled and in a beige jumpsuit, stood by quietly as a federal magistrate judge in Miami ordered him to be transferred to the Southern District of California, the region where his case was initially filed.

Prosecutors said additional charges would be presented against Francis for failing to appear at a hearing in his ongoing bribery case in San Diego.

“Not right now,” an otherwise expressionless but soft-spoken Francis said in response to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Becerra’s question about whether he could afford an attorney.

Francis was arrested in a San Diego hotel nearly a decade ago as part of a federal sting operation. Investigators say he bilked the U.S. military out of more than $35 million by buying off dozens of top-ranking Navy officers with booze, sex, lavish parties and other gifts.

The scandal led to the conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges. Investigators say Francis, who owned and operated his family’s ship-servicing business, abused his position as a key contact for U.S. Navy shops at ports across Asia, wooing naval officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines.

He pleaded guilty in 2015 and was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor and security guards.

But weeks before he faced sentencing in September 2022, Francis made a daring escape as he cut off his ankle monitor and disappeared. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela.

He was arrested a couple weeks later before boarding a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach Russia.

He had been in custody in Venezuela ever since, and officials said he sought asylum there.

152,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Congo conducts a 2nd day of voting after delays and closed polls keep people from casting ballots,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/congo-holds-2nd-day-of-voting-after-delays-and-clo/,"KINSHASA, Congo — Congo was wrapping up its second day of voting Thursday after a chaotic rollout and lengthy delays forced officials to extend the balloting in the general election. The problems drew criticism from some opposition candidates as concerns mounted that the logistical hurdles could affect the credibility of the results.

At stake was the future of one of Africa’s largest nations and one whose mineral resources are increasingly crucial to the global economy. Congo has a history of disputed elections that can turn violent, and there’s little confidence among many Congolese in the country’s institutions.

President Felix Tshisekedi, who is seeking his second and final five-year term, has spent much of his time in office trying to gain legitimacy after a disputed 2018 election. Some 44 million people - almost half the population - were expected to vote in this year’s presidential contest and in legislative and provincial elections held simultaneously.

Tshisekedi was the likely winner of the presidential ballot, as the opposition was fractured.

Voting stations that didn’t open Wednesday allowed people to cast their ballots between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Thursday, according to a statement from the electoral commission. Voters are given 11 hours to vote from the time a voting station opens and many stations were expected to be open late into the night.

The initial results will start being announced on Friday, said Didi Manara, a high ranking official with the election commission in an interview with local radio Thursday.

The Electoral Observation Mission of the National Episcopal Conference of Congo and the Church of Christ in Congo said Thursday that more than 27% of voting stations didn’t open, there were 152 reports of violence, confrontations or brawls and reports of more than 74% of voter interruption. This was based on a sampling of 1,185 reports and it was unclear how many reports were sampled.

“There are many citizen who were not allowed to vote because they didn’t have their names on the lists … there were stations that opened at 2 p.m., some at 7 a.m., 3 p.m., this is discouraging, frustrating and it creates tensions. It also impacts the credibility of the voting process,” said the Rev. Eric Nsenga, a coordinator for the mission.

“It is clear that in this entire voting process we recorded things that stood out, incidents that we never noticed in former election processes,” he said.

Opposition leader Moise Katumbi said Thursday the election was marred by widespread fraud, violence against his supporters and the inability of several people to vote. However, he claimed the results “so far collected across the country and compiled by our monitoring centers” show he is “far in the lead.”

Local residents stayed outside some sites through the night to monitor the counts and were still there, struggling not to nod off, on Thursday morning.

“It is important for me to be a witness in order to protect the voting process. Sometimes they steal our votes; that’s why we were sent here to protect our voting process,” Moise Ibadu, one of the unofficial monitors, said.

Some people who were unable to vote because the machines broke down tried to return Thursday to cast ballots but found their stations closed.

“I am disappointed because I couldn’t vote, and I am not alone. There are many other people who couldn’t vote,” said a 45-year-old woman who did not want to be named.

But not everyone agreed the voting should have been prolonged.

“What happened yesterday was just sabotage of the electoral process,” said Bienvenu Matumo, a member of the rights group LUCHA. “The law makes no provision for extension, but this is a fait accompli on the part of (the election commission).”

On Wednesday, some people waited for 10 hours or more to vote. Associated Press reporters saw frustrated voters at one station in the capital, Kinshasa, aggressively try to push past police in riot gear. At least one station didn’t receive materials until an hour and a half before it was scheduled to close.

In conflict-riddled eastern Congo, displaced people said they couldn’t find their names on voter lists. In the city of Bunia, a voting center was vandalized in a dispute between the electoral commission and voters, and gunshots in the area prevented people from voting.

Fighting between more than 120 armed groups for land and power, and to protect their communities, has been ongoing for decades in the east but has worsened in recent years with the resurgence of the rebel group M23, which has seized territory and displaced millions of people.

Some displaced people who were unable to register due to the violence tried in vain to use older electoral cards Wednesday and were turned away, in some cases resulting in violence.

In the town of Bunia one person was killed Wednesday and 11 wounded when displaced people demonstrated against the police, said Gen. Johnny Luboya the governor of Ituri province.

The chaos came as no surprise to election observers and Congo experts, who have been warning for weeks that massive logistical challenges could hamper the vote’s rollout and threaten its credibility.

Election observers say they’re preparing for the post-electoral period, when the results could be contested. Nicolas Teindas, the director for the international observation mission for the Carter Center, warned that there were high levels of disputes in the past.

153,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Wildcat strike that shut down English Channel rail services is over with gradual return of trains,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/wildcat-strike-that-shut-down-english-channel-rail/,"PARIS — A wildcat strike Thursday by staff at Eurotunnel, which links Britain and the European continent and paralyzed dozens of Eurostar trains, ended some six hours after it began, Eurotunnel announced. It promised a gradual return to service.

Eurostar passenger trains will start transporting passengers on Friday, and the rail shuttle known as LeShuttle, which carries vehicles and passengers, was to return to duty starting Thursday night, along with freight trains.

The unannounced strike triggered by what Eurotunnel staff said was an insufficient bonus caused outrage and disarray in train stations as travelers on both sides of the English Channel tried to join families and friends for the Christmas holidays.

Union representatives at Eurotunnel’s French site had rejected a 1,000-euro ($1,100) end-of-year bonus, and went on strike to press a demand to have it tripled, Eurotunnel said earlier. That “resulted in the complete interruption of service and the closure of our terminals in France and the UK,” the statement said.

It said that 30 Eurostar passenger trains had been canceled out of London, Paris or Brussels.

Eurostar and Eurotunnel are two separate companies.

French Transport Minister Clement Beaune had called the stoppage “unacceptable,” insisting on the need for a quick solution.

“I salute the spirit of responsibility of all concerned,” he said later on X, formerly Twitter, noting the end of the Channel Tunnel blockage.

“Eurotunnel (officials) and union representatives reached an accord,” a Eurotunnel statement said, saluting the agreement - but not specifying any specifics of the deal.

It said earlier that affected customers would be able to exchange their tickets free of charge or claim a refund.

Tim Kelsey, of Oxford, was among victims of the strike, stranded at Paris‘ Gare du Nord train station.

“We learned about the strike here, when we arrived here at the station. It’s an outrage, being stuck here this close to Christmas,” he said. “What are the strikers thinking about?” He bemoaned the lack of any offer of accommodations in Paris.

“No trains available today or tomorrow. How am I going to get home to my children?” Kelsey asked. “It’s going to be a lonely Christmas on the streets of Paris.”"

Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose Cabinet took office last week, has promised to free the outlet of the former ruling conservatives’ propaganda and divisive policies.

Police and security forces erected barriers in front of TVP’s main building in the Polish capital, Warsaw, after leaders of the Law and Justice party that was ousted from power following elections two months ago began a sit-in inside the building on Wednesday to protest the changes.

155,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,France’s president is accused of siding with Depardieu as actor faces sexual misconduct allegations,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/french-president-macron-accused-of-siding-with-dep/,"PARIS — Women’s rights activists criticized French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday for appearing to take sides with actor Gérard Depardieu by saying the film star who is facing sexual misconduct allegations “makes France proud.”

Speaking on Wednesday night on TV channel France 5, Macron described himself as a “big admirer” of a “great actor.” Macron added: “He makes France proud.”

Macron’s comments in a televised interview come after a documentary that aired earlier this month said 16 women have accused Depardieu of harassing, groping or sexually assaulting them. The France-2 report also showed the actor making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.

They also come as a Spanish journalist and writer recently filed a complaint against Depardieu, who she says sexually abused her during an interview in Paris in 1995, Spanish police said Thursday.

Asked about such accusations against Depardieu, Macron said he believed in the presumption of innocence and the judicial process. “You will never see me participate in a manhunt,” the French leader said.

Macron also criticized his culture minister’s decision to launch a disciplinary procedure concerning Depardieu’s prestigious Order of the Legion of Honor, which could lead to the award getting rescinded. He said Culture Minister Rima Abdul-Malak went “a bit too far.”

The Legion of Honor is not “a moral tool” and should not be removed “based on a documentary,” Macron said.

Depardieu, 74, was put under investigation in December 2020 for alleged rape and sexual assault following allegations in 2018 from actor Charlotte Arnould, who said the crimes took place at Depardieu’s home. The investigation is ongoing.

Another alleged victim emerged in Spain, journalist and writer Ruth Baza who filed a complaint last week in the southern city of Torremolinos that the Spanish police said will now be shared with French authorities.

Baza, 51, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Thursday that when she was 23, she interviewed the actor in Paris for the magazine Cinemanía. She said that in her police complaint she explained how at the end of the interview the actor started kissing her face and neck, and touched her between her legs, behavior she said that police have classified as rape.

Baza said she felt “truly paralyzed” by Depardieu. “I was trapped.”

Baza said she had buried the matter in her mind but wrote it all down in detail in her diary at the time. She said the whole episode flooded back last April when she read about accusations made by 13 women against Depardieu.

She said that since then she has been in “a true nightmare” and decided she had to speak out.

“Taking the decision to go to the police has been the very last decision to try to go on with my life and leave this story in the hands of others and just try to help others who are in my very same situation and who are not able to talk,” Baza said.

She said that she has every intention of testifying to French authorities if needed.

Another complaint was filed in France in September by comedian Helene Darras for alleged sexual assault. Darras accused Depardieu of touching her bottom when she was a young extra for the 2008 film “Disco.”

Women rights activists on Thursday vigorously denounced Macron’s comments.

Michelle Dayan, president of Lawyers 4 Women, said that as a lawyer and a citizen, she also believed strongly in the presumption of innocence. “Yet it mustn’t be used as a pretext not to listen to women who say they are victims of abuses,” she said.

Speaking on France Info news broadcaster, Dayan said “violence against women starts there … in the image of women that is conveyed” through Depardieu’s shocking remarks.

Activist group Osez le feminisme denounced on X, formerly Twitter, “one more confirmation that, definitively, Emmanuel Macron doesn’t live in the same world as us.”

“We, the prey, are facing a man (Depardieu) who describes himself as a ‘great hunter,’ yet who, in the words of the president, becomes the victim of a ‘manhunt,’” the group posted.

Anne-Cécile Mailfert, president of the Women’s Foundation, said on BFM TV that Macron’s comments were “very serious” because “he is judging women who filed a complaint, women who spoke out. … He’s taking sides.”

Former French President Francois Hollande also chimed in to counter his successor. “No, we are not proud,” Hollande said on the France Inter radio network.

What was expected from the president was to “speak about women” who see in Depardieu’s remarks “violence, domination and contempt,” he said.

In October, Depardieu published an open letter in the French newspaper Le Figaro that said, “I want to tell you the truth. I have never, ever abused a woman.”

156,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Two railroad crossings temporarily closed in Texas raise concerns about cross-border trade,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/two-railroad-crossings-temporarily-closed-in-texas/,"McALLEN, Texas — The federal government has closed railroad crossings in two Texas border towns, raising concerns about the potential impact on cross-border trade and American consumers.

Customs and Border Protection announced Sunday that it would temporarily stop railroad operations in Eagle Pass and El Paso starting Monday. It did not say how long rail operations would be paused.

The railroads and politicians have decried the move that closes two of the six available railroad systems between Mexico and the U.S.

“This train doesn’t just stop at Eagle Pass. This train doesn’t just impact Texas,” Rep. Tony Gonzalez, a Republican congressman who represents the affected region, said Tuesday during a news conference. “This train impacts all of America, goods that are going all over America.”

CBP reported as many as 10,000 people entering the country illegally every day through the southwest border this month. Closing the railroad would free up customs officers to assist overwhelmed U.S. Border Patrol agents who need to take migrants into custody.

Thousands of asylum-seekers who have crossed are sleeping outside along the border as they wait for federal agents to process them. Most are released with notices to appear in immigration courts, which are backlogged with more than 3 million cases.

Operations were changed for similar reasons when CBP closed a port of entry in Lukeville, Arizona, a pedestrian crosswalk in San Diego, and an international bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Union Pacific and BNSF are the two railroads directly affected by the rail closures in Texas. Between them, 24 trains typically use the railroads daily to move agricultural products, automotive parts, finished vehicles, chemicals, and other consumer goods, according to the Association of American Railroads.

Union Pacific estimated its losses - in goods, wages and transportation costs - will exceed $200 million a day if the crossings in both cities remain closed. The railroad giant said the two crossings make up 45% of its cross-border business and that it cannot shift trains to other gateways.

BNSF did not provide a dollar estimate of losses but said it anticipates an impact to employees and a significant “downstream effect across our system, since those trains then travel throughout our 32,500-mile network,” according to a statement shared with the Associated Press.

Nearly 10,000 Union Pacific rail cars are currently halted on both sides of the border. Some of those cars contain automotive parts and completed vehicles.

Automakers Ford, GM and Toyota told AP that they would not be immediately affected by the border shutdowns, but Stellantis, an automaker of 14 car brands including Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler, expressed concern.

“The suspension of rail operations at the international crossings between Texas and Mexico has the potential to significantly impact production at Stellantis’ North American facilities that will quickly ripple out to our U.S. supply base,” spokesperson Jodi Stinson said in a statement.

Union Pacific said it has more than 60 trains - carrying automotive cars, food and beverages, industrial commodities, and agriculture products such as grain - waiting at the border.

The National Grain and Feed Association and the North America Export Grain Association raised fears that stalled grain and oilseed shipments could have an impact for their customers in Mexico, which is among the groups’ most important export markets.

“NGFA and NAEGA have become aware this afternoon of critical tightness in feeding supplies for several livestock feeders in Mexico,” the organizations said in a statement. “We have also learned of grain trains in multiple states being held for shipment due to CBP’s embargo. The critical nature of this issue is growing by the hour, particularly for those livestock feeders that may run short of feed.”

NGFA President Michael Seyfert said livestock feeders in Mexico could start to run out of grain to feed their animals if the crossings don’t reopen within a week because they don’t keep a big supply on hand.

“You can maybe stretch rations for a bit, but you can only do that so long,” he said. “And then it’s not like you shut the factory down for two days. You start making some some real difficult decisions related to animals from a humaneness standpoint.”

Trucks are a potential alternative to trains, although moving goods at such volume via road would be logistically problematic. It would take roughly 550 trucks to deliver the grain that one 110-car train hauls.

Union Pacific said it moves about 450,000 rail shipments through Eagle Pass and El Paso each year and estimates it would take one million trucks to move the same volume, or 2,800 trucks daily.

Migrants often board the trains as they travel through Mexico, but this does not guarantee entry to the U.S.

Union Pacific and BNSF use police, partnerships with federal agencies and technology to deter and detect contraband and people entering the country illegally. Union Pacific has a system that uses gamma-ray imaging to spot unwanted passengers.

Union Pacific said it has found only five migrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally on its trains in the last five weeks.

“Through our efforts, we have experienced very few people attempting to cross the border on trains at both ports of entry,” BNSF said via a statement."

Archbishop Tomasz Bernard Peta of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of St. Mary in Astana, Kazakhstan, and Auxiliary Bishop Athanasius Schneider rejected the new church policy declared by Pope Francis this week and asked the pontiff to rescind it.

Quoting Galatians 2:14, the clerics said Francis “does not walk uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel” in issuing the declaration, titled “Fiducia supplicans.”

Francis on Monday approved the declaration by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith to allow clergy to offer blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not performed in the context of a civil union or in any way resemble a liturgical wedding ceremony.

Archbishop Peta and Bishop Schneider said priests and laypeople in the archdiocese are prohibited “from accepting or performing any form of blessing whatsoever of couples in an irregular situation and same-sex couples.”

“It goes without saying that every sincerely repentant sinner with the firm intention to no longer sin and to put an end to his public sinful situation (such as, e.g., cohabitation outside of a canonically valid marriage, union between people of the same sex) can receive a blessing,” they added.

Their statement was first reported and translated by The Catholic Herald, an independent magazine in London.

According to the Association of Religion Data Archives World Religion database, 20% of Kazakhstan’s population in 2020 was listed as Christian, with 0.69% being Catholic.

Users who tried to access their X accounts during the outage were met with a cheerful “Welcome to X!” message.

Some users migrated to X rival Threads to discuss the blackout.

Thursday’s brief but large outage is the latest case of technical issues at X following Elon Musk’s takeover of the company last year.

Before he took over, X experienced around nine outages a year. In February alone, X had four blackouts, with several others before and after in 2023.

159,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Meet the Russian professor who became mayor of a Colombian city,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/21/meet-mikhail-krasnov-russian-professor-who-became-/,"TUNJA, Colombia — Mikhail Krasnov walks along the steep streets of the Colombian city of Tunja just like any other resident - except he’s no longer just another neighbor.

Now people greet the newly elected mayor as he makes his way around town and stop him for pictures. One woman hugs the man known here as the “Russian professor” and poses for a selfie.

Krasnov, a 45-year-old university professor from Russia, was one of the unexpected winners in Colombia’s regional elections in October. He prevailed by promising to stamp out corruption and embrace more meritocracy in the city government, where jobs often go to those with political connections.

He’s also trying to reduce the city’s debt.

“We are not here to promote my face,” said Krasnov, who has been interviewed by dozens of national media outlets and also a Russian network, since he won the election. “We want to send the message that Tunja exists, that we are competitive and want to attract investors.”

The blond and green-eyed professor stands out in Tunja, a city of 170,000 people in Colombia’s Andean highlands, where many residents are of Indigenous descent.

He is believed to be the only Russian living in the city, where he has been teaching economics and human rights courses at the local public university for the past decade.

Krasnov was born in Saratov, a city in southern Russia, in 1978. He arrived in Tunja in 2008 on a student exchange program, fell in love with the city’s food and culture, learnt Spanish and became a Colombian citizen two years ago.

“My mother has Ukrainian roots, my father is Russian and I am Colombian” he says proudly, adding that he opposes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where he has friends and family.

The professor says he decided to get involved in politics last year, due to his growing frustration with the city’s lack of progress in areas like job creation and poverty reduction.

“You reach an age where you start to ask yourself what you can contribute” to society, he said of his decision to enter the turbulent world of Colombian politics.

At first Krasnov tried to run as an independent, which meant he had to collect 30,000 signatures to get himself on the ballot.

After collecting the signatures however, Krasnov discovered there was another requirement for registering as a candidate – a $10,000 fee.

That was too much for Krasnov’s modest budget, but his growing fame and commitment to campaigning got him noticed by some political parties, who have the right to register candidates.

Eventually Krasnov was put on the ballot by The Force for Peace, a party founded last year by the former president of Colombia’s congress.

Krasnov describes himself as a centrist, and jokes about the campaign, in which he ran against several candidates that were better funded and represented traditional parties that have run the city for years.

In the nine-candidate race Krasnov also defeated a politician from President Gustavo Petro’s leftist party, the Historical Pact.

“I’m a public university professor, who was born in the Soviet Union, so you’d think I’d be on the left” he said. “But the leftists were the first ones to attack me, even when I was collecting signatures, because I also appealed to their voters.”

Krasnov won the election with 31% of the overall vote.

“It was a big surprise,” said Alejandra Monroy Martínez, a political scientist based in Tunja, who remembers seeing Krasnov handing out flyers and talking to people on the city’s streets. She said his victory reflects a growing dissatisfaction with the city’s political class.

Alba Rodríguez Parra, 56, said she trusts “the Russian” because he was a professor at the city’s public university, speaks six languages and has several degrees.

She’s hoping that the new mayor can reduce growing crime rates and help to expand the streets that lead into the city center and are sometimes jammed with cars.

“Previous mayors have let us down, because they pocketed all the money” she said.

160,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Virginia's railways are getting an upgrade,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-21/virginia-passenger-rail-authority-amtrak-trains-dc-richmond-raleigh,"Earlier this month, two federal grants totaling well over $1 billion were awarded to help move along major rail infrastructure improvements. One day, that means passenger rail will more quickly propel riders from Richmond to Washington, D.C., or Raleigh, North Carolina.

Getting to Raleigh quicker would make Da’Quan Love ditch his car. Love is the owner of the political fundraising group Reflex Strategy Group, and he also serves as the executive director of the NAACP in North Carolina. He commutes south about two times a week — a trip that can take up to three hours, one way. Math: That’s about 12 hours total driving each week just to and from work.

“I’d absolutely love to take the train, because I can get some work done,"" Love said while leaving Raleigh. “I just hope that they would also improve the internet service.”

The influx of federal grants to fix rail infrastructure with the end goal of getting drivers out of their cars has been going on for years according to D.J. Stadtler, executive director of the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority.

“As we've seen over the last week, and really over the last couple of years, the feds are really excited about growing infrastructure. They see the congestion, too,” Stadtler said. “Rush-hour traffic and congestion is bipartisan. So whether you're Republican, a Democrat, Independent — if you are in traffic, you don't like it.”

Stadtler said over the last few years, Amtrak ridership in Virginia has increased. According to a press release, the rail line saw its highest ridership increase ever, with a 20.1% jump over last year.

“We have set a record for each month of ridership for the last 15 or 16 months,” he added. “We have the momentum going where ridership is setting records, blowing away even the pre-COVID numbers. We feel like we will be continually well-positioned to compete for infrastructure money to help get folks off the road, help the environment and give people a better quality of transportation.”

But not everyone will be able to ride the train even once all the infrastructure upgrades are finished.

Matt Simmons, president of the company that runs Capital Ale House and Fest Biergarten, travels up to Fairfax at least twice a week for work.

“I don't think the stops for the train are close enough to my restaurants,” Simmons said. “And there's a lot of times I have to make stops on the way. So, I don't think that would work for me.”

Simmons did say that he’d definitely take the train when he goes to D.C. for events or fun, especially since parking at most hotels costs the same as a train ticket.

The timeline for completion — at least for trains running back and forth from Richmond to D.C on an hourly basis — is about six years away.

“2030 is the magic number for north of Richmond,” Stadtler said. “2030 is when all of the Phase 2 projects will be done between Richmond and D.C.”

But riders looking for the express line from Richmond to Raleigh will have to wait a while longer.

The recent announcement by North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis of a $1 billion grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation — for a new passenger rail route between Raleigh and Richmond — was only for North Carolina, said Stadtler.

The route, once completed, will be along a former CSX freight line and be called the S-Line.

“CSX used to have the S-Line that took traffic straight down through Virginia to North Carolina,” said Stadtler. “They have pulled a lot of that up, because they didn't use it.”

VPRA purchased the S-Line with the goal of rebuilding it. Once operational, it’ll cut about 1 hour, 15 minutes off the roughly 4-hour route.

Stadtler said VPRA is only in the design stages of what the line will eventually look like. He doesn’t expect the S-Line to be operational until years after 2030.

“I'm very reluctant to say how many ‘a few’ is,” Stadtler said. “Once we get that design work done by the end of 2024, we will have a good sense for the design requirements. We will know whether it's a $6 billion investment or a $10 billion investment. We just have no idea.”

Eventually, VPRA envisions rail service running all across the commonwealth — including from Washington down past Roanoke, and Washington to Raleigh, and from Norfolk and Newport News out past Staunton."
161,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,How to keep Richmond-area pets safe over the holidays,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-21/how-to-help-pet-dog-cat-animal-urgent-emergency-care-greater-richmond,"The holidays can be challenging for humans, but animals also get stressed out during this time of year. Friends or relatives might slip them extra treats from the table, they might find wrapping paper and Christmas decorations to be a tasty treat — or they might be staying away from home while their families travel.

What happens when pets need urgent and emergency care during this period? Tabitha Treloar, director of communications at the Richmond SPCA, has some advice to help pet owners breathe a sigh of relief this holiday season. The Richmond SPCA has a veterinary hospital that helps serve low-income residents. Urgent and emergency care may otherwise be out of reach financially, so the organization likes to emphasize prevention over everything else, especially now.



Food for thought

“Some of the biggest risks are foreign body ingestion and pancreatitis in dogs,” Treloar said. She added that it’s easy to prevent things that are “known risks,” such as feeding table scraps from a holiday meal to pets that could upset their digestive systems or giving extra treats.

If pet owners want to indulge their animals over the holidays, Treloar suggests preparing a fun treat — like putting kibble or veterinarian-approved treats in a Kong or other puzzle toy and freezing them in advance.

“Then you can give them that treat in another room away from where everybody is dining, so that they can enjoy that favorite,” Treloar said, “It also keeps them from pestering grandma for that little piece of gravy …that really is too rich for their stomachs to handle.

She also added that when gifts start getting unwrapped, animals might mistake wrapping paper, ribbons or holiday decorations for tasty treats: “Those are all kinds of foreign body things we worry about.” While unwrapping gifts, it wouldn’t hurt to keep a close eye on pets, just to ensure they’re not ingesting any small bits that may fall off the packaging.

If pet owners find themselves in need of emergency or urgent care and can’t afford to take pets to a veterinarian’s office, there are options.



In need of urgent care?

UrgentVet emergency centers have opened throughout the Richmond region, including in Short Pump, Carytown and Midlothian.

“These are kind of in between your normal primary care vet, like at a hospital, and the full-on emergency center,” Treloar said. She recommends calling pet urgent care centers in advance to find out if they have weight limits for animals, and to see what potential costs are.

If an emergency situation that requires immediate care arises, Treloar suggests calling emergency centers to find out what the wait times are, and to make sure they’re open and accepting patients —because holiday hours can change things.

The same goes for pet owners who have an exotic or unusual pet.

“Hopefully those who do have that type of pet will already have an [established] relationship with a vet,” Treloar said.

If pets get sick, she also recommends not using any home remedies found on the internet and to instead stick to vet-recommended solutions. “Our vets often tell us really rough stories that come from people trying to do things on their own at home that can cause more problems than the initial issue,” she said.



Boarding away from home

If pet owners are traveling over the holidays and unable to take their pets with them, they might choose to board their pets. There’s been a lot of news coverage recently about a respiratory illness affecting dogs. Making sure your pets are up-to-date on their vaccinations is key for situations like this, especially if an outbreak of kennel cough or parainfluenza breaks out at a facility.

“What is being seen is that people’s habits and vaccinations sometimes flipped during the pandemic, as did access to vaccinations here,” Treloar said.

Treloar also said that between lower vaccination rates and a surge in typical respiratory illnesses in animals around this time of year, things are being seen “a little bit differently among the populations.”

If pets aren’t traveling with their families for the holidays, they might end up at dog parks, or crowded places like daycare facilities, where the vaccination status of other animals could be unknown. By making sure pets are up-to-date on their shots or keeping them at a distance from other animals, pets are better prepped to healthy in case of a bug going around."
162,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,"Gaza health officials say Israel's offensive has now killed more than 20,000 people",https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-22/gaza-health-officials-say-israels-offensive-has-now-killed-more-than-20-000-people,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel's devastating air-and-ground assault on Gaza has now killed more than 20,000 people in the 10 weeks since the conflict began, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health — a figure that is fast approaching 1% of the Palestinian territory's pre-war population.

The ministry, in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, said Friday that at least 20,057 people have died from the Israeli attacks since Oct. 7. It has said 70% of those killed are women and children.

Although the health ministry doesn't differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, it says the majority of those killed have been women and children. Another 50,000 people in Gaza have been wounded, the Hamas-controlled ministry says. International aid groups generally agree with its tallies.

A death toll of 20,000 in the enclave, where the population is estimated at roughly 2.1 million, means around 1 out of every 105 people has been killed since the war began.

As the death toll continues to rise, Israel faces growing international pressure to end the bombing of Gaza. Even the Biden administration, which has firmly backed Israel's stated goal of crushing Hamas, has repeatedly admonished Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to minimize civilian casualties.

Lives shattered

Among those whose lives have been shattered by Israel's bombardment is Yousef Es-Sakani. He sits on the edge of a planter under a tree in the center of Ramallah, a bustling, traffic-choked city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and tries to make sense of Israeli airstrikes earlier this month in Gaza that suddenly added most of his family to the war's staggering death toll.

In the early morning hours of Dec. 9, he says, his wife, four daughters and two of his sons were killed by Israeli airstrikes that flattened their four-story Gaza City apartment building. A third son only survived because he stayed with an aunt the night of the attack.

""One of the ones killed is my daughter, she had one semester left to graduate to become a doctor,"" he says.

/ Ayman Oghanna for NPR / Ayman Oghanna for NPR Yousef Es-Sakani is trying to make sense of the airstrike in Gaza City earlier this month that killed his wife, four daughters and two of his sons.

Of his two sons killed, the body of one remains buried under the rubble, says Es-Sakani, who wears a black baseball cap, a salt-and-pepper beard and an expression of weary stoicism.

Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 attack, when Hamas staged a lightning strike on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, Israel says. The Islamist militant group also seized around 240 hostages, but freed more than a hundred of them during a week-long cease-fire at the end of November. At least 110 others remain in captivity, Israeli officials say.

At last count, Israel's military says it has killed 7,000 Hamas fighters. It remains unclear, however, whether that figure includes an estimated 1,000 militants Israel says were killed inside its border during the Oct. 7 attack.

People who have followed past wars in Gaza say the Gaza Ministry of Health's numbers are reliable. The ministry has traditionally used a digitized system to gather the names, ages and gender of the dead from hospitals and morgues.

Even so, it has become increasingly difficult to keep an accurate count amid frequent communications blackouts in Gaza and attacks on hospitals, which Israeli says are harboring Hamas fighters and command posts. With much of Gaza now reduced to rubble, thousands, like Es-Sakani's son, lie uncounted under tons of concrete and twisted rebar.

""Any numbers you hear are unfortunately an undercount because we don't know how many bodies are underneath the rubble,"" says Sari Bashi, who works in Ramallah and serves as the program director for Human Rights Watch in charge of global research. ""And the [Gaza] civil Defense Force does not have equipment and many areas are unreachable.""

Pressure on Israel to switch tactics

The U.S. wants Israel to shift to lower intensity combat, sending in special forces teams to root out Hamas rather than targeting the Islamist militant group with airplanes and tanks. Many Israelis have also pushed their government toward another cease-fire to secure the release of the remaining hostages.

But a retired Israeli brigadier general, Shlomo Brom, said it is difficult for troops to avoid civilian casualties when Hamas is embedded in mosques, schools and hospitals, as the Israelis claim.

Anas Baba / NPR / NPR The civilian death toll in Gaza has led to growing calls for Israel to shift tactics in its assault on the Palestinian territory. Above, people survey the damage from an airstrike in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah.

Brom also says Hamas believes the growing death toll in Gaza is undermining support for Israel's war effort.

""Not only they don't care about their populations, they're seeing the casualties contribute to their cause,"" he said. ""Because that's OK if they can mobilize the media [and] public opinion.""

Meanwhile, for weeks, international aid groups have been warning of a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with food, water and fuel and critical levels. The U.N. World Food Program, warned Monday that ""Gazans are becoming more desperate by the day, with nowhere to go and nothing to eat.""

163,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Tacoma police officers are acquitted in the killing of unarmed Black man Manuel Ellis,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-21/tacoma-police-officers-are-acquitted-in-the-killing-of-unarmed-black-man-manuel-ellis,"AILSA CHANG, HOST:

A jury acquitted three police officers of all charges today in the death of Manuel Ellis, an unarmed Black man who was killed in Tacoma, Wash., in 2020. Though he died months before George Floyd, Ellis' case gained new attention in the wake of Floyd's murder. The trial was the first test of a state law making it easier to charge officers for using deadly force. Jared Brown of KNKX reports.

JARED BROWN, BYLINE: Officers Matthew Collins and Christopher “Shane” Burbank were found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Officer Timothy Rankine was acquitted of manslaughter. Ellis had been walking home from a convenience store late at night in March of 2020, when Officers Collins and Burbank called him over to their patrol car.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PATTY EAKES: There seemed to be some sort of conversation, perhaps, a brief interaction.

BROWN: Special prosecutor Patty Eakes with the state attorney general's office argued in court that Burbank then knocked Ellis to the ground without cause. Video recorded by passing motorist show he and Collins then punched Ellis, put him in a neck hold and tasered him. Witnesses say he didn't fight back. Officer Timothy Rankine later kneeled on Ellis' back while his hands and feet were bound.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

EAKES: He's not threatening the officers. He's not incoherent. The words he uses are all words that anyone can understand. Please, I can't breathe. I still can't breathe. Sir, please, I can't breathe.

BROWN: Attorneys for the officers said that Ellis attacked them and resisted arrest with extreme strength, a symptom, they said, of what some call excited delirium. That's a medical syndrome that some police trainers say can cause a person to be difficult to control and can lead to death, but which has been widely rejected by medical associations. Defense attorney Wayne Fricke argued Ellis died of a methamphetamine overdose exacerbated by a heart condition unknown to the officers.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WAYNE FRICKE: All they know is they were being attacked by a guy out in the streets in a dangerous part of town, and they're acting accordingly.

BROWN: The county medical examiner ruled Ellis' death a homicide due to a lack of oxygen from police restraint with methamphetamine and heart disease listed as contributing factors. It took a year after Ellis' death for the officers to be charged. Police accountability advocates in Washington say the racial justice protests of 2020 were instrumental in getting state officials to reexamine the case and bring charges. And according to legal experts in Washington, it was nearly impossible to charge police officers before 2019, when state law required prosecutors to prove officers acted with malice or evil intent. Craig Sims is a former Washington prosecutor. He said the Tacoma officers' acquittal shouldn't impact future charging decisions.

CRAIG SIMS: The field has been somewhat leveled in terms of the path to pursuing accountability for police officers who may have crossed the line.

BROWN: After the verdict, Washington's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, issued a short statement thanking the jury for their service and saying his heart went out to the Ellis family. In a statement inside the courthouse, the officers' attorneys said the acquittal proved that their clients had been falsely charged. For NPR News, I'm Jared Brown in Tacoma.

164,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,UN Security Council debates how to get aid into Gaza as conditions become more dire,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-21/un-security-council-debates-how-to-get-aid-into-gaza-as-conditions-become-more-dire,"AILSA CHANG, HOST:

The question of how to get more aid into Gaza has deadlocked the United Nations Security Council. For three days, proposals have been debated there, and they continue tonight. Now, the nuances are complex. But in general, the U.S. has a veto power and could use it to stop proposals that it and Israel see as allowing Hamas to resupply or rearm. But millions of people in Gaza are in increasingly dire conditions. NPR's Michele Kelemen is covering all of this and joins us now. Hi, Michele.

MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.

CHANG: So what are these proposals that are prompting objections from the U.S. right now?

KELEMEN: Well, the original draft resolution called for a U.N. monitoring mechanism to check trucks going into Gaza. The U.S. and Israel opposed that because right now Israel is doing those inspections. They say they want to make sure that weapons aren't being smuggled in for Hamas. And U.S. officials have made clear that they feel like they have an OK system in place. Here's how National Security Council spokesman John Kirby put it today.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN KIRBY: It's important to us, of course, that the humanitarian situation in Gaza gets addressed. We are working harder than any other nation to actually address those concerns.

KELEMEN: So the U.S. pushed back on that proposal, which is - seems to be dropped in the latest version. The new draft resolution just calls for a U.N. aid coordinator. It also just calls for urgent steps to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access rather than calling for a cessation of hostilities now.

CHANG: OK. Well, I know that the U.S. has vetoed previous resolutions. Do you think that will happen again?

KELEMEN: The talks all week have focused on ways to get the U.S. to yes or at least to an abstention. And as I look over the latest draft, that does seem possible. You know, the Security Council did pass one resolution last month. It focused also on the plight of civilians in Gaza, particularly children. It called for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and aid corridors - that was language that the U.S. could accept at that time. It has vetoed resolutions calling for a cease-fire in this conflict, arguing that Israel has the right to go after Hamas, which carried out that attack on Israel October 7. But, you know, as the humanitarian crisis grows, every time the U.S. vetoes something at the U.N., Washington faces a backlash all around the world. And, Ailsa, there's growing criticism of the Biden administration at home too.

CHANG: Exactly. I mean, conditions are getting worse in Gaza. And now the U.N. is warning of mass hunger there, right? What are they saying about that?

KELEMEN: Well, the U.N. spokesman today painted a very grim picture. Stephane Dujarric talked about how few hospitals are operating in Gaza, how the Israeli military operations have uprooted tens of thousands of Palestinians who really have nowhere safe to go. And here's what he said about the food situation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEPHANE DUJARRIC: According to a food security analysis issued today, more than half a million people are facing catastrophic hunger conditions in Gaza. The World Food Programme warns that these levels of acute food insecurity are unprecedented in recent history and that Gaza risks famine.

KELEMEN: He said, you know, 1 in 4 Gazans have run out of food and are in brink of starvation. So, you know, there's a lot of pressure at the U.N. to do something. What the U.N. wants is a humanitarian cease-fire and more aid routes. The resolution that's being debated calls for unhindered humanitarian access and more aid routes and also more fuel to meet the dramatic needs. But it's definitely been watered down from the original proposals in order to get the U.S. on board.

CHANG: That is NPR's Michele Kelemen. Thank you so much, Michele.

KELEMEN: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR."

Two TV heartthrobs, Andrew Scott, the hot priest from ""Fleabag,"" and Paul Mescal, who plays the conflicted romantic Connell in ""Normal People,"" star in a new movie called ""All Of Us Strangers."" Critic Bob Mondello says the word that best describes the film for several reasons is haunting.

BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE: Adam is a screenwriter who lives in a massive, mostly vacant apartment building in London. He's working on a script about his parents, who died when he was 11 - if, by working, you mean watching TV and occasionally going outside when the fire alarm sounds.

(SOUNDBITE OF FIRE ALARM SOUNDING)

MONDELLO: One night when he does and looks up, there's only one other lit apartment in the whole building with a guy who stayed put. After the all-clear, there's a knock at Adam's door.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

PAUL MESCAL: (As Harry) Hello. I saw you looking at me from the street. I'm Harry. You drink?

MONDELLO: He motions to the bottle in his hand.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

MESCAL: (As Harry) It's meant to be the best in the world, but I couldn't tell you why, so...

ANDREW SCOTT: (As Adam) No, thanks.

MESCAL: (As Harry) Yeah, OK. OK, how about I come in anyway? - if not for a drink, then for whatever else you might want.

MONDELLO: Adam declines, but the ache of loneliness lingers. The next day, to research his script, he takes a train out to the suburb where he grew up and finds his old house and, as night falls, has an encounter with another man - only, this time, Adam's the one who's hoping to be invited in.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

JAMIE BELL: (As Dad) She's going to be over the moon to see you.

MONDELLO: And he is.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

BELL: (As Dad) Guess who I found loitering in the park?

CLAIRE FOY: (As Mum) Is it him?

BELL: (As Dad) Oh, yeah. It's definitely him. Look in his eyes.

FOY: (As Mum) Yes, it is you.

MONDELLO: It's his parents, who've not aged a day.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

SCOTT: (As Adam) Hi.

FOY: (As Mum) Hi. Don't just stand there. Get yourself inside.

MONDELLO: A ghost story of sorts about connection where it's least expected and after hope is all but gone - speaking of which, Adam returns to his apartment and meets up with Harry again, this time letting things go where they will...

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

MESCAL: (As Harry) I'm assuming you're not with anyone - never see you with anyone.

MONDELLO: ...Physical intimacy leading to personal intimacy.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

MESCAL: (As Harry) Is this your mum and dad?

SCOTT: (As Adam) Yeah. They died just before I was 12. I'm trying to write about them at the moment.

MESCAL: (As Harry) How's it going?

SCOTT: (As Adam) Strangely.

MONDELLO: You might say that. Filmmaker Andrew Haigh has adapted a Japanese novel called ""Strangers"" in ways that let him explore family and distance in a personal way. How personal? The house Andrew visits when he sees his parents in the movie is the house the filmmaker grew up in.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

BELL: (As Dad) And I would hear you crying in your room after school. Did the boys bully you then?

MONDELLO: Haigh is telling a generous tale of injuries done glancingly and without intent - of parents being offered a second chance in their children's memory...

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

BELL: (As Dad, crying) Sorry I never came in your room when you were crying.

SCOTT: (As Adam) Dad. Dad, I get it. It was so long - (crying) it was so long ago.

MONDELLO: ...And of comfort offered by those damaged children to each other in the present.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ALL OF US STRANGERS"")

MESCAL: (As Harry) I'm really sorry.

SCOTT: (As Adam) It was a long time ago.

MESCAL: (As Harry) I don't think that matters.

MONDELLO: Andrew Scott's tightly wound Adam, Paul Mescal's chill, but also wounded Harry, haunted by memories and self-doubt - two strangers finding comfort in each other as they struggle to reconcile the men they've become with the expectations they're still trying to set aside - the disconnect that makes all of us strangers to our pasts and that makes Andrew Haigh's ""All Of Us Strangers"" such a haunting meditation on how we can connect.

Earlier this year, NPR's podcast Taking Cover told the story of a friendly fire in Iraq back in 2004. Two Marines and an Iraqi interpreter were killed in the tragedy, which also wounded more than a dozen others. Our reporters learned that the son of a prominent politician was involved in the mistake, and the whole thing had been covered up. Now a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee is asking the Marine Corps for answers. NPR's Tom Bowman and Graham Smith bring us the latest.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: April 12, 2004. U.S. Marines accidentally launched an 81-millimeter mortar on one of their own positions during fighting in Fallujah - among those killed, Lance Corporals Brad Shuder and Rob Zurheide. Zurheide's wife, Elena, was expecting their first child.

ELENA ZURHEIDE: April 12 was my due date. I was due on April 12, and my husband died on April 12.

GRAHAM SMITH, BYLINE: The Marines didn't tell Elena the truth about how Rob died. They said it was enemy fire. She heard rumors it was an accident, but she wasn't officially informed it was friendly fire till more than three years later. And even then, a lot was held back. She wants to know why.

ZURHEIDE: Because that's what I view all of this as - a big, fat lie.

BOWMAN: When NPR reached out to the Marine Corps leadership after the podcast ran, telling them about our investigation, about Elena and several wounded veterans who'd never been told the truth, the Marines said there'd be no response. But there's someone else now looking for answers about what went wrong that day and why it was so poorly handled afterwards - Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat who serves on the Armed Services Committee.

MARK KELLY: Robert Zurheide's widow, Elena, is one of my constituents. His son Robert, who wasn't even born when he was killed, is there in Tucson with his mom.

BOWMAN: Going to Kelly's office, you walk past the orange spacesuit he wore as an astronaut and a photo of the fighter jet he flew in the Navy. He was a combat pilot like John McCain, the Republican war hero whose desk Kelly now sits behind.

KELLY: They deserve answers. It's important that they get them - not only them but the folks who were wounded. You know, why were they not informed? You know, why did it take this long? It shouldn't. They should be informed immediately. The Marine Corps has regulations, and they need to follow up.

SMITH: When we went to the Marines for answers, at first they said they couldn't find any documentation of the friendly fire. Then they gave us conflicting stories about what had happened. And then they failed to even follow regulations and reach out to the wounded vets. But Kelly's a senator. They won't ignore him. The senator told us he recently met with the No. 2 Marine officer, General Christopher Mahoney, and he raised the issue of this mishandled incident.

Had he any idea what you were talking about, or...

BOWMAN: What did he say?

KELLY: Yeah, he was familiar with it. And he told us he's going to get us some answers, and I trust that he's going to do that.

BOWMAN: One of the wounded troops Kelly wants answers for is John Smith. Smith was a Marine corporal. He lost a leg and the use of one eye that day.

SMITH: Hey, John.

BOWMAN: We visited him recently in Maryland. He ambles out of his house slowly, walking with a stiff gait.

JOHN SMITH: Y'all ready?

SMITH: Great to see you.

SMITH: Likewise.

SMITH: How you been?

SMITH: I can't complain - enjoying myself for the holidays. How's everything been with you, though?

BOWMAN: All good, all good.

SMITH: John's working on his master's degree in mental health counseling, and he's a hip-hop artist on the side. He says he still thinks about that explosion that mangled his leg every day.

SMITH: For about 10, 15 minutes in the morning, I'm back in 2004 'cause I have to put myself back together every time.

SMITH: You got the prosthetic. Yeah.

SMITH: Exactly. So it's like I don't get to move all the way forward. But, I mean, after I put myself together, my daughter runs down. And I'm like, hey; I'm here now.

SMITH: By Pentagon regulations, someone from the Marines should have met with Smith and given him a copy of the investigation almost 20 years ago.

SMITH: I have never been contacted on this at all, like, for none of it.

SMITH: You haven't heard anything official from the Marines.

SMITH: Nothing at all.

BOWMAN: And you learned about it from the podcast.

SMITH: Exactly.

BOWMAN: What is that - what do you think about that?

SMITH: I think it's - honestly, the only word I can say is disgusting. Like, you espouse the words honor, courage, commitment. And you want us to follow them. And we give our life to follow. But when the ball falls on you, it's all of a sudden not important.

BOWMAN: So why were John Smith and others never told the truth? Well, here's what we uncovered. One of the Marines involved in this deadly mistake, the officer who plotted this mortar mission was First Lieutenant Duncan Hunter Jr., son of Duncan Sr., then a California congressman and the powerful chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.

SMITH: Among those wounded that day in Fallujah were two U.S. Army soldiers. We met Joe Colabuno on the National Mall last summer. You can hear the cicadas. He remembers seeing the mortar round fall while he and his friend were having a smoke in the school courtyard where the Marines were holed up.

JOE COLABUNO: So he got blasted forward. I got blasted against - there was a little wall.

(SOUNDBITE OF CICADAS BUZZING)

COLABUNO: You know, and Shihab was standing in the absolute worst possible way that you could be standing, and something explodes next to you.

SMITH: Shihab was their interpreter, an Iraqi who took the job to help support his young brothers and sisters back in Baghdad.

COLABUNO: Shihab was just like this, staring up at the stars.

BOWMAN: Joe Colabuno and his friend John Nelson were both badly wounded, could have been medically retired. But they fought to stay in. Both are still on active duty and hold the rank of sergeant major. The Marines have never told them the truth about their wounds and the death of their friend, Shihab.

SMITH: Colabuno always assumed the explosion that day in April 2004 was caused by the enemy until we told him what really happened. He's never talked much about that day.

COLABUNO: I don't carry it like a weight. I carry it somewhere, I guess. But - and war sucks. War is hell, right? I mean, we know that. We know this. But it's so stupid to - why would you cover it up? But...

SMITH: He points to the Capitol building looming at the end of the Mall.

COLABUNO: As long as these guys understand it - and the further away we get from war, the less they understand the the cost of war going forward, right? I mean, it needs to be an incredible tax on the nation to go to war. It should be because we need to think real [expletive] hard before we do that.

BOWMAN: Which gets us back to why Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona tells us he's looking into this case. He says beyond these men and the families getting the truth, it's important for the military to learn from their mistakes.

KELLY: To prevent future ones and to figure out why it happened. And then you need to put in some, you know, processes and procedures to make sure that stuff like that does not happen again.

BOWMAN: We also wrote to the Army Chief of Staff, General Randy George, who had his lawyers reach out to the Marines, referring the questions on to them.

SMITH: Meanwhile, the Marines who fought in Fallujah 20 years ago are planning a reunion in California in February. They've invited Colabuno and the other soldier, too - men who they never got to know at the time but who share the same tragedy. They hope by then they'll get some answers from the Marine Corps. I'm Graham Smith.

BOWMAN: And I'm Tom Bowman, NPR News.

CHANG: Tom and Graham are the hosts of NPR's investigative podcast Taking Cover.

167,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,"Zach Condon describes the dark, cold Norwegian island behind Beirut's new album",https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-21/zach-condon-describes-the-dark-cold-norwegian-island-behind-beiruts-new-album,"ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Zach Condon, the creative force behind the band Beirut, toured hard in 2019 until his body said stop in the one way he couldn't ignore.

ZACH CONDON: Because it tried getting me sick. It tried getting me exhausted. And I think once it found the voice and it kind of pulled the plug on that, it realized that it could shut everything down.

SHAPIRO: A persistent case of laryngitis forced him to cancel a bunch of shows and take a break. So Zach Condon told me he went looking for a place to regroup. He wanted somewhere icy and dark.

CONDON: Because for some reason, that speaks to me, and that kind of gives me a sense of protection and shelter. And so I kind of went looking for the most extreme version of that in northern Norway.

SHAPIRO: Tonight is the winter solstice - the longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. So let's lean into that and travel with Zach Condon to a dark, cold Norwegian island called Hadsel, which is also the name of Beirut's latest album. In a cabin on Hadsel, he found a pump organ.

(SOUNDBITE OF BEIRUT SONG, ""HADSEL"")

CONDON: So the pump organ is the more piano-sized, for-your-own-home - you actually - it's funny. When you're playing it, it's like riding a bicycle because you're pumping air into the bellows with your feet.

SHAPIRO: Usually when people say it's like riding a bicycle, they mean you never forget how to do it. You mean you're actually pedaling your feet like a bicycle.

CONDON: Yeah. Yeah. You're literally pedaling your feet like a bicycle, yeah. And it - also, it gives you some kind of room for expression and other such things that you wouldn't have on a church organ, for example.

SHAPIRO: There's almost, like, an accordion-ish (ph) sound to it.

CONDON: Yeah. That's the closest other instrument to it. It's the same kind of reeds. It's just a different system of kind of bellows and air, I guess.

SHAPIRO: And so how much of you is thinking, oh, I've got the place to create my next album and make new music, as opposed to I just need to lick my wounds and recover and be away from people for a little while?

CONDON: Well, actually, originally it was more the latter. I mean, that was my entire purpose. But, yeah, once I saw the pictures of the pump organ and I found out that it was in tune and it worked, I kind of went into autopilot. Like, I wasn't really thinking anymore. I was just reacting. And I was packing five suitcases full of equipment and making these plans as if it was a studio visit.

(SOUNDBITE OF BEIRUT'S ""MELBU"")

SHAPIRO: We hear the pump organ throughout the album, but there's one instrumental track that I think is just that instrument on its own called ""Melbu.""

CONDON: Yeah. It's - it was a very meditative track, and it was a very meditative night. I actually was writing that at Agvar's (ph) house. Agvar is the guy who let me play the church organ and collects and repairs pump organs from around northern Norway, actually.

SHAPIRO: You say it was a special night, but it was all night. You were there in the Arctic winter.

CONDON: Polar night. Yeah.

SHAPIRO: I mean, it was one monthlong night - right? - or multi-month.

CONDON: Yeah. I was there for two months. The first month was mostly darkness. And I think my parents thought I might go there and lose my mind.

SHAPIRO: Did you?

CONDON: Yes and no. Yes and no.

SHAPIRO: Go on.

CONDON: I gravitate towards the night. I always have. Actually, since I was about 11 years old, I've suffered from really bad insomnia. It was like a switch went off in my head, and I could no longer sleep during the night. I could only sleep during the day for some reason. So, like, as soon as the sun would rise, I would rest. And I started to get this kind of backwards feeling of, like, the night is when it's peace and solitude and focus, and the daytime is when all the noise and activity and stress is. And so when I was looking for a place to escape, that was very purposeful on my part, to find somewhere that was literally nighttime the whole time so that I could just focus.

SHAPIRO: This is a real part of you now. It's not just a place you did a thing once.

CONDON: Well, I actually bought a cabin up there 'cause I loved it...

SHAPIRO: Wait.

CONDON: ...So much.

SHAPIRO: Really?

CONDON: Yeah. Yeah. I really appreciated it there. You know, I didn't expect to be making so many friends up there. That was not - I really thought I would be super isolated. But I ended up getting really involved with the local kind of village that I was part of there.

SHAPIRO: You describe the persistent laryngitis that, in part, led you to this remote island. And there are places on the album where it sounds to me like having lost and regained your voice, you're now relishing what it can do in a different way, like, taking more pleasure in some of the melodies and harmonies it can make.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ARCTIC FOREST"")

BEIRUT: (Vocalizing).

SHAPIRO: Do you think of your voice differently now?

CONDON: You know, on this record, I really allowed myself a lot of vocal freedom, because I was trying to enjoy it and really savor the moment, you know? 'Cause who knows? I still have kind of indigestion issues, and they can lead to, you know, voice degradation over time, for example. So I'm really trying to kind of take out the limitations. And so with the voice, I was very improvisatory, very just allowing whatever happened to happen. Almost every take on the record is first or second or third try...

SHAPIRO: Really?

CONDON: ...Like, somewhere in the very first few - yeah. Yeah. Because you get this kind of magical, deeper emotion out of it. And as cliche as that sounds, it's like, as soon as you start retreading the same territory and trying to get it, quote-unquote, ""correct,"" you end up losing the magic, you know? So I made sure not to allow myself to critique myself out of first takes on this record.

SHAPIRO: One place I hear what you're describing is the track ""Arctic Forest.""

CONDON: Yeah. Exactly.

SHAPIRO: Is that an apt example?

CONDON: (Laughter) It's very apt because I hadn't even finished writing the story I was going to put into it before I started singing. And then what happened is when I went, and I went back to rewrite and correct the kind of improvisation I had done, I realized I could never do it as well again. And so there is actual gibberish in there, and I had to just allow myself to be OK with it.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ARCTIC FOREST"")

BEIRUT: (Vocalizing).

SHAPIRO: So you're planning your first live concerts in years for early 2024. How are you feeling about it?

CONDON: If I'm being honest, I'm terrified. I'm - you know, I'm already losing a little sleep over it. But I wanted to celebrate the record in a lot of ways. It's not so much that I ever hated performance. I'm not a performer naturally. It's - I'm much more of the tinkerer. Like, I'm in the bedroom kind of tinkering on songs all night, and that's my natural place. But there's something beautiful about live music, especially when you have a lot of acoustic instruments on stage. And I just really wanted to be able to do that at least once with this music. So I told myself, I won't go on tour, but I'm going to try this. I'm going to try to get on stage once again and kind of fight through the stress and the struggle and see how this turns out. And maybe it's something I can do off and on from now on.

SHAPIRO: Do you feel like you now have a different relationship with your body than you did before the great rebellion of 2019?

CONDON: (Laughter) You know, you hear this a lot from people who have kind of suffered traumas and such things. It's not so much that you get past it or through it or anything, so much as you get better at carrying it with you. And I'm reaching that point where these issues that I have, I'm starting to be able to sit with them rather than run from them all the time. And I'm hoping that's the solution, because that might be the best I get, you know?

SHAPIRO: And now that you've got a cabin in remote Norway, you could always retreat to Hadsel again if you need to.

CONDON: That's my immediate plan after the February shows...

SHAPIRO: Really?

CONDON: ...So I can catch the really snowy month, which is March, which is my favorite.

SHAPIRO: Zach Condon performs as Beirut and his new album is ""Hadsel."" Thank you so much.

CONDON: Cheers. Thank you.

Fueled by the success of its Pulse line, the GRTC Transit System is on track to add four 60-foot-long articulated buses that run on compressed natural gas to its rapid-transit fleet by 2025.

The buses will be able to accommodate 120 seated and standing passengers. They’ll also have a third door, which GRTC says will help speed boarding and make overall trip times faster.

GRTC’s 40-foot Pulse buses can be crowded at peak times, according to GRTC communication specialist Henry Bendon. Bigger, larger-capacity buses will help create a “generally more pleasant peak commute experience,” he said in an email.

“The Pulse has been overwhelmingly successful, outpacing initial estimates by thousands of riders per day and bringing new people into the system,” Bendon says. “Projects like the Western Extension (which takes the Pulse out to Parham Road in Henrico County) and North/South Pulse (which will run from Azalea Avenue in north Richmond toward Chesterfield Towne Center) have already shown the demand for rapid transit is high and the enthusiasm from riders is real — and these larger buses are being brought in to help deal with that enthusiasm.”

To accommodate the larger buses, construction at the Pulse’s 26 stations, which shouldn’t affect their operations, is set for this spring.

GRTC launched its rapid-transit Pulse line in 2018. The buses run from Rocketts Landing to the Willow Lawn shopping center. Through October of this year alone, there have been 1.45 million rides on the Pulse.

The articulated buses — which feature an accordion-like junction in the middle of the bus — will eventually replace the entire Pulse fleet. Current Pulse buses will then be cycled into regular transit service."

D.C. police detectives say someone drove in a Jeep Grand Cherokee, began firing, and drove away shortly before noon Thursday in the 1300 block of Half Street Southwest, near Nats Park.

Surveillance cameras captured the suspect's jeep – which police say was stolen in an armed carjacking on Kansas and Blair Streets in Northeast D.C. on Wednesday.

Crime scene investigators will comb through the charred jeep to see if they can get DNA or other evidence to help solve this mass shooting.

The armed robbery was reported just after midnight Thursday.

According to Montgomery County police, three masked suspects entered Shalla in the 8000 block of Sligo Avenue and demanded their belongings.

Two of the suspects had firearms, one of which was a long rifle. Police said the second suspect was carrying a shotgun, while the third was carrying a red bag. Police did not specify how many victims were involved, but they said all of the victims complied before the suspects headed towards Washington, D.C.

Mareg Antandh has lived in the neighborhood for several years and was just at the restaurant on Tuesday.

""I was shocked because this would be the last place I would expect this to happen, considering there is a police station in that building up the street. I was really, really shocked. I was surprised,"" Antandh told FOX 5 Thursday.

A few doors down the street on Sligo Avenue, beauty salon owner Mary Paulino said she first heard about the incident on social media. Paolino owns Wink’d, which specializes in services such as eyelash extensions and nails.

""You know, we’re like a family,"" Paolino said. ""All of the stores are kind of together. We all know each other, so it’s pretty scary, but this neighborhood, it’s not a bad neighborhood. I think at night, it gets kind of weird. At night, some of the businesses stay open really late. So, that attracts dangerous activities.""

Earlier this year, Montgomery County police launched a new plan with the goal of preventing violent crime.

Under the ""Late Night Safety Plan,"" businesses open between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. in high-crime areas are required to submit and develop safety plans. Those plans must be approved by the Montgomery County Police Department.

Antandh said while he remains hopeful a plan like this could be beneficial in the long term, he’s skeptical until he sees results.

""I would emphasize the fact that we need more police presence,"" he said. ""We need more police officers on the streets. People have to feel safe to come enjoy dinner at a neighborhood restaurant, in my opinion.""

Just days before Christmas last year, 62-year-old Charles Reynolds was found in a stairwell of the Wayne Avenue garage.

The Montgomery County Police Department still has no leads in the deadly shooting, so FOX 5 came back to the crime scene with a retired homicide detective to analyze the mysterious murder.

""At approximately 9 p.m., officers responded to the parking garage located at Wayne Avenue and Fenton Street and found, in the stairwell, an adult male, dead, with trauma to his body,"" said Montgomery County Police Officer Carlos Cortes on the night of the crime.

Reynolds, who went by Joe, was the man found shot dead in that stairwell.

He had just finished shopping for last-minute Christmas gifts and having dinner with his family when he decided to drop off the leftovers in his car with plans to rejoin them for ice cream.

""It was literally six minutes between when we left the restaurant and when she called 911,"" said Reynolds’ wife, Karis Hastings, in a press conference months after the murder.

In those six minutes, Joe went from celebrating with his loved ones to being shot and killed. His sister-in-law was the one to find him and call for help.

""So then, instead of getting ready for Christmas we were talking to the police and calling funeral homes,"" his wife said.

According to the Montgomery County Police Department, no property was stolen from Reynolds.

There were also no cameras in the stairwell or the parking deck.

Despite sifting through hours of nearby surveillance, police say they have no leads.

""We’re really at our wits’ end in this particular incident because it is- it doesn’t make sense to us,"" said MCPD Chief Marcus Jones.

Related article

FOX 5 contributor and retired homicide detective Randy Kucsan recently analyzed the unsolved case.

""You can see this is fairly well-lit. You know they would look for nooks and crannies where perhaps it’s darker or no cameras,"" said Kucsan. ""But you can see right here it’s very well-lit, and it’s a short distance from the vehicle to the stairwell. So again, he might’ve been accosted at his car, or perhaps he just starts going back down the stairwell, and the person or the assailant or assailants piggyback through that door after him. This happened quickly, impulsively and that’s probably why there’s no witnesses to it.""

""I believe Mr. Reynolds was targeted because he was alone, and it could’ve been anyone, but they chose someone that was alone and vulnerable, and it was a crime of opportunity,"" Kucsan went on to say. ""There’s a $10,000 reward that remains in effect. I’m sure based on my training and experience, I’m sure somebody not necessarily saw the shooting because, again it was in a secluded stairwell, but they may have seen suspicious activity before or after the shooting.""

The police department told FOX 5 there is no danger to the community.

If you did see anything suspicious, detectives are asking you to contact them and you can leave an anonymous tip.

We’ll have more on this case with special coverage on FOX Local in the coming weeks."

The guilty pleas came seven months after Attorney General Anthony Brown first announced that a correctional officer and civilians had been indicted on charges that they assisted inmates in illegal activity at the Roxbury Correctional Institution in Hagerstown, Maryland.

""Safety is as important in our correctional institutions as it is to the public in our neighborhoods and communities,"" Brown said in a news release this week. ""This meticulous investigation and subsequent convictions send a clear message that we will not tolerate crime or corruption within our correctional facilities that disrupts the goals of rehabilitation.""

An investigation began in April 2022, after authorities recovered drugs and other contraband that had been smuggled into the prison after an inmate returned to the facility from a hospital visit.

The AG’s investigative team ""uncovered a complex web of conspiracies operating to smuggle drugs and other contraband into RCI by way of an employee, drones, and outside civilians who were recruited over social media,"" according to the news release.

Last month, Brown announced additional charges against one of the RCI inmates, Jose Miguel Tapia. Tapia created a fake court commitment document and impersonated a representative from a state’s attorney’s office in an attempt to secure his unlawful early release from prison, the attorney general said.

The forged document, imprinted with the seal of the clerk of the circuit court, purported to award Tapia 449 days of credit for time served against his sentence in an effort to get him an early release, Brown said.

From his prison cell, Tapia electronically faxed the fake order to the clerk of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and, assuming the identity of a representative from the state’s attorney’s office, called the clerk’s office to request that it be processed, according to the news release.

The clerk’s office recognized that the commitment was forged, the attorney general’s office said. Tapia was sentenced to 14 additional years.

Even so, Prince George’s and Montgomery County came in second for where most Marylanders are buying their cannabis.

These new statistics come as no surprise to the inventory manager here at Columbia Care, a cannabis dispensary here in Bethesda. The inventory manager says business has more than doubled, even quadrupled since recreational marijuana use is now legal in Maryland.

Central Maryland is reportedly the hotspot for the most cannabis sales in the state — that includes Anne Arundel, Harford and Baltimore counties. Plus Carroll, Howard and Queen Anne’s counties.

Turns out cannabis sales are generating millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state. The comptroller of Maryland’s office releasing its quarterly report indicating more than 12-million dollars in cannabis tax had been collected between July and September 2023.

The state’s comptroller says 35% is going to the community reinvestment and repair fund, 5% to counties across the state, 5% to the cannabis public health fund, 5% to the cannabis business assistance fund and the remaining balance to the state’s general fund."

""Secretary Schiraldi is a reformer and has a history of being a reformer,"" said Governor Moore on WBAL-AM this week.

Schiraldi has long endorsed the elimination of youth prisons and the reduction of community corrections.

At a community meeting in South Baltimore this week, Schiraldi told the crowd that juvenile crime is on the downturn, however, not everyone seemed convinced.

""There's a breakdown somewhere within DJS,"" shouted one resident.

Kinji Scott, who once chaired Maryland's juvenile justice coalition, isn't convinced Schiraldi is capable of reforming a habitually broken juvenile system.

""He has no track record of reforming anything,"" said Scott.

""We should be at the point now that we are transforming the penal system into a treatment-driven system and we're not there. This is not the guy for the job,"" insists Scott.

It has some residents scratching their heads over how it could have happened and at taxpayers' expense.

Justin Beitzel, who lives in North Baltimore, showed us his calendar Thursday.

It's a flawed calendar, one riddled with errors including a mistake made on the October page.''

""They missed the 22nd,"" said Beitzel.

The city erased October 22, going from October 21, skipping to the 23rd.

But in November, the city added a day--November 31st. That month only has 30 days.

""That's really unfortunate, somebody's kicking themselves for that one,"" said Beitzel.



Thousands of calendars were recently mailed to city taxpayers, including Pat Fisher and Eric Landers who live in the Medfield neighborhood.

""It's a waste of money, it went into the trashcan. The errors..did someone not go over them before they mailed them out? I mean, how incompetent,"" said Fisher.

""What are (they) doing with our money? We're paying this money as taxpayers, the citizens that live in the city. We want it to be put to good use. But also, people make mistakes and errors happen and that's, that's what happens in life,"" said Landers.



Fox45 News reached out to DPW and was told by a spokesperson to email our questions.

We did, asking: How much money was spent on these calendars, including mail cost? When did DPW become aware of the errors--were the mistakes caught, but mailed out anyway?

A DPW spokesperson responded but without answering any of our questions.



Instead, releasing a statement that reads in part: ""DPW deeply regrets the recent editorial mistakes that occurred in the annual calendar....in light of this, we have initiated a thorough review of our editorial processes.""

Still, more reaction in Medfield.

""Have you ever heard of a calendar that didn't have the actual dates correct? So, it may be a, what do you call it, save it for later...maybe a valuable item someday,"" said Jim Rapp."

Baltimore's Office of the Inspector General cites a human error as the reason for the officer not receiving the compensation.

Specifically, IG Isabel Mercedes Cumming told FOX45 News a new payroll check never logged the former officer's accrued vacation hours when they switched Departments.

ALSO READ |

The former officer, who served for over 32 years and retired in November 2019, initially filed a complaint to the Baltimore's Office of the Inspector General back in October.

The officer was told that they would have approximately 114 days of accrued vacation leave paid out to them, but between November 2019 and October 2023, the officer never received the money.

According to a report from the Inspector General, the officer tried to correct the matter with the BPD's Human Resources office and a Fraternal Order of Police union representative, but the officer's efforts were unsuccessful.

The officer then contacted the Inspector General for assistance, and the IG referred the officer's allegation to the police department and Baltimore City's Department of Finance for review. The Inspector General's report says that the OIG maintained consistent communication with the BPD and the DOF between November 16, 2023, and December 13, 2023, and both responded to the OIG's referral of the officer's missing payout.

ALSO READ |

After reviewing records, the Police Department told the Inspector General's office that upon the officer's retirement date in November 2019, the police department never initiated a leave payout request for the officer's vacation leave balance. The finance department confirmed the finding by reviewing its records.

The DOF reviewed all payments made to the officer between the retirement date in November 2019 and December 2023 and found that while the officer received some accrued leave balance payouts, the officer never received any payments for their vacation leave balance. The report says that, according to DOF records, the officer was owed compensation for 111.98 days of vacation leave, which totaled $40,822.34.

On December 14, 2023, Inspector General Isabel Cumming and Assistant Inspector General Richard Mitchell contacted the officer to provide an update on the original complaint. A follow-up was sent on December 20, 2023, letting the officer know that on December 15, 2023, Baltimore City issued a check to the officer."

185,[Maryland] https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local,Two Baltimore City Council members currently ineligible for reelection over campaign fines,https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/two-baltimore-city-council-members-currently-ineligible-for-reelection-over-campaign-fines-nick-mosby-antonio-glover,"With less than five months left before Baltimore City voters head to the polls, state records show two Baltimore City Council members are currently disqualified to file for reelection.

According to the online campaign finance database operated by the Maryland State Board of Elections (SBE), Council President Nick Mosby and Councilman Antonio Glover have several open violations and referrals to the Office of the State Prosecutor (OSP).

Mosby’s campaign has 10 active violations, with four referred to the OSP for further enforcement, SBE’s campaign finance records show.



RELATED |

With slightly fewer fines and violations, state records show Glover’s campaign boasts seven open violations with four active referrals to the OSP.

SBE Director of Candidacy and Campaign Finance Allen Norfleet explained the elected leaders’ current eligibility status to FOX45 News.

Mosby has outstanding fines of $8,355 and Glover $7,000,” Maryland State Board of Elections Director of Candidacy and Campaign Finance Allen Norfleet explained to FOX45 News. “They will need to pay these fines before they can be a candidate for reelection.”

Both Mosby and Glover have extensive histories with campaign disclosure violations compared to their colleagues.

Though some past fines have been waived, Mosby and Glover have amassed a history of $15,860 and $21,385 in respective fines since registering their campaign organizations with the state.

Both city officials also trail their colleagues in available campaign cash, state election records show.



While Mosby’s latest campaign disclosure has an outstanding amendment due from a routine audit, his January 2023 filing reported only $954 in its account.

In a written statement to FOX45 News, Mosby dismissed the violations and stated he has been more focused on governing.

My focus has not been on campaigning, but rather, advancing our city out of very challenging times. I had a very successful campaign fundraising launch last week, and my campaign is fully committed to working with the SBE to clear our the outstanding amendments and penalties,” Baltimore City Council President Nick Mosby wrote to FOX45 News.

In March, Mosby an eight-month battle with the Baltimore City Ethics Board over two ethics violations related to a legal defense fund.



The fund was in his name as well as the name of his now-ex-wife, former State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby. Amid the unrelated legal defense fund battle, the city’s ethics board asked a judge to penalize Mosby $1,000 daily until he complied with their demands.

The nearly $200,000 in fines Mosby racked up were never imposed, with the board later saying they were “confident that Council President Mosby [had] complied with the Board’s Administrative Order.”

Glover’s last filed campaign disclosure in November 2022 showed $3,095 in available cash. The councilman is 11 months past due in filing his last required campaign disclosure, SBE records show.



In response to questions submitted to Antonio Glover by FOX45 News, he suggested he is working with SBE to resolve his campaign’s violations and that this matter should not concern Baltimore residents.

Baltimore residents should not be concerned about the status of my campaign committee,” Baltimore City Councilman Antonio Glover explained to FOX45 News in an email.

Glover confirmed that, despite his current eligibility, he plans on seeking reelection.

Not all Baltimore City Council members have allowed their campaign finance violations to escalate.



Despite previously receiving four late campaign disclosure violations, Councilman Eric Costello successfully lobbied the SBE to waive all prior $3,080 fees and violations from his record, according to state records.

As of his last filed disclosure, Costello leads the City Council with over $435,000 in available campaign cash.

Out of the 15-member Baltimore City Council, only Councilman Mark Conway has a flawless campaign reporting record.

The Maryland State Board of Elections website states the next campaign finance reports are due on January 17. These public disclosures will include all campaign contributions and expenditures for 2023.

According to the SBE’s 2024 election calendar, eligible candidates must file by 9:00 p.m. on February 9 to appear on the primary election ballot.
